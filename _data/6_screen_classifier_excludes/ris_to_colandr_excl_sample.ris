TI  - Telemedicine (Virtual Clinic) Effectively Delivers The Required Healthcare Service For Pediatric Ambulatory Surgical Patients During The Current Era Of Covid-19 Pandemic: A Mixed Descriptive Study
AB  - Background: Children often suffer from congenital or acquired diseases. Ambulatory cases represent the vast majority of pediatric surgical cases. COVID-19 pandemic-associated regulatory precautions had made the process of seeking medical advice at a suitable appointment such a big problem. We utilized telemedicine (online encounter) to deliver the required healthcare service for sorting and guiding pediatric ambulatory surgical patients. In this article, we aimed to: (1) present our experience, (2) evaluate the effectiveness, and (3) document the results of this technology to solve the problem of difficult healthcare accessibility. Materials and methods: In this study, we compared the utilization of telemedicine (virtual clinic via video consultation) prospectively in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic in the period from June 2020 to July 2021 to the in-person clinic encounter at the outpatient department (OPD) retrospectively in the previous year (from June 2019 until the end of May 2020) for perioperative management of pediatric ambulatory surgical patients. The study was conducted at 3 tertiary care pediatric surgery centers. The information recorded for analysis included: demographic data, surgical condition distribution, time interval from the appointment request till the actual encounter with the surgeon, conversation duration, distance traveled, and ultimate fate of the consultations. For both groups, service was evaluated after the first follow-up visit by a patient survey questionnaire (Patient Experience Assessment form) including questions relevant to each encounter. Results: A total of 1124 pediatric patients with various ambulatory surgical conditions had been scheduled for virtual clinic video encounters. Of them, 1056 cases were evaluated by video consultation, supervised by their parents or caregivers, thus, achieving an attendance rate of 94%. Of the remaining cases, 2% (n = 23) were canceled and 4% (n = 45) did not attend the virtual clinic. Two-thirds of the cases live in rural /remote areas. Patients’ overall satisfaction was 92%. This was in comparison to 872 pediatric ambulatory surgical patients scheduled for in-person clinic visits before the implementation of the virtual clinic. Of them, only 340 cases had attended the clinic, thus, achieving an attendance rate of 39%. Of the remaining cases, 450 cases (51.6%) were canceled and 82 cases (9.4%) did not attend the clinic (no show). About 48% of the cases live in rural areas. For this group, patients’ overall satisfaction was 63%. The mean encounter duration was similar for both groups (∼ 5 min). Surgical condition distribution was also similar (p-value: 0.694). For new cases, the time interval from appointment request till the actual encounter was very short for the virtual clinic group (range: 6–15 days) as compared to the in-person clinic group (range: 30–180 days). Patients were followed up for a median period of 14 ± 3.25 months (range: 6–22 months) with no patient loss to follow-up. Conclusion: Telemedicine can effectively bridge the patient-physician communication gap caused by the regulatory precautions mandated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. It achieved an attendance rate of 94% and parents’ / patients’ overall satisfaction of 92%. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Response To Scientific And Societal Needs For Marine Biological Observations
AB  - Development of global ocean observing capacity for the biological EOVs is on the cusp of a step-change. Current capacity to automate data collection and processing and to integrate the resulting data streams with complementary data, openly available as FAIR data, is certain to dramatically increase the amount and quality of information and knowledge available to scientists and decision makers into the future. There is little doubt that scientists will continue to expand their understanding of what lives in the ocean, where it lives and how it is changing. However, whether this expanding information stream will inform policy and management or be incorporated into indicators for national reporting is more uncertain. Coordinated data collection including open sharing of data will help produce the consistent evidence-based messages that are valued by managers. The GODS Biology and Ecosystems Panel is working with other global initiatives to assist this coordination by defining and implementing Essential Ocean Variables. The biological EOVs have been defined, are being updated following community feedback, and their implementation is underway. In 2019, the coverage and precision of a global ocean observing system capable of addressing key questions for the next decade will be quantified, and its potential to support the goals of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development identified. Developing a global ocean observing system for biology and ecosystems requires parallel efforts in improving evidence-based monitoring of progress against international agreements and the open data, reporting and governance structures that would facilitate the uptake of improved information by decision makers.

TI  - Capability Of Lisem To Estimate Flood Hydrographs In A Watershed With Predominance Of Long-Duration Rainfall Events
AB  - Process-based hydrological models are of great importance to understand hydrological processes and support decision making. The LImburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) requires information on soil and land-use-related attributes to represent the transformation of rainfall into runoff for isolated rainfall events. This study aimed at evaluating LISEM for estimation of direct surface runoff (DSR) hydrographs in a watershed in Southern Brazil under the predominance of long-duration rainfall events, dominated by Argisols and with availability of a high-density rain gauge network. In addition, this study sought to: (i) suggest and evaluate a procedure for definition of initial soil moisture from antecedent 5-day rainfall depth; (ii) reduce the degree of subjectivity involved in the determination of some vegetation-related parameters by using remote sensing; and (iii) recommend a validation procedure. The saturated soil hydraulic conductivity and the Manning's surface roughness coefficient were calibrated considering 11 rainfall-runoff events, whereas the validation was performed for 4 events from the average calibrated parameters. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was used to assess both calibration and validation, resulting in average values of 0.64 and 0.58, respectively. It can be inferred from the results that the use of remote sensing to derive some LISEM parameters, along with the suggested schemes for definition of initial soil moisture and validation, was effective and provided sound results even for long-duration rainfall events. The results of this study and its methodological procedures can serve as a basis for other professionals who intend to use LISEM for both conducting detailed analyses of DSR hydrographs and supporting water resources management.

TI  - Estimation Of Hail Damage Using Crop Models And Remote Sensing
AB  - Insurance agents often provide crop hail damage estimates based on their personal experience and field samples, which are not always representative of the investigated field’s spatial variability. For these reasons, farmers and the insurance market ask for a reliable, objective, and less labor-intensive method to determine crop hail losses. Integrating remote sensing and crop modeling provides a unique opportunity for the crop insurance market for a reliable, objective, and less labor-intensive method to estimate hail damage. To this end, a study was conducted on eight distinct maize fields for a total of 90 hectares. Five fields were damaged by the hailstorm that occurred on 13 July 2019 and three were not damaged. Soil and plant samples were collected to characterize the experimental areas. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was deployed to determine the total aboveground biomass and obtainable yield at harvest, using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite images. Modeled hail damages (HDDSSAT1, coupling SEBAL estimates of obtainable yield and DSSAT-based potential yield; HDDSSAT2, coupling yield map at harvest and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)-based potential yield) were calculated and compared to the estimates of the insurance company (HDinsurance). SEBAL-based biomass and yield estimates agreed with in-season measurements (−4% and +0.5%, respectively). While some under and overestimations were observed, HDinsurance and HDDSSAT1 averaged similar values (−4.9% and +3.4%) compared to the reference approach (HDDSSAT2). © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Habitat Highs And Lows: Using Terrestrial And Uav Lidar For Modelling Avian Species Richness And Abundance In A Restored Woodland
AB  - Vegetation structure influences landscape use and habitat quality for many bird species. Owing to the difficulties associated with collecting structural data from traditional field measurements, numerous studies have investigated the utility of Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for providing landscape-scale structural information that may be useful for exploring animal-habitat associations. Notably, almost all of these studies have involved the use of LiDAR from airborne rather than terrestrial platforms. However, vegetation metrics that might be important for explaining bird species occurrence and diversity, such as understory vegetation complexity and overall vegetation volume, may be partially obscured from airborne sensors by tree canopy cover. These challenges might be overcome by terrestrial and UAV LiDAR sensors that can provide detailed information of understory forest strata. For the first time, we collected terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) and unoccupied aerial vehicle LiDAR (ULS) data in a woodland landscape to compare the ability of both sensors to identify relationships among vegetation structural metrics and bird species richness and abundance. Overall, TLS and ULS models provided similar results based on the sampling methodology we used for LiDAR data collection in an open woodland landscape. Canopy roughness, ground vegetation vertical complexity, total vegetation volume and canopy height derived from these sensors were among the most common significant variables in explaining avian diversity and individual species abundance. Individual species abundance models provided better prediction power (up to R2 = 0.82 (TLS) and R2 = 0.83 (ULS)) than bird community abundance by functional guilds (up to R2 = 0.40 (TLS), R2 = 0.41 (ULS)) and overall bird abundance (R2 = 0.10 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)), species richness (R2 = 0.14 (TLS), R2 = 0.14 (ULS)) and diversity (R2 = 0.17 (TLS), R2 = 0.16 (ULS)). Additionally, we found that several vulnerable bird species are strongly associated with LiDAR structural variables, which may assist with habitat assessment and conservation management.

TI  - Tropical Dry Forests Of Venezuela:: Characterization And Current Conservation Status
AB  - Tropical dry forests are located predominantly in the northern portion of Venezuela, above 6 degrees N. Although their potential extent covers ca 400,000 km(2) (44\% of the land), they currently occupy about 10 percent of this area. The diversity and complexity of Venezuelan dry forests increases from north to south along a gradient of decreasing severity of the dry season. A typical dry forest in Venezuela presents ca 110-170 species of plants front ca 40 to 50 families with in an area of approximately 10 ha. Species composition and forest structure, however, are dependent oil local landscape conditions (e.g., soil type, topography), and nearby forest types call be very different. Our analysis of five dry forest variants showed a maximum family similarity of 67 percent, although most values fell in the 50-60 percent interval. They are currently considered as one of venezuelas most threatened ecosystems, but only 5 percent of extant dry forests are included in protected areas; this represents 0.5 percent of their potential extent. It is fundamental to promote the creation of at least 3 or 4 more large protected areas (ca 5000 ha), with different climatic and orographic characteristics, in combination with the recovery of threatened species, the restoration of degraded systems, and the implementation of sustainable development projects. Their apparent high resilience suggests Chat with the proper management we call restore and maintain the integrity of Venezuelan dry forests.

TI  - Biomass Of The Cyanobacterium Lyngbya Wollei Alters Copper Algaecide Exposure And Risks To A Non-Target Organism
AB  - Nuisance algal infestations are increasing globally in distribution and frequency. Copper-based algaecides are routinely applied to control these infestations, though there is an ever-present concern of risks to non-target species. This research evaluated risks associated with a commonly applied chelated copper algaecide (Captain® XTR; SePRO Corporation) to a sentinel non-target species (Daphnia magna) and further assessed alteration of the exposure and toxicity when a nuisance mat-forming cyanobacterium, Lyngbya wollei, was present in exposures. Aqueous copper concentrations in treatments with algae significantly decreased within 1 h after treatment and averaged 57.5% of nominal amended Cu through the experiment duration. The 48 h LC50 values were 371 µg Cu/L with no algae present in exposures and increased significantly to 531 µg Cu/L when L. wollei was simultaneously exposed. This research provides information on the short-term fate of copper and hazard assessment by incorporating targeted binding ligands, as present in operational treatments. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Visual Soil Examination Techniques As Part Of A Soil Appraisal Framework For Farm Evaluation In Australia
AB  - Despite major advances in remote sensing and soil-landscape modelling, the use of visual soil examination and evaluation (VSEE) techniques in the field remains a crucial component of soil assessment and management packages for farmers in rural Australia. Of particular value are techniques for the rapid assessment of soil structural form and stability, which are fundamental issues affecting the ability of soil profiles to accept and store water in farming systems constrained by drought. An improved soil appraisal framework for farm evaluation, usable for all crops, derived from the successful VSEE-based 'Cotton SOILpak' system, is proposed. It has the potential to enhance the ability of farm businesses to deal with four soil-related issues; annual profitability, maximising land values, minimising the impact of increasing input costs, and negotiation of favourable outcomes for themselves and the local community when confronted by competing land uses. An overview is given of the proposed technical contents of the new scheme for 'whole-farm soil assessment and management planning', which is based on a blend of VSEE methods, modern soil databases, and extra laboratory testing where appropriate. Also outlined are the associated human resource requirements and organisational structures required to deliver practical and ethical soil management outcomes to farmers and the nation.

TI  - Integrating Cellular Automata With The Deep Belief Network For Simulating Urban Growth
AB  - Sustainable urban development is a focus of regional policy makers; therefore, how to measure and understand urban growth is an important research topic. This paper quantified the amount of urban growth on land use maps that were derived from multi-temporal Landsat images of Jiaxing City as a rapidly-growing city in Zhejiang Province from 2000-2015. Furthermore, a new approach coupled the heuristic bat algorithm (BA) and deep belief network (DBN) with the cellular automata (CA) model (DBN-CA), which was developed to simulate the urban expansion in 2015 and forecast the distribution of urban areas of Jiaxing City in 2024. The BA was proposed to obtain the best structure of the DBN, while the optimized DBN model considered the nonlinear spatial-temporal relationship of driving forces in urban expansion. Comparisons between the DBN-CA and the conventional artificial neural network-based CA (ANN-CA) model were also performed. This study demonstrates that the proposed model is more stable and accurate than the ANN-CA model, since the minimum and maximum values of the kappa coefficient of the DBN-CA were 77.109\% and 78.366\%, while the ANN-CA's values were 63.460\% and 76.151\% over the 200 experiments, respectively. Therefore, the DBN-CA model is a potentially effective new approach to survey land use change and urban expansion and allows sustainability research to study the health of urban growth trends.

TI  - Evaluation Of Water Quantity-Quality, Floodplain Landuse, And Land Surface Temperature (Lst) Of Turag River In Bangladesh: An Integrated Approach Of Geospatial, Field, And Laboratory Analyses
AB  - Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and development activities are posing numerous threats to the rivers of Bangladesh. In the recent decade, Turag River has been exposed to severe threats due to anthropogenic activities. The present research deals with the evaluation of water quantity-quality, landuse and landcover (LULC), and land surface temperature (LST) of Turag River and its floodplain by using an integrated approach of field study, laboratory analysis, and geospatial techniques. LULC mapping of the study area has been done using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images by unsupervised method, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index indices (NDWI) approach. From LULC classification, the study shows that the average reduction of water bodies from 1989 to 2019 is about 60-66\%, and the rate of reduction is about 14.25 ha per year. Due to anthropogenic activities and rapid urbanization, a large number of water bodies have been depleting. The average temperature of the river water from filed observed data is 30.23 degrees C and from image processed data is about 28.32 degrees C. The minimum and maximum values of pH, EC, TDS, and Eh are 6.87-8.44, 808-1192 mu s/cm, 406-739 ppm, - 31 to - 150 mV, respectively. The concentration ranges of cations (Na, Ca, Mg, K, Fe, and Mn) are 85.43-247.60, 28.59-39.47, 11.1-13.58, 5.21-13.261\_07-1.14\_006-.47 mg/l consecutively.The ranges of anions concentration (HCO3-,Cl-, SO42-, NO3-) are 165.45-388.87, 54.81-194.07, 52.49-289.63, 19.63-126.93 mg/l, respectively. It is evident that HCO3-, NO3-, and Mn exceed the standard limit of Bangladesh Water Quality Standard (BWQS) and World Health Organization (WHO), indicating that the water of the Turag River is deteriorating that is not safe for human consumption and aquaculture purposes. The study will assist to take some effective measures to control the pollution and uphold the water quality and natural riparian processes. So, the outputs of the study will contribute to the future urban landuse planning in the river floodplain area to mitigate ongoing alarming pollution and unplanned industrialization.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment Of Noise Mapping On The Main Street
AB  - Among the sounds constituting a part of our daily lives, the undesired and disturbing ones are named noise. The noises can be defined as the acoustic energy that affects the physiological and psychological welfare of humans due to its direct or indirect effects on the human health. But, the traffic noise, which is one of the disturbing noises having wide dispersion in urban areas, affects the health of a gradually increasing number of people. The number of studies on measurement, dispersion, and mapping of traffic noise in developed and developing countries is gradually increasing. It can be seen that the studies concentrate on mapping based on the city centers and neighborhoods, where the traffic is intense. In this article, unlike the regional noise measurement studies, the transversal cross sections were established with a certain interval according to the land status along the main street, and the noise measurement points were determined using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The daily mean noise levels (L-den) were calculated by performing the measurements at daytime, evening, and nighttime. Using ArcGIS 10.4 software, the accuracy of noise maps created via inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis function (RBF), and ordinary kriging (OK) geostatistical analysis interpolation methods and the dispersion effect of traffic noise were compared. According to the visual method and error corrections, it was found that the best noise map was obtained using the RBF method. It is believed that the map provides accurate and reliable results because of the flat land surface, higher noise values measured on the road region, decrease in the noise at the points farther from the road region, and soft transitions between the noise values depending on the distance from the road. In order to take measures in order to decrease or eliminate noise on the main street, the local administrators and decision-makers can make use of these maps, the accuracy of which has been confirmed.

TI  - Analysis On Pattern And Influence Factors Of Rural Settlements In Grain Main Production Area Of Songnen Plain
AB  - The purpose of this study was to reveal the pattern and influence factors of rural settlements in main grain producing area, which had great significance for rural residential land consolidation under the background of urbanization. Keshan County was taken as an example in this paper, rural settlements data were extracted from the Countryside Land Survey Database of the 2nd National Land Survey in 2009, which was used as basic information source, and field research and interviews were conducted towards local settlements. Meanwhile, socio-economic data came from the Statistical Yearbook of Keshan County and other statistics of corresponding departments. Multiple GIS (geographic information system) spatial analysis software was used. Specifically, natural breaks method was employed to divide the scale of rural settlements, and these settlements were finally classified into 4 kinds based on size, including micro, small, medium and large rural settlements. Kernel density estimation method was utilized to analyze the distribution density of rural settlements. Then, certain spatial methods, such as, Getis-ord General G and Getis-Ord Gi*, were used to explore the distribution pattern and size of rural settlements. The pattern of rural settlements was explored through analyzing the scale, density and clustering characteristics, and the effect of topography and agricultural productivity level and geographical conditions on the pattern of rural settlements was also investigated. Results were obtained as follows: 1) The numbers of micro, small and medium rural settlements were too many, accounting for 89.44% of the total number of rural settlements, whose area was 67.56% of the total; their public infrastructures were not matching and service facilities were lacking, and the roads connecting these rural settlements were highly dense, which not only wasted a lot of land resources but also divided cultivated land into small pieces and destroyed its integrity. In addition, the degree of mechanization of agriculture in main grain producing areas reached more than 85%, so this organization did not adapt to the development of agricultural productivity and the life of internal residents. 2) Kernel density peak value of rural settlements was 1.58 /km2, kernel density of rural settlements in grain main production area of Songnen Plain ranged from 0.14 to 2.30 /km2, the overall distribution density of rural settlements was relatively low, and the scale presented globally low clustering spatial distribution, being consistent with the characteristics of main grain producing areas. Rural settlements in Keshan Town, north of Shuanghe and Kubei Town, northeast Xianghua Town, and middle part of Beixing and Henan Town showed a characteristic of small clustering spatial distribution, while the partial regions in Xilian, Xihe, Fazhan, Xijian Town and Keshan Farm as well as the sporadic regions in Gucheng, Xianghua and Beilian Town presented a feature of high agglomeration spatial distribution. 3) Scale distribution characteristics of rural settlements presented a trend, namely "low altitude hilly area < low altitude alluvial plain area < low altitude diluvia mesa area". The rural settlements in plain area took on a small clustering spatial distribution characteristic, the rural settlements in hilly area had a spatial distribution characteristic of high density, small concentration and low density mass concentration, and the rural settlements in diluvia mesa area had a characteristic of big scale spatial distribution and clustering. 4) Topography was the formation basis of initial location of the rural residential areas. But with the transformation of social economy, the improvement of agricultural productivity had a more obvious effect on rural settlement pattern adjustment in major grain producing areas. In location factors, the influence of urban radiation on settlement pattern was limited to a certain range. Traffic significantly changed the local spatial pattern of residential areas, and had obvious distance attenuation effect. Therefore, t is study can provide a reference for the spatial layout optimization and regulation of rural settlements in these experimental areas. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - From Grapes To Getaways: Unraveling The Residential Tourism Impact On Land Use Change And Soil Erosion Processes In Menfi District
AB  - The Mediterranean basin has experienced widespread changes in land use and, along with this, changes in geomorphological and hydrological processes and erosion risks. The Menfi area (Italy) has been no exception, and residential tourism has played an unexplored role. Using satellite images in 2007 and 2022, the main changes in land use were determined comparatively, and the variation in soil erosion levels was calculated using the RUSLE equation. The contribution of residential tourism to these processes was also analyzed. The results show a substantial decrease in the area occupied by vineyards and a increase in the site devoted to residential tourism (second homes) with olive orchards. Erosion values have also decreased. The results allow us to conclude that the decrease in the area with vineyards results in a reduction in soil erosion. The main drivers of the change in land use are socioeconomic factors, including the aging of farmers, the shift of subsequent generations to alternative activities, and the overall decrease in agricultural income. In addition, the expansion of tourist infrastructure was accentuated in the new land with olive orchard groves in south-faced, medium-altitude, and lower slope areas, which together provide landscape value and contribute to the reduction of soil erosion.

TI  - Assessing The Changes In Land Use And Ecosystem Services In Changzhou Municipality, Peoples' Republic Of China, 1991-2006
AB  - Much of the world is experiencing fast urbanization. Many pen-urban open spaces, such as parks, forest, farmland, and wetlands, have been built over, which has resulted in a steep decline of ecosystem services at the municipal and regional levels. Using remote sensing, geography information system (GIS) technology and economic evaluation method for ecosystem services, the evolution of landscape spatial structure in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 of Changzhou City, People's Republic of China, was obtained and the change of ecosystem services resulted from land use change was evaluated. Study results show a continuing expansion of urbanized areas and reduction in ecosystem services. Before 2001, farmland was the main type of land use, accounting for more than 53.3\% of the total area within the broadly-drawn municipal boundaries. In 2006, farmland and built-up areas were the main land-use types. The built-up area increased by 122\% from 1991 to 2006. From 1991 to 2001, the proportion of ecological land (farmland, forests, grasslands, and water-covered areas) within Changzhou's municipal boundaries decreased 24.1\%. Based on the observed changes, the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Changzhou's ecological land decreased by 19.3\% from 1991 to 2006 and the annual decrease ratio was approximately 1.3\%. Conversion of farmland to other uses was responsible for the largest reduction in the value of ecosystem services, equal to 239.8 million RMB (equivalent to USD 37.8 million). Our research results were already adopted locally by Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Urban Planning and applied for Changzhou Mater Urban Planning. The current study can contribute not only to improvements in the Changzhou environment, but to the study of and improvements to other rapidly-urbanizing cities, as the rapid growth of urban areas is one of the most pronounced environmental trends of recent times.

TI  - Landscape Evolution And It's Impact Of Ecosystem Service Value Of The Wuhan City, China
AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization and enhanced ecological protection measures have greatly influenced landscape change, which has exacerbated regional landscape competition and conflicts and indirectly affected the supply of ecosystem services. Clarifying the relationship between ecosystem service change and landscape change is useful for understanding the impact of ecosystem conversion on socio-economic development and providing a knowledge base for relevant policy decisions. In this study, we used remote sensing technology to process Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imageries, combined with transformation analysis and kernel density analysis to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of land use change in Wuhan City from 1980 to 2020. We also estimated the ESV in the region using the improved unit area value equivalent method to reveal the trends of ESV changes in Wuhan. The results showed that land use changes in Wuhan during 1980-2020 occurred mainly in terms of decreases in farmland, forestland, and bare land, as well as increases in built-up land and water bodies. The built-up land was mainly concentrated in the main urban areas, but its area in each suburban area has increased in recent years. In contrast, farmland was mainly distributed in suburban areas, and its area has been decreasing in recent years due to the impact of urban expansion. However, the reduction is compensated for by the reclamation of ecological land such as grassland and forestland, which has aggravated the loss of ecosystem service values in the study area. In addition, human activities such as urban expansion have increased the demand for water resources, while also leading to ecological problems such as water scarcity and water quality degradation, which have caused serious losses to key ecosystem services in Wuhan city. Therefore, in order to alleviate the competition and conflicts in the landscape and mitigate the loss of ecosystem service values in this area, we have proposed some constructive suggestions for future urban planning and water quality improvements in Wuhan. The focus of these suggestions is on controlling the expansion of built-up land, as well as the conservation of ecological land and resource protection. Meanwhile, our findings can also provide reference information for land resource planning and ecological monitoring, and help researchers to understand the contribution of ecosystem service functions in relation to socio-economic development.

TI  - Outcome Of Different Radiotherapy Strategies After Breast Conserving Surgery In Patients With Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (Dcis)
AB  - Background: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery for DCIS lowers the relative local recurrence risk by half. To identify a low-risk group with the minimal benefit of RT could avoid side effects and spare costs. In this study, the outcome was compared for different RT-strategies using data from the randomized SweDCIS trial. Material and methods: Five strategies were compared in a Swedish setting: RT-to-none or all, RT to high-risk women defined by DCISionRT, modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9804 criteria, and Swedish Guidelines. Ten-year recurrence risks and cost including adjuvant RT and local recurrence treatment cost were calculated. Results: The mean age at recurrence was 64.4 years (36–90) and the mean cost for treating a recurrence was $21,104. In the SweDCIS cohort (n = 504), 59 women developed DCIS, and 31 invasive recurrence. Ten-year absolute local recurrence risk (invasive and DCIS) according to different strategies varied between 18.6% (12.5–23.6%) and 7.8% (5.0–12.6%) for RT-to-none or to-all, with an additional cost of $2614 US dollars per women and $24,201 per prevented recurrence for RT-to-all. The risk differences between other strategies were not statistically significant, but the larger proportion receiving RT, the fewer recurrences. DCISionRT spared 48% from RT with 8.1% less recurrences compared to RT-to-none, and a cost of $10,534 per prevented recurrence with additional cost depending on the price of the test. RTOG 9804 spared 39% from RT, with 9.7% less recurrences, $9525 per prevented recurrence and Swedish Guidelines spared 13% from RT, with 10.0% less recurrences, and $21,521 per prevented recurrence. Conclusion: It seems reasonable to omit RT in pre-specified low-risk groups with minimal effect on recurrence risk. Costs per prevented recurrence varied more than two-fold but which strategy that could be considered most cost-effective needs to be further evaluated, including the DCISionRT-test price. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Building The Vegetation Drought Response Index For Canada (Vegdri-Canada) To Monitor Agricultural Drought: First Results
AB  - Drought is a natural climatic phenomenon that occurs throughout the world and impacts many sectors of society. To help decision-makers reduce the impacts of drought, it is important to improve monitoring tools that provide relevant and timely information in support of drought mitigation decisions. Given that drought is a complex natural hazard that manifests in different forms, monitoring can be improved by integrating various types of information (e.g., remote sensing and climate) that is timely and region specific to identify where and when droughts are occurring. The Vegetation Drought Response Index for Canada (VegDRI-Canada) is a recently developed drought monitoring tool for Canada. VegDRI-Canada extends the initial VegDRI concept developed for the conterminous United States to a broader transnational coverage across North America. VegDRI-Canada models are similar to those developed for the United States, integrating satellite observations of vegetation status, climate data, and biophysical information on land use and land cover, soil characteristics, and other environmental factors. Collectively, these different types of data are integrated into the hybrid VegDRI-Canada to isolate the effects of drought on vegetation. Twenty-three weekly VegDRI-Canada models were built for the growing season (April-September) through the weekly analysis of these data using a regression tree-based data mining approach. A 15-year time series of VegDRI-Canada results (s to 2014) was produced using these models and the output was validated by randomly selecting 20\% of the historical data, as well as holdout year (15\% unseen data) across the growing season that the Pearson's correlation ranged from 0.6 to 0.77. A case study was also conducted to evaluate the VegDRI-Canada results over the prairie region of Canada for two drought years and one non-drought year for three weekly periods of the growing season (i.e., early-, mid-, and late season). The comparison of the VegDRI-Canada map with the Canadian Drought Monitor (CDM), an independent drought indicator, showed that the VegDRI-Canada maps depicted key spatial drought severity patterns during the two targeted drought years consistent with the CDM. In addition, VegDRI-Canada was compared with canola yields in the Prairie Provinces at the regional scale for a period from 2000 to 2014 to evaluate the indices' applicability for monitoring drought impacts on crop production. The result showed that VegDRI-Canada values had a relatively higher correlation (i.e., r>0.5) with canola yield for nonirrigated croplands in the Canadian Prairies region in areas where drought is typically a limiting factor on crop growth, but showed a negative relationship in the southeastern Prairie region, where water availability is less of a limiting factor and in some cases a hindrance to crop growth when waterlogging occurs. These initial results demonstrate VegDRI-Canada's utility for monitoring drought-related vegetation conditions, particularly in drought prone areas. In general, the results indicated that the VegDRI-Canada models showed sensitivity to known agricultural drought events in Canada over the 15-year period mainly for nonirrigated areas.

TI  - Land Degradation Assessment Using Geospatial Techniques
AB  - Land degradation is a thoughtful threat involved in reducing area and productivity of 13.4 billion ha in the global cultivable land. The genesis and distribution of different types of land degradation processes depend on climate, topography, vegetative cover, parent material (salty or acidic), and groundwater (saline, sodic, or heavy metals/metalloid). Above all, human-induced degradation of land has been exaggerated recently. These changes in land degradation can be monitored and assessed through geospatial techniques such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) with fine spatial and spectral resolution imageries. The advanced techniques such as microwave, hyperspectral, and proximal ground-based sensor data with multivariate statistical algorithms have increased the efficiency of classification and mapping of degraded lands. The values of different parameters extracted from thematic map of the terrain, surface, hydrology, and spectral ratio indices of multispectral, hyperspectral images are used as an input parameter for the generation of a digital soil map. The digital soil map with seasonal/temporal variation (possible with fine temporal resolution) conveys detailed information regarding the study of changes, characterization, causes, protection, and reclamation of the land degradation processes. The method of real-time monitoring and assessment of land degradation using RS/GIS techniques is costeffective, fast, and accurate and indicates land/resource management quickly to secure the food, water, and environmental security. This chapter summarizes the comprehensive understanding of the extent, type, cause of land degradation processes, and indicators of land degradation as well as assessment and monitoring of such through advanced remote sensing techniques. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.

TI  - Silvi-Net - A Dual-Cnn Approach For Combined Classification Of Tree Species And Standing Dead Trees From Remote Sensing Data
AB  - Forest managers and nature conservationists rely on precise mapping of single trees from remote sensing data for efficient estimation of forest attributes. In recent years, additional quantification of dead wood in particular has garnered interest. However, tree-level approaches utilizing segmented single trees are still limited in accuracy and their application is therefore mostly restricted to research studies. Furthermore, the combined classification of presegmented single trees with respect to tree species and health status is important for practical use but has been insufficiently investigated so far. Therefore, we introduce Silvi-Net, an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fusing airborne lidar data and multispectral (MS) images for 3D object classification. First, we segment single 3D trees from the lidar point cloud, render multiple silhouette-like side-view images, and enrich them with calibrated laser echo characteristics. Second, projected outlines of the segmented trees are used to crop and mask the MS orthomosaic and to generate MS image patches for each tree. Third, we independently train two ResNet-18 networks to learn meaningful features from both datasets. This optimization process is based on pretrained CNN weights and recursive retraining of model parameters. Finally, the extracted features are fused for a final classification step based on a standard multi-layer perceptron and majority voting. We analyzed the network?s performance on data captured in two study areas, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ) and the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP). For both study areas, the lidar point density was approximately 55 points/m(2) and the ground sampling distance values of the true orthophotos were 10 cm (ChEZ) and 20 cm (BFNP). In general, the trained models showed high generalization capacity on independent test data, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.1\% for the classification of pines, birches, alders, and dead trees (ChEZ) -and 91.5\% for coniferous, deciduous, snags, and dead trees (BFNP). Interestingly, lidar-based imagery increased the OA by 2.5\% (ChEZ) and 5.9\% (BFNP) compared to experiments only utilizing MS imagery. Moreover, Silvi-Net also demonstrated superior OA compared to the baseline method PointNet++ by 11.3\% (ChEZ) and 2.2\% (BFNP). Overall, the effectiveness of our approach was proven using 2D and 3D datasets from two natural forest areas (400-530 trees/ha), acquired with different sensor models, and varying geometric and spectral resolution. Using the technique of transfer learning, Silvi-Net facilitates fast model convergence, even for datasets with a reduced number of samples. Consequently, operators can generate reliable maps that are of major importance in applications such as automated inventory and monitoring projects.

TI  - Environmental Racism And Air Pollution: Pre And Post The Covid-19 Economic Shutdown
AB  - Decades of research demonstrates that minoritized groups are disproportionately affected by swathes of harmful pollutants, including air pollution, even controlling for low income. Would significantly reducing individual car traffic help reduce the EJ gap? The systemic shock of the COVID-19 economic shutdown, with accompanied reduction in car use, can be exploited to analyze this question. Kerr and colleagues ask this question for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), use satellite data and categorical differences, and find that majority-minoritized tracts on average benefited more from the shutdown, but the least-White tracts still were significantly worse off than the most-White tracts. We further explore this question for PM2.5, one of the most harmful air pollutants, using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to combine several different federal datasets to compare pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Analyzing Census tracts, we find (1) little evidence of discrimination in the placement of PM2.5 sensors, (2) evidence of the standard EJ disproportionality for PM2.5 in both pre-shutdown 2019 and post-shutdown 2020, but (3) evidence of disproportionate improvement for Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans, with concerning indications of possible harm to African Americans. This implies, as do the findings in Kerr and colleagues' study, that policies that limit gasoline-powered car use can reduce air pollution but are unlikely to importantly alleviate US environmental racism affecting African Americans. © 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Epidemic Risk Analysis After The Wenchuan Earthquake Using Remote Sensing
AB  - On 12 May 2008, Wenchuan Earthquake, magnitude 8.0, destroyed thousands of buildings, and resulted in thousands of people being buried in the collapsed buildings. In order to investigate the potential epidemic disease risk after earthquake, a Backward Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was constructed to assess the potential epidemic risks by applying remote sensing technology to obtain Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) values, as well as by using a geographic information system (GIS) to gain ambient epidemic-related spatial factors over the earthquake region. In this study, a relationship was established between the change in environmental factors after earthquake and potential epidemic risks, which was found to be statistically significant. The result might be explained for three change perspectives, namely environmental risks, medical risks and psychological risks. The corresponding strategies for preparedness in case of epidemic disease were given.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity Of The Relationship Between Pm2.5 Concentrations And The Surface Urban Heat Island Effect In Beijing, China
AB  - Air pollution and the urban heat island (UHI) effect are two serious problems in many cities and have become increasingly serious with accelerated urbanization. The relationship between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the UHI effect has become a research topic of major interest to help avoid the vicious cycle of the UHI effect and air pollution, but recent studies still focus on correlation analysis, lacking attention to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of their relationship. Combining remote sensing and in situ data, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the interaction between the UHI effect and PM2.5 in Beijing over four seasons by using a coupling coordination degree model, and the characteristics of spatiotemporal heterogeneity were analyzed from both biophysical and socioeconomic aspects. The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were selected as the indices from a biophysical perspective. Urban functional areas derived from points of interest (POIs) were used to represent the area's socioeconomic background. The results showed that the relationship between PM2.5 and the UHI effect has spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The areas exhibiting high degrees of coupling coordination were most widely distributed in spring, and the highest degree of coupling coordination appeared in summer. The four seasons of high coupling coordination areas occurred over four seasons, covering more than 58.3\% of Beijing's area, mainly concentrated in business-related functional areas. Areas where the positive interaction between the UHI effect and air pollution was weak tended to have a higher proportion of vegetation. The results of this work are of theoretical and management value for mitigating the threat of rapid urbanization to human health.

TI  - Effects Of Land Use And Land Cover Change On Ecosystem Services In The Koshi River Basin, Eastern Nepal
AB  - The provision of ecosystem services is directly related to the type of land use and land cover and management practices in a given area. Changes in land use and land cover can alter the supply of ecosystem services and affect the well-being of both humanity and nature. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations of land use and land cover and quantifies the change in three important ecosystem services (food production, carbon storage, and habitat quality) in the Koshi River Basin, Nepal during 1996-2016 by using freely available data and tools such as, Landsat satellite images and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. During the observed time period, there was an overall gain in urban areas (190 sq.km ), forests (773 sq.km ) and grassland (431 sq.km ); loss of cultivated land (220 sq.km ) and shrub lands (847 sq.km ), mostly occurring in the lowlands (<= 1000 m). As a result of the land cover changes, while food production and carbon storage showed a declining trend, overall habitat quality in the basin increased. There is a need to design novel and effective landscape approaches that address local realities and that will aid the maintenance of ecosystem services. We recommend landscape level planning to improve urban and agricultural sectors and focus on halting the loss of ecosystem services.

TI  - A Review On The Use Of Lidar Remote Sensing For Forest Landscape Restoration
AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is the process where vegetation is recovering in terms of its forest traits, ecosystem functionality, climate change mitigation, building up human livelihoods, and well-being in deforested and degraded forest landscapes by promoting accelerated forest regrowth. Several countries within the Global Partnership of FLR have made ambitious pledges to promote FLR globally and to restore at least 350 million ha of degraded and deforested lands by 2030 worldwide. FLR accountability has been limited to the schematic quantification of how much the land area in the forest has been restored and how many trees have been replanted for conservation purposes. Natural regeneration, old-growth forests, and mixed-species plantations of different types of species are some of the FLR strategies. Monitoring the outcome of complex forest restoration efforts requires appropriate methods and sophisticated tools. The logical procedures are by distinguishing the different forest cover types across different forest landscapes and second by identifying their respective values to ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Canopy structural attributes are one of the most important parameters that can act both, distinguishing the forest cover types and indicator to the forest respective values. Traditional assessments rely heavily on field-based inventory, which is cost-prohibitive and difficult to track a million hectares scale progress. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing has emerged as a great alternative to monitoring forest structure, function, and composition. With the ability to penetrate the forest canopy it allows an accurate measurement of structural canopy parameters along with the vertical profile. This paper will review the trends of FLR and the use of LiDAR remote sensing technology to monitor forest restoration outcomes towards achieving sustainable forest management practices. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

TI  - Using Multisource High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data (2 M) With A Habitat-Tide-Semantic Segmentation Approach For Mangrove Mapping
AB  - Mangrove wetlands are hotspots of global biodiversity and blue carbon reserves in coastal wetlands, with unique ecological functions and significant socioeconomic value. Annual fine-scale monitoring of mangroves is crucial for evaluating national conservation programs and implementing sustainable mangrove management strategies. However, annual fine-scale mapping of mangroves over large areas using remote sensing remains a challenge due to spectral similarities with coastal vegetation, tidal periodic fluctuations, and the need for consistent and dependable samples across different years. In previous research, there has been a lack of strategies that simultaneously consider spatial, temporal, and methodological aspects of mangrove extraction. Therefore, based on an approach that considers mangrove habitat, tides, and a semantic segmentation approach, we propose a method for fine-scale mangrove mapping suitable for long time-series data. This is an optimized hybrid model that integrates spatial, temporal, and methodological considerations. The model uses five sensors (GF-1, GF-2, GF-6, ZY-301, ZY-302) to combine deep learning U-Net models with mangrove habitat information and algorithms during low-tide periods. This method produces a mangrove map with a spatial resolution of 2 m. We applied this algorithm to three typical mangrove regions in the Beibu Gulf of Guangxi Province. The results showed the following: (1) The model scored above 0.9 in terms of its F1-score in all three study areas at the time of training, with an average accuracy of 92.54\% for mangrove extraction. (2) The average overall accuracy (OA) for the extraction of mangrove distribution in three typical areas in the Beibu Gulf was 93.29\%. When comparing the validation of different regions and years, the overall OA accuracy exceeded 89.84\% and the Kappa coefficient exceeded 0.74. (3) The model results are reliable for extracting sparse and slow-growing young mangroves and narrow mangrove belts along roadsides. In some areas where tidal flooding occurs, the existing dataset underestimates mangrove extraction to a certain extent. The fine-scale mangrove extraction method provides a foundation for the implementation of fine-scale management of mangrove ecosystems, support for species diversity conservation, blue carbon recovery, and sustainable development goals related to coastal development.

TI  - Mountain Farmers And Ecosystems: Changing Land Use And Livelihoods In Mount Rungwe, Tanzania
AB  - This paper analyses long-term and incremental land use changes that have taken place in Mount Rungwe ecosystem in Tanzania from 1973 to 2010 basing on information derived from satellite images, household socio-economic data, focus group discussions and interviews with key informants. While most literature on land use change reports negative effects, land use changes in Mount Rungwe ecosystem have positively benefited communities through more diversification and greater commercialisation. The paper demonstrates that rural communities' livelihoods are both a cause and a result of changes in the natural Mount Rungwe ecosystem. The changes in land use through cropping patterns and reforestation took advantage of opportunities from population increase, access to markets and agricultural resources management. Consequently, the changes have qualitatively improved communities' livelihoods and forest ecosystems. The paper broadens our understanding on the potential land use changes in mountain ecosystems for enhancing rural livelihoods and the environment in line with the Boserup's agricultural intensification theory.

TI  - Differential Impact Of Climate Change On The Hydropower Economics Of Two River Basins In High Mountain Asia
AB  - Water stored in the form of snow and glaciers in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region regulates the water supply, and resultant water-based economies, that support the livelihoods of millions of people. Trends in the seasonal and long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by initial ice reserves, meteorological factors and geographic features, vary across sub-basins in the HMA region. We examined the economic impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins, one each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an integrated assessment framework to estimate the changes in economic value of the hydropower generation from hydropower plants on rivers fed by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins. The framework, developed under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical models (a suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower model) with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river flow over historic and future time using the water balance model in sixteen scenarios (eight climate models and two emissions scenarios) for rivers upstream of hydropower plants in each sub-basin. Using the hydropower model we developed, we estimated the changes in hydropower generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity, located in Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a 19.6 MW capacity, in Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their baselines, the estimated impact of climate change and temporal variability were higher for the Naltar plant than for the Trishuli plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with water storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated impacts are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides an example of the differential impacts of climate change on hydropower plants located in rivers fed by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt at different decades in this century. This type of integrated assessment of climate change impact will support the scientific understanding of hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource management in a changing climate.

TI  - Evaluation Of The Honey-Card Technique For Detection Of Transmission Of Arboviruses In Florida And Comparison With Sentinel Chicken Seroconversion
AB  - Zoonotic mosquito-borne viruses, such as the West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), are major public health threats in the United States. Early detection of virus transmission and targeted vector management are critical to protect humans against these pathogens. Sentinel chickens and pool screening of mosquitoes, the most widely used methods of arbovirus early detection, have technical time-lags that compromise their early-detection value. The exploitation of sugar-feeding by trapped mosquitoes for arbovirus surveillance may represent a viable alternative to other methods. Here we compared effectiveness of sugar-impregnated nucleic-acid preserving substrates (SIPS) and sentinel chicken program for detecting WNV, EEEV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus in gravid traps, CO2-baited light traps, and resting traps at 10 locations in two Florida counties. In St. Johns County, comparable numbers of EEEV detections were made by SIPS traps (18) and sentinel chickens (22), but fewer WNV detections were made using SIPS (1) than sentinel chickens (13). In Volusia County, seven arbovirus detections were made via the sentinel chicken program (one EEEV and six WNV), whereas only one arbovirus detection (WNV) was made using SIPS. CO2-baited light traps captured > 90\% of total mosquitoes, yet yielded < 30\% of arbovirus detections. Resting traps and gravid traps captured a fraction of total mosquitoes, yet yielded roughly equivalent numbers of arbovirus detections, as did light traps. Challenges to successful deployment of SIPS include optimization of traps for collecting all vector species, increasing sugar-feeding rates of trapped vectors, and developing tractable methods for arbovirus detection.

TI  - Development Of Geomorphologic Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph For A Large Watershed
AB  - Hill torrents cause a lot of environmental and property damage in Pakistan every year. Proper assessment of direct runoff in the form of hill torrents is essential for protection of environment, property, and human life. In this paper, direct surface runoff hydrograph (DSRH) was derived for a large catchment using the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph concept. The catchment with hill torrent flows in semi-arid region of Pakistan was selected for this study. It was divided into series of linear cascades and hydrologic parameters required for Nash's conceptual model, and were estimated using geomorphology of the basin. Geomorphologic parameters were derived from satellite images of the basin and ERDAS and ArcGIS were used for data processing. Computer program was developed to systematically estimate the dynamic velocity, its related parameters by optimization and thereby to simulate the DSRH. The data regarding rainfall-runoff and satellite images were collected from Punjab Irrigation and Power Department, Pakistan. Model calibration and validation was made for 15 rainfall-runoff events. Ten events were used for calibration and five for validation. Model efficiency was found to be more than 90\% and root mean square error to be about 5\%. Impact of variation in model parameters (shape parameter and storage coefficient) on DSRH was investigated. For shape parameter, the number of linear cascades varied from 1 to 3 and it was found that the shaper parameter value of 3 produced the best DSRH. Various values of storage coefficient were used and it was observed that the value determined from geomorphology and the dynamic velocity produced the best results.

TI  - A Novel Framework For Turbidity Source Apportionment Of The Urban Lakeside River Network
AB  - Turbidity source apportionment is essential but complex for precise environmental rehabilitation of worldwide urban lakeside river networks impaired by turbidity. A new turbidity source analysis framework including in-situ sampling, vessel monitoring, remote sensing, and hydrodynamic modelling was proposed, where the critical processes of flow reversal from the turbid lake, navigation, and urban non-point source in urban lakeside river networks were explicitly considered. The case study results showed that the turbidity problem (mean value was 211.3 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)) was primarily led by suspended inorganic matter (58\%), followed by suspended organic matter (19\%) and other matter. The Tiaoxi River and busy shipping contributed most to the annual total suspended solids load of the target river, with the same percentage of 34\%. The turbid Lake Taihu provided 64,663 tonnes and 31\% of the total suspended solids load, focusing on the autumn and winter months. Tiaoxi River load was highly concentrated on the storm events, which accounted for 71.4\% of the annual Tiaoxi River source (209846 tonnes). The large water volume of reverse flow and the high TSS concentration of Lake Taihu in the autumn and winter months accounted for the seasonal change in Lake Taihu's TSS load. The coronavirus disease lockdown reduced the mean monthly total suspended solids concentration of 152.4 mg/L in November and December 2019 to 49.2 mg/L in January and February 2020, by limiting the waterway transportation and the market demand for building materials. The river estuary's vegetation interception belt, shipping restriction and rerouting, and integrated catchment management were advised to mitigate the urban river network turbidity.

TI  - Contributions Of Kansas Rangeland Burning To Ambient O3: Analysis Of Data From 2001 To 2016
AB  - Prescribed range/pasture burning is a common practice in Kansas to enhance the nutritional value of native grasses and control invading weeds, trees, and brush. A major concern associated with the burning is the contribution of smoke to elevated ground level ambient ozone (O3). The objective of this study is to estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient O3 mixing ratios through regression analysis (1) between observed O3 data and available satellite burn activity data from 2001 to 2016; and (2) between observed O3 data and the smoke contributions to PM2.5 which were resolved from receptor modeling. Positive correlations were observed between ambient O3 levels and the acres burned each year estimated from satellite imagery. When burned acres in April were larger than or equal to 1.9 million, O3 > 70 ppb occurred at least at one of the ten monitoring sites in Kansas. Statistical regression models of daily maximum 8-hour O3 mixing ratios were developed at each of the ten monitoring sites using meteorological predictors. The O3 model residuals that were not explained by the meteorological effect models were affected by PM2.5 contributors including sulfate/industrial sources and emissions that generated secondary organic particles, such as rangeland burning, which were derived from receptor modeling. The average O3 model residual on the high O3 days in April was 21 ± 9 ppb, which was likely associated with smoke emissions from burning. Research will continue to obtain daily satellite burn activity data and to correlate burn data with daily O3 data, so that modeling of O3 levels can be improved under influences of daily burn activities. Less frequency of high O3 days was observed in April since 2011, which may be partly due to implementation of the Flint Hills Smoke Management Plan which promoted better timing of burns. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Co-Evolution Of Climate-Vegetation-Hydrology And Its Mechanisms In The Source Region Of Yellow River
AB  - Vegetation recovery under global change and its consequent evolution of eco-hydrological processes have modulated the water resources conservative capacity in the source region of the Yellow River (YRSR). Based on climatological data, remotely sensed vegetation index and geographical information, the integrated simulations of water and carbon cycles in the YRSR are presented, with the vegetation interface processes (VIP) distributed eco-hydrological dynamic model. Then the co-evolving mechanisms of hydrological and vegetation dynamics are investigated. Results show that warming and wetting climate in the YRSR has improved the vegetation growing condition and extended the growing period for more than 10 days in recent decades. Averaged NDVI from 2010 to 2020 increased by 4.5% relative to that from 2000 to 2009. Vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) shows a significant uptrend with a rate of 4.57 gC m-2 a-1, 77% of which is contributed by climate change and elevated atmosphere CO2 fertilization, and the rest 23% is by vegetation greening. Evapotranspiration (ET) is increasing at a rate of 2.54 mm a-1 and vegetation water use efficiency (WUE, expressed as GPP/ET) is also improving at a relative rate of 5.1% a-1. Generally, annual ET, GPP and WUE and their trends are decreasing along the elevation below 4200 m. At basin scale, there are significant positive correlations between the vegetation greenness and the runoff coefficient with precipitation in the current and previous years, demonstrating a legacy effect of precipitation for vegetation recovery on water conservation capacity. The increased ET might be a benefit to the water recycle between land surface and atmosphere, which will alleviate the reduced potential of water yield owing to ecological restoration and establish trades-off and synergies among precipitation, vegetation and water yield. Conclusively, exploring the mechanisms of hydrological responses to climate change and vegetation recovery and its feedback will provide scientific support to the assessment of ecological engineering programs in the source regions. © 2022, Science Press.

TI  - Four Health Data Networks Illustrate The Potential For A Shared National Multipurpose Big-Data Network
AB  - Information in electronic health data that are drawn from large populations of patients is transforming health care, public health practice, and clinical research. This article describes our experience in developing data networks that repurpose electronic health records and administrative data. The four programs we feature are the Food and Drug Administration's Mini-Sentinel program (which focuses on medical product safety), the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet, comparative effectiveness research), the National Institutes of Health's Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory Distributed Research Network (biomedical research), and ESPnet (public health surveillance). Challenges to these uses of electronic health data include understanding the factors driving the collection, coding, and preservation of the data; the extensive customization of different systems that collect similar data; the fragmentation of the US health care delivery system and its records; and privacy and proprietary considerations. We view these four programs as examples of the first stage in the development of a shared national big-data resource that leverages the investments of many agencies and organizations for the benefit of multiple networks and users. © 2014 by Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation.

TI  - Applications Of Digital Imaging And Analysis In Seabird Monitoring And Research
AB  - Rapid advances in digital imaging technology offer efficient and cost-effective methods for measuring seabird abundance, breeding success, phenology, survival and diet. These methods can facilitate understanding of long-term population trends, and the design and implementation of successful conservation strategies. This paper reviews the suitability of satellites, manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and fixed-position, handheld and animal-borne cameras for recording digital photographs and videos used to measure seabird demographic and behavioural parameters. It considers the disturbance impacts, accuracy of results obtained, cost-effectiveness and scale of monitoring possible compared with ‘traditional’ fieldworker methods. Given the ease of collecting large amounts of imagery, image processing is an important step in realizing the potential of this technology. The effectiveness of manual, semi-automated and automated image processing is also reviewed. Satellites, manned aircraft and UAVs have most commonly been used for population counts. Spatial resolution is lowest in satellites, limiting monitoring to large species and those with obvious signs of presence, such as penguins. Conversely, UAVs have the highest spatial resolution, which has allowed fine-scale measurements of foraging behaviour. Time-lapse cameras are more cost-effective for collecting time-series data such as breeding success and phenology, as human visits are only required infrequently for maintenance. However, the colony of interest must be observable from a single vantage point. Handheld, animal-borne and motion-triggered cameras have fewer cost-effective uses but have provided information on seabird diet, foraging behaviour and nest predation. The last of these has been important for understanding the impact of invasive mammals on seabird breeding success. Advances in automated image analysis are increasing the suitability of digital photography and videography to facilitate and/or replace traditional seabird monitoring methods. Machine-learning algorithms, such as Pengbot, have allowed rapid identification of birds, although training requires thousands of pre-annotated photographs. Digital imaging has considerable potential in seabird monitoring, provided that appropriate choices are available for both image capture technology and image processing. These technologies offer opportunities to collect data in remote locations and increase the number of sites monitored. The potential to include such solutions in seabird monitoring and research will develop as the technology evolves, which will be of benefit given funding challenges in monitoring and conservation. © 2020 British Ornithologists' Union

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation Of Evapotranspiration And Efficiency Evaluation Of Water Consumption In Qaidam Basin
AB  - Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET), composed of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, is the main mode of water dissipation in the natural ecosystems. In general, ET returns about two thirds of the annually terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere on the global scale, and the ratio can reach as high as 80% in arid areas. As a result, accurate knowledge of ET is crucial to understand the water budget as well as its effect on ecosystems. This is particularly important for water resources management and eco⁃environmental protection in arid regions. Compared with ground⁃based ET measurements recorded by sparse flux towers, satellite remote sensing (RS) is a suitable tool to map regional ET patterns in a temporally and spatially consistent manner, yielding a series of RS⁃based ET models with varying mechanisms and degrees of complexity. Considering the sparse distribution of meteorological observations in the Northwest of China, we adopted the surface temperature⁃vegetation index (TVX) method in this study to estimate daily ET in Qaidam Basin from 2011 to 2019. Uniquely, the theoretical boundaries of the TVX feature space were determined pixel by pixel based on the surface energy balance principle, so ET could be mapped for regions with complex topography in a spatially consistent manner. Then a simple dual⁃source ET framework was used to partition evapotranspiration into soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T), and finally the water consumption efficiency of natural ecosystems was evaluated by further partitioning E into soil evaporation over bare land and soil evaporation beneath the canopy. All the above schemes were demonstrated with Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. Results show that the annual ET of Qaidam Basin from 2011 to 2019 decreased at first and then increased, with an average value of 188.75 mm. As for seasonal variations, ET from April to September accounted for 80% of the annual ET with the peak value arising in June or July. Influenced by the spatial patterns of precipitation, the ET presents an obviously decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and from the surrounding mountains to the interior of the basin. Local high ET values in the interior of the basin are mainly distributed around the rivers, lakes, and springs. The annual average E and T in the recent nine years is 171.06 mm and 14.26 mm, respectively. Although the seasonal variations of both E and T follow a trend similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values observed in summer, the peak of the latter appears one month later than that of the former. In terms of spatial distribution, soil evaporation shares patterns consistent with total ET, but plant transpiration is mainly observed in the southeast of the basin, showing a semi⁃ring structure. The annually total water consumption of terrestrial ecosystems in the basin is 43.094 billion m3 on average. The corresponding proportion of high⁃efficiency, medium⁃efficiency and low⁃efficiency water consumption is 6.55%, 52.57% and 40.88%, respectively. Due to the extremely low fractional vegetation cover of Qaidam Basin, the amount of water consumption with high⁃efficiency is much lower than the other two. However, when considered water consumed by bare land and dense canopy, the water consumed by dense canopy per unit area is 297.83 mm, which is much higher than that consumed by bare land. In conclusion, this study reveals the water consumption efficiency of ET in the whole Qaidam Basin in a temporally and spatially consistent manner, which provides important scientific support for ET⁃ based water resources management. © 2022 Science Press.

TI  - Estimating The Grassland Aboveground Biomass In The Three-River Headwater Region Of China Using Machine Learning And Bayesian Model Averaging
AB  - Spatially and temporally explicit information on the biomass in terrestrial ecosystems is essential to better understand the carbon cycle and achieve vegetation resource conservation. As a climate-sensitive critical ecological function area, accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal variation in the grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is important in the Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR) of China. In this study, based on field observation, remote sensing, meteorological and topographical data, we estimated the grassland AGB in the TRHR and analyzed its spatiotemporal change and response to climatic factors. Four machine learning (ML) models (random forest (RF), cubist, artificial neural network and support vector machine models) were constructed and compared for AGB simulation purposes. The AGB results estimated with the four ML models were then applied in integrated analysis via Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to obtain more accurate and stable estimates. Our results demonstrated that the RF model performed better among the four ML models (testing dataset: correlation coefficient (r) = 0.84; root mean squared error = 76.99 g m-2), and BMA improved grassland AGB prediction based on the multimodel results. The spatial distribution of the grassland AGB in the TRHR was heterogeneous, with higher values in the southeast and lower values in the northwest. The interannual variation in the grassland AGB in most areas of the TRHR exhibited nonsignificant increasing trends from 2000 to 2018, and the sensitivity of the AGB to the annual precipitation was obviously modulated by regional water conditions. This study provides a more precise method for grassland AGB estimation, and these findings are expected to enable improved assessments to obtain a greater grassland AGB understanding. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Vegetation Mapping Of A Tropical Freshwater Swamp In The Northern Territory, Australia: A Comparison Of Aerial Photography, Landsat Tm And Spot Satellite Imagery
AB  - The tropical wetland environments of northern Australia have ecological, social, cultural and economic values. Additionally, these areas are relatively pristine compared to the many other wetland environments in Australia, and around the world, that have been extensively altered by humans. However, as the remote northern coastline of Australia becomes more populated, environmental problems are beginning to emerge that highlight the need to manage the tropical wetland environments. Lack of information is currently considered to be a major factor restricting the effective management of many ecosystems and for the expansive wetlands of the Northern Territory, this is especially the case, as these areas are generally remote and inaccessible. Remote sensing is therefore an attractive technique for obtaining relevant information on variables such as land cover and vegetation status. In the current study, Landsat TM, SPOT (XS and PANT) and large-scale, true-colour aerial photography were evaluated for mapping the vegetation of a tropical freshwater swamp in Australia's Top End. Extensive ground truth data were obtained, using a helicopter survey method. Fourteen cover types were delineated from 1:15 000 air photos (enlarged to 1:5000 in an image processing system) using manual interpretation techniques, with 89\% accuracy. This level of detail could not be extracted from any of the satellite image data sets, with only three broad land-cover types identified with accuracy above 80\%. The Landsat TM and SPOT XS data provided similar results although superior accuracy was obtained from Landsat, where the additional spectral information appeared to compensate in part for the coarser spatial resolution. Two different classification algorithms produced similar results.

TI  - Sentinels Of Breach: Lexical Choice As A Measure Of Urgency In Social Media
AB  - Objective This paper identifies general properties of language style in social media to help identify areas of need in disasters. Background In the search for metrics of need in social media data, much of the existing literature ignores processes of language usage. Psychological concepts, such as narrative breach, Gricean maxims, and lexical marking in cognition, may assist the recovery of disaster-relevant metrics from altered patterns of word prevalence. Method We analyzed several hundred thousand location-specific microblogs from Twitter for Hurricane Sandy, Oklahoma tornadoes, and the Boston Marathon bombing along with a fantasy football control corpus, examining the relative frequency of words in 36 antonym pairs. We compared the ratio of words within these pairs to the corresponding ratios recovered from an online word norm database. Results Partial rank correlation values between observed antonym ratios demonstrate consistent patterns across disasters. For Hurricane Sandy data, 25 antonym pairs have moderate to large effect sizes for discrepancies between observed and normative ratios. Across disasters, 7 pairs are stable and meet effect size criteria. Sentiment analysis, supplementary word frequency counts with respect to disaster proximity, and examples support a "breach" account for the observed results. Conclusion Lexical choice between antonyms, only somewhat related to sentiment, suggests that social media capture wide-ranging breaches of normal functioning. Application Antonym selection contributes to screening tools based on language style for identifying relevant content and quantifying disruption using social media without the a priori specification of content keywords.

TI  - Evapotranspiration And Biomass Modelling In The Pontal Sul Irrigation Scheme
AB  - In order to make feasible the use of irrigated areas of the Pontal Sul Irrigation Scheme in Petrolina, State of Pernambuco, Brazil, modelling of real evapotranspiration (ET) and plant biomass production (BIO) at a large scale was performed with associated agro-meteorological data and the algorithm SAFER (Simple Algorithm For Evapotranspiration Retrieving) using MODIS images for the years 2010-2017. The year 2012 presented the highest ET average with 3.15 mm day(-1) in the rainy season, reaching a maximum of 6 mm day(-1). The lowest mean ET was recorded in the year 2013, with 0.08 mm day(-1) in the dry season, and the maximum recorded for the period was 3.40 mm day(-1) in the irrigated agricultural area. For BIO, the highest average was 104.82 kg ha(-1) day(-1), during the rainy season of 2012, reaching a maximum value of 252 kg ha(-1) day(-1). The lowest average was for the dry period of 2013, with a value of 0.93 kg ha(-1) day(-1), and a maximum of 112.51 kg ha(-1) day(-1) in the irrigated agricultural area. The higher ET results represent moisture in the root zone, provided by rainfall and/or irrigation, showing maximum values in the rainy season. The results obtained for BIO suffer greatly from perimeter water availability. The present study becomes very important to the management of water resources, as it provides an increase in water productivity for food production.

TI  - Forest Mapping By Geoinformatics For Landscape Fire Behaviour Modelling In Coastal Forests, Greece
AB  - This study aims at quantifying and mapping fire-related characteristics of forest structure through field inventories, statistics, remote sensing, and geographical information systems in the island of Lesvos, northeast Aegean Sea, Greece. Simulation of fire behaviour requires forest biomass inputs that describe surface fuel types/models along with canopy fuel properties, such as canopy cover, stand height, crown base height, and crown bulk density, to accurately predict surface and crown fire spread and spotting potential. Forest canopy characteristics and other vegetation attributes were sampled and derived in over 100 field plots, the majority of which were located in coastal pine forest stands. Regression models involving four dependent forest stand variables (stand height, canopy cover, crown base height, and crown bulk density) were developed using generalized additive models. The values of adjusted R2 were 0.72 for stand height, 0.68 for canopy cover, 0.51 for crown base height, and 0.33 for crown bulk density. These regression models were used to create forest fuel characteristics layers, which can be used as inputs to fire management applications and state-of-the-art landscape-scale fire behaviour models. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Toward Quantification Of The Impact Of 21st-Century Deforestation On The Extinction Risk Of Terrestrial Vertebrates
AB  - Conservation actions need to be prioritized, often taking into account species' extinction risk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List provides an accepted, objective framework for the assessment of extinction risk. Assessments based on data collected in the field are the best option, but the field data to base these on are often limited. Information collected through remote sensing can be used in place of field data to inform assessments. Forests are perhaps the best-studied land-cover type for use of remote-sensing data. Using an open-access 30-m resolution map of tree cover and its change between 2000 and 2012, we assessed the extent of forest cover and loss within the distributions of 11,186 forest-dependent amphibians, birds, and mammals worldwide. For 16 species, forest loss resulted in an elevated extinction risk under red-list criterion A, owing to inferred rapid population declines. This number increased to 23 when data-deficient species (i.e., those with insufficient information for evaluation) were included. Under red-list criterion B2, 484 species (855 when data-deficient species were included) were considered at elevated extinction risk, owing to restricted areas of occupancy resulting from little forest cover remaining within their ranges. The proportion of species of conservation concern would increase by 32.8\% for amphibians, 15.1\% for birds, and 24.7\% for mammals if our suggested uplistings are accepted. Central America, the Northern Andes, Madagascar, the Eastern Arc forests in Africa, and the islands of Southeast Asia are hotspots for these species. Our results illustrate the utility of satellite imagery for global extinction-risk assessment and measurement of progress toward international environmental agreement targets. Hacia la Cuantificacion del Impacto de la Deforestacion del Siglo XXI sobre el Riesgo de Extincion de los Vertebrados Terrestres Las acciones de conservacion necesitan ser priorizadas, considerando con frecuencia el riesgo de extincion de las especies. La Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza (UICN) proporciona un marco de trabajo objetivo y aceptado para la valoracion del riesgo de extincion. Las valoraciones basadas en los datos colectados en el campo son la mejor opcion, pero los datos de campo sobre los cuales basar las valoraciones con frecuencia son limitados. Los datos colectados por medio de la teledeteccion pueden usarse en lugar de los datos de campo para informar a las valoraciones. Los bosques tal vez sean el tipo de cubierta de suelo mejor estudiado para el uso de datos de teledeteccion. Con un mapa de acceso abierto y resolucion de 30-m de la cobertura de arboles y su cambio entre 2000 y 2012, valoramos la extension de la cobertura de bosque y la perdida dentro de las distribuciones de 11, 186 especies de anfibios, aves y mamiferos dependientes del bosque a nivel mundial. Para 16 especies, la perdida del bosque resulto en un riesgo de extincion elevado, bajo el criterio A de la lista roja, debido a las declinaciones rapidas de poblacion inferidas. Este numero incremento a 23 cuando las especies con deficiencia de datos (es decir, aquellas con informacion insuficiente para su evaluacion) fueron incluidas. Bajo el criterio B2 de la lista roja, 484 especies (855 cuando se incluyeron las especies con deficiencia de datos) se consideraron con riesgo alto de extincion, debido a las areas restringidas de ocupacion como resultado de la pequena cobertura del bosque que permanece dentro de su distribucion. La proporcion de especies de interes para la conservacion incrementaria en 32.8 \% para los anfibios, 15.1 \% para las aves y 24.7 \% para los mamiferos si nuestros cambios de categoria sugeridos son aceptados. America Central, los Andes del norte, Madagascar, los bosques del Arco Oriental de africa y las islas del sureste asiatico son puntos clave para estas especies. Nuestros resultados ilustran la utilidad de las imagenes satelitales para la valoracion global de la extincion de riesgo y para la medicion del progreso hacia los objetivos de los acuerdos ambientales internacionales.

TI  - Detection And Monitoring Of Facilities Exposed To Subsidence Phenomena Via Past And Current Generation Sar Sensors
AB  - The identification of facilities in areas affected by subsidence phenomena represents a fundamental activity in processes dealing with land management. For this kind of phenomena, the analyses may be hampered by the lack of official subsidence zoning maps because of the wide extension of the affected areas. This is mainly due to the costs necessary for measurements and surveys to be carried out via conventional in situ techniques which can turn out to be unaffordable for the authorities in charge of land management. In this regard, during the last decade the use of remote sensing data, such as medium resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images processed via differential interferometry algorithms (DInSAR), has proven its benefits for the detection and monitoring of facilities (i.e., buildings and infrastructures) in subsiding areas. Currently, the improved resolution and coverage of the ultimate generation SAR sensors seem very promising for consequence analyses of facilities, although displacement time series are still limited for long-term studies. In this paper, analyses of DInSAR data acquired via both medium (ERS-ENVISAT) and high (COSMO-SkyMed) resolution sensors are carried out over a densely urbanized flat area in southern Italy so as to show how the appropriate use of DInSAR data at different scales can valuably help in the detection and monitoring of damageable facilities. © 2013 Sinopec Geophysical Research Institute.

TI  - Defining A Communications Satellite Policy System For The 21st Century: A Model For A International Legal Framework And A New ''Code Of Conduct''
AB  - This paper addresses the changing international communications environment and explores the key elements of a new policy framework for the 21st Century. It addresses the issues related to changing markets, trade considerations, standards, regulatory changes and international institutions and law. The most important aspects will related to new international policy and regulatory frameworks and in particular to a new international code of ethics and behavior in the field of satellite communications. A new communications satellite policy framework requires systematically addressing the following points: Multi-lateral agreements at the nation State and the operating entity level Systematic means to access both private and public capital Meshing ITU regulations with regional and national policy guidelines including ''landing rights'' and national allocation procedures. Systematic approach to local partnerships Resolving the issue of the relative standing of various satellite systems (i.e. GEO, MEG, and LEO systems) Resolving the rights, duties, and priorities of satellite facility providers versus types of service providers. Beyond this policy framework and generalized legal infrastructure there is also another need. This is a need that arises from both increased globalism and competitive international markets. This is what might quite simply be called a ''code of reasonable conduct:'' To provide global and international communications services effectively and well in the 21st Century will require more than meeting minimum international legal requirements. A new ''code of conduct'' for global satellite communications will thus likely need to address: Privacy and surveillance Ethics of transborder data flow Censorship and moral values Cultural and linguistic sensitivity Freedom of the press and respect for journalistic standards As expanding global information and telecommunications systems grow and impact every aspect of modem life, the need for new international policy and especially new suitable standards of conduct in the field of satellite communications become ever more apparent and necessary.

TI  - Scale- And Region-Dependence In Landscape-Pm2.5 Correlation: Implications For Urban Planning
AB  - Under rapid urbanization, many cities in China suffer from serious fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F\_PLAND) and built-up areas (C\_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F\_PLAND and positively to C\_PLAND (significance at p < 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.

TI  - Sea Level Rise Exposure Assessment Of U.s. East Coast Cargo Container Terminals
AB  - Continuity of marine port operations and recovery in the event of disaster and flooding are dependent upon planning for acute or chronic disruptions. Ports are developing the capacity to integrate climate change adaptation with strategic planning and making capital investments in infrastructure. Geospatial risk assessments have demonstrated utility for planning marine port terminal facilities. Such assessments have tended to be coarse and comprehensive (whole port cities) or narrow, site-specific and single-hazard approaches (single terminal or site scale). This study develops a methodology for major container port terminals on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States to advance a screening approach to sea level rise, identify exposure to terminals and associated surface transportation, and enable comparative assessment. The study leverages geospatial data, elevation, imagery, transportation databases, tide gauges, and sea level rise projections. The approach extends prior methods to quantify exposure across multiple ports and terminals. Hypsographs and modelled future tidal flooding are derived for each port. Results highlight the need for port planning to develop GIS, monitor sea level rise trends, engage in integrative assessments, and optimize mitigation and adaptation actions. Results show similarities across yet also differentially increasing threats of relative sea level rise and tidal flooding at individual terminals. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Heritage And Satellite Manufacturing: Firm-Level Competitiveness And The Management Of Risk In Global Production Networks
AB  - This article explores the role that product- and firm-centered heritage plays as an advantage-creating resource and competitive dynamic in contributing to minimizing risks for firms in global production networks (GPN). Research on the management of risk has been identified as critical for developing an understanding of the underlying determinants of GPN. In the satellite industry, key risks relate to launch, extreme conditions in outer space, and challenges concerning repair. These risks are minimized by the development and management of heritage. Heritage is a reputational asset founded on proven technology embedded in products and/or firm-based relationships that have values or associations that accumulate and are passed down over time. The risks associated with the space sector are extreme; however, heritage also plays an important but unacknowledged role in other economic sectors, including shipping, nuclear energy, rail, medical technologies, and aviation. The article adds to the economic geography literature in three ways. First, it highlights the central role that regulators and insurance providers play in defining market imperatives for GPN. Second, it identifies and explores heritage as a reputational asset, providing both a source of competitiveness and a competitive dynamic influencing firm-based routines and interfirm relationships. Third, it provides the first in-depth analysis of the satellite industry in the context of heritage-a sector that impacts on the everyday activities of government agencies, citizens, and firms. This analysis of heritage is based on eighty in-depth interviews with representatives from across the UK space sector.

TI  - Spatial Prediction Of Soil Depth Using Environmental Covariates By Quantile Regression Forest Model
AB  - Prediction of soil depth for larger areas provides primary information on soil depth and its spatial distribution that becomes vital for land resource management, crop, nutrient, and ecosystem modeling. The present study assessed the spatial distribution of soil depth over 160,205 km(2) of Andhra Pradesh, India, using 20 covariables by quantile regression forest (QRF). An aggregate of 2854 soil datasets compiled from various physiographic units were randomly partitioned into 80:20 ratio for calibration (2283 samples) and validation (571 samples). Landsat imagery, terrain datasets (8), and bioclimatic factors (11) were utilized as covariates. The QRF model outputs signified that precipitation, multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness (MrVBF), mean diurnal range, isothermality, and elevation were the most important variables influencing soil depth variability across the landscape. Spatial prediction of soil depth by QRF model yielded a ME of - 1.81 cm, RMSE of 34 cm, PICP of 90.2, and a R-2 value of 42\% as compared to ordinary kriging which results in a ME of - 0.14 cm, a RMSE of 37 cm, and a R-2 value of 32\%. As soil depth is spatially dynamic and has significant correlation with terrain and environmental covariates, better prediction was possible by the QRF model. However, high-density bioclimatic variables could be utilized along with high-resolution terrain variables to improve the predictive accuracy.

TI  - Soil Salinity Effects On Crop Growth And Yield - Illustration Of An Analysis And Mapping Methodology For Sugarcane
AB  - The effects of soil salinity on growth and yield of sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) are used to illustrate how soil and plant samples (<<ground truth>>), digital videographic or SPOT HRV spectral observations, and image analysis by unsupervised classification can be used jointly to quantify and map variations in weighted electrical conductivity (WEC, dS m(-1)) of the root zone and MELD (metric tons of millable stalks ha(-1)). The combined data for the 1992 and 1993 growing seasons of the study showed that each dS m(-1) increase in WEC reduced stalk population by 0.6 stalks m(-2), stalk weight by 0.14 kg, and stalk yields by 13.7 metric tons ha(-1). Sugarcane growth and yield were not affected by root: zone salinities less than about 2dS m(-1), but no millable stalks were produced at salinities in excess of 10 dS m(-1). The 25 pixels ha(-1) of SPOT is a good scale for mapping salt stress patterns and taking sire-specific ameliorative actions. The combination of satellite or aerial spectral observations, ground truth, and image classification procedures demonstrated in this study is readily applicable to other vegetation stresses.

TI  - A Modified Knn Method For Mapping The Leaf Area Index In Arid And Semi-Arid Areas Of China
AB  - As an important vegetation canopy parameter, the leaf area index (LAI) plays a critical role in forest growth modeling and vegetation health assessment. Estimating LAI is helpful for understanding vegetation growth and global ecological processes. Machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and random forest (RF) with remote sensing images have been widely used for mapping LAI. However, the accuracy of mapping LAI in arid and semi-arid areas using these methods is limited due to remote and large areas, the high cost of collecting field data, and the great spatial variability of the vegetation canopy. Here, a novel and modified kNN method was presented for mapping LAI in arid and semi-arid areas of China using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images with field data collected in Ganzhou and Kangbao of China. The modified kNN was developed by integrating the traditional kNN estimation and RF classification. The results were compared with those from kNN and RF regression alone using three sets of input predictors: (i) spectral reflectance bands (input 1); (ii) vegetation indices (input 2); and (iii) a combination of spectral reflectance bands and vegetation indices (input 3). Our analysis showed that in Ganzhou, the red-edge bands of the Sentinel-2 image had a high correlation with LAI. Using the red-edge band-derived vegetation indices increased the accuracy of mapping LAI compared with using other spectral variables. Among the three sets of input predictors, input 3 resulted in the highest prediction accuracy. Based on the combination, the values of RMSE obtained by the traditional kNN, RF, and modified kNN were 0.526, 0.523, and 0.372, respectively, and the modified kNN significantly improved the accuracy of LAI prediction by 29.3% and 28.9% compared with the kNN and RF alone, respectively. A similar improvement was achieved for input 1 and input 2. In Kangbao, the improvement of the prediction accuracy obtained by the modified kNN was 31.4% compared with both the kNN and RF. Therefore, this study implied that the modified kNN provided the potential to improve the accuracy of mapping LAI in arid and semi-arid regions using the images. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - The Damage Of Urban Vegetation From Super Typhoon Is Associated With Landscape Factors: Evidence From Sentinel-2 Imagery
AB  - Many studies have investigated the impacts of typhoons on natural vegetation, but the influencing factor of urban vegetation damage from super typhoon is not clear. Therefore, this study investigated the vegetation damage patterns in eight cities affected by Typhoon Mangkhut (the 2nd strongest tropical storm worldwide in 2018) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 images. The vegetation damage maps have an overall accuracy of 97% using the very high-resolution WorldView-3 images as reference data. The results show that (1) The typhoon-induced vegetation damage show high spatial heterogeneity in urban areas and varies with land cover types. Residential greenspace and street trees are more susceptible to typhoon disturbance than natural vegetation. (2) Wind intensity is still an important factor in urban vegetation damage (r2 = 0.43, P value <0.001). (3) Urban vegetation damage positively relates to vegetation sparseness for all cities (r: 0.39–0.89, P value <0.01), whereas negatively correlated to the height of surrounding buildings (r = −0.57, P value <0.01), suggesting that both biotic and abiotic factors of the urban environment have influences on the resistance of vegetation to storms. This study provides insights into the resistance and resilience of urban vegetation to strong typhoons that can be used for urban forestry planning and management. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Estimation Of Land Surface Temperature From Landsat-8 Oli: Comparative Analysis Of Two Periods For Duzce In Turkey
AB  - In this study, using Landsat 8 OLI satellite images, Duzce province 2013 and 2021 land surface temperature data were calculated and it was aimed to determine land surface temperature values according to land-use classes. In addition, correlations were examined according to six different vegetation indexes. In the areal distribution of land surface temperature data, it was determined that 59.7\% of the entire area was distributed between 25 and 30 degrees C in 2013, and 53.3\% between 20 and 25 degrees C in 2021. The normalized difference vegetation index, which is used extensively, especially in studies related to vegetation, has the highest average values of broad-leaved forest areas in both periods. In the relations between land surface temperature values and vegetation indexes, a positive correlation with normalized difference built-up index and a negative correlation with other vegetation indexes were found. Correlation values between land surface temperature and vegetation indexes in 2021 were higher than in 2013. The highest correlation values were obtained in the normalized difference built-up index in 2013 and 2021 with correlation values of 0.62 (R-2: 0.39) and 0.73 (R-2: 0.54), respectively. While a correlation of 0.68 (R-2: 0.46) was found with the NDVI index in 2021, a correlation of 0.55 (R-2: 0.30) was obtained in 2013. The lowest correlation was found in the renormalized difference vegetation index with ratios of 0.66 (R-2: 0.44) in 2021 and 0.47 (R-2: 0.22) in 2013. In addition, significant and positive spatial autocorrelations were obtained according to Moran I and LISA statistical analysis in both years. Moran's I values were found to be 0.607 (p < 0.05) in 2013 and 0.791 (p < 0.05) in 2021, and it was determined that there were significant clusters according to LISA. Understanding the effects of the spatial distribution of Land use-land change and its variation over time on the land surface temperature can be incorporated into environmental health and sustainable urban planning and contribute to planners.

TI  - Estimation Of Rubber Stand Age In Typhoon And Chilling Injury Afflicted Area With Landsat Tm Data: A Case Study In Hainan Island, China
AB  - Stand age in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation is an important factor for production management and ecosystem modeling. The feasibility of detecting difference in rubber stand age using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in Hainan Island, an area frequently disturbed by typhoon (or hurricane, tropical cyclone) and chilling injury, was evaluated. The results indicated that most of the TM bands were negatively correlated with stand age, of which the near-infrared bands had the most stable and strongest coefficients. However, the correlation of infrared bands with stand age was dramatically weakened by disturbance of severe typhoon and chilling injury, which suggested that, to study the stand age of rubber plantation by remote sensing, it is more appropriate to use an image acquired in dry season and far from severe natural disaster. The TM bands, normalized- and ratio-based vegetation indices that computed from red and infrared bands (3-5 and 7), and tasseled cap components were employed to develop models for estimating stand age through multivariate regression analysis techniques. Four statistically significant models with R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.82 were obtained. When applied to the validation data, all the regression models showed an overestimation of young stands (about less than 25 years) and more severe underestimation of old stands due to the growth characteristics of rubber tree and disturbance of natural disasters. The incorporation of original bands with vegetation indices and tasseled cap components as independent variables could yield the highest estimated correlation index squared (l(2)) value of 0.58, the RMSE value of 5.96 years, and less model bias than the other test models. This study demonstrated a close relationship between rubber stand age and Landsat TM data, and a promising prospect in application of TM data to investigating stand parameters in Hainan Island.

TI  - Ethical Issues Of Human Enhancements For Space Missions To Mars And Beyond
AB  - A human mission to Mars is planned by public and private agencies. It is broadly discussed and studied by scientists in such fields as medicine and aerospace engineering. Less attention is being paid by philosophers and ethicists, and social scientists as well. The aim of this paper is to discuss possible ethical challenges and issues, which may appear during a human mission to Mars. We focus our attention mostly on one issue – the idea of human enhancements for space missions. While our case study is mostly a mission to Mars, ethical issues around human enhancement for space are also relevant for other longer-term human expeditions, including Lunar missions, and beyond. Because the space environment is hazardous for humans, it can be expected that new ethical issues concerning the value of human life may appear. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mineral Potential Mapping In Central Iran Using Fuzzy Ordered Weighted Averaging Method
AB  - The aim of this work is to introduce the application of the fuzzy ordered weighted averaging method as a straightforward knowledge-driven approach to explore porphyry copper deposits in an airborne prospect. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to airborne geophysical (potassium radiometry, magnetometry, and frequency-domain electromagnetic) data, geological layers (fault and host rock zones), and various extracted alteration layers from remote sensing images. The central Iranian volcanic-sedimentary belt in Kerman province of Iran that is located within the Urumieh-Dokhtar (Sahand-Bazman) magmatic arc is chosen for this study. This region has high potential of mineral occurrences, especially porphyry copper, containing some active world-class copper mines such as Sarcheshmeh. Two evidential layers, including the downward continued map and the analytic signal of such filtered magnetic data, are generated to be used as geophysical plausible traces of porphyry copper occurrences. The low values of the resistivity layer acquired from airborne frequency-domain electromagnetic data are also used as an electrical criterion in this study. Four remote sensing evidential layers, including argillic, phyllic, propylitic, and hydroxyl alterations, are extracted from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer images in order to map the altered areas associated with porphyry copper deposits. The Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus images are used to map iron oxide layer. Since potassium alteration is the mainstay of copper alteration, the airborne potassium radiometry data are used. Here, the fuzzy ordered weighted averaging method uses a wide range of decision strategies in order to generate numerous mineral potential/prospectivity maps. The final mineral potential map based upon desired geo-data set indicates adequately matching of high-potential zones with previous working mines and copper deposits. © 2014 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.

TI  - Our Footprint On Antarctica Competes With Nature For Rare Ice-Free Land
AB  - Construction and operation of research stations present the most pronounced human impacts on the Antarctic continent across a wide range of environmental values. Despite Antarctic Treaty Parties committing themselves to comprehensive protection of the environment, data on the spatial extent of impacts from their activities have been limited. To quantify this, we examined the area of building and ground disturbance across the entire continent using geographic information system mapping of satellite imagery. Here, we report the footprint of all buildings to be > 390,000 m(2), with an additional disturbance footprint of > 5,200,000 m(2) just on ice-free land. These create a visual footprint similar in size to the total ice-free area of Antarctica, and impact over half of all large coastal ice-free areas. Our data demonstrate that human impacts are disproportionately concentrated in some of the most sensitive environments, with consequential implications for conservation management. This highresolution measurement of the extent of infrastructure across the continent can be used to inform management decisions to balance sustainable scientific use and environmental protection of the Antarctic environment.

TI  - A Statewide Urban Tree Canopy Mapping Method
AB  - Maps of urban tree canopy are essential to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem services, and to determine who benefits from them. Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m2, three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m2 on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m2, which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5–81%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE)decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block. Our work is comparable to past efforts to map urban tree canopy, and the open source software and use of imagery that is freely available for all cities in the contiguous US make it broadly applicable. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing For Current Irrigated Area Mapping Of The Rift Valley Lake Basin In Ethiopia
AB  - The study was conducted in the Rift Valley Basin in 2020-2022, with the objective of evaluating the newly developed techniques for irrigated area mapping of spatially large areas and assessing the current irrigated area in the basin. Methods used for irrigated area mapping are imagery analysis using the NDVI and EVI methods and land use classification. All results were verified with ground-truthing data using the sample locations selected. A 10 m x 10 m spatial resolution image derived from the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite was used to create a time series spanning 2020, 2021, and 2022. Irrigated area maps from all three techniques were obtained and evaluated. Metric indicators were used to evaluate the performance of the irrigated area mapping techniques, the mean overall accuracy was 0.82, with a kappa coefficient of 0.76 and an F1-score of 0.86 with the highest and lowest overall accuracy observed in 2020 (0.86) and 2022 (0.76), respectively. Coefficient of determination was used to quantify the correlation of geospatial information and the multispectral remote sensing data analysis results maps agreed with irrigated area mapping with respect to ground truthing with R2 mean value of 0.87 which suggests a strong agreement.HIGHLIGHTSNo previous study has been done for the basin. The study will have an impact on managing water resources, strategic water allocation planning and climate change mitigation options. Appropriate references are used.

TI  - Comparison Between Snow Albedo Obtained From Landsat Tm, Etm+ Imagery And The Spot Vegetation Albedo Product In A Mediterranean Mountainous Site
AB  - Albedo plays an important role in snow evolution modeling quantifying the amount of solar radiation absorbed and reflected by the snowpack, especially in mid-latitude regions with semiarid conditions. Satellite remote sensing is the most extensive technique to determine the variability of snow albedo over medium to large areas; however, scale effects from the pixel size of the sensor source may affect the results of snow models, with different impacts depending on the spatial resolution. This work presents the evaluation of snow albedo values retrieved from (1) Landsat images, L (16-day frequency with 30 x 30 m pixel size) and (2) SPOT VEGETATION albedo products, SV (10-day frequency with 1 x 1 km pixel size) in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in South Spain, a Mediterranean site representative of highly heterogeneous conditions. Daily snow albedo map series were derived from both sources, and used as input for the snow module in the WiMMed (Watershed Integrated Management in Mediterranean Environment) hydrological model, which was operational at the study area for snow monitoring for two hydrological years, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, in the Guadalfeo river basin in Sierra Nevada. The results showed similar albedo trends in both data sources, but with different values, the shift between both sources being distributed in space according to the altitude. This difference resulted in lower snow cover fraction values in the SV-simulations that affected the rest of snow variables included in the simulation. This underestimation, mainly due to the effects of mixed pixels composed by both snow and snow-free areas, produced higher divergences from both sources during the melting periods when the evapo-sublimation and melting fluxes are more relevant. Therefore, the selection of the albedo data source in these areas, where snow evapo-sublimation plays a very important role and the presence of snow-free patches is very frequent, can condition the final accuracy of the simulations of operational models; Landsat is the recommended source if the monitoring of the snowpack is the final goal of the modeling, whereas the SV product may be advantageous when water resource planning in the medium and long term is intended. Applications of large pixel size albedo sources need further assessment for short-term operational objectives.

TI  - Assessment And Analysis Of Morphometric Characteristics Of Lake Tana Sub-Basin, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
AB  - This study aimed at assessing and quantitatively analysing morphometric parameters of the Lake Tana Sub-basin and its catchments using remote sensing data and Geographic Information System (GIS). The extraction of drainage network was performed from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m x 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data using the Arc Hydro extension within ArcGIS 10.2. The drainage network analysis of the sub-basin revealed that the sub-basin is a seventh order with a dendritic drainage pattern and very fine drainage texture. Further, the analysis of the study showed that the catchments Gilgel Abay, Ribb and Gumera are a fifth-order stream whereas Megech is a sixth-order stream. Values of bifurcation ratio is high that indicates the presence of a higher number of streams even in the higher orders, high structural disturbance, availability of erodible soils and occurrence of high overland flow and discharge. The drainage density also revealed the basin area is permeable, with high precipitation, infiltration rate and vegetation covers. Moreover, the elongation ratio showed the basin is elongated and low class. The smaller stream frequency indicates that the basin experienced low relief, permeable bedrock and the presence of alluvial fans and flood plains. The results of this study provide information on drainage morphometry for researchers and watershed managers to understand the watershed characteristics. It serves as a basis for improved planning, management and decision making to ensure sustainable use of the basin resources, river basin evaluation, watershed prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resources management at macro and micro level.

TI  - Generation Of A Global Spatially Continuous Tansat Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Product By Considering The Impact Of The Solar Radiation Intensity
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a new and direct way of monitoring photosynthetic activity. However, current SIF products are limited by low spatial resolution or sparse sampling. In this paper, we present a data-driven method of generating a global, spatially continuous TanSat SIF product. Firstly, the key explanatory variables for modelling canopy SIF were investigated using in-situ and satellite observations. According to theoretical and experimental analysis, the solar radiation intensity was found to be a dominant driving environmental variable for the SIF yield at both the canopy and global scales; this has, however, been neglected in previous research. The cosine value of the solar zenith angle at noon (cos (SZA0), a proxy for solar radiation intensity, was found to be a dominant abiotic factor for the SIF yield. Next, a Random Forest (RF) approach was employed for SIF prediction based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) visible-to-NIR reflectance data, the normalized difference vegetation (NDVI), cos (SZA0), and air temperature. The machine learning model performed well at predicting SIF, giving R2 values of 0.73, an RMSE of 0.30 mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1 and a bias of 0.22 mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1 for 2018. If cos (SZA0) was not included, the accuracy of the RF model decreased: the R2 value was then 0.65, the RMSE 0.34 mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1 and an bias of 0.26 mW m-2 nm-1 sr-1, further verifying the importance of cos (SZA0). Finally, the globally continuous TanSat SIF product was developed and compared to the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF data. The results showed that the globally continuous TanSat SIF product agreed well with the TROPOMI SIF data, with an R2 value of 0.73. Thus, this paper presents an improved approach to modelling satellite SIF that has a better accuracy, and the study also generated a global, spatially continuous TanSat SIF product with a spatial resolution of 0.05°. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Detecting Shrub Recovery In Sagebrush Steppe: Comparing Landsat-Derived Maps With Field Data On Historical Wildfires
AB  - Background: The need for basic information on spatial distribution and abundance of plant species for research and management in semiarid ecosystems is frequently unmet. This need is particularly acute in the large areas impacted by megafires in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, which require frequently updated information about increases in exotic annual invaders or recovery of desirable perennials. Remote sensing provides one avenue for obtaining this information. We considered how a vegetation model based on Landsat satellite imagery (30 m pixel resolution; annual images from 1985 to 2018) known as the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) “Back-in-Time” fractional component time-series, compared with field-based vegetation measurements. The comparisons focused on detection thresholds of post-fire emergence of fire-intolerant Artemisia L. species, primarily A. tridentata Nutt. (big sagebrush). Sagebrushes are scarce after fire and their paucity over vast burn areas creates challenges for detection by remote sensing. Measurements were made extensively across the Great Basin, USA, on eight burn scars encompassing ~500 000 ha with 80 plots sampled, and intensively on a single 113 000 ha burned area where we sampled 1454 plots. Results: Estimates of sagebrush cover from the NLCD were, as a mean, 6.5% greater than field-based estimates, and variance around this mean was high. The contrast between sagebrush cover measurements in field data and NLCD data in burned landscapes was considerable given that maximum cover values of sagebrush were ~35% in the field. It took approximately four to six years after the fire for NLCD to detect consistent, reliable signs of sagebrush recovery, and sagebrush cover estimated by NLCD ranged from 3 to 13% (equating to 0 to 7% in field estimates) at these times. The stabilization of cover and presence four to six years after fire contrasted with previous field-based studies that observed fluctuations over longer time periods. Conclusions: While results of this study indicated that further improvement of remote sensing applications would be necessary to assess initial sagebrush recovery patterns, they also showed that Landsat satellite imagery detects the influence of burns and that the NLCD data tend to show faster rates of recovery relative to field observations. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Characteristics Of Daytime Land Surface Temperature In Wind Corridor: A Case Study Of A Hot Summer And Warm Winter City
AB  - With increasing urbanisation, the fraction of built-up areas and human activities increase, deteriorating the urban thermal environment and air quality. To improve the urban environment, wind corridors have attracted much research attention in recent years. In this study, a sky-view factor (SVF)-based method is proposed and verified for the potential wind corridor detection in a built-up urban area. The proposed method accurately identified wind corridors at a spatial resolution as high as 10 m. Characteristics of daytime land surface temperature (LST) were analysed based on Landsat-8 data. Results show that daytime LST in the wind corridor is higher than that in its adjacent non-corridor areas. To quantify the effect of SVF on LST over urban ground-level surfaces, the quantitative relationship between SVF and LST was analysed in the whole study area. Mean LST was found to increase linearly with SVF at a rate of about 0.2 degrees C per 0.1 SVF value. Moreover, effects of the underlying surface and urban morphology on LST were also discussed. Water bodies were found to effectively reduce LST, whereas in built-up areas, LST was also affected by building height (negative correlation) and building density (positive correlation). When using building height as a variable, the mean LST difference reached 3.5 degrees C in four seasons, while it was only 1.2 degrees C between areas with different building densities. These findings are useful to urban planning and provide insights to evaluate wind corridors' effectiveness holistically.

TI  - Community Forest Management In Sikkim Himalaya Towards Sustainable Development
AB  - Sikkim state is rich in biodiversity with a vibrant traditionally strong conservation ethics in place. This work aimed to understand the diverse systems of community forest management and their status with special reference to the nature of institutions governing them. As such, prolific and luxuriant state of the forests is perceptible through remote sensing data based on derivations of normalised difference vegetation index and land use/cover. Existing community forest management practices such as sacred landscapes/groves, gumpa (monastery) forests, private forests earlier managed by kazis/royal family members, taungya, bhasme and dzumsa/pipon system, etc. were field documented. Community management components of the state administered forests like joint forest management, eco-development committees for protected areas, watershed committees and panchayats/mandals were also observed. Practices still in existence, historical perspectives, management mechanism, administering authority, culture/tradition, forest status, traditional ecological knowledge and its constraints were assessed. Socio-economic and natural resources interlinking in all the practices was assessed which should be an important factor for environmental law capacity building. There are further scopes of carbon benefits from community forest management in the context of climate change regimes.

TI  - Temporal Monitoring Of Land Use/Land Cover Change In Kahramanmaraş City Center
AB  - Irregular urbanization causes problems such as decrease in fertile agricultural areas, irregular industrialization and urbanization. To provide a healthier life opportunity for future generations without disturbing nature, it is essential to determine the temporal changes in land use and to make land management plans accordingly. In this study, land use/land cover (LULC) change occurred in Kahramanmaras province within 30 years was investigated by remote sensing and integration of Geographic Information Systems. Landsat satellite images of 1988-1998-2008-2018 were obtained for the production of LULC maps. Each image was classified according to supervised classification approach using the support vector machines (SVMs) algorithms. The confusion matrix was created for each year to examine the accuracy of the LULC maps. The overall accuracy of the thematic maps was obtained as 91.76%, 93.56%, 86.89% and 88.29%, respectively. Also, Kappa values of thematic maps for each year were obtained as 0.88, 0.91, 0.81 and 0.84, respectively. When the results were examined, the development of industry in the city area and the construction of the airport contributed to the development of the social and economic structure of the city. The increase in the number of housing in the related regions has led to an increase in the amount of urban areas and a decrease in agricultural areas. © Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Exploring The Regional Potential Of Lignocellulosic Biomass For An Emerging Bio-Based Economy: A Case Study From Southwest Germany
AB  - The globally emerging concepts and strategies for a "bioeconomy" rely on the vision of a sustainable bio-based substitution process. Fossil fuels are scarce and their use contributes to global warming. To replace them in the value chains, it is essential to gain knowledge about quantities and spatial distributions of renewable resources. Decision makers specifically require knowledge-based models for rational development choices. In this paper, we demonstrate such an approach using remote sensing-derived maps that represent the potential available biomass of forests and trees outside forests (TOF). The maps were combined with infrastructure data, transport costs and wood pricing to calculate the potentially available biomass for a regional bioeconomy in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in Southwest Germany. We estimated the spatially explicit regional supply of biomass using routable data in a GIS environment, and created an approach to find the most suitable positions for biomass conversion facilities by minimizing transport distances and biomass costs. The approach resulted in the theoretical, regional supply of woody biomass with transport distances between 10 and 50 km. For a more realistic assessment, we subsequently applied several restrictions and assumptions, compiled different scenarios, optimised transport distances and identified wood assortments. Our analysis demonstrated that a regional bioeconomy using only local primary lignocellulosic biomass is possible. There would be, however, strong competition with traditional wood-processing sectors, mainly thermal utilisation and pulp and paper production. Finally, suitable positions for conversion facilities in Baden-Württemberg were determined for each of the six most plausible scenarios. This case study demonstrates the value of remote sensing and GIS techniques for a flexible, expandable and upgradable spatially explicit decision model. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Efficient Selection Of Sar Features Using Ml Based Algorithms For Accurate Fvc Estimation
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is a ratio of vertical projection area of green vegetation to the total area under consideration. Crops infested by pests, diseases or nutrient deficiency show their impact on the crop coverage. Therefore, FVC is a good indicator of crop health and arid soil. Recently, various models have been reported for FVC estimation using optical data, but it is still limited to different weather conditions. Therefore, it is not feasible to continue crop monitoring using optical data. On the other hand, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is weather independent, and has a good potential for crop monitoring in all-weather conditions. SAR data has been used for many crop parameters estimation, however has not been much explored for FVC estimation. Plenty SAR features are available which are sensitive to vegetation parameters. Some of the features are sensitive during early crop stages (e.g., entropy, DpRVI-dual polarization radar vegetation index), while others are sensitive during different stages of crops (backscattering signal of VH and VV polarization). Therefore, there is a need to critically assess all the features and find the optimum combination that provides exemplary results during the entire crop cycle. For this purpose, sixteen features are considered using the different combinations of Sentinel-1 SLC data and their temporal analysis is observed for their different phenology stages. Four machine learning (ML) based models i.e., LightGBM, Xgboost, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest have been explored on these features for FVC estimation. The performance of each model is assessed with the error metrics. Xgboost emerges as the best model with a minimum RMSE value of 0.159. Xgboost model has the capability to recognize the most important features. Due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, feature priority sequence may vary, therefore, algorithm runs multiple times and the probability of each feature for every position is calculated and on the basis of the highest probability, feature importance sequences is decided. Xgboost model is developed by increasing the input features in the order of their importance sequence and the RMSE value is calculated for each input combination. It is noted that initially, the RMSE value improved from 0.22 to 0.15 for the top five input features. When additional features were included, no further improvement in the RMSE was observed. Therefore; entropy, alpha, VH, VH/VV, and VV are the top five features which are used in the Xgboost model for FVC estimation instead of all sixteen features, which delivers satisfactory results. © 2022 COSPAR

TI  - Gaussian Class-Conditional Simplex Loss For Accurate, Adversarially Robust Deep Classifier Training
AB  - In this work, we present the Gaussian Class-Conditional Simplex (GCCS) loss: a novel approach for training deep robust multiclass classifiers that improves over the state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracy and adversarial robustness, with little extra cost for network training. The proposed method learns a mapping of the input classes onto Gaussian target distributions in a latent space such that a hyperplane can be used as the optimal decision surface. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual samples, our loss function pushes the network to produce feature distributions yielding high inter-class separation and low intra-class separation. The mean values of the learned distributions are centered on the vertices of a simplex such that each class is at the same distance from every other class. We show that the regularization of the latent space based on our approach yields excellent classification accuracy. Moreover, GCCS provides improved robustness against adversarial perturbations, outperforming models trained with conventional adversarial training (AT). In particular, our model learns a decision space that minimizes the presence of short paths toward neighboring decision regions. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation that shows how GCCS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches over challenging datasets for targeted and untargeted gradient-based, as well as gradient-free adversarial attacks, both in terms of classification accuracy and adversarial robustness. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Analysis Of The Spatio-Temporal Patterns Of Water Pollution And Source Contribution Using The Modis Sensor Products And Multivariate Statistical Techniques
AB  - Analysis of the spatio-temporal patterns and source apportionment of water pollution is important for proper management and protection of water resources. In this paper, different multivariate statistical methods were used to explore the spatio-temporal patterns of water pollution, and quantitative relationships between the important pollution parameters and environmental variables. Eleven significant parameters measured in 22 monitoring sites were preprocessed spanning between 2001 and 2007. Results of the hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) demonstrated that this method had high flexibility for efficient classification of the monitoring sites. Results of discriminant analysis (DA) revealed that a high number of parameters contributed in discrimination of classes in the spring and summer seasons, especially in the April and September months. Recorded data of river water temperature (RWT), runoff, and two products of the MODIS sensor including the monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) for the period of 2002-2007 were used as the explanatory variables. Test of NDVI and LST was based on extraction of their average values in different buffers of 250 up to 1500 m around the streams. Monthly data of group 1, a group with the highest number of monitoring sites resulting from the clustering procedure, was used for the analysis. Rotated principal component analysis (rotated PCA) was used for exploration of the quantitative relationships between the pollution parameters and environmental variables. Absolute principal component score-multivariate linear regression (APCS-MLR) was applied to quantify the source contributions for each pollution parameter. Results showed that NDVI and runoff can be considered as the efficient indicators of the non-point pollution sources such as the agricultural activities and surface weathering. NDVI showed an important role in reduction of TDS and No-3(-). Multiple buffers of NDVI showed temporally variable relations with different pollution sources. LST showed high discrimination potentials for distinguishing pollutions related to biochemical activities. Although the tested environmental variables revealed some relationships with those of the water pollution sources, nevertheless for more detailed analysis of the water pollution problem, the role of other latent environmental variables should be taken into consideration.

TI  - Association Between Neighborhood Greenspace And Fasting Plasma Glucose From A Large Cohort Study In Taiwan
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that greenness exposure improves health status, but few studies address diabetes, and research mainly comes from Western countries. This study hypothesizes that higher greenness exposure benefits glucose control with increased intensity of physical activity. We used data from a longitudinal health examination database in Taiwan during 2000-2014. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as an objective indicator of greenness in the neighborhood. Fasting plasma glucose served as an indicator of early diabetes diagnosis. A metabolic equivalent value (MET) based on a compendium of physical activities was used to estimate the intensity of physical activity. We applied a linear mixed-effect model with an individual-level random effect to investigate the relationship between neighborhood greenness and the fasting plasma glucose value stratified by four levels of physical activity. There are 341,211 participants with no diabetes, and 773,602 check-up visits included here. The fasting glucose among participants living in areas with higher green space was lower than that of those living in less green areas. The beneficial effects of greenspace on glucose were stronger for those with more physical activity, especially in the 500-m buffer. In the physically inactive group, compared with the lowest quantile (Q1) of cumulative average greenness, people living in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.35 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma {[}95\% confidence interval: -0.50, - 0.20]. In the physically active group, people residing in the highest quantile (Q4) of greenness had 0.48 mg less glucose in each dl of plasma {[}95\% confidence interval: -0.73, -0.23]. Higher residential greenness appears to be associated with lower glucose. Higher physical activity can mediate this association. Our results provide evidence that ensuring access to greenspace in residential neighborhoods may provide positive health outcomes and improve public health, and should be implemented in urban planning.

TI  - Assessment Of Energy-Population-Urbanization Nexus With Changing Energy Industry Scenario In India
AB  - The demand for energy has been growing worldwide, especially in India partly due to the rapid population growth and urbanization of the country. To meet the ever-increasing energy requirement while maintaining an ecological balance is a challenging task. However, the energy industry-induced effect on population and urbanization has not been addressed before. Therefore, this study investigates the linkages between energy, population, and urbanization. The study also aims to find the quantifiable indicators for the population growth and rate of urbanization due to the expanding energy industry. The integrated framework uses a multi-temporal Landsat data to analyze the urbanization pattern, a census data for changes in population growth, night time light (NTL) data as an indicator for economic development and energy production and consumption data for energy index. Multi-attribute model is used to calculate a unified metric, termed as the energy-population-urbanization (EPU) nexus index. The proposed approach is demonstrated in the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Dadri power plant located in Uttar Pradesh, India. Landsat and NTL data clearly shows the urbanization pattern, economic development, and electrification in the study area. A comparative analysis based on various multi-attribute decision model assessment techniques suggests that the average value of EPU nexus index is 0.529, which significantly large compared to other studies and require special attention by policymakers because large EPU index indicates stronger correlation among energy, population, and urbanization. The authors believe that it would help the policymakers in planning and development of future energy projects, policies, and long-term strategies as India is expanding its energy industry.

TI  - The Effect Of Topographic Orientation In City Building And Its Environmental Impact (A Case Study Of Chernozemye Cities)
AB  - The article describes the current practice of building on the slopes. The steeper the slope, the harder it restricts the orientation of buildings. V.G. Davidovich classified four levels of slope steepness, depending on their effect on the planning. In the paper, we use a hypothesis that real planning examples will show the reverse dependence of construction disorientation and slope steepness. The paper researched the buildings of five main cities in the Chernozemye region: Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Lipetsk and Tambov. A special procedure to verify this hypothesis was created. The data of the OpenStreetMap and SRTM were used for computations. We presumed that the result construction orientation is reflected by the aggregate orientations of all vertical edges. Nearly 80 thousand buildings in five cities on the total area of 1380 km(2) were analyzed. For each wall we computed its parameters: length, position of start-points and end-points, direction of the wall and also aspects and steepness of the slopes of the base surface. Then we calculated the delta-value of normal directions of walls and aspects. All walls were subdivided into nine groups by delta-values of directions and by values of steepness of the Earth surface. Samples were analyzed in WinExcel. Urban sites are indifferent to topography on flat and subflat surfaces. The buildings reflect the topographical order on slopes with mean steepness. The clarity of this reflection changes from city to city and depends on some reasons. Only the cumulative effect leads to observable results. The article gives major reasons to it. The first reason is the impossibility of erecting a long building on a steep slope. The second reason is the need to effectively correlate the location of new buildings in the streets and districts with the plan of the entire city. The third reason is the need to create a geometrically precise inside-plan of streets or districst. Their combined effect leads to a fact that, for example, the flattened territory of Tambov severely limits the planning. To be more exact, a plan (if it corresponds to the relief) does not conflict with urban development ideas. The rugged terrain of Kursk is tolerant to construction. This city cannot have an effective plan, without neglecting the steep slopes bordering the historic center. The topography effect on city planning can influence the features of urban environment. Geomorphologically subordinate construction demarcates greater the flows of matters (runoff, winds) and physical fields (insolation, noise, etc.).

TI  - Resource Of Involvement As A Psychological Characteristic Of The Correspondence Degree Between A Person And The Educational Environment
AB  - The article deals with the problem of student engagement in the modern educational space. Based on the analysis of the works of Russian and foreign authors, it is shown that engagement is considered as a process, as condition, as a mechanism, as a situation, as an investment of time and energy in the performed activity. There are also various approaches to understanding the structure of engagement, its types, forms, levels, indicators and diagnostic criteria. The most studied is the behavioral side of engagement, the least studied are the mechanisms of the formation of involvement and its management. The authors proposed a systemic anthropological psychology as a methodological basis for the study of student engagement, the foundations of which were laid in the works of Tomsk scientists (V.E. Klochko, E.V. Galazhinsky, O.M. Krasnoryadtseva, O.V. Lukyanov). In this vein, the concordance between the person and the environment is considered as the main mechanism for the formation of engagement. The measure of compliance is the “resource of engagement” of a person, which includes instrumental and value and meaning characteristics. The instrumental component includes various aspects of self-regulation of activity in a changing environment, the value and meaning component is the value and meaning dimension of the objective conditions of activity. The resource of engagement determines the fundamental possibility of including a person in an environment with specific characteristics. The authors conducted an empirical study of the "resource of engagement" of students of two large universities in the Russian Far East; the sample consisted of 498 people. As a result of the factor analysis of the data, the dimensions of the concordance between the student and the educational environment were identified. These are subjective disorganization of activity (impossibility of performing activities in an environment with the specific parameters); flexibility and readiness for change (orientation towards activities in a changing environment); willingness to take responsibility (focus on own forces and resources); result orientation (experience of pleasure in achieving specific results); willingness to work in conditions of uncertainty; selfishness (self-dependence and focus on gaining benefits); focus on the labor process (without taking into account its goals and working conditions). For each option, the directions of psychological assistance aimed at increasing the academic and social involvement of students in the educational space are determined. © 2021 Tomsk State University.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Method To Evaluate Ecological Value Of Urban Settlements With The Biotope Area Factor Index: Sources And Logical Framework
AB  - As the number of people living in cities continues to increase and as their needs continue rapidly to evolve, planners and scholars have been encouraged to define what constitutes high levels of quality of life in urban settlements. The relationship of an area's inhabitants with natural and green resources increases urban environmental value, which is one of the most relevant aspects in the determination of the quality of life in built-up contexts. Moreover, it is fundamental to find quantitative parameters that can monitor the development of planning processes, working together with natural systems. The authors present a comparative method that can be used to analyze and evaluate the ecological value of urban settlements, using a semi-automatic process that is based on calculating the biotope area factor (BAF) using different open-access databases (a cartographic dataset, aerial imagery, and Sentinel-2 images). Two different Italian case studies that are set in the Milan metropolitan area are presented. In this paper, the authors describe the two settlements using the city-planning parameters of physical structure and morphology; they show the ecological differences and similarities throughout the various remote sensing sources and data. Finally, the authors indicate how the research can be developed, highlighting the weaknesses, the potentiality, the replicability process, and the urban planning implications of the methodology.

TI  - Indicators And Benchmarks For Wind Erosion Monitoring, Assessment And Management
AB  - Wind erosion and blowing dust threaten food security, human health and ecosystem services across global drylands. Monitoring wind erosion is needed to inform management, with explicit monitoring objectives being critical for interpreting and translating monitoring information into management actions. Monitoring objectives should establish quantitative guidelines for determining the relationship of wind erosion indicators to management benchmarks that reflect tolerable erosion and dust production levels considering impacts to, for example, ecosystem processes, species, agricultural production systems and human well-being. Here we: 1) critically review indicators of wind erosion and blowing dust that are currently available to practitioners; and 2) describe approaches for establishing benchmarks to support wind erosion assessments and management. We find that while numerous indicators are available for monitoring wind erosion, only a subset have been used routinely and most monitoring efforts have focused on air quality impacts of dust. Indicators need to be related to the causal soil and vegetation controls in eroding areas to directly inform management. There is great potential to use regional standardized soil and vegetation monitoring datasets, remote sensing and models to provide new information on wind erosion across landscapes. We identify best practices for establishing benchmarks for these indicators based on experimental studies, mechanistic and empirical models, and distributions of indicator values obtained from monitoring data at historic or existing reference sites. The approaches to establishing benchmarks described here have enduring utility as monitoring technologies change and enable managers to evaluate co-benefits and potential trade-offs among ecosystem services as affected by wind erosion management.

TI  - Assessing Mangrove Conservation In China By Integrating Mangrove Ecosystem Into Ecological Footprint Accounting
AB  - Mangrove conservation effort have been undertaken in China, but there is still a lack of quantitative assessment of its eco-environmental benefits. The ecological footprint (EF) is an important indicator of the sustainability of ecosystems, with carbon footprint (CF) and biocapacity (BC) being key indicators of forest ecosystems. Despite the high carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove ecosystems, they have not yet been included in EF. This study introduces mangrove ecosystems into EF accounting and assesses the eco-environmental benefits of mangrove conservation in China. To achieve this, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of mangrove forests was estimated based on the gross primary production and respiration rates. Average forest carbon sequestration (AFCS) and yield factor, key parameters of CF and BC, were calculated from NEE for the first time. The CF and BC of mangrove ecosystems were then refined using newly defined AFCS and yield factor. The proposed framework was applied to the whole mangrove forests in China to assess mangrove conservation efforts. The results showed that the average CF of mangrove forests is about 1000 M ha, which is lower than that of terrestrial forests, while the BC of mangroves is not as high as expected due to the limited area of mangroves. CF and BC vary along the coastline, whereby CF tends to decrease with decreasing latitude while BC remains high at low latitudes owing to the large mangrove area. There is no significant decreasing trend in CF, but BC increases with increasing mangrove area. The newly introduced ecological footprint accounting of mangrove ecosystems suggests that mangrove conservation in China should focus on ecosystem health and expand the area of forestable land. These findings will benefit future management of mangrove ecosystems in China and other countries.

TI  - Land Use And Cover Dynamics Since 1964 In The Afro-Alpine Vegetation Belt: Lib Amba Mountain In North Ethiopia
AB  - Human-induced land use and land cover (LUC) changes threaten the ecosystem services of the vulnerable tropical afro-alpine vegetation. Several LUC change studies are available for the Ethiopian highlands, but relatively little is known about LUC change in the afro-alpine zones. In this study, LUC changes between 1964 and 2012 were mapped for the afro-alpine zone of Lib Amba Mountain, part of the Abune Yosef Mountains in North Ethiopia. Historical LUC was derived from georeferenced aerial photographs of 1964 and 1982, and the present LUC (2012) from Bing Map satellite imagery. Based on these successive LUC maps a time-depth map, LUC proportions, LUC transition matrices and LUC change trajectories were calculated. Two main phases of LUC change could be distinguished linked to the neo-Boserupian perspective. (i) Between 1964 and 1982, there were large-scale deforestation and general degradation of the vegetation above 3500m, in a period of low population pressure; (ii) Between 1982 and 2012, an intensification of land use prevailed accompanied with a slight regeneration of the vegetation and the Erica arborea L. forest, under increased population pressure. Depth interviews indicated that local and governmental land management measures are very important for the protection against vegetation depletion and soil degradation. Quick recovery of the forest on Lib Amba provides confidence that degraded afro-alpine areas would benefit in a short time from complete protection, given the vicinity of remaining patches of afro-alpine vegetation. Management interventions are thus vital to restore the important ecosystem services of the afro-alpine vegetation belt. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Spatial Lag Effect Of Aridity And Nitrogen Deposition On Scots Pine (Pinus Sylvestris L.) Damage
AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a widespread tolerant forest tree-species; however, its adaptability to environmental change differs among sites with various buffering capacity. In this study, we compared the spatial effects of aridity index (AI) and nitrogen deposition (ND) on biomass density in natural and man-made pine stands of differing soil fertility using geographically weighted multiple lag regression. Soil fertility was defined using soil series as zonal trophic (27.9\%), acidic (48.2\%), gleyed (15.2\%) and as azonal exposed (2.5\%), maple (2.4\%), ash (0.8\%), wet (2.1\%) and peat (0.9\%) under pine stands in the Czech Republic (Central Europe; 4290.5 km(2); 130-1298 m a.s.l.). Annual AI and ND in every pine stand were estimated by intersection between raster and vector from 1 x 1 km grid for years 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010 of severe non-specific forest damage spread. Biomass density was obtained from a MODIS 250 x 250 m raster using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for years 2000-2015, with a decrease in EVI indicating non-specific damage. Environmental change was assessed by comparing predictor values at EVI time t and t+lambda. Non-specific damage was registered over 51.9\% of total forest area. Less than 8.8\% of damaged stands were natural and the rest (91.2\%) of damaged stands were man-made. Pure pine stands were more damaged than mixed. The ND effect prevailed up to 2007, while AI dominated later. Temporal increasing ND effect under AI effectiveness led to the most significant pine stand damage in 2008 and 2014. Predictors from 2000 to 2007 afflicted 58.5\% of non-specifically damaged stands at R-2 0.09-0.76 (median 0.38), but from 2000 to 2010 afflicted 57.1\% of the stands at R-2 0.16-0.75 (median 0.40). The most damaged stands occurred on acidic sites. Mixed forest and sustainable management on natural sites seem as effective remediation reducing damage by ND. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Modelling Of Potential Recharge Zone Using Geographical Information System Based On Indonesia Regulation And Water Balance Model
AB  - Recharge zone is an important aspect for sustainable water resources management. Recharge are difficult to measure directly and the field-based methods are time consuming, expensive, and require large number of skilled manpower. Application of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) has wide application and good result in delineating recharge zone and various other fields. The present study aim to delineating potential recharge zone using GIS based on Indonesia Regulation with comparison of water balance modelling (NRECA and FJ Mock) in Cisadane watershed Indonesia. Water balance model is used for generating rainfall data into monthly discharge (base flow and direct runoff) with validation of 3 discharge station (Genteng, Batubeulah and Serpong) as representative of upstream, middle and downstream of Cisadane watershed. Rainfall is a dynamic and sensitive factor for generating potential recharge zone, there is a significant changing of potential recharge zone between using 3 parameters and 4 parameters, potential recharge zone can increase or decrease based on annual rainfall. The accuracy of NRECA and FJ Mock model and result fairly good validation with acceptable NSE (0.52-0.61) and R values (0.76-0.87). Potential recharge zone map using 4 parameters (land use, slope, soil and rainfall) is suitable with the results of baseflow percentage of NRECA and FJ Mock model. Cisadane watershed is dominated by medium (33.62\%) to high potential recharge (55.49\%).

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation Of Soil Moisture Content In Croplands: A Case Study In Golestan Province, North Of Iran
AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays a critical role in soil science via its influences on agriculture, water resources management, and climate conditions. There is broad interest in finding relationships between groundwater recharge, soil characteristics, and plant properties for the quantification of SMC. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of optical satellite imagery for estimating the SMC over cropland areas. For this purpose, we collected 394 soil samples as targets in Gonbad-e Kavus in the Golestan province in the north of Iran, where a variety of crop types are cultivated. As input data, we first computed several spectral indices from Sentinel 2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) images, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI), and then analyzed their relationships with surveyed SMC using four machine learning regression algorithms: random forests (RFs), XGBoost, extra tree decision (EDT), and support vector machine (SVM). Results revealed a high and rather similar correlation between the spectral indices and measured SMC values for both S2 and L8 data. The EDT regression algorithm yielded the highest accuracy, with an R-2 = 0.82, MAE = 3.74, and RMSE = 1.08 for S2 and R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 2.42, and MAE = 1.08 for L8 images. Results also revealed that MNDWI, NDWI, and NDSI responded most sensitively to SMC estimation.

TI  - Redd+ Implementation In A High Forest Low Deforestation Area: Constraints On Monitoring Forest Carbon Emissions
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+), is still a promising mechanism of the UNFCCC for many tropical countries that would like to receive a fair financial compensation for their historical and current efforts to avoid forest conversion at the expense of more economically land uses. Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD+ not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km2) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system “PRODES”. However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapá which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD+ strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the on-going REDD+ design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985–2008); b) estimated CO2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD+ implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapá has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD+ mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD+ implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD+ to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Satellite Estimation Of Coastal PCo2 And Air-Sea Flux Of Carbon Dioxide In The Northern Gulf Of Mexico
AB  - Satellite approaches for estimation of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and air-sea flux of CO2 in coastal regions offer the potential to reduce uncertainties in coastal carbon budgets and improve understanding of spatial and temporal patterns and the factors influencing them. We used satellite-derived products in combination with an extensive data set of ship-based observations to develop an unprecedented multi-year time-series of pCO(2) and air-sea flux of CO2 in the northern Gulf of Mexico for the period 2006-2010. A regression tree algorithm was used to relate satellite-derived products for chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and dissolved and detrital organic matter to ship observations of pCO(2). The resulting relationship had an r(2) of 0.827 and a prediction error of 31.7 mu atm pCO(2) (root mean-squared error of the relationship was 28.8 mu atm). Using a wind speed and gas exchange relationship along with satellite winds, estimates of air-sea flux of CO2 were derived yielding an average annual flux over the period 2006-2010 of -0.8 to -1.5 (annual mean = -1.1 +/- 0.3) mol C m(-2) y(-1), where the negative value indicates net ocean uptake. The estimated total annual CO2 flux for the study region was -4.3 + 1.1 Tg C y(-1) Relationships of satellite-derived pCO(2) with salinity were consistent with shipboard observations and exhibited a concave relationship with low values at mid- and low salinities attributed to strong biological drawdown of CO2 in the high productivity river-mixing zone. The time-series of satellite-derived pCO(2) was characterized by a seasonal pattern with values lower during winter and spring, low to intermediate values during fall, and higher and more variable values during summer. These findings were similar to simulations from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. A seasonal pattern was also evident in the air-sea flux of CO2 with generally more negative fluxes (i.e., ocean uptake) during winter and spring, and positive fluxes during summer months with fall being a period of transition. Interannual variations in annual means of both air-sea flux of CO2 and DIN loading were significant, with higher DIN loading coinciding in some cases with more negative air-sea flux of CO2 (i.e., net ocean uptake). Spatial patterns of pCO(2) reflected regional environmental forcing including effects of river discharge, wind forcing, and shelf-slope circulation. Our study also illustrates the utility of satellite extrapolation for highlighting areas that may contribute significantly to regional signals and for guiding prioritization of locations for acquiring further observations. The approach should be readily applicable to other regions given adequate availability of in situ observations for algorithm development.

TI  - A Soft-Input Soft-Output Polar Decoding Algorithm For Turbo-Detection In Mimo-Aided 5g New Radio
AB  - Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) polar decoding algorithms, such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Soft Cancellation (SCAN) polar decoding, offer iteration capability for facilitating turbo-style detection. However, at lower Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), the performance of the BP and SCAN decoders is about 1.5 dB and 0.5 dB worse than that of the state-of-the-art hard-decision Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding algorithm, respectively, despite iteratively exchanging information with a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) detector. Motivated by this gap, we conceive a novel G-SCAN polar decoder, which generates both soft-decision and hard-decision outputs. This is achieved by intrinsically amalgamating a list decoder with a novel SISO decoder. These soft-decision outputs may be used for turbo-detection, but they also support the hard-decision outputs of the SCL algorithm for achieving superior block error rate (BLER) performance. As a result of these benefits, the proposed G-SCAN algorithm using a list size of L = 2 offers around 1 dB BLER gain compared to the conventional hard-decision SCL decoder relying on L = 32. Furthermore, we have carried out its Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis, and characterized the performance vs. the complexity of the proposed G-SCAN algorithm, and compared it to various soft-and hard-decision output benchmarks for a wide variety of different rate-matching modes and block lengths. Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm, a novel Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided G-SCAN algorithm is also proposed, which facilitates early termination and improves the BLER performance. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Drought Disaster Monitoring Using Modis Derived Index For Drought Years: A Space-Based Information For Ecosystems And Environmental Conservation
AB  - Drought disaster is one of the major factors restricting the development of vegetation across a wide variety of environments. Monitoring the temporal and spatial dynamics of drought episodes in the study area is crucial for environmental and ecosystem conservation. This study assesses drought disaster by utilising space-based data and R programming for drought years 2003, 2007, 2012 and 2019 in the Free State Province, South Africa. Results revealed that the study area witnessed drought events in the year 2003 where March, August, September, October, November and December were more affected by drought disaster events. It was further observed that February and March were affected by extreme drought conditions in the year 2007. In year 2012, January, October, November and December, there exist moderate to severe drought conditions in the study area where some regions were more affected than the other. Finally, year 2019 witnessed variations in drought event distributions across the months with January, October and November witnessing severe to extreme drought conditions from about 0 to 30\% drought values. Overall, this study shows that the 16-day Terra-MODIS composite and EVI products are sensitive to stressors associated with drought. The Vegetation Condition Monitoring Index (VCI) based on MODIS is suited for monitoring drought disasters. The technique used in this study revealed the suitability of MODIS data for assessing drought conditions and their potential environmental impacts.

TI  - Impact Of Management Modes On Ecosystem Service Values: A Case Study In Fujin City, Northeast China
AB  - Different management modes can influence land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC), resulting in changes in ecosystem service values (ESV). However, few studies compared the differences in ESV under different management modes. The objective was to analyze the impact of different management modes on ESV. Multisource remote sensing images were used to obtain the LULCC data for Fujin City over four periods (1986, 1995, 2005, and 2015). We modified the equivalent value factors method by crop yield to estimate the ESV in different years. Statistics show that paddy increased from 59.2 to 1341.8 km(2) in the agricultural region, whereas it increased from 60.1 to 2236.3 km(2) in the reclamation region during 1986 to 2015. The total ESV decreased by 49.0\% and 43.4\%, respectively, in the agricultural region and reclamation region. The agricultural products function exhibited a larger increase and the freshwater supply function exhibited a greater decrease in the reclamation region than in the agricultural region. Two regions can learn from each other and carry out innovations in land management approaches to promote common developmental goals. (C) 2018 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Effectiveness Of Using Vegetation Index To Delineate Zones Of Different Soil And Crop Grain Production Characteristics
AB  - Cost-effective methods to map differences in productivity across fields have potential application for site-specific management of fertilizer and pesticides. In this study, zones were delineated for a field with hummocky topography in southwestern Saskatchewan by clustering, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat TM information. Zones uniqueness were confirmed if zones differed in grain yield. Two different zones were delineated in the field. These zones had significant (P < 0.05) differences in soil factors related to productivity: average solum depth, spring soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and spring soil moisture. Over 4 yr, the two zones also had different spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield and protein content. The yield response to N-P fertilizer blend within each zone was different with no significant response to N-P fertilizer in the zone with higher NDVI values versus a significant response to N-P in the zone with lower NDVI. The results indicate a potential economic advantage to reducing fertilizer application to the zone without fertilizer response. Further, the residual soil NO3-N in the zone without fertilizer response was positively correlated with N application in the previous year. Therefore, there is a potential environmental benefit to reducing fertilizer application to that zone to decrease residual NO3-N, which can leach and contaminate ground water or can be denitrified to the greenhouse gas, N2O. Hence, this relatively simple and low-cost method of zone delineation has potential practical application to realize economic and environmental benefits from site-specific management of fertilizer.

TI  - Satellite And Aerial Remote Sensing In Disaster Management: An Introduction
AB  - Increasing global population escalated anthropogenic activities. Widespread undesired transformations are observed in the land system. Undue land transformations triggered frequent extreme weather events. Increasing extreme weather events is an indicator of climate change. Climate change disasters inflicted unprecedented infrastructural and human losses across the globe. It is essential to formulate and develop frameworks for effective monitoring of natural disasters. Appropriate and effective technology intervention is required for mitigating disaster risks. This chapter aims to explain the complexities and uncertainties of natural disasters. A conceptual disaster risk reduction framework is also provided in the proposed chapter. It may help in demonstrating the utility of proposed method to address the challenges of disaster management. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial Patterns Of Wilting In Sugar Beet As An Indicator For Precision Irrigation
AB  - Precision irrigation requires the mapping of within-field variations of water requirement. Conventional remote sensing techniques provide estimates of water status at only shallow soil depths. The ability of a water sensitive crop, sugar beet, to act as an intermediate sensor providing an integrated measure of water status throughout its rooting depth is tested here. Archive aerial photographs and satellite imagery of Eastern England show crop patterns resulting from past periglacial processes. The patterns were found to be spatially and temporally consistent. Field sampling of soil cores to 1 m depth established that the within-field wilting zones were significantly associated with coarser or shallow soils. The stress classes, determined by classification of the digitised images, were weakly correlated with total available water (Pearson correlation r=0.588,P<0.05).These results suggest that wilting in sugar beet can be used as an intermediate sensor for quantifying potential soil water availability within the root zone. Within-field stress maps generated in 1 year could be applied as a strategic tool allowing precision irrigation to be applied to high-value crops in following years, helping to make more sustainable use of water resources. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Quantum Svr For Chlorophyll Concentration Estimation In Water With Remote Sensing
AB  - The increasing availability of quantum computers motivates researching their potential capabilities in enhancing the performance of data analysis algorithms. Similarly, as in other research communities, also in remote sensing (RS), it is not yet defined how its applications can benefit from the usage of quantum computing (QC). This letter proposes a formulation of the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm that can be executed by D-Wave quantum computers. Specifically, the SVR is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that is solved with quantum annealing (QA). The algorithm is tested on two different types of computing environments offered by D-Wave: the advantage system, which directly embeds the problem into the quantum processing unit (QPU), and a hybrid solver that employs both classical and QC resources. For the evaluation, we considered a biophysical variable estimation problem with RS data. The experimental results show that the proposed quantum SVR implementation can achieve comparable or, in some cases, better results than the classical implementation. This work is one of the first attempts to provide insight into how QA could be exploited and integrated in future RS workflows based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Trade-Offs Among Ecosystem Services In Coastal Wetlands Under The Effects Of Reclamation Activities
AB  - In recent years, unsustainable reclamation activities have damaged coastal ecosystems and degraded ecosystem services, as a result, management of coastal wetland ecosystem services has received increasing attention. Because different ecosystem services respond differently to management, there are inevitable trade-offs among some of these services, and understanding these trade-offs has gradually become a research hotspot. As the research on trade-offs has deepened, it has become possible to quantify them. Based on the interpretation of remote sensing and socioeconomic data for the Yellow River Delta's coastal wetlands since 1989, the InVEST model was used to evaluate the spatial patterns and dynamic evolution of coastal wetland ecosystem services and the trade-offs among them. Production possibility frontier curves were then selected to identify optimal combinations of ecosystem service values; a trade-off intensity index was constructed to quantify the magnitude of the trade-offs, and the effects of reclamation activities on the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services were analyzed. A trade-off existed between material production and habitat quality from 1989 to 2015, and its intensity increased yearly. In addition, the relationship between carbon storage and material production transformed from a synergy into a trade-off in 2008, although the strength of the trade-off has been increasing since then. The results of our study will provide a scientific basis for improving wetland management and ecological restoration by alerting managers to the need to mitigate the tradeoffs.

TI  - Assessment Of The Spatial And Temporal Patterns Of Cover Crops Using Remote Sensing
AB  - Cover cropping is a conservation practice that helps to alleviate soil health problems and reduce nutrient losses. Understanding the spatial variability in historic and current adoption of cover cropping practices and their impacts on soil, water, and nutrient dynamics at a landscape scale is an important step in determining and prioritizing areas in a watershed to effectively utilize this practice. However, such data are lacking. Our objective was to develop a spatial and temporal inventory of winter cover cropping practices in the Maumee River watershed using images collected by Landsat satellites (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) from 2008 to 2019 in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Each year, satellite images collected during cover crop growing season (i.e., between October and April) were converted into two seasonal composites based on cover crop phenology. Using these composites, various image-based covariates were extracted for 628 ground-truth (field) data. By integrating ground-truth and image-based covariates, a cover crop classification model based on a random forest (RF) algorithm was developed, trained and validated in GEE platform. Our classification scheme differentiated four cover crop categories: Winter Hardy, Winter Kill, Spring Emergent, and No Cover. The overall classification accuracy was 75%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.63. The results showed that more than 50% of the corn-soybean areas in the Maumee River watershed were without winter crops during 2008–2019 period. It was found that 2019/2020 and 2009/2010 were the years with the largest and lowest cover crop areas, with 34% and 10% in the watershed, respectively. The total cover cropping area was then assessed in relation to fall precipitation and cumulative growing degree days (GDD). There was no apparent increasing trend in cover crop areas between 2008 and 2019, but the variability in cover crops areas was found to be related to higher accumulated GDD and fall precipitation. A detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of cover crops using GEE could help in promoting site-specific management practices to enhance their environmental benefits. This also has significance to policy makers and funding agencies as they could use the information to localize areas in need of interventions for supporting adoption of cover cropping practice. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Patterns And Controls Of Terrestrial Primary Production In A Changing World
AB  - Primary production is the process by which solar energy is converted to chemical energy by autotrophic organisms, primarily green plants on land, providing the energy available to power earth's ecosystems. In this process atmospheric CO2 is incorporated into organic matter, thereby playing a dominant role in the global carbon cycle with crucial implications for global climate change. Net primary production (NPP) is the amount of fixed energy or organic matter left over after the plants have met their own respiratory needs and represents the amount of energy available to the consumers, including humans. Across the earth's terrestrial biomes, a large range of NPP is observed with the highest values in tropical forests and wetlands, intermediate values in temperate forests and grasslands, and lowest in extremely cold or dry deserts. Accurate measurement of NPP is challenging despite the simple concept that it represents the amount of new biomass added to the plants in a given time period. This is because a significant and highly variable proportion of NPP is lost from the plants by processes such as herbivory, volatilization, and carbon flux to the soil. Methods of measuring NPP are diverse, being dependent on the structure and dynamics of the vegetation. For example, harvest methods in which the aboveground tissues are periodically clipped from quadrats of known area can be effective for quantifying aboveground NPP in herbaceous vegetation (e.g., grasslands), whereas in woody vegetation, the growth of woody tissues must also be measured. Moreover, measurements of total NPP in terrestrial ecosystems must account for root growth which can be very challenging. As a result, reliable estimates of total NPP are few. Plants allocate a large proportion of their fixed energy to their root systems to fuel additional root growth and to meet their respiratory needs. The proportion of total NPP that goes to belowground NPP ranges from about 25 % to over 50 % and is higher in ecosystems where the degree of limitation by soil resources is greater, i.e., dry or nutrient-poor sites. Surprisingly, over 10 % of NPP is contributed by plants to the soil in the form of rhizosphere carbon flux including exudation, rhizodeposition, and allocation to mycorrhizal fungi and other symbionts. Variation in NPP results from differences among ecosystems in the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaching the plant canopy, the amount of that PAR absorbed by the foliage (APAR), the biochemical efficiency of the plants under optimal environmental conditions, and the degree to which actual conditions are less than optimal. The APAR depends in part on the amount of foliage surface area per unit ground area (leaf area index - LAI) which ranges from less than 1 in dry or infertile sites to over 10 in some resource-rich forests. Large-scale monitoring of estimated NPP is possible using satellite imagery of reflected solar radiation that can be converted into vegetation LAI and combined with environmental measurements that indicate the degree of stress reduction to photosynthetic activity. Four principal abiotic factors usually limit the amount of NPP on land - light, water, temperature, and mineral nutrients - and all these abiotic factors are changing rapidly as a result of human activity, with highly uncertain implications for global and local NPP. Commonly, two or more of these abiotic factors concurrently or sequentially limit NPP, but water deficit is arguably the most widespread single factor constraining global NPP. The effect of temperature on NPP is most closely related to subfreezing conditions that limit the length of the growing season in temperate and high-latitude environments. Nitrogen is the most important limiting mineral nutrient in most ecosystems, although in highly weathered tropical soils where nitrogen-fixing organisms are abundant, phosphorus may be the most limiting nutrient. Biotic factors can play a key role in regulating NPP so that human activities such as vegetation management and introduction of exotic species will exert a major influence on future patterns of NPP. The effects of biodiversity on NPP have proven difficult to establish, but experimental tests suggest that loss of species can reduce NPP particularly if a dominant species is lost or when species numbers become very low, diminishing complementarity in resource use by coexisting species. Dramatic shifts in plant community structure, for example, the ongoing invasion of grassland vegetation by woody plants, can cause changes in NPP that appear to depend in part on climate. Consumption of plant tissues by herbivores often can have a negative effect on NPP, but in many grasslands, compensatory growth responses to herbivory can result in no reduction in NPP or in some cases even stimulation of NPP by herbivory. Temporal variation in NPP results from interannual variation in both environmental and biotic factors as well as pulse disturbance events that can reset the successional clock. The response of NPP to interannual variation in rainfall seems to be greatest in semiarid and subhumid environments where average precipitation is sufficient to sustain highly productive communities (vs. true deserts). Following natural or human disturbances, forests exhibit a recurring pattern in which NPP peaks after a few decades of stand development, followed by a decline with age in older stands. Global environmental changes - climate, atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deposition, exotic species introductions, etc. - are certain to exert a major influence on global NPP in the future, but the outcomes are highly uncertain because of the complex ways in which all these changes interact with one another to influence the vegetation and NPP. For example, CO2 enrichment experiments indicate that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration can significantly stimulate NPP in young forests, but the effect may be transient because of progressively greater stress by mineral nutrients - unless high N deposition overcomes this limitation. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

TI  - Comparison Of Gpm Imerg Version 06 Final Run Products And Its Latest Version 07 Precipitation Products Across Scales: Similarities, Differences And Improvements
AB  - Precipitation is an essential element in earth system research, which greatly benefits from the emergence of Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs). Therefore, assessment of the accuracy of the SPPs is necessary both scientifically and practically. The Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is one of the most widely used SPPs in the scientific community. However, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation for the performance of the newly released IMERG Version 07, which is essential for determining its effectiveness and reliability in precipitation estimation. In this study, we compare the IMERG V07 Final Run (V07\_FR) with its predecessor IMERG V06\_FR across scales from January 2016 to December 2020 over the globe (cross-compare their similarities and differences) and a focused study on mainland China (validate against 2481 rain gauges). The results show that: (1) Globally, the annual mean precipitation of V07\_FR increases 2.2\% compared to V06\_FR over land but decreases 5.8\% over the ocean. The two SPPs further exhibit great differences as indicated by the Critical Success Index (CSI = 0.64) and the Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD = 3.42 mm/day) as compared to V06\_FR to V07\_FR. (2) Over mainland China, V06\_FR and V07\_FR detect comparable precipitation annually. However, the Probability of Detection (POD) improves by 5.0\%, and the RMSD decreases by 3.7\% when analyzed by grid cells. Further, the POD (+0\%similar to+6.1\%) and CSI (+0\%similar to+8.8\%) increase and the RMSD (-11.1\%similar to 0\%) decreases regardless of the sub-regions. (3) Under extreme rainfall rates, V07\_FR measures 4.5\% lower extreme rainfall rates than V06\_FR across mainland China. But V07\_FR tends to detect more accurate extreme precipitation at both daily and event scales. These results can be of value for further SPP development, application in climatological and hydrological modeling, and risk analysis.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Single Tree Data Enable The Determination Of Habitat Thresholds For The Three-Toed Woodpecker (Picoides Tridactylus)
AB  - Forest biodiversity conservation requires precise, area-wide information on the abundance and distribution of key habitat structures at multiple spatial scales. We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns And Accessibility Of Green Spaces In Kumasi, Ghana
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) are a central part of cities and offer multiple ecological and social benefits necessary for a higher quality of life of inhabitants. However, rapid unguided urban growth together with planning policies on rezoning can lead to transformation of UGS to commercial, residential, and other uses. These processes of land use change result in inequities in the distribution of UGS in the city. Yet, data and metrics that capture changes in the geography of UGS is scarce within African cities. This paper addresses this need by examining the spatio-temporal geography of UGS at the neighborhood-scale in Kumasi, the next biggest city in Ghana. Five (5) UGS distribution indicators were computed from remote sensing data for 2013 and 2020 and compared across neighborhoods. Further, a GIS network analysis method was deployed to analyse access to parks in Kumasi. The results showed that between 2013 and 2020, green spaces in Kumasi became fragmented and disconnected despite a slight increase in quantity. The level of UGS fragmentation was found to significantly vary among the neighborhoods. Fragmentation and depletion in UGS were profound at the outskirts of Kumasi while majority of the population cannot access the nearest park under 30-min’ walk. These findings contribute to a complete and holistic understanding of the distribution and accessibility of UGS at the neighborhood level in cities and disparities in UGS exposure in the Global South. The findings provide important insights for urban policies while the data and methods serve as blueprints for local authorities, particularly in Ghana to track their progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11, target 7. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Built Environment And Its Influences On Walking Among Older Women: Use Of Standardized Geographic Units To Define Urban Forms
AB  - Consensus is lacking on specific and policy-relevant measures of neighborhood attributes that may affect health outcomes. To address this limitation, we created small standardized geographic units measuring the transit, commercial, and park area access, intersection, and population density for the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Cluster analysis was used to identify six unique urban forms: central city, city periphery, suburb, urban fringe with poor commercial access, urban fringe with pool park access, and satellite city. The urban form information was linkable to the detailed physical activity, health, and socio-demographic data of 2,005 older women without the use of administrative boundaries. Evaluation of the relationship between urban forms and walking behavior indicates that older women residing in city center were more likely to walk than those living in city periphery, suburb communities, and urban fringe with poor commercial access; however, these women were not significantly more likely to walk compared to those residing in urban fringe with poor park access or satellite city. Utility of small standardized geographic units and clusters to measure and define built environment support research investigating the impact of built environment and health. The findings may inform environmental/policy interventions that shape communities and promote active living.

TI  - Methodological Approach For The Study Of Historical Centres Of High Architectural Value Affected By Geo‐Hydrological Hazards: The Case Of Lanciano (Abruzzo Region—Central Italy)
AB  - The study of geo‐hydrological problems in urban contexts of considerable historical importance plays an extremely interesting role in the safeguarding of architectural and artistic assets of great value. The need to guarantee the conservation of monumental heritage is an ethical and moral requirement that new generations have a duty to support. Operating in urbanised contexts is extremely difficult, due to the presence of infrastructures and underground services that prevent the execution of classical surveys and prospecting. The technologies currently available, however, allow us to also investigate the subsoil in a non‐destructive way and to control the evolution of active natural phenomena in a continuous and automated way with remote‐sensing techniques. The methodological approach consists of the development of a series of cognitive investigations, aimed at identifying the elements of weakness of the soil system, so as to be able to subsequently undertake the most appropriate decisions for the reduction of geo‐hydrological risks. The case here analysed concerns Lanciano city (Central Italy), famous for its pre‐Roman origins, that was affected by a violent storm in the summer of 2018. This event devastated the inhabited Centre with flooding of all the neighbourhoods and the collapse of parts of buildings. For this reason, direct and indirect geognostic investigations were carried out within the Historical Centre, which is of considerable architectural value, and an important monitoring system was installed. The actual geo‐hydrological hazard was planned using 3D numerical modelling to define the hydraulic and deformational behaviour of the subsoil. Comparison between the modelling performed and the monitoring data acquired has allowed us to understand the complex behaviour of the subsoil and the subsidence mechanisms of the Historic Centre. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - An Exploration Of Spatial Human Health Risk Assessment Of Soil Toxic Metals Under Different Land Uses Using Sequential Indicator Simulation
AB  - A modified method was proposed which integrates the spatial patterns of toxic metals simulated by sequential indicator simulation, different exposure models and local current land uses extracted by remote-sensing software into a dose-response model for human health risk assessment of toxic metals. A total of 156 soil samples with. a various land uses containing farm land (F1-F25), forest land (W1-W12) and residential land (U1-U15) were collected in a grid pattern throughout Xiandao District (XDD), Hunan Province, China. The total Cr and Pb in topsoil were analyzed. Compared with Hunan soil background values, the elevated concentrations of Cr were mainly located in the east of XDD, and the elevated concentrations of Pb were scattered in the areas around F1, F6, F8, F13, F14, U5, U14, W2 and W11. For non-carcinogenic effects, the hazard index (HI) of Cr and Pb overall the XDD did not exceed the accepted level to adults. While to children, Cr and Pb exhibited HI higher than the accepted level around some areas. The assessment results indicated Cr and Pb should be regarded as the priority pollutants of concern in XDD. The first priority areas of concern were identified in region A with a high probability ( > 0.95) of risk in excess of the accepted level for Cr and Pb. The areas with probability of risk between 0.85 and 0.95 in region A were identified to be the secondary priority areas for Cr and Pb. The modified method was proved useful due to its improvement on previous studies and calculating a more realistic human health risk, thus reducing the probability of excessive environmental management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations Of Agricultural Water Use Efficiency And Its Response To The Grain To Green Program During 1982–2015 In The Chinese Loess Plateau
AB  - The interaction between agricultural water use efficiency (WUEc) and change in vegetation dynamics (mainly crops coverage) was analyzed to assess the ecological effect of the implementation of China's Grain to Green Program (GGP) and to further analyze the impact of the policy on agriculture on a long-term scale from an ecosystem perspective. Remote sensing data (e.g., gross primary productivity, GPP; evapotranspiration, ET; and the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of WUEc in the Loess Plateau during three periods: 1982–2015, 1982–2001, and 2001–2015. The results indicated that, first, the average and the trend of WUEc showed strong spatial heterogeneity over 1982–2015, a period that shows a strip distribution. The average value increased from the northwest to the southeast while the multiyear trend value decreased from the northwest to the southeast, and a positive slope prevailed (p < 0.05). Second, statistically significant positive trends (p < 0.001) in the annual mean WUEc for 1982–2015, with a value of 7.11 × 10−3 g C kg−1 H2O yr−1, indicate that the rate of carbon sequestration in the agricultural ecosystem was faster than that of water loss. Finally, the GGP was conducive to the improvement of WUEc in this arid and semiarid area, with interannual trend values of WUEc from 1982 to 2001 of 4.26 × 10−3 g C kg−1 H2O, and 9.88 × 10−3 g C kg−1 H2O (p < 0.05) after the GGP. Our analyses explored how the changes in WUEc after the GGP were more sensitive to the NDVIc (the subscript c stands for cropland) trends, which means that NDVIc was an important controller influencing GPPc and ETc tendency and thus further influencing WUEc in response to the GGP. This study contributes to a better understanding of the variations of agricultural carbon-water coupling and provides references and theories for the development of water-saving agriculture in an ecological restoration area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring Of Eco-Environmental Quality In Xi′An Based On Gee And Adjusted Rsei
AB  - As the capital city of Shaanxi Province, Xi′an has experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization under the economic globalization background in recent decades and still besets by increasingly prominent ecological problems. Xi′an is also one of the typical cities suffering from severe aerosol pollution in China. Rapidly and comprehensively quantitative monitoring of the spatio-temporal variations of eco-environmental quality in Xi′an is crucial for regional eco-environmental guidance and protection. This study was carried out on Google Earth Engine (GEE), a new cloud-computing platform with the merits of easy access to tremendous public resources and convenient processing of substantially geospatial data. Four-season Landsat images of 2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, 2020 and those previous-successive target years were selected firstly. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to improve the previously developed remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) by adding aerosol optical depth (AOD) to it, and an adjusted RSEI (ARSEI) including greenness (NDVI), heat (LST), dryness (NDSI), humidity (Wet) and AOD was proposed to dynamically monitor the eco-environmental quality in Xi′an from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, Moran index was adopted to explore the spatial autocorrelation of the eco-environmental quality in Xi′an. Using summer, the season with the best principal component effect, as an example, the results showed that: (1) taking the effect of air pollution into account, the first principal component (PC1) contribution of ARSEI proposed in this paper was more than 83%. ARSEI could better concentrate the characteristics of each index and provide a more comprehensive evaluation for the eco-environmental quality of Xi′an. (2) The average ARSEIs of Xi′an from 2000 to 2020 were 0. 565, 0. 521,0. 572, 0. 644 and 0. 695, respectively, indicating that the urban eco-environmental quality degraded from 2000 to 2004 and promoted from 2004 to 2020. In the past 20 years, the areas with poor and very poor eco-environmental quality decreased by 1339.08 km2, which were mainly located in the north of Qinling Mountains. The areas with good and excellent eco-environmental quality increased by 2241. 80 km2 and were concentrated in Qinling areas, southern part of the city. (3) The improved areas were larger than the degraded areas in Xi′an over the past 20 years, and each district has undergone both the improvement and degradation processes. It was worth noting that the city experienced the worst degradation from 2000 to 2004, accounting for 29.41%, and the greatest improvement between 2010 and 2015, accounting for 31.62%. Generally speaking, the eco-environmental quality of Xi′an has been improved in the past 20 years. (4) All the five Global Moran′s I values were above 0.627 in 2000, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2020, which indicated that the spatial distribution of the urban eco-environmental quality has a strongly positive correlation. The LISA cluster map showed that the aggregation distribution was dominated by high-high and low-low patterns. The low-low areas were mainly located in the northern Qinling Mountains, while the high-high areas were concentrated in the southern part of the city. Based on GEE cloud platform, this study accomplished fast eco-environmental quality monitoring in Xi′ an and will provide method reference and data support for regional eco-environmental monitoring, management and restoration. © 2023 Science Press.

TI  - Earthquake-Induced Change Detection In The 2003 Bam, Iran, Earthquake By Complex Analysis Using Envisat Asar Data
AB  - The recently deployed Envisat satellite collected before- and after-event imagery on the Bam, Iran, earthquake that occurred on 26 December 2003. The majority of buildings in Bam were traditional one-story unreinforced adobe structures constructed of the indigenous land material of the region. As a result, the corresponding SAR imagery for Bam reflects less material dependence on object detection. For this study, two sets of before and after SAR data are used from theASAR sensor onboard of the Envisat platform. The backscattering, complex coherence, self-power and cross-power values are computed for each respective co-registered data pairs. The change detection scheme evaluates these results using orbital information to assess the levels of change in different city zones. Such damage maps can potentially serve in disaster response/management and also in estimating economic losses (Eguchi et al. 2000 ). Damage maps from field observations are used to validate these findings.

TI  - Dataset On The Global Distribution Of Shallow Groundwater
AB  - Shallow groundwater (GW), defined as the water table of unconfined or perched aquifers that is near enough to the land surface to influence the vadose zone and the surface soil moisture, impacts land surface water, energy, and car -bon cycles by providing additional moisture to the root zone via capillary fluxes. Although the interactions of shallow GW and the terrestrial land surface are widely recognized, in-corporating shallow GW into the land surface, climate, and agroecosystem models is not yet possible due to the lack of groundwater data. Groundwater systems are affected by var-ious factors, including climate, land use/land cover, ecosys-tems, GW extractions, and lithology. Although GW wells are the most direct and accurate way of monitoring water table depths at point scales, upscaling GW levels from point scale to areal or regional scale poses significant challenges. Here, we provide high spatiotemporal resolution global maps of the terrestrial land surface areas influenced by shallow GW from mid-2015 to 2021 (a separate NetCDF file for each year) in a 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution. We derived this data from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission spaceborne soil moisture observations with a temporal resolution of 3 days and approximately 9 km grid resolution. This spatial scale corresponds to SMAP's "Equal Area Scalable Earth " (EASE) grids. The central assumption is that the monthly moving average of soil moisture observa-tions and their coefficient of variation are sensitive to shal-low GW regardless of the prevailing climate. We process the Level-2 enhanced passive soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP\_E) product to detect shallow GW signals. The presence of shal-low GW data is calculated by an ensemble machine learn-ing model, which is trained using simulations from a variably saturated soil moisture flow model (Hydrus-1D). The simula-tions span various climates, soil textures, and lower bound-ary conditions.The spatiotemporal distribution of shallow GW data based on SMAP soil moisture observations is provided for the first time with this dataset. The data are of value in a wide variety of applications. The most direct use is in climate and land sur-face models as lower boundary conditions or as a diagnostic tool to verify model results. Some other applications may in-clude flood risk analyses and regulation, identifying geotech-nical issues such as shallow GW-triggered liquefaction, global food security, ecosystem services, watershed management, crop yield, vegetation health, water storage trends, and track-ing mosquito-borne diseases by identifying wetlands, among other applications.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Evolving A Total-Evaluation Map Of Flash Flood Hazard For Hydro-Prioritization Based On Geohydromorphometric Parameters And Gis-Rs Manner In Al-Hussain River Basin, Tartous, Syria
AB  - Floods are one of the most severe hydrological hazards that cause an excessive threat to landscape stability, population welfare, infrastructure and spatial development in the Syrian coastal region. Al-Hussain river basin, like other Syrian coastal basins, is prone to a hazardous, frequent-flooding threat. However, investigating the probable areas of flooding risk is a difficult challenge that results from the almost complete absence of spatially distributed geo-hydrological measurements in Al-Hussain river basin. In this regard, geohydromorphometric parameters (Stream numberN(u), Stream lengthL(u), Bifurcation ratioR(b), Form factorF, Elongation ratioE(b), Drainage densityD(d), Stream frequencyF(s), Drainage textureT(d), Lemniscate ratioK, Compactness indexC, Circulatory ratioR(c), Ruggedness numberR(n), Basin reliefH(r), and Relief ratioR(r)) derived from remote sensing data in the GIS environment can provide a comprehensive and objective approach that can be utilized to map the spatial distribution of flood hazards at the level of delineated sub-basins. This being the case, the present research focuses on exploring the spatial distribution of flood risk in ten sub-basins belonging to Al-Hussain river basin by using spatial techniques tools in order to overall determine the hydro-prioritization of conservation. The geo-visualization map of generated flash flood susceptibility evaluates five degrees of the flood risk: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The flood risk map indicates that Qalea, and Talaa sub-basins have massive hydrodynamic risk, which, in turn, indicates the urgent need of soil and water maintaining measures. This hydrological dynamic in these sub-basins is explained by high values ofD(d),F,R-r,R-n,R-c, andK, respectively. Overall, the spatial outcomes of the current work successfully proved the efficiency of extracted geohydromorphometric layers from RS data in the context of the spatial assessment of flash flood hazard; they also ensure ecological sustainability and productivity of the study basin.

TI  - Investigation Of Groundwater Potential Using Geomatics And Geophysical Methods: Case Study Of The Anzi Sub-Basin, Western Anti-Atlas, Morocco
AB  - The mapping of water potential in arid regions holds crucial significance for the sustainable management of water resources in these vulnerable environments. The Anzi sub-basin in Morocco is confronted with water scarcity, presenting a significant challenge. The region's arid climate and limited accessibility to groundwater resources further exacerbate this scarcity, ultimately constraining the region's socioeconomic development, heavily reliant on agriculture. To address this issue, the current study employs mathematical modeling, specifically the frequency ratio (FR) method, and geomatics tools such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) to map and assess potential groundwater zones. The study considers multiple factors influencing water availability, including the density of drainage nodes, lineament density, permeability, slope, NDVI, curvature, distance to drainage, topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI), distance to lineament, and rainfall. The investigation identifies 45 wells, of which 70\% are used for model application and the remaining 30\% for validation. The model application results in the identification of five potential zones: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low, encompassing 3.97\%, 10.11\%, 23.38\%, 35.02\%, and 27.53\% of the total study area, respectively. Furthermore, the model's validity is confirmed through the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis, indicating a reliability value of 82.5\% for the FR method in mapping groundwater potential. These findings align with the results obtained from geo- physical prospecting in the region. Notably, the locations of high-flow wells generally correspond to moderately to highly conductive anomalies of resistivity, primarily attributed to the presence of quaternary formations, geological faults, and geophysically derived faults. These results are further validated by proton magnetic resonance surveys.(c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluation And Proposal Of Connectivity Of Remnant Fragments In The Campus Of Universidade Federal De Lavras, Minas Gerais
AB  - This paper mapped and characterized the forest remnants in the domain of UFLA and identified potentials corridors to improve the connectivity among them. The thematic map for the analyses was built using the SPRING 3.4 program considering aerial images (2001) and satellite images (Landsat 7, March of 2001). The fragments impacts were analyzed by the application of investigative questionnaires in order to record the past anthropogenic disturbances. The shrub-tree vegetation of the six main fragments was inventoried by the quadrants method, with the inclusion level considering trees with DBH higher or equal to 5.0 cm. The fragments I and IV were respectively the most disturbed fragments. According to the thematic map, the fragment I showed the smallest area, form index and core area, consequently, the largest edge effect. The fragment III showed the largest area, form index and core area and the smallest edge effect. Among the main impacts registered, the most important were garbage, external highways, trails and build constructions. In the six main fragments 544 individuals were registered, belonging to 48 families, 110 genera and 161 species. The largest diversity value was registered in the fragment III (3.917) and the smallest (2.135) in the fragment I. A low similarity was detected among the fragments. After the analysis of the results, the connectivity among the fragments was verified with the recovering of the areas of permanent preservation along the water streams and dams.

TI  - Reviewing The Oceanic Niño Index (Oni) To Enhance Societal Readiness For El Niño’s Impacts
AB  - NOAA’s Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) is used to record for historical purposes the occurrence and duration of El Niño episodes, based on the monitoring of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific Ocean. The ONI is used to identify the onset of an above average SST threshold that persists for several months, encompassing both the beginning and end of an El Niño episode. The first appearance of an anomalous seasonal value of 0.5 °C suggests with a high probability that an El Niño could emerge, but for heightened warnings, one must wait for several months. In this article, we proposed that the ONI value of 0.7 °C identifies a tipping point at which the El Niño event becomes locked in, which can provide additional lead time for mitigative actions to be taken by societal decision makers. Our preliminary findings suggest that a first appearance of 0.7 °C value could serve as a credible marker of El Niño’s locked-in phase, which can provide additional credibility to the current 0.5 °C El Niño onset indicator for at-risk societies to get ready for El Niño’s foreseeable societal and ecological impacts. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Multi-Model Rice Canopy Chlorophyll Content Inversion Based On Uav Hyperspectral Images
AB  - Rice is China's main crop and its output accounts for 30\% of the world's total annual rice production. Rice growth status is closely related to chlorophyll content (called Soil and Plant Analyzer Development (SPAD) values). The determination of a SPAD value is of great significance to the health status of rice, agricultural irrigation and regulated fertilization. The traditional SPAD value measurement method is not only time-consuming, laborious and expensive but also causes irreparable damage to vegetation. The main aim of the present study is to obtain a SPAD value through the inversion of hyperspectral remote sensing images. In order to achieve this purpose, the hyperspectral image of rice at different growth stages at the canopy scale was first acquired using a hyperspectral imaging instrument equipped with a drone; the spectral characteristics of the rice canopy at different growth stages were analyzed and combined with a ground-level measured SPAD value, the bands with high correlation between the SPAD values and the spectra of the rice canopy at different fertility stages were selected. Subsequently, we combined the spectral characteristics with the continuous projection algorithm to extract the characteristic band and used the PLS method in MATLAB software to analyze and calculate the weight of each type of spectral value and the corresponding canopy SPAD value; we then used the wavelength corresponding to the spectral value with the highest weight as the used band. Secondly, the four methods of univariate regression, partial least squares (PLS) regression, support vector machine (SVM) regression and back propagation (BP) neural network regression are integrated to establish the estimation model of the SPAD value of rice canopy. Finally, the models are used to map the SPAD values of the rice canopy. Research shows that the model with the highest decision coefficient among the four booting stage models is "booting stage-SVR" (R-2 = 0.6258), and the model with the highest decision coefficient among the four dairy maturity models is "milk-ripe stage-BP" (R-2 = 0.6716), all of which can meet the requirement of accurately retrieving the SPAD value of rice canopy. The above results can provide a technical reference for the accurate, rapid and non-destructive monitoring of chlorophyll content in rice leaves and provide a core band selection basis for large-scale hyperspectral remote sensing monitoring of rice.

TI  - Understanding The Changes Of Optically Active Substances (Oacs) In Hulun Lake In The Past 35 Years And Its Indication To The Degradation Of Aquatic Ecology
AB  - Lake eutrophication and ecological degradation are among the most serious environmental problems in the world and identifying changes in key water quality parameters and associated drivers is critical for lake management. Optically active substances (OACs) are important water quality indicators that affect lake water ecology and evaluate lake eutrophication. Climate change and human activities are important factors driving the changes of OACs in lakes. Understanding how and why OACs varies in long-term trend in response to different influencing factors and its driving mechanism is needed to understand. In this study, based on the Landsat series satellite data, this study investigated the historical changes of OACs in Hulun Lake, quantitatively explained the response relationship of OACs to meteorological, hydrological and human activity elements, and discussed their indicative role in the degradation of water ecology. The results showed that during 1986–2020, OACs had obvious periodic changes; from 1986 to 1999, Chla, CDOM and TSM are relatively stable at lower values; during 2000–2009, the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) increased, and the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chla) decreased; during 2010–2020 The annual TSM and CDOM concentration decreased, and the Chla concentration increased. The results showed that among the hydrometeorological and anthropogenic variables selected to explain changes in the OAC, gross domestic product (GDP) is the key factor influencing changes in the OACs, explaining 39.3%, 71.8% and 60.6% of the changes in Chla, CDOM and TSM, respectively. Air temperature (AT) can explain 24.0% of the variation in Chla, evapotranspiration (Eva) can explain 19.1% and 5.52% of the variation in CDOM and TSM, and precipitation (P) can explain 13.8% and 7.5% of the variation in Chla and TSM. Water level is an important pathway affecting OACs in Hulun Lake, explaining 50.7% of the variation in CDOM, 48.0% of the variation in TSM and 23.1% of the variation in Chla. Warming and drought in the Hulun Lake basin and human activities ultimately lead to changes in OACs. Finally, a pattern diagram to assess the degree of ecological degradation of lake was proposed. This study has substantial implications to monitor and assess the ecological degradation status of lake and maintain the sustainable development of lakes in cold and arid regions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessing Visual Green Effects Of Individual Urban Trees Using Airborne Lidar Data
AB  - Urban trees benefit people's daily life in terms of air quality, local climate, recreation and aesthetics. Among these functions, a growing number of studies have been conducted to understand the relationship between residents' preference towards local environments and visual green effects of urban greenery. However, except for on-site photography, there are few quantitative methods to calculate green visibility, especially tree green visibility, from viewers' perspectives.To fill this research gap, a case study was conducted in the city of Cambridge, which has a diversity of tree species, sizes and shapes. Firstly, a photograph-based survey was conducted to approximate the actual value of visual green effects of individual urban trees. In addition, small footprint airborne Lidar (Light detection and ranging) data was employed to measure the size and shape of individual trees. Next, correlations between visual tree green effects and tree structural parameters were examined. Through experiments and gradual refinement, a regression model with satisfactory R2 and limited large errors is proposed. Considering the diversity of sample trees and the result of cross-validation, this model has the potential to be applied to other study sites. This research provides urban planners and decision makers with an innovative method to analyse and evaluate landscape patterns in terms of tree greenness. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Understanding Urban Expansion On The Tibetan Plateau Over The Past Half Century Based On Remote Sensing: The Case Of Xining City, China
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is an important area that affects global sustainable development. Quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization is crucial for maintaining the sustainability on the TP. This study took Xining City, the largest city on the TP, as an example to understand the urban expansion in this region in the past 50 years. We combined the high‐resolution spy satellite data and China’s long‐term urban land dataset (CULD) to quantify the urban expansion of Xining City. The object‐oriented random forest classification was performed to extract urban land from spy satellite data in 1969, and the inter‐annual correction was used to combine urban land information from 1969 to 2017. We found that the proposed approach can accurately quantify the urban expansion of Xining City over the past half century with an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Such high accuracy benefits from the fine resolution of spy satellite data and the consistency of CULD. We also found that Xining City experienced accelerated and fragmented urban sprawl to higher altitude areas, as a result of socioeconomic development and topographical limi-tations. The acceleration of urban expansion was more obvious, and the urban landscape fragmen-tation was more serious at high altitude areas. Such urban expansion encroached on cropland and grassland, and caused increased risks of landslides and other geological disasters. Therefore, Xining City urgently needs to promote the development of compact cities to control urban sprawl at higher altitude areas and provide a reference for improving urban sustainability across the TP. In this study, we analyzed the urban expansion of Xining city from 1969 to 2017, and provided a reliable way to understand the long‐term spatiotemporal urbanization based on remote sensing, which has the potential for wide applications. In addition, the extracted urban information can help to improve the urban sustainability of Xining City and the entire TP. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - The Value Of Snow Depletion Forecasting Methods Towards Operational Snowmelt Runoff Estimation Using Modis And Numerical Weather Prediction Data
AB  - Forecasting streamflow mainly due to snowmelt in the mountainous eastern part of Turkey is important in terms of effective management of water resources at the headwaters of Euphrates River, where large dam reservoirs are located. Monitoring Snow Covered Area (SCA) and modeling snowmelt forms the backbone of the forecasting studies as the snowmelt dominating runoff constitutes approximately 2/3 of total annual volume of runoff during spring and early summer. Two main motivations of the study are; firstly, to assess the methodologies to forecast SCA using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and derive Snow Depletion Curve (SDC) for each elevation zone. Secondly, to forecast 1 day ahead daily discharges using the derived SDCs and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data corrected specifically for the area. The Upper Euphrates Basin (10,275 km(2)) is selected as the pilot basin and MODIS daily snow cover products are analyzed for the snowmelt season. Four different methodologies are proposed and assessed to forecast SDCs; simple averaging, temperature based, stochastic modeling and probabilistic approach. SDCs are derived for the water years 2006-2010, 4 years data are used to derive the equations of the methodologies and 1 year is used to verify their skills. Forecasting discharges 1 day ahead with Snowmelt Runoff Model using NWP data is the second part of the study. Impact of forecasted SDCs with different methodologies is examined with the model. Model applications provide promising results both for the forecasting of SCA and runoff with an overall Model Efficiency higher than 0.60 and 0.85, respectively.

TI  - Bacteriophages As Indicators Of Faecal Pollution And Enteric Virus Removal
AB  - Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative to faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), particularly as surrogates of enteric virus fate and transport, due to their closer morphological and biological properties. Based on a review of published data, we summarize densities of coliphages (F+ and somatic), Bacteroides spp. and enterococci bacteriophages (phages) in individual human waste, raw wastewater, ambient fresh and marine waters and removal through wastewater treatment processes utilizing traditional treatments. We also provide comparisons with FIB and enteric viruses whenever possible. Lastly, we examine fate and transport characteristics in the aquatic environment and provide an overview of the environmental factors affecting their survival. In summary, concentrations of bacteriophages in various sources were consistently lower than FIB, but more reflective of infectious enteric virus levels. Overall, our investigation indicates that bacteriophages may be adequate viral surrogates, especially in built systems, such as wastewater treatment plants. Significance and Impact of the Study: Bacteriophage are alternative fecal indicators that may be better surrogates for viral pathogens than fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). This report offers a summary of the existing literature concerning the utility of bacteriophage as indicators of viral presence (fecal sources and surface waters) and persistence (in built infrastructure and aquatic environments). Our findings indicate that bacteriophage levels in all matrices examined are consistently lower than FIB, but similar to viral pathogens. Furthermore, in built infrastructure (e.g. wastewater treatment systems) bacteriophage closely mimic viral pathogen persistence suggesting they may be adequate sentinels of enteric virus removal. © 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology

TI  - Variation Character Of Water And Sediment And Its Response To Rainfall And Human Activities In Longtong Region Of The Middle Yellow River
AB  - To evaluate the benefits of soil and water conservation and adjust ecological and environmental policies in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the relationships between precipitation and changes in vegetation index, and water and sediment flows were analyzed using precipitation, runoff, sediment transport and remote sensing data in the Longtong region from 1957 to 2019. The cumulative anomaly method and double cumulative curve were used to analyze the relationship between precipitation and changes in vegetation index, and water and sediment flows.The results showed that precipitation in the Longtong region did not exhibit an apparent decline with time, but runoff and sediment transport exhibited a significant decline with time. The abrupt change to runoff, from abundant to dry, occurred in 1985, and the abrupt change to sediment transport, from abundant to dry, occurred in 1985 and 2002.The normalized vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited a recovery, with an annual increase of 1.7%, and the spatial NDVI exhibited fluctuations in a generally increasing value. Vegetation cover in the southern part of the basin was the best. Compared with the reference period A (1957 ~ 1985), the contribution of precipitation to runoff in period B (1986-2019) was 26. 21%, while the contribution of anthropogenic to runoff was 73. 79%. Compared with the reference period A (1957 ~ 1985), the contribution of precipitation in periods B (1986 ~ 2019) and C (2003 ~ 2019) to sediment transport was 22. 80% and 11. 73%, respectively, while the contribution of anthropogenic sediment transport were 77.20% and 88.27%, respectively. © 2023 Editorial Board of Journal of Basic Science and.

TI  - Using Remotely Sensed Indicators Of Primary Productivity To Improve Prioritization Of Conservation Areas For Top Predators
AB  - The need to incorporate habitat dynamics into spatial conservation prioritization is increasingly recognized but often limited by the lack of available temporal data. To overcome this limitation, model-assisted monitoring has been advocated and developed over the last decade. However, predictive modelling often relies on static habitat features or interpolated climate data, failing to consider other relevant ecological processes such as primary productivity and its dynamics. The importance of primary productivity relies on its key role in determining the availability of food resources via trophic cascades. This study aims to assess how the spatiotemporal variation in the habitat quality for top predators (using raptors as case study) can be affected by temporal fluctuations in primary productivity, and whether its incorporation into habitat modelling improves predictions in space and time. Through model predictions we then incorporate interannual habitat-quality dynamics into spatial conservation planning to identify priority areas for raptor conservation based on a new set of dynamic priority-area indices. Using raptor occurrence data from two surveys (2001 and 2014), we found high model performance and transferability for all species (AUC(2001) = 0.89 +/- 0.10 and Boyce's Index(2001) of 0.78 +/- 0.20; AUC(2014) = 0.89 +/- 0.12 and Boyce's Index(2014) of 0.87 +/- 0.06). Annual mean and minimum values of EVI (indicators of productivity and phenology, respectively) and elevation were the most important predictor variables for most raptor species. However, the standard deviation of EVI (an indicator of seasonality) was also found to be an important predictor for migratory species breeding in shrublands and croplands. Interannual model predictions showed a large interannual variation in habitat availability across species, partially associated with regional land-use changes. Interannual habitat-quality dynamics was translated into marked changes in the priority areas for raptor conservation -areas mostly associated with deciduous forest and water environments (rivers and dams) in our study area. Our results shed light on the role of intra- and interannual dynamics of primary productivity in driving habitat quality for top predators. They also confirm the potential of remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes to inform about habitat-quality dynamics in a cost-effective, standardized and repeatable way. Incorporating interannual dynamics of primary productivity in habitat modelling supports raptor conservation prioritization by informing about adequacy, stability and legacy of raptor conservation areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Pattern Of Urban Forest Leaf Area Index In Response To Rapid Urbanization And Urban Greening
AB  - Rapid urbanization and urban greening have caused great changes to urban forests in China. Understanding spatiotemporal patterns of urban forest leaf area index (LAI) under rapid urbanization and urban greening is important for urban forest planning and management. We evaluated the potential for estimating urban forest LAI spatiotemporally by using Landsat TM imagery. We collected three scenes of Landsat TM (thematic mapper) images acquired in 1997, 2004 and 2010 and conducted a field survey to collect urban forest LAI. Finally, spatiotemporal maps of the urban forest LAI were created using a NDVI-based urban forest LAI predictive model. Our results show that normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) could be used as a predictor for urban forest LAI similar to natural forests. Both rapid urbanization and urban greening contribute to the changing process of urban forest LAI. The urban forest has changed considerably from 1997 to 2010. Urban vegetated pixels decreased gradually from 1997 to 2010 due to intensive urbanization. Leaf area for the study area was 216.4, 145.2 and 173.7 km(2) in the years 1997, 2004 and 2010, respectively. Urban forest LAI decreased sharply from 1997 to 2004 and increased slightly from 2004 to 2010 because of numerous greening policies. The urban forest LAI class distributions were skewed toward low values in 1997 and 2004. Moreover, the LAI presented a decreasing trend from suburban to downtown areas. We demonstrate the usefulness of TM remote-sensing in understanding spatiotemporal changing patterns of urban forest LAI under rapid urbanization and urban greening.

TI  - Using Remotely Sensed Suspended Sediment Concentration Variation To Improve Management Of Poyang Lake, China
AB  - Cui L, Qiu Y, Fei T, Liu Y, Wu G. 2013. Using remotely sensed suspended sediment concentration variation to improve management of Poyang Lake, China. Lake Reserv Manage. 29:47-60. This study applied Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2000 to 2010 to obtain and analyze the spatiotemporal variation of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discussed factors affecting it in Poyang Lake, China. Results showed that (1) the mean SSC was lower in the south, higher in the north, and moderate in the central lake region; (2) the mean SSC in the south was lower than or close to 20 mg/L, with no clear annual trend; (3) the mean SSC in the north was slightly higher than 20 mg/L in 2000 and increased from 2001, with the highest value <60 mg/L in 2006; (4) the mean SSC in the central lake region, except for 2009, ranged from 20 to 40 mg/L and had an annual pattern similar to that in the southern lake region; (5) for the entire lake, the mean SSC declined from January to March, increased from September to December, and fluctuated from April to August; and (6) several higher SSC values were found in the central or southern lake regions. The spatiotemporal variation of SSC was controlled by natural and human factors, in which dredging was dominant. Limiting the area of dredging and reducing dredging intensity would decrease SSC and maintain sustainable development of Poyang Lake. Remote sensing can obtain the spatiotemporal information of some water quality parameters, which will help managers understand the lake dynamics and mechanisms to make better decisions for lake management. © by the North American Lake Management Society 2013.

TI  - Decision-Based Fusion For Improved Fluvial Landscape Classification Using Digital Aerial Photographs And Forward Looking Infrared Images
AB  - Riverine landscapes associated with large dynamic floodplains provide a complex array of habitats for fish. Mapping and quantitative assessment of the habitats poses a major challenge. This study uses high spatial resolution airborne digital photographs and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images, simultaneously acquired in spring 2005 over a 12 river kilometer section of the Unuk River in Southeast Alaska to map macro habitat indicators for Pacific salmon such as large woody debris (LWD), water channels, sand/gravel bars, and riparian vegetation. Image processing revealed that LWD could best be extracted using contextual information from the digital photos. River channel water had prominent shadows cast from neighboring trees and could not be accurately classified using digital photos, but could be well-delineated using unsupervised classification of the FLIR images. All other classes showed up well using supervised classification of digital photos. Using a decision-based fusion approach, the best individual classification results obtained from the digital photos and FLIR images to generate an improved fluvial landscape classification map (land-cover map). Using a decision-based fusion method resulted in an overall classification accuracy of the study area to 84.29 percent, compared to 77.00 percent using supervised classification of aerial photos alone. This appears to be first time that high-resolution airborne thermal images have been used for fluvial landscape classification, and the study clearly demonstrates the value of using thermal images and decision-based fusion approach for improved land-cover classification. © 2008 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

TI  - Examining The Potential Impact Of Land Use/Cover Changes On The Npp Ecosystem Services Of Yan'an Region Of China: A Scenario-Based Analysis
AB  - Remote sensing-derived LUC maps for 2009, GIS-based LUC change model, and ecosystem service value of NPP were used to facilitate the analysis. The results forests have significantly higher NPP values than farmlands, whose NPP is approximately equal to that of brushlands. The scenario-based LUC change analysis revealed that if the urban LUC change pattern continues, the total ecosystem service value of NPP will also change, especially if the forest cover is not fully protected and conserved. Our results highlighted that under the great pressure of urbanisation, there is a need to strengthen the proper implementation of policies in order to maintain and improve ecosystem services. Although there are limitations to the estimated ecosystem service value of NPP of Yan'an to be taken into account in future studies, the magnitude of the estimated changes in the LUC is substantial.

TI  - Fuzzy Model-Based Assessment And Monitoring Of Desertification Using Modis Satellite Imagery
AB  - Purpose - The growing rate of desertification in Northwestern China and Mongolia that is occurring as a result of the conflict between economic development and natural conservation has been demonstrated in many studies. There have, for example, been some large studies using variations in bi-weekly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) satellite images as a parameter for evaluating the vegetation dynamics in these areas. The purpose of this paper is to identify multi-temporal variation in vegetated and non-vegetated areas in remotely sensed satellite images to assess the status of desertification in East Asia. Design/methodology/approach - Spatial data derived from these satellite images are applied to evaluate vegetation dynamics on a regional level, to identify the areas most vulnerable to desertification. Findings - Analytical results indicate that the desert areas in East Asia are primarily distributed over Southern Mongolia, Central and Western Inner Mongolia, and Western China (the Taklimakan Desert). These desert areas expanded from 2000 to 2002, shrunk in 2003, then expanded again from 2003 to 2005. The areas most at risk for desertification are principally distributed in Southeastern Mongolia, and Eastern Inner Mongolia. Originality/value - Simulation results based on data for deserts distributed throughout Northwestern China and Mongolia indicate that the proposed fuzzy model-based method would be helpful for assessing and monitoring desertification. These analytical results will help administrators refine planning processes, define the boundaries of protected areas, and facilitate decisions for prioritizing areas for desertification protection.

TI  - Exploring The Use Of Seabirds As A Dynamic Ocean Management Tool To Mitigate Anthropogenic Risk To Large Whales
AB  - Vessel strike and entanglement in fishing gear are global threats to large whales. United States management actions to reduce human-induced serious injury and mortality to large whales have been inadequate, partially due to static, spatial protection schemes that fail to adjust to distribution shifts of highly mobile animals. Whale conservation would benefit from dynamic ocean management, but few tools exist to inform dynamic approaches. Seabirds are often found in association with whales and can be tagged at lower cost and in higher numbers than whales. We explored the use of satellite-tagged seabirds (great shearwaters) as dynamic ocean management tools for near real-time identification of habitats where humpback and North Atlantic right whales aggregate, potentially increasing anthropogenic risk. We identified shearwater habitat use areas in the Gulf of Maine with 50\% kernel density utilization distributions at yearly, monthly, and weekly scales using satellite-telemetry data from 2013-2018. We quantified overlap using whale sightings and whale satellite telemetry data at two spatial scales: Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary and the Gulf of Maine. Within the sanctuary, shearwaters overlapped with >50\% of humpback sightings in 4 of 6 (67\%) years, 15 of 23 (65\%) months, and 50 of 89 (56\%) of weeks. At the Gulf of Maine scale, shearwater use areas overlapped >50\% of humpback sightings in 5 of 6 years (83\%) and 16 of 22 (73\%) months, and encompassed humpback 50\% utilization distributions (based on satellite telemetry) in 2 of 3 (66\%) years and 7/12 (58\%) months analyzed. Overlap between shearwaters and right whales was much lower, with >50\% overlap in only 1 of 6 (17\%) years and 3 of 23 (13\%) months. These initial results demonstrate that satellite-tagged shearwaters can be indicators of humpback whale habitat use in both space and time. With further study, tagged shearwaters may provide near-real time information necessary to operationalize dynamic management to mitigate human impacts on humpback whales.

TI  - Large Area Mapping Of Annual Land Cover Dynamics Using Multitemporal Change Detection And Classification Of Landsat Time Series Data
AB  - Land cover characteristics remain of particular interest to the monitoring and reporting communities, and approaches for generating annual maps of land cover informed by change information derived from long time series are critically needed. In this study, we demonstrate and verify the utility of disturbance and recovery metrics derived from annual Landsat time series to inform the classification of annual land cover over a > 1.2 million hectare forest management area in the Boreal Mixedwood Region of northern Ontario, Canada. Annual land cover maps were generated, producing temporally informed products and compared to the established approach of using single-date spectral variables and indices. The Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm was used to classify land cover annually between 1990 and 2010, followed by the application of an annual temporal filter to remove illogical land cover transitions. Change detection in the study area had an overall accuracy of 92.47%. The use of time series metrics in the classification of land cover improved overall accuracy by 6.38% compared to single-date results. Using a separate independent reference sample, the RF classification approach combined with postclassification transition filtering resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 87.98%. The use of annual change and trend information to guide land cover, which is further informed by logical land cover transition rules, points to the creation of efficient, robust, and reliable land cover products in a transparent and operational fashion. © 2015, Copyright © Crown copyright.

TI  - High-Resolution Satellite Images Combined With Hydrological Modeling Derive River Discharge For Headwaters: A Step Toward Discharge Estimation In Ungauged Basins
AB  - The reliance on ground-based measurements has been a long-standing barrier toward deriving river discharge for ungauged headwaters, which are quite sensitive to climate change due to relatively high contributions of snow and glacier meltwater to river discharge. In addition, information pertaining to discharge is scarce and inconsistent across the globe due to economic, geographic, and political reasons. Therefore, understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of river discharge in ungauged headwaters is extremely challenging, particularly in high mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study presents a methodology of estimating daily continuous discharge using multisource remote sensing and a hydrological model that can simulate cryospheric processes including snow and glacier accumulation and melt. The hydrological model is forced and calibrated purely by satellite-observed information, particularly by river widths derived from high-spatial-resolution images without using in situ river discharge measurements. Poorly gauged or ungauged headwaters with river widths on the order of 100 m, including the Lhasa (the tributary of the upper Brahmaputra River), Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers originating on the TP were chosen to test the methodology. At-a-section river widths were derived from high-resolution satellite images (i.e., IKONOS, QuickBird, RapidEye-1/2/4/5, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-2) and Landsat archives. As exemplified by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values (NSE) (up to 0.8 and higher than 0.5 overall), simulated daily continuous discharge was reliable in the four testbeds with different river bathymetry, narrow river widths, and complex terrain. Uncertainties associated with the accuracy, number, and variability of calibration references (i.e., remotely sensed widths) and optimization algorithms were fully discussed. This study highlights the potential of deriving daily continuous discharge without a priori information on river flow, paving the way for discharge estimation in ungauged headwaters globally and providing important implications for satellite-based discharge estimation in narrow rivers across high-mountain regions.

TI  - Cross-Scale Monitoring Of Habitat Suitability Changes Using Satellite Time Series And Ecological Niche Models
AB  - One of the biggest challenges to deal with the global crisis of biodiversity loss is the lack of efficient and viable monitoring systems across scales. Unlike traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring, a usually costly and time-consuming enterprise, satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer a technically feasible and sustainable in time solution. Here, we devise a cost-effective and upgradeable spatiotemporal framework for monitoring the species-specific habitat availability changes across scales by trend analysis of habitat suitability index (HSI) derived from ecological niche models (ENMs; Maxent) and using time series of SRS data (MODIS). The SRS-ENM framework was applied for a large suite of native species (911), from major taxonomic groups (flora (vascular plants), amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), and listed in the IUCN Red List at regional (Iberian Peninsula) and continental (Europe) scales. The HSI-trend analyses predict cumulative reductions in habitat suitability for Threatened and Non-Threatened species across scales for the period 2002–2016. Specifically, 19% and 66% of the total grid cells for both species' groups showed negative trends at both regional and continental scales, respectively. Results were similar when considering all IUCN threat categories. All taxa groups showed a decrease in habitat suitability, but amphibians and reptiles groups hosted the largest number of negative HSI-trends grid cells. Considering all groups together, 12% and 34% of both study areas have strong reductions in habitat quality. We conclude that our framework detects increases and decreases in species' habitat suitability regardless of the spatial scale, extent, and pixel size. Species' range predictions across space and time based on SRS time series represent a promising Earth observation tool to support traditional risk assessment protocols and anticipate the decision-making process, while serving as a cross-scale biodiversity monitoring system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimation Of Sediment Load For Himalayan Rivers: Case Study Of Kaligandaki In Nepal
AB  - Himalayan regions have increasing sediment yield due to undulating topography, slope and improper watershed management. However, due to limited observation data, and site accessibility issues, less studies have quantified sedimentation loads in the Himalayas, especially Nepal. This has hindered the investments on run-of-river hydropower projects as high and unpredicted sedimentation has increased losses in hydropower production. Therefore, there is a need to understand key physical processes driving sedimentation in these regions, with the available data. This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate the sedimentation yields in the Kaligandaki basin of Nepal, which is an important tributary that drains into the Ganges. Multi-source data from field observations, remote sensing platforms, surveys and government records were used to set up and run the SWAT model for the Kaligandaki basin from 2000 to 2009. Results for the 10-year model run indicate that 73% of the total sediment load is estimated to come from the upstream regions (also known as High Himalayan region), while only 27% is contributed from the Middle and High Mountain regions (where land management-based interventions were deemed most feasible for future scenarios). The average sediment concentration was 1986 mg/kg (ppm), with values of 8432 and 12 mg/kg (ppm) for maximum and minimum, respectively. Such high sedimentation rates can impact river ecosystems (due to siltation), ecosystem services and hydropower generation. In addition, model results indicate the need for better high frequency observation data. Results from this study can aid in better watershed management, which is aimed at reducing sedimentation load and protecting Himalayan rivers. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Gis Based Soil Loss Assessment Using Rusle Model: A Case Of Horo District, Western Ethiopia
AB  - Land degradation in the form of soil erosion is a worldwide challenge and make environmental problem that affects crop yields, makes livelihoods difficult, and creates crises. The main objective of this study was to measure soil loss using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) Model in Horo district, Western Ethiopia. RUSLE with a Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to quantify soil loss using rainfall, soil, a digital elevation model (DEM), and satellite image datasets as factor value inputs. Those factors are erosivity (R), erodibility (K), topography (LS), cover management (C), and conservation support practice (P) layer values that can be interactively used using weighted overlay in ArcGIS 10.8. The result shows that the maximum and minimum potential annual soil loss of the study area ranged from nil (0.01 t/ha/yr) on plain surfaces to 216.01 t/ha/yr. The average annual soil loss rate in the study area was 13.27 t ha/yr. The highest mean annual soil loss of 216.01 t/ha/yr were observed from farmland and it was the largest portion of the study area, which covered about 64243.02 ha and represented about 73.75% of the total. As a result, forest land (16383.23 ha) was the second-largest, accounting for 18.81% of the total area. Consequently, the study revealed that the farmland was more vulnerable to erosion than other land uses and land cover types. Hence, information on average annual soil loss is important for selecting appropriate conservation measures to reduce on-site soil loss and its off-site effects. Therefore, farmers and other expected bodies should have focused on soil conservation and management practices at the highest soil loss severity classes, which must get priority for conservation by stakeholders, agents, and the government. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Ecological And Environmental Effects Of Estuarine Wetland Loss Using Keyhole And Landsat Data In Liao River Delta, China
AB  - An estuarine wetland is an area of high ecological productivity and biodiversity, and it is also an anthropic activity hotspot area, which is of concern. The wetlands in estuarine areas have suffered declines, which have had remarkable ecological impacts. The land use changes, especially wetland loss, were studied based on Keyhole and Landsat images in the Liao River delta from 1962 to 2016. The dynamics of the ecosystem service values (ESVs), suitable habitat for birds, and soil heavy metal potential ecological risk were chosen to estimate the ecological effects with the benefit transfer method, synthetic overlaying method, and potential ecological risk index (RI) method, respectively. The driving factors of land use change and ecological effects were analyzed with redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the built-up area increased from 95.98 km(2) in 1962 to 591.49 km(2) in 2016, and this large change was followed by changes in paddy fields (1351.30 to 1522.39 km(2)) and dry farmland (189.5 to 294.14 km(2)). The area of wetlands declined from 1823.16 km(2) in 1962 to 1153.52 km(2) in 2016, and this change was followed by a decrease in the water area (546.2 to 428.96 km(2)). The land use change was characterized by increasing built-up (516.25\%), paddy fields (12.66\%) and dry farmland (55.22\%) areas and a decline in the wetland (36.73\%) and water areas (21.47\%) from 1962-2016. Wetlands decreased by 669.64 km(2). The ESV values declined from 6.24 billion US\$ to 4.46 billion US\$ from 1962 to 2016, which means the ESVs were reduced by 19.26\% due to wetlands being cultivated and the urbanization process. The area of suitable habitat for birds decreased by 1449.49 km(2), or 61.42\% of the total area available in 1962. Cd was the primary soil heavy metal pollutant based on its concentration, accumulation, and potential ecological risk contribution. The RDA showed that the driving factors of comprehensive ecological effects include wetland area, Cd and Cr concentration, river and oil well distributions. This study provides a comprehensive approach for estuarine wetland cultivation and scientific support for wetland conservation.

TI  - Assessment Of Surface Hydrological Connectivity In An Ungauged Multi-Lake System With A Combined Approach Using Geostatistics And Spaceborne Sar Observations
AB  - Connectivity metrics for surface water are important for predicting floods and droughts, and improving water management for human use and ecological integrity at the landscape scale. The integrated use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and geostatistics approach can be useful for developing and quantifying these metrics and their changes, including geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), surface water extent (SWE), and connection frequency. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis based on 52 wet and dry binary state (i.e., water and non-water) rasters derived from Sentinel-1 A/B GRD products acquired from 2015 to 2019 for China's Momoge National Nature Reserve to investigate applicability and dynamics of the hydrologic connectivity metrics in an ungauged (i.e., data such as flow and water level are scarce) multi-lake system. We found: (1) generally, the change of GCF in North-South and Northeast-Southwest directions was greater than that in the West-East and Northwest-Southeast directions; (2) MDC had a threshold effect, generally at most 25 km along the W-E, NW-SE and NE-SW directions, and at most 45 km along the N-S direction; (3) the flow paths between lakes are diverse, including channelized flow, diffusive overbank flow, over-road flow and "fill-and-merge"; (4) generally, the values of the three surface hydrological connectivity indicators (i.e., the MDC, the SWE, and the conneciton frequency) all increased from May to August, and decreased from August to October; (5) generally, the closer the distance between the lakes, the greater the connection frequency, but it is also affected by the dam and road barrier. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the geostatistical method combining Sentinel-1 SAR image analysis in quantifying surface hydrological connectivity in an ungagged area. This approach should be applicable for other geographical regions, in order help resource managers and policymakers identify changes in surface hydrological connectivity, as well as address potential impacts of these changes on water resources for human use and/or ecological integrity at the landscape level.

TI  - Ecosystem Health Assessment Of World Natural Heritage Sites Based On Remote Sensing And Field Sampling Verification: Bayanbulak As Case Study
AB  - Monitoring the ecosystem health for world natural heritage sites is essential for protecting them and benefits the formulation of more targeted protection policies. This study used Bayanbulak world natural heritage site as a case, established a framework for assessing the ecosystem health through remote sensing based on the parameters of ecosystem vigour, organization, resilience, and services. Then, we verified the obtained results through field sampling. The results show that the ecosystem health in the overall study area had declined over time, however, the health within the property zone remained at high levels and stable. The area proportion of low health was low and primarily distributed in the buffer zone. Thus, in general, the ecosystem in the study area was healthy. Besides, the ecosystem health exhibited distinct spatial agglomeration characteristics, and the degree of agglomeration enhanced over time. In addition, the field vegetation samplings were consistent with the changes in the ecosystem health levels, therefore, the result of RS monitoring of ecosystem health were credible. Thus, this study provides a scientific basis for heritage managers to formulate suitable ecological protection policies and should aid further research on the ecological monitoring of heritage sites. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Recent Advances In Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Forest Remote Sensing-A Systematic Review. Part Ii: Research Applications
AB  - Forest sustainable management aims to maintain the income of woody goods for companies, together with preserving non-productive functions as a benefit for the community. Due to the progress in platforms and sensors and the opening of the dedicated market, unmanned aerial vehicle-remote sensing (UAV-RS) is improving its key role in the forestry sector as a tool for sustainable management. The use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in precision forestry has exponentially increased in recent years, as demonstrated by more than 600 references published from 2018 until mid-2020 that were found in the Web of Science database by searching for "UAV" + "forest". This result is even more surprising when compared with similar research for "UAV" + "agriculture", from which emerge about 470 references. This shows how UAV-RS research forestry is gaining increasing popularity. In Part II of this review, analyzing the main findings of the reviewed papers (227), numerous strengths emerge concerning research technical issues. UAV-RS is fully applicated for obtaining accurate information from practical parameters (height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and biomass). Research effectiveness and soundness demonstrate that UAV-RS is now ready to be applied in a real management context. Some critical issues and barriers in transferring research products are also evident, namely, (1) hyperspectral sensors are poorly used, and their novel applications should be based on the capability of acquiring tree spectral signature especially for pest and diseases detection, (2) automatic processes for image analysis are poorly flexible or based on proprietary software at the expense of flexible and open-source tools that can foster researcher activities and support technology transfer among all forestry stakeholders, and (3) a clear lack exist in sensors and platforms interoperability for large-scale applications and for enabling data interoperability.

TI  - Impact Assessment Of The Land Use Dynamics And Water Pollution On Ecosystem Service Value Of The Nile Delta Coastal Lakes, Egypt
AB  - The Nile Delta, in northern Egypt, is an extensive wetland with many lakes. The land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes and water pollution of these lakes are greatly affecting the sustainable development and the ecosystem. This study aims to investigate the impact of LULC and the water quality of Edku, Manzala, and Burullus lakes on the ecosystem service value (ESV) due to recent economic development. The changes of ESV associated with LULC dynamics and changes are calculated and evaluated using the integration of both the geographic information system and remote sensing techniques. The images of the years 2011 and 2021 are used to study the LULC changes and predict the land use and ESV of the study area for the year 2031. Furthermore, the effects of the developments during the period 2011-2021 on water quality are presented and evaluated. The land use evaluation during the period 2011-2021 showed that the economic development positively affected the water surface and urban areas changes and the water quality of the three lakes; however, the water pollution of Manzala lake is still extremely high. The water surface of Edku, Burullus, and Manzala lakes increased by 2.46\%, 0.83\%, and 15.69\%, respectively, and 12.47\%, 0.74\%, and 2.24\%, respectively, for the urban changes. The changes during the period 2011-2021 show that Manzala lake ESV increased by 4.91\%, and it may decrease by 0.11\% during the period 2021-2031. The ESV during the periods 2011-2021 and 2021-2031 is 5.04\% and - 4.17\%, respectively, for the Burullus lake, and - 0.89\% and - 6.20\%, respectively, for Edku lake. These results reveal that the ESV is vital for land resources management of the lakes and development strategies should be accurately addressed to estimate the impact of these projects.

TI  - Whole Life Sustainability In The Design Of Tourist Resorts A Coastal Alteration Prediction Model (Cap) Using Gis And Statistical Tools
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to argue that it is possible to identify a number of physical design properties of plots that are associated with coastal alteration and to develop a predictive model or metric to evaluate the potential alteration caused by that resort. Investors may have economic plot size concerns not considered by planners, tourists may prefer close proximity to deep waters, and urban planners may have failed to realize the importance of certain plot ratios or minimum dimensions etc. Design/methodology/approach - A combination of geographical information system and statistical tools is used to identify and model these properties. The research uses data from three different resorts in two countries along the Red Sea coast (Hurghada and Safaga in Egypt and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia). Landsat TM7 images are obtained for each location and analysed to detect regions with the largest alteration along the coast using the post-classification change technique. Physical properties of each village are generated using ArcGIS 9.2 both before and after alteration. Finally, a predictive decision-support tool for urban planners and environmental auditors is formulated using stepwise discriminant analysis. Findings - Two-step cluster analysis and discriminate analysis show that alteration takes place based on factors that include original width and original distance to deep water in three distinct groups. The predictive model that is developed classifies any given resort into one of three clusters, by virtue of their physical design characteristics. This gives a rough prediction of the likely alteration that might take place under a given condition. Subdivision plans that ignore the power of these two factors literally "invite" owners to violate shorelines and encroach on the sea. Planners are urged to join hands with policy makers and developers to formulate guidelines to plot subdivision and environmentally acceptable design solutions to facilitate access to deep water. Originality/value - Till now, there has been no metric to relate a plot's geometric properties with the encroachment it makes. If such an association could be made, a developer's resort plans may be evaluated to predict the degree by which an encroachment is likely. The model can be used to identify resorts whose properties present a risk to shorelines, dredge or fill to maximize usable land. Two benefits may be thought of for this approach. First, the model helps urban planners develop a sustainable coastal area by bearing in mind the needs of tourist-developers as well as the properties of their adjacent coast. Second, the factors can be used to rationalize building guidelines and land use regulations to minimize such risk.

TI  - Safety Monitoring Of Rotavac Vaccine And Etiological Investigation Of Intussusception In India: Study Protocol
AB  - Background: ROTAVAC, an indigenous rotavirus vaccine, was introduced in the universal immunization program of India in four states in 2016 and expanded to five more states in 2017. The clinical trial on efficacy of ROTAVAC did not detect an increased risk of intussusception, but the trial was not large enough to detect a small risk. This protocol paper describes the establishment and implementation of a surveillance system to monitor the safety of rotavirus vaccine and investigate the potential infectious etiologies of intussusception. Methods: This is a multi-centric hospital-based active surveillance being conducted at 28 hospitals in nine states of India. Data gathered from surveillance will be used to assess the risk of intussusception after ROTAVAC administration and to determine the infectious etiologies of intussusception. For safety assessment of ROTAVAC vaccine, children aged less than two years with intussusception admitted at the sentinel hospitals are enrolled into surveillance, a case report form completed, and a copy of the vaccination card obtained. The risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination will be assessed using a self-controlled case-series design. The investigation for potential infectious etiologies of intussusception is through a matched case-control design. Children enrolled for the safety assessment serve as cases and for each case, an age, gender and location matched control is enrolled within 30 days of case enrollment. Stool specimens are obtained from cases and controls. All forms and specimens are sent to the referral laboratory for data entry, analysis, multiplexed molecular testing, and storage. Discussion: Anticipated public health benefits of this surveillance include the generation of information useful to national government on safety of vaccine and to make future decisions on vaccine use through risk-benefit analysis. Investigating infectious agents may help to determine the potential infectious etiologies of intussusception. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Satellite Sleuthing: Does Remotely Sensed Land-Cover Change Signal Ecological Degradation In A Protected Area?
AB  - We evaluate whether remotely sensed land-cover change within a newly protected area signalled human-driven ecological degradation. Vegetation density changed in a quarter of pixels during the first 13 years (1986-1999) following the sanctuary's formal enclosure, with many patches showing a decrease in density. We use on-the-ground data collected in 2006 in 132 random plots to explore whether these changes in vegetation density reliably signalled latent shifts in local diversity of woody plants and whether they could be attributed to illicit activities including fuel wood collection and livestock grazing. Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India. Species richness, species sharing, species assemblages, and incidence of invasive and useful species were statistically similar among plots in which vegetation density had decreased, increased or remained similar. Likewise, intensity of disturbance associated with human activities was similar across these plot types. Our data provide no clear evidence that local changes in vegetation density signalled latent shifts in local diversity of woody plants. They also fail to reveal any clear association between local changes in vegetation density and human-related activities. Finding no evidence that land-cover change led to biotic erosion, we reflect on the utility of resource-use bans in protected areas, particularly those embedded within historically coupled human-nature systems.

TI  - Faith And Trust
AB  - Faith aims at a transcendent God, whereas the immanent object of trust is man. Faith and trust play an important role in Max Weber’s thesis because he recognizes in Calvinism’s peculiar theology of grace, with its emphasis on solely trusting in God, the indirect source for a work ethic that seeks to gain a sign of religious salvation in successful work, leading to the accumulation of capital by ascetic Protestants and a restraining of consumption. The relationship between death and religion broadly understood is especially well investigated by terror management theory, a social psychology following the work of cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker. The perspective of the world religions demands the desacralization of money and the market. A de-deified market that is no longer master of the society but its servant can benefit human life. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Stefan Schwarzkopf.

TI  - Validation Of Applicability Of Modis Evapotranspiration Simulation Model To Panxi Tobacco Planting Area
AB  - Estimating ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) using model simulation is of great signifi cance to study regionally spatiotemporal variation of water resources and to evaluate eff ects of climate change on water management. Based on MODIS-ET model, ecosystem ET in Panzhihua-Xichang (Pan-xi) tobacco planting area was simulated by using remote sensing data and meteorological data from January to October in 2016. The model was parameterized and validated by fi eld fl ux observation data. Results showed that the ET values calculated by MODIS-ET model with defaulted parameters were about 12.8% lower than observation values. The effi ciency coeffi cient was 0.767, and the average error in early growth period (DOY 105 ~ 161) was the highest. After parameterization on the basis of fi eld observation data, the dynamic curve of ET was consistent with measured dynamic curve. The slope of linear regression was 0.997, and the effi ciency coeffi cient was 0.808. These results proved that MODIS-ET model has effi cient applicability after parameterization in the study area. The study could provide an applicable ET dataset to support study on water and heat balance in Pan-xi tobacco planting area. © 2017, Editorial Office Chinese Tobacco Society. All right reserved.

TI  - An Integrated Approach To Modeling Urban Growth Using Modified Built-Up Area Extraction Technique
AB  - Prediction of urban growth is often crucial in urban planning decisions. In this paper, we integrated the whole process of urban growth prediction by SLEUTH simulation for Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan area of Bangladesh for the year of 2035. SLEUTH requires a rigorous preparation of five data inputs, i.e., slope, exclusion area, urban extent, road network and hillshade. This paper improvised the preparation of urban extent input using both Landsat-8 and Landsat-5 imagery. To increase the accuracy of urban area extraction from Landsat-8 images, we integrated normalized difference vegetation index and modified normalized difference water index with normalized difference built-up index. In the case of normalized difference built-up index, we used the principal component image of band 6 and 7 of Landsat-8 to include the effects of both bands. This technique to extract the built-up area increased the overall accuracy by 17.28% point. SLEUTH model ran through three calibration phases—coarse, fine and final—and an additional calibration was run to generate the forecasting coefficients. After the calibration phase, the best fit coefficient values were determined to run the prediction mode. The predicted outputs were derived as percentiles of development probability, from which a probability of above 90% was selected in this study. The prediction reveals that the urban extent of the study area is likely to increase by 158.66% from 2015 to 2035, and the designated conservation areas will significantly decrease during the same time period. This paper will provide researchers with an accurate and structured methodology to predict urban growth. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

TI  - Bacterial Loading During Flooding: A Case Study From 2010 On The Bi-National Rio Grande
AB  - Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria loadings were tracked during the summer 2010 major flood event of the Rio Grande using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model. This bi-national watershed spanning Texas and Mexico has loading from urban point source sewage outfalls and non-point source loadings from rangeland and agricultural areas located upstream of a urban centre (Laredo/Nuevo Laredo). Flood events represent a high risk for human health since bacterial loadings increased during the flood. Sampling during flood conditions is dangerous and therefore there are comparatively few studies that have examined bacterial values in rivers during flood events. Therefore, the safest way to obtain bacterial concentrations during a flood event is through hydrologic modelling. Significantly, the initial assumption of constant bacterial loading within the basin is not valid. As demonstrated by previous research there is a strong linear correlation between streamflow and E. coli values. The outcomes of this study will provide guidelines for users of the SWAT model to predict bacteria fate and transport during future flood events and will therefore assist communities in improving management of their water supplies. Finally, use of satellite precipitation data as primary input for the SWAT model potentially extends the findings of this study to areas of the developing world that lack ground monitoring of precipitation. © 201 WIT Press.

TI  - Validation Of The Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre Database: A Comprehensive Database Containing Records Of All Inter-Facility Patient Transfers In The Province Of Ontario
AB  - Background: The Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre (PTAC) was established as a part of the emergency response in Ontario, Canada to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Prior to 2003, data relating to inter-facility patient transfers were not collected in a systematic manner. Then, in an emergency setting, a comprehensive database with a complex data collection process was established. For the first time in Ontario, population-based data for patient movement between healthcare facilities for a population of twelve million are available. The PTAC database stores all patient transfer data in a large database. There are few population-based patient transfer databases and the PTAC database is believed to be the largest example to house this novel dataset. A patient transfer database has also never been validated. This paper presents the validation of the PTAC database. Methods: A random sample of 100 patient inter-facility transfer records was compared to the corresponding institutional patient records from the sending healthcare facilities. Measures of agreement, including sensitivity, were calculated for the 12 common data variables. Results: Of the 100 randomly selected patient transfer records, 95 (95%) of the corresponding institutional patient records were located. Data variables in the categories patient demographics, facility identification and timing of transfer and reason and urgency of transfer had strong agreement levels. The 10 most commonly used data variables had accuracy rates that ranged from 85.3% to 100% and error rates ranging from 0 to 12.6%. These same variables had sensitivity values ranging from 0.87 to 1.0. Conclusion: The very high level of agreement between institutional patient records and the PTAC data for fields compared in this study supports the validity of the PTAC database. For the first time, a population-based patient transfer database has been established. Although it was created during an emergency situation and data collection is dependent on front-line medical workers, the PTAC data has achieved a high level of validity, perhaps even higher than many purpose built databases created during non-emergency settings. © 2006 Robinson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Marine And Human Habitat Mapping For The Coral Triangle Initiative Region Of Sabah Using Landsat And Google Earth Imagery
AB  - The governments of the six Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have expressed their commitment to protecting marine ecosystems and improving management systems. Achieving the above commitment requires detailed baseline information on the spatial distribution and extent of the marine resources, such as seagrass meadows, coral reef, mangrove fotests and seaweed beds, as well as the ability to successfully interpret and understand these data. This study examined a combination of Landsat image enhancement technique and pixel-bated regional growing tools to create a map of marine and human habitats with five classes-of-interest: seagrass, land, coral and coral rubble, subsurface sand/mud, land, and human habitats for twelve islands of eastern Sabah of East Malaysia (extending from 4 degrees 42' N, 118 degrees 31' E to 4 degrees 12' N, 118 degrees 50' E), located in the south-eastern boundary of Palawan/North Borneo Ecoregion (extending from 14 degrees 31' N, 116 degrees 52' E to 0 degrees 0.04'N, 122 degrees 12' E) of the CTI implementation area. Using this method, an overall accuracy of > 75\% was achieved for mapping of those class-of-interest types. The estimated seagrass areal coverage is 274 ha, of which 158 ha (58\% of the total area) occurred in relatively shallow water areas. Using Google Earth data, seaweed culture sites with a total area of 7114 ha were observed around 7 of the 12 islands. The mapping approach and the results of the study will be of immense benefit to natural resource management of the study area through enabling conservation agencies to prioritize seagrass, coral, seaweed or marine conservation sites and to document local threats to those habitats.

TI  - Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: A Systematic Review And Critical Appraisal Of Comparative Effectiveness And Health Economics Research
AB  - In recent years, evidence has emerged regarding the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMT). Despite growing evidence in this field, there is need for appropriate research designs that effectively reflect the person-centred system of care promoted in osteopathy and provide data which can inform policy decisions within the healthcare system. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesise the evidence from comparative effectiveness and economic evaluation research involving OMT. A database search was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, PEDro, AMED, SCOPUS and OSTMED.DR, from their inception to May 2015. Two separate searches were undertaken to identify original research articles encompassing the economic evaluation and comparative effectiveness of OMT. Identified comparative effectives studies were evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and appraised using the Good Reporting of Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) principles. Identified economic studies were assessed with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines. Sixteen studies reporting the findings of comparative effectiveness (n = 9) and economic evaluation (n = 7) research were included. The comparative effectiveness studies reported outcomes for varied health conditions and the majority (n = 6) demonstrated a high risk of bias. The economic evaluations included a range of analyses and considerable differences in the quality of reporting were evident. Despite some positive findings, published comparative effectiveness and health economic studies in OMT are of insufficient quality and quantity to inform policy and practice. High quality, well-designed, research that aligns with international best practice is greatly needed to build a pragmatic evidence base for OMT. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The Importance Of Telemedicine During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Focus On Diabetic Retinopathy
AB  - Recently, telemedicine has become remarkably important, due to increased deployment and development of digital technologies. National and international guidelines should consider its inclusion in their updates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mandatory social distancing and the lack of effective treatments has made telemedicine the safest interactive system between patients, both infected and uninfected, and clinicians. A few potential evidence-based scenarios for the application of telemedicine have been hypothesized. In particular, its use in diabetes and complication monitoring has been remarkably increasing, due to the high risk of poor prognosis. New evidence and technological improvements in telemedicine application in diabetic retinopathy (DR) have demonstrated efficacy and usefulness in screening. Moreover, despite an initial increase for devices and training costs, teleophthalmology demonstrated a good cost-to-efficacy ratio; however, no national screening program has yet focused on DR prevention and diagnosis. Lack of data during the COVID-19 pandemic strongly limits the possibility of tracing the real management of the disease, which is only conceivable from past evidence in normal conditions. The pandemic further stressed the importance of remote monitoring. However, the deployment of device and digital application used to increase screening of individuals and monitor progression of retinal disease needs to be easily accessible to general practitioners. © 2020 Raffaele Galiero et al.

TI  - Modelling Stormwater Management Based On Infiltration Capacity Of Land Use In The Watershed Scale
AB  - The focus of urbanization effects on floods has gradually extended from the design of hydraulic channels to the control of imperviousness ratio and urban land use pattern in urban areas or the urbanized watershed. The stormwater management needs to integrate multiple floods perspectives in a spatial hierarchical unit, such as building, lot, city, watershed and region. However, the spread of the use of the urban landscape for managing and controlling stormwater in urbanized basins has been rather slow. The Low Impact Development (LID) model, which is used as the word of sponge city development in China, is used widely in Chinese cities. But most of Chinese cities, especially in East China have a high urban land intensity and no enough sponge city spaces to absorb surface runoff. The strong floods relationship exists among these spatial scales such as lot, city, watershed and region. Thus, the impact of land use change on environmental conditions improves the scientific knowledge on the floods correlation between new urban districts and downtowns, and expands the range of application of the LID/sponge city development. Then, the decline in the infiltration capacity resulted primarily from the transformation between construction land, cultivated land and other land use changes. However, there is low correlation between the infiltration capacity (CNc) and the construction land growth intensity in the overall sequence of development intensity (CLI15), but a high correlation in local parts of the CLI15 value. The high correlation occurs in the two parts of the CLI15 such as 8%-15% and 24%-39%, which are located in the "hot areas" of urban land growth around big cities and some rapidly developing towns. There is plenty of construction land and ecological infiltration space, and more opportunities to spatially contact together. Especially, three important target factors of the infiltration capacity in land use, such as the protection of infiltration spaces, land use control and LID-IMPs, are insufficient in the integrated planning and management. Last, the paper proposed a "3+4+5" stormwater management model in improving land use infiltration capacity, namely, three target factors, five key management elements and four management strategies models. Most parts of Area A in Taihu Lake watershed have a high intensity of land development, and implement the offensive strategy of improving the capacity of the hydraulic channels in the flood-prone areas, and create new ecological spatial elements in the right places. Area B around big cities is the main implementation area of the sponge city development/LID-IMPs, and controls the size of incremental construction land, and optimizes the pattern of construction land and natural spaces based spatial forms. Areas C and D are the main protection areas, and integrate stromwater management with land use zones, and expand and improve the ecological quality of natural service function. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Evaluation Of Forest Ecological Security And Its Influencing Factors In Multi-Climatic Zones: A Case Study Of Yunnan Province
AB  - Forest ecological security is related to national ecological security. Yunnan Province has a significantly stereoscopic climate characterized by diverse and complex vegetation. Therefore, the ecological security of Yunnan Province's forests, which span multiple climate zones, must be carefully considered. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the forest ecological security situation and influencing factors in Yunnan Province in 2017. Utilizing data from remote sensing, the Yunnan Province Yearbooks, socioeconomic statistical data, and better pressure-state-response modeling, this work produced an index system containing state and societal pressure. The evaluation indicators were weighted using a combination of entropy weighting and expert weighting, using 16 prefectures in Yunnan Province as samples. Using the fuzzy matter-element technique, the forest ecological security situation in Yunnan Province in 2017 was assessed, and the contributing causes were examined. Results indicate that there are spatial distribution differences in ecological security in various regions of Yunnan Province. The regions with the greatest indices of forest ecological security were found in Xishuangbanna in the south and Nujiang and Diqing in the northwest of Yunnan Province, while those areas with the lowest indices were distributed in Qujing and Zhaotong in the northeast and Baoshan in the west. Results of the grey relation analysis show that those factors that influence forest ecological security across different prefectures showed significant diversity. In Yunnan Province, the main influencing factors include days when the air quality reaches Level 2 or higher, the percentage of natural forest acreage and accumulation, the value of forest ecological service function per unit area, the annual average temperature, and forest coverage. The influence of the forest status index was greater than that of the forest pressure index. The findings of this work can guide decisions related to regional forest ecological security construction across multiple climate zones. In view of the differences in ecological security status and influencing factors in different regions, ecological environment governance should be adapted to local conditions to ensure the coordinated development of nature, the economy, and the ecological environment.

TI  - Population Structure In A Continuously Distributed Coastal Marine Species, The Harbor Porpoise, Based On Microhaplotypes Derived From Poor-Quality Samples
AB  - Harbor porpoise in the North Pacific are found in coastal waters from southern California to Japan, but population structure is poorly known outside of a few local areas. We used multiplexed amplicon sequencing of 292 loci and genotyped clusters of single nucleotide polymoirphisms as microhaplotypes (N = 271 samples) in addition to mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence data (N = 413 samples) to examine the genetic structure from samples collected along the Pacific coast and inland waterways from California to southern British Columbia. We confirmed an overall pattern of strong isolation-by-distance, suggesting that individual dispersal is restricted. We also found evidence of regions where genetic differences are larger than expected based on geographical distance alone, implying current or historical barriers to gene flow. In particular, the southernmost population in California is genetically distinct (F-ST = 0.02 {[}microhaplotypes]; 0.31 {[}mtDNA]), with both reduced genetic variability and high frequency of an otherwise rare mtDNA haplotype. At the northern end of our study range, we found significant genetic differentiation of samples from the Strait of Georgia, previously identified as a potential biogeographical boundary or secondary contact zone between harbor porpoise populations. Association of microhaplotypes with remotely sensed environmental variables indicated potential local adaptation, especially at the southern end of the species' range. These results inform conservation and management for this nearshore species, illustrate the value of genomic methods for detecting patterns of genetic structure within a continuously distributed marine species, and highlight the power of microhaplotype genotyping for detecting genetic structure in harbor porpoises despite reliance on poor-quality samples.

TI  - A National-Scale Model Of Linear Features Improves Predictions Of Farmland Biodiversity
AB  - Modelling species distribution and abundance is important for many conservation applications, but it is typically performed using relatively coarse-scale environmental variables such as the area of broad land-cover types. Fine-scale environmental data capturing the most biologically relevant variables have the potential to improve these models. For example, field studies have demonstrated the importance of linear features, such as hedgerows, for multiple taxa, but the absence of large-scale datasets of their extent prevents their inclusion in large-scale modelling studies. We assessed whether a novel spatial dataset mapping linear and woody-linear features across the UK improves the performance of abundance models of 18 bird and 24 butterfly species across 3723 and 1547 UK monitoring sites, respectively. Although improvements in explanatory power were small, the inclusion of linear features data significantly improved model predictive performance for many species. For some species, the importance of linear features depended on landscape context, with greater importance in agricultural areas. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that a national-scale model of the extent and distribution of linear features improves predictions of farmland biodiversity. The ability to model spatial variability in the role of linear features such as hedgerows will be important in targeting agri-environment schemes to maximally deliver biodiversity benefits. Although this study focuses on farmland, data on the extent of different linear features are likely to improve species distribution and abundance models in a wide range of systems and also can potentially be used to assess habitat connectivity. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Evalution Of Shallow Loess Landslide Stability In Typical Loess Hilly Region: A Case Study Of Zhidan County In Yan’an Area Of Shaanxi Province
AB  - The geological environment of the loess hilly region is fragile, and it is easy to induce shallow loess landslides during the rainy season. Zhidan County is a typical loess hilly region, where the loess landslide is widely distributed and the shallow loess landslides account for 85% of the total number of landslides. The research area is located in Zhidan County of Shaanxi Province, where the geological environment condition is poor and shallow landslides account for 80% of the total landslides. Evaluation of shallow landslides stability is not only conductive to understand the occurrence and development of shallow landslide, but also of great significance for disaster prevention and regional planning. In this paper, 96 shallow landslides were acquired through field investigation, aerial survey by UAVs and interpretation by satellite image. The basic physical and mechanical parameters were obtained through laboratory experiments. The SINMAP model was used to evaluate the stability of shallow landslide under different rainfall conditions in the study area. Then the area of stability regions, the number of landslide points and landslide density under different rainfall levels were analyzed. The simulation results of SINMAP model show that the overall stability of the study area is relatively high. When the precipitation value is 8.6 mm, 15 mm, 25 mm, 50 mm and 100 mm, the area falling in instable classes (including high instable, instable and potentially instable)accounts for 9.12%, 18.93%, 23.17%, 30.94% and 38.67% of the total area respectively, and the unstable area does not exceed half of the area of the watershed. The landslide density of the high instable class is the largest, followed by the instable and potential instable class. The areas expand in instable classes with the increase of precipitation values, and the areas in high instable classes located in the place with steep slope and intensive fluvial erosion has a small change in area. The stability of shallow landslide depends a great extent on the local topography conditions:the elevation is between 1302~1606 m, the slope is between 20°~51°, and the largest number of shallow landslides is in the westward and northwest slope. Finally, the stability simulation results by SINMAP model is verified through landslide field investigation. SINMAP model provides a powerful tool to predict the stability of rainfall induced shallow loess landslides. It not only evaluates the stability of existing landslide, but also predicts the potential landslide in the future under different rainfall conditions, which will be helpful to prevent and mitigate the loss caused by landslide disaster and provide reference for reasonable urban planning and road siting. © 2019, Science Press (China).

TI  - Comparison Of Evapotranspiration Upscaling Methods From Instantaneous To Daytime Scale For Tea And Wheat In Southeast China
AB  - Accurately converting instantaneous evapotranspiration (λETi) at satellite over-passing time into daily evapotranspiration (λETd) is a key issue of applying remotely sensed data to estimate regional evapotranspiration (λET) from remote sensing satellites, which plays an important role for effective water resource management. The scaling methods that take advantage of the relationship between λET and other environmental factors and can be used to convert λETi into λETd. In this study, five scaling methods of converting λETi into λETd, including the evaporative fraction method (Eva-f method), revised evaporative fraction method (R-Eva-f method), crop coefficient method (Kc-ET0 method), revised crop coefficient method (R-Kc-ET0 method) and direct canopy resistance method (Direct-rc method), were evaluated based on the detailed meteorological data measured from 2016 to 2018 in a tea field and 2018 to 2020 in a wheat field in southeast China. The estimated λETd was compared with the measured λETd by the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method. The results indicated that the Eva-f and R-Eva-f methods with the mean root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of efficiency (ε) equaled 9.02 W m−2 and 0.92; 12.06 W m−2 and 0.89, respectively, were superior to the Kc-ET0, R-Kc-ET0 and Direct-rc method; the Kc-ET0 method with the mean RMSE and ε equaled 20.62 W m−2 and 0.79 was also a good option for simulating the λETd of tea and wheat; while the R-Kc-ET0 method simulated the λETd well for the wheat with mean RMSE and ε equaled 36.29 W m−2 and 0.71, but significantly overestimated the tea λETd with the mean RMSE and ε values of 39.61 W m−2 and 0.59 for tea; the Direct-rc method overestimated λETd of tea and wheat for the most of intervals with the mean RMSE and ε of 39.58 W m−2 and 0.62, and was not recommended to use in the present study areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote Characterization Of Photosynthetic Communities In The Fryxell Basin Of Taylor Valley, Antarctica
AB  - We investigate the spatial distribution, spectral properties and temporal variability of primary producers (e.g. communities of microbial mats and mosses) throughout the Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, using high-resolution multispectral remote-sensing data. Our results suggest that photosynthetic communities can be readily detected throughout the Fryxell basin based on their unique near-infrared spectral signatures. Observed intra- and inter-annual variability in spectral signatures are consistent with short-term variations in mat distribution, hydration and photosynthetic activity. Spectral unmixing is also implemented in order to estimate mat abundance, with the most densely vegetated regions observed from orbit correlating spatially with some of the most productive regions of the Fryxell basin. Our work establishes remote sensing as a valuable tool in the study of these ecological communities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and demonstrates how future scientific investigations and the management of specially protected areas could benefit from these tools and techniques.

TI  - The Green Divide And Heat Exposure: Urban Transformation Projects In Istanbul
AB  - Extreme heat events are happening more frequently and with greater severity, causing significant negative consequences, especially for vulnerable urban populations around the globe. Heat stress is even more common in cities with dense and irregular planning and lacking urban blue-green infrastructures. This study investigates the greening and cooling effects of five selected urban transformation projects and their surrounding areas (within a 10-min walking distance) in Istanbul from 2013 to 2021, with a focus on environmental justice and climate adaptation planning perspectives. By employing temporal analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) values derived from Landsat data sets to detect changes in these five selected urban transformation projects in the megacity of Turkiye, Istanbul, this study finds that the distribution of green infrastructures (e.g., tree canopy) is only limited to project sites of long-running and state-supported urban transformation projects in Istanbul. Consequently, the unequal distribution of green infrastructures creates cooling effects only for the locals residing in the new residential projects. However, the surrounding areas have less urban green infrastructure and are exposed more to the urban heat over time. Urban development policies and planning highly contribute to increasing the climate vulnerabilities among those who do not benefit from the recently developed residential units in Istanbul. Such a trend can affect adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities and redress environmental injustices in urban planning in the megacity of Istanbul.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Evolution Of Multi-Scale Green Space Environments And Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study Of Beijing Sub-Center
AB  - With the rapid development of global industrialization and urbanization and the aggravation of climate warming, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become an important environmental problem affecting human survival and development. In 2020, China clearly set a "dual carbon" target. Because the location and layout of urban green space are related to the function of carbon sink, the study of the relationship between the construction of urban green spaces and the heat island effect is of great significance. This study was based on Landsat 8 remote sensing images of the Tongzhou District, Beijing, from 2013 to 2019 and examined the effect of urban green space construction and the heat island effect in the Tongzhou District at three scales: the macro level of the overall construction environment, the meso level of the urban area, and the micro level of the individual park. The results show that: (1) when the vegetation coverage was increased by 10\% in the Tongzhou District, the temperature decreased by 0.58-0.68 celcius; (2) the change in the heat island in the Tongzhou District had a circular layered structure, the degree of mitigation produced by green space in different circles differed, and the effect of urban and rural transition areas was obvious; and (3) parks have different effects on the temperature drop inside and outside the park. The cooling benefit was higher when the area of an individual park was 105 ha or less, and a park including both forest and wetland had better cooling ability. This study clarifies the direction of urban space cooling and carbon control at different levels and proposes a multi-scale planning decision-making process for urban green space based on temperature orientation, thereby providing a theoretical reference for macro policy, standards, planning, and park design of urban green spaces.

TI  - Natural Conditions And Anthropogenic Change Of The Coastal Zone In The Area Of Kacha Village
AB  - Development of not yet used parts of the coastal zone poses the task of developing appropriate management principles based on scientific ideas and forecast. The aim of the work is to characterize natural conditions, features of lithodynamics and anthropogenic impact on the coastal area adjacent to the village of Kacha (Sevastopol region); using this site as a case, to demonstrate the problems arising out of economic development; and to give recommendations for rational use of natural resources. The data of repeated geomorphological surveys, observations of the coastline dynamics at the controls, measurements of the beach profiles were analyzed using the results of tacheometric and photogrammetric surveys, satellite images, and other materials. Geological and geomorphological conditions and lithodynamics are considered in detail. In the area under study, a complex pattern of redistribution of sediment volumes is observed; it is characterized by a significant seasonal and interannual variability of alongshore sediment migrations. The average rate of the cliff edge retreat is 0.43 m/year in the northern part of the site, 0.04 m/year in the central part and 0.10 m/year in the southern part. At the same time, the central part of the cliff falls due to soil crumbling in the absence of landslides. According to satellite data, over a 2 km area centered at the Nemetskaya Clough, average displacement of the cliff edge was about 0.27 m/year in the period from 2004 to 2016. The most probable average annual value of sediment input due to destruction of cliffs is about 6,000 m3/year. Provided earlier in the literature, the values of the cliff retreat and sediment influx due to its destruction are not confirmed by the data of long-term observations and seem to the authors to be significantly overestimated. Specific cases of hazardous exogenous processes (landslides) and current anthropogenic impact on the coastal zone are considered. Specific recommendations are given for further economic development of the coastal zone. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Benefits Of High Resolution Pm2.5 Prediction Using Satellite Maiac Aod And Land Use Regression For Exposure Assessment: California Examples
AB  - This study estimated annual average ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at 1 km resolution using satellite Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD), land use parameters, and meteorology in California for the year 2016 (cross-validation R2 = 0.73 (site-based) and 0.81 (observation-based)). Using these high-resolution PM2.5 estimates, regionally varying urban enhancements of PM2.5 concentrations, 1.43-2.77 μg/m3 (23.9-36.2%), were identified in the densely populated air basins of San Francisco Bay Area, San Joaquin Valley, and South Coast. On the other hand, within-urban PM2.5 variability was found to be 31.4-35.6% of between-urban variability across California. However, this pattern was not consistent from region to region, even showing higher within-urban variability (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area). In addition, satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations were statistically significantly associated with demographic factors (i.e., % people of color, % poverty, and % low education) with the strongest positive association with % people of color (1.05 and 2.72 μg/m3 increases per interquartile range (IQR) and range increases, respectively). The fine-scale PM2.5 estimates enabled the assessment of long-term PM2.5 exposures for all populations particularly benefiting rural populations and socially vulnerable populations widely distributed in each urban area. This study provided evidence of regionally varying exposure misclassification that would arise without accounting for rural and within-urban exposure variabilities.

TI  - Rapid Implementation Of Home Oxygen Treatment And Remote Monitoring For Covid-19 Patients At The Verge Of The Omicron Wave In Turku, Finland
AB  - Background: In Turku, Finland, we introduced a home oxygen treatment and app-based monitoring program for hospitalized COVID-19 patients to facilitate an early discharge during the Omicron wave. In this case series we explore the clinical parameters of patients enrolled in the program and evaluate the cost–benefit and safety issues of the program. Methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with marked hypoxemia but otherwise in stable condition were screened from Turku City Hospital and Turku University Hospital by treating doctors for eligibility in the program. Peripheral oxygen saturation of > 92% and breathing frequency < 30/min in rest with oxygen supplementation were among the criteria. All patients actively participating in the program between 10th of January 2022 and 30th of September 2022 were included in this case series. Clinical data of hospitalization and monitoring were analysed, and cost–benefit evaluation was based on the number of saved hospitalization days. Results: Nineteen COVID-19 patients were included in this case series and recruited from three different hospital departments in the Turku city region, South-West Finland. All patients were male, the median age was 59 years and the median duration of hospitalization before enrolment in the program was 6 days (range 3—20 days). The median duration of home oxygen treatment was 13 days (range 3—72 days) and the median duration of home monitoring was 18 days (range 7—41 days). A total of 210,5 hospital days were prevented, resulting in savings of €144,490 of healthcare expenditure (on average 9 days and €7,605 per patient). No major safety issues were reported during the program. Conclusions: In our case series, home oxygen treatment combined with home monitoring was safe and economically beneficial. Application based monitoring could be considered in other post-acute pulmonary conditions to reduce hospitalization and healthcare costs. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Analysis Of Shrines Properties Using Remote Sensing Approach: Case Study Of Lembah Bujang
AB  - The heritage of Lembah Bujang, Kedah is important as a starting point to understand the origins and history of civilization in Malaysia. This research is to analyze the spectral reflectance of shrines properties in an identified area by using remote sensing techniques in conserving this cultural heritage site. The remote sensing device (Spectroradiometer) was used to measure the spectral reflectance of the source of shrines in the study area. This tool was applied for reflectance's test over properties such as ancient brick, granite, literates and iron in a different two study areas consist of Lembah Bujang and Kompleks Sungai Batu. Remote sensing test properties demonstrate that discrimination of properties types of each civilization is possible through reflection measurement, but that discrimination is complicated by surface conditions, such as weathering and lichen growth. Comparison between clays, granite and iron show that clays to be more reflective than granite and iron. This result will help more in our further study on detecting these properties direct through remote sensing imagery and will be helpful in developing new indexes and selection of threshold value on shrines material in the case study of Lembah Bujang. © 2016 by MIP.

TI  - Dynamic Ocean Management: Identifying The Critical Ingredients Of Dynamic Approaches To Ocean Resource Management
AB  - Dynamic ocean management, or management that uses near real-time data to guide the spatial distribution of commercial activities, is an emerging approach to balance ocean resource use and conservation. Employing a wide range of data types, dynamic ocean management can be used to meet multiple objectives for example, managing target quota, bycatch reduction, and reducing interactions with species of conservation concern. Here, we present several prominent examples of dynamic ocean management that highlight the utility, achievements, challenges, and potential of this approach. Regulatory frameworks and incentive structures, stakeholder participation, and technological applications that align with user capabilities are identified as key ingredients to support successful implementation. By addressing the variability inherent in ocean systems, dynamic ocean management represents a new approach to tackle the pressing challenges of managing a fluid and complex environment.

TI  - Sparse Representation-Based Inundation Depth Estimation Using Sar Data And Digital Elevation Model
AB  - Floods increase every year worldwide, and prompt information about the affected areas is essential for early disaster response. There has been extensive development in applying remote sensing data to identify floods. In fact, remote sensing data are the only tool to identify the extent of large-scale floods within hours after their occurrence. However, few studies have addressed methods to estimate inundation depth. Inundation depth can be advantageous for identifying areas where people may need assistance during evacuation and estimating damage loss. We present a practical application of sparse representation that integrates a synthetic aperture radar-based flood binary map with a digital elevation model to estimate inundation depths. We assume that the floodwaters can be modeled as a combination of water bodies at a state of rest. A dictionary of water bodies computed under potential inundation levels is constructed from the digital elevation model. Then, the actual flood extent is represented as a sparse linear combination of the water body dictionary. The inundation depth can be estimated because each water body from the linear combination is associated with an inundation level. To assess our proposed procedure, we computed the inundation depth of the flood in the town of Mabi, Okayama Prefecture, produced during the 2018 heavy rainfall. An average absolute value difference of about 60 cm between our results and a field survey performed by a third party was observed. Two other floods produced by the 2019 Hagibis typhoon were analyzed to illustrate the relevant information that can provide inundation depths. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Assessment Of Pm2.5 Concentrations And Exposure In China From 2013 To 2017 Using Satellite-Derived Data
AB  - Satellite-based estimation of fine particulate matter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) at a high spatiotemporal resolution is important to understand the detailed dynamics of PM2.5 pollution and exposure. Stricter clean air policies have been enacted in recent years to tackle China's serious problem with PM2.5 pollution, including the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan between 2013 and 2017. However, assessment of the change in national PM2.5 exposure during this period is difficult due to the limitation of high-resolution PM2.5 data. To address this issue, a satellite-based spatiotemporal model was developed to predict daily high-resolution surface PM2.5 concentrations in China during the designated period, and quantitative analysis was then performed regarding the spatiotemporal characteristics of this critical pollutant. The corresponding changes in the population exposure to PM2.5 were also explored at a fine scale. The overall concentrations of PM2.5 declined from 2013 to 2017, with substantial decreases in eastern China but negligible decreases in western China. The national PM2.5 concentration declined remarkably from 2013 to 2014 to 2015–2017. The Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei and Pearl River Delta regions and most cities reached the goals set by the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. However, despite the overall reduction in the PM2.5 concentration, by 2017 the vast majority of the Chinese population still lived in areas with sustained levels of high risk from fine particle pollution. The findings from this study have crucial environmental policy implications for the mitigation of PM2.5 pollution and could benefit PM2.5–related health studies in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Variability, Tendencies, And Climate Controls Of Terrestrial Evapotranspiration And Gross Primary Productivity In The Recent Decade Over China
AB  - Accurately estimating regional water and vegetation carbon fixation and understanding their covariation mechanisms will benefit regional water resources and ecosystem management. The process-based vegetation interface processes model was employed to simulate the spatiotemporal variations of evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation gross primary production (GPP) over the land mass of China, by integrating the 8-day Terra-MODIS leaf area index dataset from 2000 to 2013. It is found that there are remarkable spatial variations in annual ET and GPP across the country, top values being around 1,200mm for ET and 3,000gCm(-2) for GPP mostly occurred in the southern rainforests. Average annual ET and GPP are weakly increasing, in which about one third is significant. At annual scale, variability of ET follows precipitation variations, whereas variability of GPP follows variations of both precipitation and leaf area index. At monthly scale, variations of ET and GPP are more correlated with net radiation than precipitation. It is revealed that the climatic factors dominating water and carbon fluxes are different over the typical climate zones. The increasing GPP and water use efficiency are benefitting the regional vegetation recovery and carbon fixation, however, more water consumption may exaggerate the ecosystem vulnerability in water-limited zones.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Characterisation Of Droughts Using Selected Indices In Upper Tana River Watershed, Kenya
AB  - Monitoring and assessment of drought is key to modelling, impact assessment, mitigation and prediction of occurrence. The Upper Tana River watershed hosts two of Kenya's main water towers, Mt. Kenya and Aberdare Ranges, and is increasingly under threat from reduced water levels in the river basins due to unsustainable anthropogenic activities. The occurrence of drought in the region often exacerbates the impact of such activities on the natural resource-base. The study evaluated temporal and spatial characteristics of meteorological drought in Upper Tana Watershed using remotely sensed data from 1981 to 2018. Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Modern-Era Retro-Analysis for Research and Applications-Assimilation Model (MERRA) products provided precipitation and temperature data via Google Earth Engine platform. GeoClim was used in the retrieval of Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), while Standardised Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data were downloaded from SPEI Global Drought Monitor. Values for these datasets were plotted against time to facilitate temporal analysis of the drought. Spatially, the most intense meteorological drought period was from 2007 to 2009 in that the years were hit by severe drought for three consecutive years that covered the entire watershed. Temporally, drought incidences were observed in 1982, 1989, 1994, 2000, 2006, and 2011 and 2017. Both SPI and SPEI indices showed similar drought years. Drought mitigation measures should be implemented across the watershed. The findings provide insights that can be used by natural resource management practitioners in; drought forecasting, early warning systems, and in planning and management of water resources within the watershed. We recommend characterisation of the other types of droughts, agricultural and socio-economic droughts, for a holistic understanding of their spatial-temporal manifestations and the impact on the livelihoods of the watershed.

TI  - Assessment Of Site Index And Forest Growth Capacity Across The Pacific And Inland Northwest U.s.a. With A Modis Satellite-Derived Vegetation Index
AB  - It is difficult to map forest growth potential across regions with different environmental conditions from limited field measurements of productivity. Climatically sensitive biophysical models and remotely sensed data on vegetation offer the potential to overcome this problem. We combine both approaches in this paper. We calibrated the midsummer value of NASA's MODIS instrument's enhanced vegetation index (EVI) against site indices (SI) mapped at 10 widely dispersed locations for Douglas-fir or ponderosa pine, ranging in height from 16 to 48 m at 50 years (age at breast height). Median values of EVI derived from a 3 km × 3 km grid centered on commercial forest lands of known productive capacities produced a linear regression with site indices (R2 = 0.83). We matched stand growth properties generated by a physiologically based stand growth model (3-PG) with site-specific yield tables and inferred from model predictions, as well as from the literature, that a close relation exists between maximum leaf area index (max L), maximum periodic annual increment (max PAI), and SI. We tested the ability of median EVI to predict SI values derived from height and tree age measurements made at 5263 federal inventory and analysis (FIA) survey plots in Oregon with comparable success (R2 = 0.53) to that derived from previous application of 3-PG using 1 km resolution of climate and soil data. Based on the general agreement between the two approaches, we used mid-summer EVI valves to generate a 1 km resolution map predicting spatial variation in SI of Douglas-fir over 630,000 km2 in the Pacific and Inland Northwest, U.S.A. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Can Urbanisation Improve Household Welfare? Evidence From Ethiopia
AB  - Despite evolving evidence that Africa is experiencing urbanisation in a different way, empirical evaluations of the welfare implications of urban-development programs in Africa remain scant. We investigate the welfare implications of recent urbanisation processes in Ethiopia using household-level longitudinal data and satellite-based nightlight intensity. We also examine the impact of urban growth on the composition of household consumption and welfare. We employ temporal and spatial variations in nightlight intensity to capture urban expansion and growth. Controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity across individuals and localities, we find that urbanisation, as measured by nightlight intensity, is associated with significant welfare improvement. We find that tripling existing average nightlight intensity in a village is associated with a 42–46% improvement in household welfare. Urbanisation is also associated with a significant increase in the share of non-food consumption, which is a good measure of overall welfare and poverty. In addition, we find significant heterogeneity in urban expansion across major towns and small towns. Urban expansion in rural areas and small towns appears more impactful than similar expansion in major cities. Finally, quantile regression results suggest that better-off households are likely to benefit more from urban expansion, which may translate into higher inequality across households or communities. Our results can inform public policy debates on the consequences and implications of urban expansion in Africa. © The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Principal Resilience And Vitality In Extremis The Scenario Of Involuntary Occupational Dissolution
AB  - Purpose High-stakes accountability and continuous multi-faceted pressures of the principalship require leaders to develop a broad range of personal qualities including resilience and personal vitality. Scant research exists on what happens to school principals when careers abruptly and involuntarily end, and the purpose of this paper is sought to hear principals' accounts of their experiences and to identify whether these personal qualities assist recovery and career re-identification. Design/methodology/approach A collaborative English and Australian study of former principals aimed to evaluate effects of involuntary job loss from their own perspectives. In total, 12 case studies involved one-on-one interviews during a two-year period revealing impact of job loss, coping strategies, resilience and personal vitality. Findings Successful management indicators were found: personal qualities, including the ability to retain a perspective and big picture view of career journey; an enduring love of teaching; health and fitness; study; getting another suitable post; and psychological and medical support. Time taken to regain pre-existing levels of personal vitality varied significantly based on resilience and contextual circumstances, whilst psychological and social support from family and professional colleagues was invaluable for recovery. Originality/value This international study presents an original insight into effects of principals' sudden job loss - a perspective which has imposing pastoral relevance for employing authorities, professional associations and collegial networks. Aspiring and current principals may feel, "There but for the grace of God, go I", and it is they who may need ultimately to be prepared for what is an increasingly common occurrence in schools across the world.

TI  - Assessing Coastal Bathymetry And Climate Change Impacts On Coastal Ecosystems Using Landsat 8 And Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are facing heightened risks due to human-induced climate change, including rising water levels and intensified storm events. Accurate bathymetry data is crucial for assessing the impacts of these threats. Traditional data collection methods can be cost-prohibitive. This study investigates the feasibility of using freely accessible Landsat and Sentinel satellite imagery to estimate bathymetry and its correlation with hydrographic chart soundings in Port Klang, Malaysia. Through analysis of the blue and green spectral bands from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 datasets, a bathymetry map of Port Klang's seabed is generated. The precision of this derived bathymetry is evaluated using statistical metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination. The results reveal a strong statistical connection (R2 = 0.9411) and correlation (R2 = 0.7958) between bathymetry data derived from hydrographic chart soundings and satellite imagery. This research not only advances our understanding of employing Landsat imagery for bathymetry assessment but also underscores the significance of such assessments in the context of climate change's impact on coastal ecosystems. The primary goal of this research is to contribute to the comprehension of Landsat imagery's utility in bathymetry evaluation, with the potential to enhance safety protocols in seaport terminals and provide valuable insights for decision-making concerning the management of coastal ecosystems amidst climate-related challenges. The findings of this research have practical implications for a wide range of stakeholders involved in coastal management, environmental protection, climate adaptation and disaster preparedness.

TI  - First Space-Based Derivation Of The Global Atmospheric Methanol Emission Fluxes
AB  - This study provides improved methanol emission estimates on the global scale, in particular for the largest methanol source, the terrestrial biosphere, and for biomass burning. To this purpose, one complete year of spaceborne measurements of tropospheric methanol columns retrieved for the first time by the thermal infrared sensor IASI aboard the MetOp satellite are compared with distributions calculated by the IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1 emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source totals 187 Tg yr(-1) with a contribution of 100 Tg yr(-1) from plants, only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr(-1). Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 \%) and Indonesia (up to 58 \%), whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20-25 \%) and Central Africa (25-35 \%). On the other hand, the biogenic source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2), probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union. The robustness of the derived fluxes to changes in convective updraft fluxes, in methanol removal processes, and in the choice of the biogenic a priori inventory is assessed through sensitivity inversions. Detailed comparisons of the model with a number of aircraft and surface observations of methanol, as well as new methanol measurements in Europe and in the Reunion Island show that the satellite-derived methanol emissions improve significantly the agreement with the independent data, giving thus credence to the IASI dataset.

TI  - Time Series Model Prediction And Trend Variability Of Aerosol Optical Depth Over Coal Mines In India
AB  - A study of the assessment and management of air quality was carried out at 11 coal mines in India. Long-term observations (about 13 years, March 2000-December 2012) and modeling of aerosol loading over coal mines in India are analyzed in the present study. In this respect, the Box-Jenkins popular autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to simulate the monthly mean Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD(550 nm)) over 11 sites in the coal mines region. The ARIMA model was found as the most suitable model with least normalized Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and root mean square error and high value of R (2). Estimation was done with the Ljung-Box test. Finally, a forecast for a 3-year period from January 2013 to December 2015 was calculated which showed that the model forecasted values are following the observed trend quite well over all mining areas in India. The average values of AOD for the next 3 years (2013-2015) at all sites are found to be 0.575 +/- 0.13 (Raniganj), 0.452 +/- 0.12 (Jharia), 0.339 +/- 0.13 (Bokaro), 0.280 +/- 0.09 (Bishrampur), 0.353 +/- 0.13 (Korba), 0.308 +/- 0.08 (Talcher), 0.370 +/- 0.11 (Wardha), 0.35 +/- 0.10 (Adilabad), 0.325 +/- 0.09 (Warangal), 0.467 +/- 0.09 (Godavari Valley), and 0.236 +/- 0.07 (Cuddapah), respectively. In addition, long-term lowest monthly mean AOD(550) values are observed over Bishrampur followed by Cuddapah, Talcher, Warangal, Adilabad, Korba, Wardha, Godavari Valley, Jharia, and Raniganj. Raniganj and Jharia exhibit the highest AOD values due to opencast mines and extensive mining activities as well as a large number of coal fires. Similarly, the highest AOD values are observed during the monsoon season among all four seasons over all the mining sites. Raniganj exhibits the highest AOD value at all seasons and at all sites. In contrast, the lowest seasonal AOD values are observed during the post-monsoon season over Raniganj, Talcher, Wardha, Adilabad, Warangal, and Godavari Valley. Similarly, over Jharia, Bokaro, Bishrampur, Korba, and Cuddapah, the lowest AOD values are found in the winter season. Increasing trends in AOD(550) have been observed over Raniganj, Bokaro, Bishrampur, Korba, Talcher, and Wardha as well as over Adilabad and Godavari Valley, which is in agreement with previous works. Negative or decreasing AOD trend is found only over Jharia, Warangal, and Cuddapah without being statistically significant. Seasonal trends in AODs have also been studied in the present paper.

TI  - Proximity Forest: An Effective And Scalable Distance-Based Classifier For Time Series
AB  - Research into the classification of time series has made enormous progress in the last decade. The UCR time series archive has played a significant role in challenging and guiding the development of new learners for time series classification. The largest dataset in the UCR archive holds 10,000 time series only; which may explain why the primary research focus has been on creating algorithms that have high accuracy on relatively small datasets. This paper introduces Proximity Forest, an algorithm that learns accurate models from datasets with millions of time series, and classifies a time series in milliseconds. The models are ensembles of highly randomized Proximity Trees. Whereas conventional decision trees branch on attribute values (and usually perform poorly on time series), Proximity Trees branch on the proximity of time series to one exemplar time series or another; allowing us to leverage the decades of work into developing relevant measures for time series. Proximity Forest gains both efficiency and accuracy by stochastic selection of both exemplars and similarity measures. Our work is motivated by recent time series applications that provide orders of magnitude more time series than the UCR benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity Forest is highly competitive on the UCR archive: it ranks among the most accurate classifiers while being significantly faster. We demonstrate on a 1M time series Earth observation dataset that Proximity Forest retains this accuracy on datasets that are many orders of magnitude greater than those in the UCR repository, while learning its models at least 100,000 times faster than current state-of-the-art models Elastic Ensemble and COTE. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Ecofire: Regional-Scale Prescribed Burning Increases The Annual Carrying Capacity Of Livestock On Pastoral Properties By Reducing Pasture Loss From Wildfire
AB  - Prescribed burning is an important management tool in the extensive pastoral lands in northern Australia. It can be used to influence grazing patterns, increase the nutritive value of pastures, reduce the density of woody shrubs and reduce the risk of damaging wildfires. The consequences of regional-scale prescribed burning on pasture availability and annual carrying capacities of pastoral properties in northern Australia were examined using EcoFire, a fire management program in the Kimberley Region of north-west Australia, as an example. Theoretical long-term carrying capacities of land systems, and fire scar imagery from years before (2004-06) and during EcoFire (2007-11) were used to model the impact of the program on the seasonality and extent of fire-induced losses in annual carrying capacity, and the likelihood of properties experiencing catastrophic losses in a given year. Over the 5 years that EcoFire has been running, it has resulted in a progressive reduction in the loss of annual carrying capacity caused by the burning of pasture, and shifted the season that annual carrying capacity is lost to fire from predominantly the late to the early dry season. Most notably, the established program has reduced the probability of experiencing catastrophic loss (defined here as >50\% of annual carrying capacity removed due to fire) from 18 incidences to three incidences within a 3-year period. These outcomes have the potential to deliver economic benefits to pastoralists via increased annual carrying capacity and by improvements in pasture condition, provided stocking rates and pasture utilisation are managed carefully.

TI  - Spatial Assessment Of Para Rubber (Hevea Brasiliensis) Above Ground Biomass Potentials In Songkhla Province, Southern Thailand
AB  - Currently, Songkhla Province of Thailand has been recognized as a convenient hub of rubber industry development, accompanied by an attendant abundance of rubber tree plantations. A spatialized assessment of the rubber tree was carried out to estimate its aboveground biomass potentials using remote sensing techniques and ecosystem modeling procedures. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite-based estimations of the net primary productivity were derived and complemented with a calculated generic model, to quantify the respective above ground biomass potentials para rubber. Above ground biomass assessment findings revealed a mean value of 82.1 tonnes C ha(-1) and an aggregate of 31. 9 million tonnes C ha(-1) which is the theoretical potential, this is segregated into energy usable, and other economic purpose biomass potentials, with corresponding value ranges of 1624.1 to 6,041,531.2 million tonnes C ha(-1) and 85.5 to 317,975.6 thousand tonnes C ha(-1) respectively. Besides the theoretical above ground biomass potential (entire biomass accumulation ratio) commonly evaluated, the other potentials, which include naturally obtainable biomass usable for energy generation and the remaining share of the feedstock for non-energy uses, have been brought to light. Songkhla province has the potential for good carbon sink and sustainable supply of different pools of feedstock from the rubber tree that reinforces each other in providing a comprehensive view of biomass in energy and non-energy opportunities. The socioeconomic production and value chain analysis of the identified biomass pools needs to be evaluated; this will consequently guide policy toward a comprehensive rubber sector sustainable development.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability And Influencing Factors Of Aerosol Optical Depth Over The Pan Yangtze River Delta During The 2014-2017 Period
AB  - Large amounts of aerosol particles suspended in the atmosphere pose a serious challenge to the climate and human health. In this study, we produced a dataset through merging the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometers (MODIS) Collection 6.1 3-km resolution Dark Target aerosol optical depth (DT AOD) with the 10-km resolution Deep Blue aerosol optical depth (DB AOD) data by linear regression and made use of it to unravel the spatiotemporal characteristics of aerosols over the Pan Yangtze River Delta (PYRD) region from 2014 to 2017. Then, the geographical detector method and multiple linear regression analysis were employed to investigate the contributions of influencing factors. Results indicate that: (1) compared to the original Terra DT and Aqua DT AOD data, the average daily spatial coverage of the merged AOD data increased by 94\% and 132\%, respectively; (2) the values of four-year average AOD were high in the north-east and low in the south-west of the PYRD; (3) the annual average AOD showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2017 while the seasonal average AOD reached its maximum in spring; and that (4) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and slope contributed most to the spatial distribution of AOD, followed by precipitation and population density. Our study highlights the spatiotemporal variability of aerosol optical depth and the contributions of different factors over this large geographical area in the four-year period, and can, therefore, provide useful insights into the air pollution control for decision makers.

TI  - Gis-Based Urban Afforestation Spatial Patterns And A Strategy For Pm2.5 Removal
AB  - Within the scope of ecological development planning in China, afforestation is highly valued. However, the scientific planning of afforestation still has inadequacies. There are few studies on the spatial distribution of urban forests targeted at air quality improvement. Here, we implemented a virtual experiment to evaluate whether different tree planting distribution plans with the same afforestation scale would have a significant effect on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) removal. As a case study of Wuhan, this paper identified the statistical regularity between PM2.5 concentration and adsorption of representative trees through field sampling and measurement, simulated the influence of different afforestation plans on PM2.5 concentration based on Geographic Information System (GIS), judged the significance of the difference of the plans, and proposed a greening distribution strategy. The results show that different forest layouts had no significant impact on PM2.5 in the administrative region, and the concentration reduction rate was only 1-2%. Targeted planting of trees in heavily polluted areas in the city center would have achieved better air quality improvement, with a reduction rate of 3-5%. In Wuhan construction areas, trees should be planted to increase the forest coverage rate to 30%. The edge of the urban metropolitan development zone needs to be strengthened with trees to form a forest belt 10 km-20 km wide, with a forest coverage rate of at least 60%. In general, the capability of trees to reduce PM2.5 concentration is weak. The fundamental way to improve air quality is to reduce emissions; planting trees is only an auxiliary measure. More ecological forest functions should be considered in city-wide afforestation distribution. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics And Driving Forces Of Urban Land-Use Expansion: A Case Study Of The Yangtze River Economic Belt, China
AB  - It is important to analyze the expansion of an urban area and the factors that drive its expansion. Therefore, this study is based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) night lighting data, using the landscape index, spatial expansion strength index, compactness index, urban land fractal index, elasticity coefficient, the standard deviation ellipse, spatial correlation analysis, and partial least squares regression to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of urban land expansion and its driving factors in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) over a long period of time. The results show the following: Through the calculation of the eight landscape pattern indicators, we found that during the study period, the number of cities and towns and the area of urban built-up areas in the YREB are generally increasing. Furthermore, the variations in these landscape pattern indicators not only show more frequent exchanges and interactions between the cities and towns of the YREB, but also reflect significant instability and irregularity of the urbanization development in the YREB. The spatial expansion intensity indices of 1992-1999, 1999-2006, and 2006-2013 were 0.03, 0.16, and 0.34, respectively. On the whole, the urban compactness of the YREB decreased with time, and the fractal dimension increased slowly with time. Moreover, the long axis and the short axis of the standard deviation ellipse of the YREB underwent a small change during the inspection period. The spatial distribution generally showed the pattern of "southwest-north". In terms of gravity shift, during the study period, the center of gravity moved from northeast to southwest. In addition, the Moran's I values for the four years of 1992, 1999, 2006, and 2013 were 0.451, 0.495, 0.506, and 0.424, respectively. Furthermore, by using correlation analysis, we find that the correlation coefficients between these four driving indicators and the urban expansion of the YREB were: 0.963, 0.998, 0.990 and 0.994, respectively. Through the use of partial least squares regression, we found that in 1992-2013, the four drivers of urban land expansion in the YREB were ranked as follows: gross domestic product (GDP), total fixed asset investment, urban population, total retail sales of consumer goods.

TI  - Assessing Trends And Predicting The Cover Management Factor In A Tropical Island State Using Enhanced Vegetation Index
AB  - Soil erosion is a complex process involving multiple factors that contribute to the amount of soil loss. The amount of vegetation cover is one of the main factors used to estimate soil loss and is an important risk factor in informing land use management and soil conservation policies. Cover/crop management (C-factor) is a dynamic soil loss factor and analysing C-factor trends in the context of both space and time, to build a multi-dimensional data structure, increased the value of the trend analysis. The objectives of the study were to (1) utilise EVI dependent static and dynamic predictive equations to compute the C-factor, and (2) to investigate the spatio-temporal changes of the C-factor and hotspots in a tropical small island developing state (SIDS) from 2010 to 2019. ArcGIS Model Builder was utilised to automate the computation of the C-factor using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data and compute the ordinary least square regression. Spatio-temporal analysis was performed using the novel emerging hot spot analysis in ArcGIS to identify statistically significant hot and cold spot trends of cover management to locate new, intensifying, persistent, or sporadic hot spot patterns at different time-step intervals. The regression output for the C-factor and EVI values indicated a strong r(2), explaining on average 90\% of the models. There was no statistically significant (P value>0.05) increase in C-factor trend over a 10 year period (2010-2019, P-value=0.92), a 5 year period (2015-2019; P-value=0.59), or a 3 year period (2017-2019; P-Value=0.31). Our results showed that intensifying hot spots (27\%) were concentrated along the north-south corridor of the study area, highlighting areas with a statistically significant increase of the C-factor, thus a reduction in vegetation cover over the study period. Integrating spatio-temporal data and spatial technology provided vital cover management estimates for soil practitioners and farmers to guide conservation strategies.

TI  - The Progression In Employer Branding And Employee-Based Brand Equity: Scholar Api-Based Systematic Literature Review
AB  - Aim/purpose - This paper systematically reviews the literature of employer branding (EB) and employee-based brand equity (EBBE) using the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Google Scholar. While combining EB and EBBE this paper considers both the perspective of current, as well as potential employees and provides a systematization of knowledge related to organizational attractiveness and the impact of employees on the organizational brand. Design/methodology/approach - This study reviews the progresses in employer branding since 2009 to 2022, therefore ranging from the time that the concept of employee-based brand equity was proposed by King and Grace (2009). A four-stage process empowered by was used to review the existing literature: 1) to identify the current tendencies Google Trends search was applied; 2) to search the databases and to identify the most active contributors (publishers and authors) the scholar API was used; 3) PRISMA-S checklist was applied to ensure the rigorousness of systematic literature review; 4) to expose the interdependence of the concepts a bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer 1.6.18 software; 5) finally this study proposes a comprehensive framework of employer branding. Findings - The research on employer branding has grown substantially in the past decades and various conceptual and empirical studies have advanced the knowledge of both employer and internal branding. Still, the progression in the literature is narrow due to complexity of the field. This study identifies the main dimensions of employer branding and offers a comprehensive framework to systematize the current state of art. Research implications/limitations - The multidisciplinary nature of employer branding has led to a dispersed understanding of constructs and applications in the academic studies. This study focuses on the marketing/branding perspective and does not consider the studies grounded purely in human resource management. Originality/value/contribution - This study increases our understanding of the current literature and new research trends in employer branding and employee-based brand equity. Additionally, it explains the link between EB and EBBE. While applying the recently developed scholar API and artificial intelligence empowered software to conduct the systematic review, this study creates a procedure that can be used by researchers in an array of fields. © 2023 Joanna Krywalski Santiago, published by Sciendo.

TI  - Potential Of Sentinel-2a Data To Model Surface And Canopy Fuel Characteristics In Relation To Crown Fire Hazard
AB  - Background: Crown fires are often intense and fast spreading and hence can have serious impacts on soil, vegetation, and wildlife habitats. Fire managers try to prevent the initiation and spread of crown fires in forested landscapes through fuel management. The minimum fuel conditions necessary to initiate and propagate crown fires are known to be strongly influenced by four stand structural variables: surface fuel load (SFL), fuel strata gap (FSG), canopy base height (CBH), and canopy bulk density (CBD). However, there is often a lack of quantitative data about these variables, especially at the landscape scale. Methods: In this study, data from 123 sample plots established in pure, even-aged, Pinus radiata and Pinus pinaster stands in northwest Spain were analyzed. In each plot, an intensive field inventory was used to characterize surface and canopy fuels load and structure, and to estimate SFL, FSG, CBH, and CBD. Equations relating these variables to Sentinel-2A (S-2A) bands and vegetation indices were obtained using two non-parametric techniques: Random Forest (RF) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Results: According to the goodness-of-fit statistics, RF models provided the most accurate estimates, explaining more than 12\%, 37\%, 47\%, and 31\% of the observed variability in SFL, FSG, CBH, and CBD, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the four equations considered, the observed and estimated values of the four fuel variables were used separately to predict the potential type of wildfire (surface fire, passive crown fire, or active crown fire) for each plot, considering three different burning conditions (low, moderate, and extreme). The results of the confusion matrix indicated that 79.8\% of the surface fires and 93.1\% of the active crown fires were correctly classified; meanwhile, the highest rate of misclassification was observed for passive crown fire, with 75.6\% of the samples correctly classified. Conclusions: The results highlight that the combination of medium resolution imagery and machine learning techniques may add valuable information about surface and canopy fuel variables at large scales, whereby crown fire potential and the potential type of wildfire can be classified.

TI  - Introducing Two Random Forest Based Methods For Cloud Detection In Remote Sensing Images
AB  - Cloud detection is a necessary phase in satellite images processing to retrieve the atmospheric and lithospheric parameters. Currently, some cloud detection methods based on Random Forest (RF) model have been proposed but they do not consider both spectral and textural characteristics of the image. Furthermore, they have not been tested in the presence of snow/ice. In this paper, we introduce two RF based algorithms, Feature Level Fusion Random Forest (FLFRF) and Decision Level Fusion Random Forest (DLFRF) to incorporate visible, infrared (IR) and thermal spectral and textural features (FLFRF) including Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern (RELBP_CI) or visible, IR and thermal classifiers (DLFRF) for highly accurate cloud detection on remote sensing images. FLFRF first fuses visible, IR and thermal features. Thereafter, it uses the RF model to classify pixels to cloud, snow/ice and background or thick cloud, thin cloud and background. DLFRF considers visible, IR and thermal features (both spectral and textural) separately and inserts each set of features to RF model. Then, it holds vote matrix of each run of the model. Finally, it fuses the classifiers using the majority vote method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, 10 Terra MODIS and 15 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images with different spatial resolutions are used in this paper. Quantitative analyses are based on manually selected ground truth data. Results show that after adding RELBP_CI to input feature set cloud detection accuracy improves. Also, the average cloud kappa values of FLFRF and DLFRF on MODIS images (1 and 0.99) are higher than other machine learning methods, Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (0.96). The average snow/ice kappa values of FLFRF and DLFRF on MODIS images (1 and 0.85) are higher than other traditional methods. The quantitative values on Landsat 8 images show similar trend. Consequently, while SVM and K-nearest neighbor show overestimation in predicting cloud and snow/ice pixels, our Random Forest (RF) based models can achieve higher cloud, snow/ice kappa values on MODIS and thin cloud, thick cloud and snow/ice kappa values on Landsat 8 images. Our algorithms predict both thin and thick cloud on Landsat 8 images while the existing cloud detection algorithm, Fmask cannot discriminate them. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our algorithms have acquired higher average cloud and snow/ice kappa values for different spatial resolutions. © 2018 COSPAR

TI  - Predicting Wildfire Vulnerability Using Logistic Regression And Artificial Neural Networks: A Case Study In Brazil's Federal District
AB  - Predicting the spatial distribution of wildfires is an important step towards proper wildfire management. In this work, we applied two data-mining models commonly used to predict fire occurrence - logistic regression (LR) and an artificial neural network (ANN) - to Brazil's Federal District, located inside the Brazilian Cerrado. We used Landsat-based burned area products to generate the dependent variable, and nine different anthropogenic and environmental factors as explanatory variables. The models were optimised via feature selection for best area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and then validated with real burn area data. The models had similar performance, but the ANN model showed better AUC (0.77) and accuracy values when evaluating exclusively non-burned areas (73.39\%), whereas it had worse accuracy overall (66.55\%) when classifying burned areas, in which LR performed better (65.24\%). Moreover, we compared the contribution of each variable to the models, adding some insight into the main causes of wildfires in the region. The main driving aspects of the burned area distribution were land-use type and elevation. The results showed good performance for both models tested. These studies are still scarce despite the importance of the Brazilian savanna.

TI  - Assessing Vulnerability Of Forest Ecosystem In The Indian Western Himalayan Region Using Trends Of Net Primary Productivity
AB  - The Himalayan ecosystem is one of the sensitive and fragile ecosystems with rich biodiversity that provides major ecosystem services. The study was conducted to measure the extent of vulnerability across forested grids of Uttarakhand—one of the States of Indian Western Himalayan (IWH) region. The forests of the state are exposed to various anthropogenic and natural climatic pressures, thus making them vulnerable. In this paper, we demonstrate how to map vulnerability of forest ecosystem by analyzing variability and trends of net primary productivity (NPP). The vulnerability of the forest ecosystem was evaluated through trends of sensitivity and adaptability of NPP. The sensitivity of a system was considered as the response degree of the system to climatic variability whereas adaptability was considered as the ability to maintain, recover or improve its structure in the face of climatic stresses. In our study, NPP was considered as the receptor of shock and stresses of climatic variability and human disturbances. We discuss the method and results with reference to productivity changes under the influence of changing climate for the forested landscape of a mountainous region. The results have been summarized to rank vulnerability at the level of administrative boundary of governance, i.e. district. Average value of vulnerability for all NPP pixels of forests grids in a district was used to compute the vulnerability at district level. The study will help forest managers in decision making for efficiently allocating resources and to prioritize management options in the identified regions to improve productivity in coming times. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Acetylcholinesterase Activity In The Terrestrial Snail Xeropicta Derbentina Transplanted In Apple Orchards With Different Pesticide Management Strategies
AB  - Apple orchards are highly manipulated crops in which large amounts of pesticides are used. Some of these pesticides lack target specificity and can cause adverse effects in non-target organisms. In order to evaluate the environmental risk of these products, the use of transplanted sentinel organisms avoids side-effects from past events and facilitate comparison of multiple sites in a short time. We released specimens of the terrestrial snail Xeropicta derbentina in each 5 of two kinds of apple orchards with either conventional or organic management strategies plus in a single abandoned orchard. After one month, individuals were retrieved in order to measure acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Mean values of AChE activity were significantly reduced in all conventional apple orchards compared to the others. Results show that the measurement of biomarkers such as AChE inhibition in transplated X. derbentina could be useful in the environmental risk assessment of post-authorized pesticides.

TI  - Incremental Evaluation Of The Ecosystem Service Value In The Ecological Restoration Area Of An Iron Mine
AB  - Mine ecological restoration can be divided into in situ restoration and alternative restoration of abandoned land, which is an im⁃ portant way to reduce the damage of mineral resources extraction to the ecological environment. Using remote sensing and GIS technology, three kinds of ecological restoration, namely slope greening of tailings bank, construction of wetland, and afforestation of an iron and steel enterprise in Inner Mongolia were selected. The ecosystem service value of different types of ecological restoration areas, which were pre⁃ viously iron mines, were investigated and evaluated. The results showed that：The area of the three ecological restoration areas increased in different degrees in 2016—2018, and the proportion of grassland area in the green area of the slope increased by 85.4 per cent compared with 2016; The wetland area in the constructed wet area increased by 33.3 per cent compared with 2016; The forested area of the afforesta⁃ tion area increased by 38.4 per cent compared with 2016; And the ecological restoration area of the green slope area and the artificial wet area gradually increased from east to west, and the ecological restoration of the afforestation area increased from east, west to the middle. The value of ecosystem services in the three ecological restoration areas increased in different degrees from 2016 to 2018; The total value of ecosystem services increased by 5.21 million yuan compared with 2016, and the value of ecosystem services in the three ecological restoration areas increased by 2.18 million, 2.59 million yuan, and 436 900 yuan; The value of ecological services for regulating green areas in the slope increased by 1.42 million yuan compared with 2016; The value of ecological services for regulating wetland services increased by 1.66 million yuan compared with 2016; And the value of the adjustment service in the afforestation area increased by 277 500 yuan compared with the value of 2016. The study provide a practical basis for mining enterprises to implement their main responsibility on ecological environment governance and actively perform mine ecological restoration. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Agricultural Resources and Environment.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing And Machine Learning To Detect Turbidity Anomalies In Hydroelectric Reservoirs
AB  - Monitoring water quality in reservoirs is essential for the maintenance of aquatic ecosystems and socioeconomic services. In this scenario, the observation of abrupt elevations of physicochemical parameters, such as turbidity and other indicators, can signal anomalies associated with the occurrence of critical events, requiring operational actions and planning to mitigate negative environmental impacts on water resources. This work aims to integrate Machine Learning methods specialized in anomaly detection with data obtained from remote sensing images to identify with high turbidity events in the surface water of the Tre<SIC>s Marias Hydroelectric Reservoir. Four distinct threshold-based scenarios were evaluated, in which the overall performance, based on F1-score, showed decreasing trends as the thresholds became more restrictive. In general, the anomaly identification maps generated through the models ratified the applicability of the methods in the diagnosis of surface water in reservoirs in distinct hydrological contexts (dry and wet), effectively identifying locations with anomalous turbidity values.

TI  - Dataset Of Human Interventions As Anthropogenic Perturbations On The Caribbean Coast Of Colombia
AB  - Human interventions on coastal areas are always causing environmental impact; however, most of the times inventories of those interventions are possibly not well structured, and surely without a specific standard. The raw data presented shows an exhaustive and systematic revision of satellite images on 1700 km of the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where 2743 human interventions were identified. These interventions are classified in 38 categories in order to assess their environmental impact at a regional scale. The filtered data shows the environmental impact obtained for each category and the values allotted to each of the four parameters used for this evaluation. Moreover, the data is filtered for each of the five environmental coastal units in which the Caribbean coast of Colombia is divided by national regulations. Finally, the filtered and processed data shows the analysis done to obtain the graphical results of a previously paper (An evaluation of human interventions in the anthropogenically disturbed Caribbean Coast of Colombia {[}1] ). Therefore, this dataset comprises three spreadsheets (xlsx) and two geographical files (kmz), which are ready to be used for any researcher, decision maker, land planner or practitioner interested in making further analysis on environmental impact assessment in coastal areas. Additionally, the dataset is carefully organised for educational exercises in such a manner that professors or lecturers can repeat the same steps in this study area or in their own, from the inventory to the final results.

TI  - A New Index For Assessing Tree Vigour Decline Based On Sentinel-2 Multitemporal Data. Application To Tree Failure Risk Management
AB  - Detection and monitoring of vigour decline are certainly useful for forest managers to support future interventions. In this work a new index, from Sentinel-2 retrieved NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series, is proposed, hereafter called 'normalized Vegetation Vigour Index (nVVI)', which is specifically designed to quantify and map tree vigour decline. Results proved that nVVI is negatively correlated to tree age (r = -0.815, p < 0.001): older or unhealthy trees showed low nVVI values; younger trees showed high nVVI possibly related to vigour increase. nVVI was, finally used within a Decision Support System (DSS) specifically designed to support tree failure risk management in wide areas, like the natural parks. It was found that such approach can result in an economic saving of about 52\% compared to more traditional tree stability surveys. If present, a nVVI map can highlight incipient vegetative anomalies permitting tree stability surveys to be better prioritized.

TI  - The History Of Intertidal Blue Mussel Beds In The North Frisian Wadden Sea In The 20th Century: Can We Define Reference Conditions For Conservation Targets By Analysing Aerial Photographs?
AB  - Conservation decisions often rely on defining a reference status for habitats and species to enable targets to be set and progress measured. Long-lasting and continual anthropogenic impacts on habitats and species make the setting of undisturbed reference values such as diversity, distribution, population size or other ecological characteristics, difficult. In turn this hampers assessment of ecological status.Within the Wadden Sea, intertidal blue mussel beds are important biogenic structures which can be clearly defined from the surrounding flats. As mussel beds are highly productive habitats, they are considered as biological quality indicators for coastal waters. Nonetheless the reference status provokes controversy in discussions between policymakers, stakeholders and researchers. In order to build on existing knowledge of intertidal blue mussel beds in the North Frisian Wadden Sea, we analysed aerial photographs from the 1930s, 1958, 1989, 1998 and 2010. We supplemented this remote sensing data with annual monitoring data from 1999 to 2009 obtained from analysis of aerial photographs and field surveys.Results show a generally high persistency of blue mussel beds likely over eight decades, although sites were probably not permanent throughout the time period and their areal extent had changed. Mussel beds occur mainly on the east side of the islands which provide shelter against storms from the west. Studies of aerial photographs for the 1930s and 1958 demonstrate the importance of historical data to an assessment of the current status of the beds. In particular they help assess the distribution and extent of mussel beds over time. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Determination Of Soil Erosion Risk Using Rusle Model And Soil Organic Carbon Loss In Alaca Catchment (Central Black Sea Region, Turkey)
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the major threats to the conservation of soil and water resources. For that reason, predictive erosion models are useful tools for evaluating soil erosion and developing soil erosion management plans. For this aim, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) function is a widely used erosion model. This research integrated the RUSLE with a geographic information system (GIS) to investigate the spatial distribution of annual soil loss potential in the Alaca catchment in north central Black Sea region, Turkey. The rainfall erosivity factor was developed from local annual precipitation data using a modified Fournier index; the topographic factor was developed from a digital elevation model; the land cover factor was generated from satellite imagery and forest inventory maps; and the soil organic carbon level and the erodibility factor were developed from systematically collected soil samples and the application of the geostatistical method, respectively. From the model, more than the half of the total study area as in the very low and low erosion risk classes (0-12 t ha(-1) year(-1)), whereas 4.4 \% (723.6 h) of the total area was at high and very high erosion risk (35-150 and >150 t ha(-1) year(-1)), respectively. In addition, soil organic carbon density values were between 0.18 and 4.92 kg m(-2) across the catchment. Moreover, the distribution of soil organic carbon losses was closely correlated with the distribution of soil erosion risk classes in the study area. Soils and topographical properties of the watershed had a greater influence than land use/land-cover type on the magnitude of potential soil and soil organic carbon losses, because the erosivity factor did not change substantially in the study area.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing With Species Distribution Models; Mapping Tamarisk Invasions Using The Software For Assisted Habitat Modeling (Sahm)
AB  - Early detection of invasive plant species is vital for the management of natural resources and protection of ecosystem processes. The use of satellite remote sensing for mapping the distribution of invasive plants is becoming more common, however conventional imaging software and classification methods have been shown to be unreliable. In this study, we test and evaluate the use of five species distribution model techniques fit with satellite remote sensing data to map invasive tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) along the Arkansas River in Southeastern Colorado. The models tested included boosted regression trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), generalized linear model (GLM), and Maxent. These analyses were conducted using a newly developed software package called the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM). All models were trained with 499 presence points, 10,000 pseudo-absence points, and predictor variables acquired from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor over an eight-month period to distinguish tamarisk from native riparian vegetation using detection of phenological differences. From the Landsat scenes, we used individual bands and calculated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and tasseled capped transformations. All five models identified current tamarisk distribution on the landscape successfully based on threshold independent and threshold dependent evaluation metrics with independent location data. To account for model specific differences, we produced an ensemble of all five models with map output highlighting areas of agreement and areas of uncertainty. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of species distribution models in analyzing remotely sensed data and the utility of ensemble mapping, and showcase the capability of SAHM in pre-processing and executing multiple complex models.

TI  - Using Multi-Indices Approach To Quantify Mangrove Changes Over The Western Arabian Gulf Along Saudi Arabia Coast
AB  - Mangroves habitat present an important resource for large coastal communities benefiting from activities such as fisheries, forest products and clean water as well as protection against coastal erosion and climate related extreme events. Yet they are increasingly threatened by natural pressure and anthropogenic activities. We observed an inaccurate distribution of mangroves over the Western Arabian Gulf (WAG) which is a vital habitat and resource for the local ecosystem, according to the United Stated Geological Survey (USGS) mangrove database through spectral analysis. Change detection analysis is conducted on mangrove forests along the Saudi Arabian coast of the WAG for the years 2000, 2010 and 2018 using Landsat 7 & 8 data. Three supervised classification methodologies are employed for mangrove mapping, including Supported Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), referred to as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF). CART's accuracy was recorded to be >95% while other classifiers were >90%. The CART supervised learning classifier, mapping mangroves’ distribution and biomass using Google Earth Engine (GEE) online platform, indicates an overall increase in the northern Tarut Bay and Tarut Island, by 0.21 km 2 from 2000 to 2010 and by 1.4 km 2 from 2010 to 2018. The increase might be due to mitigation strategies such as mangrove breeding and plantation. It can be challenging to detect changes in certain regions due to the inadequate resolution of Landsat where submerged mangroves can be confused with salt marshes and macro algae. We employed a new method to identify and analyze submerged mangrove forests distribution via a submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in Abu Ali Island. Our results show the robustness of SMRI as an effective indicator to detect submerged mangroves in both high and medium spatial resolution satellite images. NDVI values differentiated submerged mangroves from tidal flats between Landsat 7 & 8 as well as during conditions of low and high tides. High resolution WorldView-2 image showed agreement of mangroves distribution with the SMRI and NDVI results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Modeling Stem And Branch Biomass Of Tamarix Spp. In The Marine Protected Area In Changyi, China
AB  - Tamarix spp. are woody plants that are widely distributed throughout the world, and they have ecological importance in the arid and salinized areas of China. However, methods for modeling the biomass of Tamarix spp. and other multi-stemmed shrubs are inadequate. Diameter measurements (such as diameter at breast height) are frequently used and have proved to correlate well with biomass; however, such methods are difficult to apply for Tamarix because of its irregular growth patterns and multiple stems. Modeling shrub biomass has received more attention in recent years, and several studies have indicated that for shrubs shaped like cylinders or cones, the crown area was significantly correlated with shrub biomass. Considering the constraints of diameter measurements for Tamarix spp., we modeled Tamarix spp. biomass using crown width and height in Changyi Marine Protected Area (Shandong Province, China; 37°06'15"N, 119°22'00"E). The area containing Tamarix spp. (T. chinensis and T. austromongolica) was approximately 20.7 km2. In February 2014, nine sample plots (30 m × 30 m) were selected, and three embedded plots (5 m × 5 m) were placed randomly in each plot. Prior to harvesting, the height (H), basal diameter (BD), and crown area (C) of 247 Tamarix individuals in the embedded plots were measured. Fresh weights (FW) were collected after harvesting. At the time of sampling, the trees had no foliage, and thus the FW included only stems and branches. One hundred and eighty-nine individuals were selected randomly to establish the regression equations, while the remaining 58 individuals were used for testing the accuracy of these equations. CH (the product of C×H) and C were chosen as independent variables, and the regression equations were established in the form of linear, power-law, and quadratic polynomials.The equations based on CH were FW=0.856 × (CH)－0.879 (R2= 0.884, F = 1428.5), FW=0.403 ×(CH)1.226 (R2= 0.900, F = 1396.1), and FW=0.010 × (CH)2+0.562 × (CH)+0.114(R2= 0.903, F = 875.7), whereas the equations based on C were FW=2.462 × C-1.893 (R2= 0.825, F = 881.8), FW=0.900 × C1.440 (R2= 0.861, F = 966.3), and FW=0.144 × C2+1.007 × C+0.127(R2= 0.864, F = 600.7). Although quadratic polynomial equations had higher R2values, the power-law functions performed best in the test, as they had deviations of -2.22% (CH) and 2.92% (C). Furthermore, because the power-law function is the most widely used allometric equation, we recommend establishing regression equations using power-law functions in this area. As tree crown properties can be reconstructed using high-resolution satellite data, allometric equations that use C as the only independent variable may provide a more cost-efficient way of monitoring, reporting, and verifying the carbon stocks of Tamarix spp. The mean values of H, BD, C, and FW in the study area were (215.2 ± 41.4)cm, (4.2 ± 1.9)cm, (2.49 ± 2.21)m2, and (4.15 ± 5.80)kg (mean ± SD), respectively; therefore, artificial management should be enhanced to improve the stand quality. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Evaluating The Compliance Of Sea Turtle Light Ordinances In Florida Using Remote Sensing
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing has essentially been absent from processes evaluating compliance with environmental policy. Through a case study of the observance of sea turtle light ordinances in Florida, this study seeks to demonstrate that remotely sensed data can be beneficial in evaluation of environmental policy compliance. As a means to increase the successful sea turtle nesting rate, 21 counties and several other municipalities adapted policies prohibiting the lighting of beaches during sea turtle nesting season from May to October. Using visible/infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights satellite imagery to determine mean radiance values and diamond plots of difference images of nighttime lights radiance values, this study confirms compliance with these light ordinances while emphasizing the benefits of remote sensing techniques in the process.

TI  - Plant Identity, But Not Diversity, And Agroecosystem Characteristics Affect The Occurrence Of M. Robertsii In An Organic Cropping System
AB  - Organic farmers rely largely on cultural practices, such as crop rotation and cover cropping, and on biological control to manage pests. Winter cover crops add diversity to agroecosystems and can benefit soil conservation and health, retention and supply of soil nutrients, regulation of arthropods, and crop yields. Within the framework of a three-year experiment to investigate ecosystem services and disservices associated with 12 winter cover crop treatments during the transition of a small grain - corn - soybean production system to organic management, we examined the effects of cash crop and crop management, cover crop species and diversity, arthropods, and soil properties on Metarhizium spp. in a single field site in central Pennsylvania, USA. We used sentinel insect assays with Galleria mellonella L. to determine the relative occurrence of Metarhizium spp. in soil samples from treatment plots. M. robertsii was the only species detected, and therefore Metarhizium species diversity was not related to cover crop diversity. Detection of M. robertsii was lower in cover crop monocultures and mixtures containing brassicas compared to those with legumes. M. robertsii was detected more frequently in the standing cover crops in the corn phase of the rotation than in the soybean phase, but there was no difference in soil samples in the corn and soybeans after cover crop termination. In samples from cover crops, 33\% of the variation of percentage mortality of sentinel G. mellonella by M. robertsii was explained by positive correlations with cover crop biomass in the previous fall, the biomass of weeds in the current season (spring), soil moisture, Ca, and timing of sampling in days after planting, and by negative correlations with number of days since disturbance prior to soil sampling and percent sand. In samples from corn and soybeans, 23\% of the variation of percentage mortality of sentinel G. mellonella by M. robertsii was explained by positive correlations with soil labile C, electrical conductivity, and activity-density of ground beetles (Carabidae), and by negative correlations with increasing number of days after planting relative to time of sampling, percent sand, and activity-density of mites. The complex interactions of multiple biotic and abiotic factors that shape the soil community requires further research to develop an understanding of how to manage production systems and practices to promote and conserve biological control in the soil.

TI  - The Conservation Of Afro-Palaearctic Migrants: What We Are Learning And What We Need To Know?
AB  - The global long-term decline of migrant birds represents an important and challenging issue for conservation scientists and practitioners. This review draws together recent research directed at the Afro-Palaearctic flyway and considers its implications for conservation. The greatest advances in knowledge have been made in the field of tracking. These studies reveal many species to be highly dispersed in the non-breeding season, suggesting that site-level conservation at a small number of locations will almost certainly be of limited value for most species. Instead, widespread but 'shallow' land-sharing solutions are likely to be more effective but, because any local changes in Africa will affect many European populations, any impact will be extremely difficult to detect through monitoring in the breeding grounds. Targeted action to boost productivity in Europe may help to halt declines of some species but reversing declines for many species is also likely to require these 'shallow' land-sharing approaches in non-breeding areas. The retention or planting of native trees in the humid and arid zones within Africa may be a generic conservation tool, especially if planting is concentrated on favoured tree species. Overall, and despite a growing knowledge, we remain largely unable to progress beyond general flyway-level actions, such as maintaining suitable habitat across an increasingly anthropogenic landscape for generalists, targeted site-based conservation for specialists and at stop-over sites, protection of species from hunting, and individual species-level solutions. We remain unable to assess the cost-effectiveness of more specific conservation action, mainly because of uncertainty around how migrant populations are affected by conditions during passage and on the non-breeding grounds, as well as around the efficacy of implementation of actions, particularly in non-breeding areas. For advances in knowledge to develop and implement effective conservation, scientific approaches need to be better integrated with each other and implemented across the full annual cycle. However, we urge the immediate use of available scientific knowledge rather than waiting for a complete understanding, and that any action is combined with species monitoring and adaptive management across the flyway.

TI  - Evaluation Of Eco-Environmental Vulnerability In Jilin Province Based On An Ahp-Pca Entropy Weight Model
AB  - Jilin Province is the main grain-producing area in China and has a considerable ecological function in Northeast China. Understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of ecological vulnerability can aid effectively managing environmental change, guiding the rational use of land resources, and developing strategies for regional environmental protection. Based on the Sensitivity–Resilience–Pressure model of ecological vulnerability, a comprehensive evaluation indexes system for ecological vulnerability was established from the perspectives of human activities and natural environment in Jilin Province using meteorological, remote sensing, and statistical data. Thereafter, an entropy weight model constructed by using an analytic hierarchy process and principal component analysis was employed to analyze the geospatial and temporal dynamics of ecological vulnerability from 2000 to 2020 in the study area. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to probe spatial relationships between the different ecological vulnerability levels. The results revealed that 1) the overall environment was suitable with a light vulnerability level and below in the study area; however, ecological vulnerability varied among different regions and increased gradually from east to west. High vulnerability areas were mainly distributed in the western region, characterized by less rainfall and lower vegetation cover, and displayed a considerable global spatial autocorrelation with high-high aggregation. Potentially vulnerable areas were concentrated in the mountainous regions of eastern Jilin Province. 2) The ecological vulnerability index was divided into five levels as potential, slight, light, moderate and heavy. The area proportion was varied significantly among different levels. Taking 2020 as an example, the proportion in descending order is light>moderate>slight>potential>heavy, moreover, the area of light and below vulnerable area accounts for about 67.9%, indicating that Jilin Province is at a medium level of vulnerability in the whole. 3) Temporally, the vulnerability of the ecological environment in Jilin Province improved from 2000 to 2020. Compared to 2000, the proportions of heavyly and slightly vulnerable areas in 2020 decreased by 2.78% and 9.20%, respectively; whereas the proportions of light and moderately vulnerable areas in 2020 increased by 7.45% and 5.24%, respectively. The potentially vulnerable areas in 2020 were the same as those in 2000. 4) The value of Moran’s I index increased from 0.2335 to 0.3841 from 2000 to 2020, implying that spatial agglomeration was more pronounced, and high-high aggregation was distributed in the western region of the study area, whereas low-low aggregation was concentrated in the eastern region of Jilin Province. Relevant suggestions for environmental protection were proposed based on vulnerability assessments and impact factors. Existing ecological protection strategies should be continued in zones with potential and slight vulnerabilities. Zones with light and moderate vulnerability should prioritize black soil protection to ensure reasonable development of agricultural land resources. For heavyly vulnerable zones, investment in environmental protection should increase.ince.

TI  - Habitat Loss And Anthropogenic Disturbance In Jamaica's Hellshire Hills Area
AB  - This study provides empirical assessments of the magnitude of human pressures on forest habitat in Jamaica's Hellshire Hills. The Hellshire Hills represents an outstanding example of the Caribbean region's dry limestone forests. Approximately 160 km2 in area, the Hellshire Hills is home to a unique and rich biodiversity, including the critically endangered Jamaican Iguana (Cylcura collei). The area's biodiversity is under increasing threat from deforestation from subsistence driven encroachment. Using deforestation as a spatial indicator of habitat loss, the study derives satellite based estimates of the rate of habitat destruction within and immediately outside the area. The underlying human driving forces in this destruction are analyzed in a regression analysis of key socio-economic indicators that adusts for these locational differences. Results suggest that immiserating pressures on species habitat, particularly outside the area, are greater than anywhere else on the island. Simulations of species loss and edge-induced disturbances to species habitat also indicate that the potential impacts of forest conversion may be substantial and extend well beyond the area's boundaries. Together, the study's results highlight the intrinsic vulnerablity of the Hellshire Hills to outside disturbance. In particular, they raise doubts about the potential of the area (which has been accorded protected status within the recently established Portland Bight Protected Area) to provide for the long-term preservation and viability of the area's species. It is concluded that appropriate reserve design and species protection will require the collection of detailed empirical data on species diversity, numbers, habitat requirements, and spatial distribution. However, before this information can be collected priorities for biodiversity conservation must be set. Costs and benefits of conversation must also be assessed within the overall context of an integrated rural development plan for the area.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Characteristics Of Evapotranspiration In The Upper Minjiang River Basin Based On The Sib2 Model
AB  - The evapotranspiration (ET) in mountainous watersheds affects the security of downstream water supply and ecological safety. Continuous time-varying ET cannot be obtained by traditional methods such as remote sensing and ground observations. In this study, a simple biosphere model 2 (SiB2) was parameterized in a typical mountainous area, the upper Minjiang River, using field observations and remote sensing data. The performance of SiB2 was then assessed by comparing it with direct measurements of the evaporation dishes. The results showed that (1) at the daily scale, the simulated ET was smaller than the measured ET. At the monthly scale, the relative errors between the simulated and measured values ranged from 1.48\% to 20.72\%. The relative error between the simulated and measured values of the total annual ET is 6.99\%; (2) the ET of Minjiang River was characterized by a "bimodal" variation, with lower daily ET from November to February (non-growing season) and higher daily ET from March to August (growing season); (3) the ET of Minjiang River showed the spatial characteristics of low in the northwest and high in the southeast, with a high-value center located in Dujiangyan City. In summary, SiB2 is suitable for simulating ET in mountainous watersheds with spatial and temporal continuity. This study can contribute to the enhancement of water resources use planning and basin management in the upper Minjiang River.

TI  - Prosopis Juliflora Management And Grassland Restoration In Baringo County, Kenya: Opportunities For Soil Carbon Sequestration And Local Livelihoods
AB  - Climate change, land degradation and invasive alien species (IAS) threaten grassland ecosystems worldwide. IAS clearing and grassland restoration would help to reduce the negative effects of IAS, restore the original vegetation cover and sustain livelihoods while contributing to climate change mitigation, but uncertain financial benefits to local stakeholders hamper such efforts. This study assessed where and when net financial benefit could be realized from Prosopis juliflora management and subsequent grassland restoration by combining ecological, social and financial information. Impacts of Prosopis invasion and grassland degradation on soil organic carbon (SOC) in nine sublocations in Baringo County, Kenya, were evaluated. Then the financial impacts of Prosopis removal and grassland restoration in the area were calculated and spatially explicit management scenarios for each sublocation modelled, combining geographical information derived from satellite images taken in different years of the invasion with SOC data and socio-economic data collected in the sublocations. The expanding Prosopis distribution and density since 1995 have increased cumulated SOC storage on former bare land or degraded grasslands. On former pristine or restored grasslands, however, Prosopis invasion has reduced total SOC storage. Prosopis removal and grassland restoration are predicted to yield financial benefits through charcoal made from removed trees, increased cattle numbers and carbon credits. However, a trade-off between increased SOC and net financial benefit was found. The predicted net SOC increase would contribute around one-tenth, at most, to the net financial benefit. The available budget, based on Baringo households' average willingness to pay, would enable removal, on average, of one-fifth of Prosopis per sublocation in a single year. A larger area can be cleared if Prosopis is sparse than if it is dense. The analyses show that in some sublocations, households' annual investments could result in restoration of all former grassland areas. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how integrating and linking detailed ecological, social and financial geodata to develop accurate and realistic invasive alien species management scenarios can illustrate costs and benefits of management interventions in a spatial context. Such scenarios should be used more extensively to support land management decisions.

TI  - Carbon Stock Estimation From Vegetation Biomass Using Spot-7 Imagery
AB  - Vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during photosynthesis. Covering more areas with trees will increase the CO2 absorption capacity more substantially than other vegetation like bushes, grasses, or rice fields. Trees convert the CO2 captured during photosynthesis into organic carbon to be stored in biomass. Woody trees account for approximately 60% of the total aboveground tree biomass, and trunks, where food reserves produced in photosynthesis are stored, have relatively large biomass compared to other parts of the tree. The biomass of a vegetation stand determines the optimization of air pollutant absorption in urban areas. Yogyakarta City is the center for tourism, education, and cultural activities in Indonesia, which is vulnerable to land-use conversion, a factor of the shrinking green space. This study aimed to estimate carbon stock from vegetation biomass in Yogyakarta City using the remote sensing product SPOT-7 imagery. To calculate the vegetation biomass, the diameter at breast height (DBH) of stands was measured in the field. Then, statistical analyses were performed to determine the correlation and regression between the actual or observed biomass and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value derived from the SPOT-7 image. The regression model used was y = 1.4277x – 0.0849. The total biomass produced in Yogyakarta City was estimated at 1,399,487.1 tonnes, which contained 643,764.1 tonnes of carbon stock. ©2023 by the authors.

TI  - A New Method For Spatial Estimation Of Water Quality Using An Optimal Virtual Sensor Network And In Situ Observations: A Case Study Of Chemical Oxygen Demand
AB  - Accurate water quality estimation is important for water environment monitoring and water resource management and has emerged as a pivotal aspect of ecological rehabilitation and sustainable development. However, due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of water quality parameters, it is still challenging to obtain highly accurate spatial patterns of them. Taking chemical oxygen demand as an example, this study proposes a novel estimation method for generating highly accurate chemical oxygen demand fields in Poyang Lake. Specifically, based on the different water levels and monitoring sites in Poyang Lake, an optimal virtual sensor network was first established. A Taylor expansion-based method with integration of spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity was developed by considering environmental factors, the optimal virtual sensor network, and existing monitoring stations. The proposed approach was evaluated and compared with other approaches using a leave-one cross-validation process. Results show that the proposed method exhibits good performance in estimating chemical oxygen demand fields in Poyang Lake, with mean absolute error improved by 8\% and 33\%, respectively, on average, when compared with classical interpolators and remote sensing methods. In addition, the applications of virtual sensors improve the performance of the proposed method, with mean absolute error and root mean squared error values reduced by 20\% to 60\% over 12 months. The proposed method provides an effective tool for estimating highly accurate spatial fields of chemical oxygen demand concentrations and could be applied to other water quality parameters.

TI  - Seeing The Forest For The Trees: Identifying Discursive Convergence And Dominance In Complex Redd Plus Governance
AB  - Scholars of international law and international relations largely agree that global governance today, and global environmental governance in particular, is marked by institutional complexity. Environmental policy fields are, to varying degrees, governed by a plurality of institutions with different levels of legalization, membership, and jurisdictional scope, and with different degrees of coherence among them. The international governance architecture on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is a case in point. Located at the intersection of the governance systems on climate change, biodiversity, forestry, and development, REDD+ governance provides a stage where a large variety of intergovernmental and transnational institutions come together, collaborate, or compete on questions of standard-setting, financing, implementation, and evaluation. This complexity poses challenges to the effectiveness of REDD+ governance in general, but also to specific actor groups and organizations that lack the resources to understand and navigate such a fragmented governance landscape. Against this backdrop, we introduce an analytical framework to read and structure a complex governance architecture. The framework breaks new ground by adopting argumentative discourse analysis and the concept of storylines to the study of institutional complexity. We argue that beyond the messy surface of institutional complexity there may be a surprising degree of convergence, in the sense of discursive hierarchies that run across institutions, practices, and scales. We illustrate such a cross-cutting hierarchy for the complex REDD+ governance system, focusing on the sensitive issue of forest carbon monitoring. In our analysis of respective guidance documents and country reports, we find, underneath the institutional complexity across governance scales, a considerable dominance of techno-managerial perspectives and a preference for carbon commodification. This discursive hegemony and convergence resonates with the dominance of certain REDD+ funding institutions and the prioritization of the monitoring practice of remote sensing.

TI  - Assessing Changes Of Mangrove Forest In A Coastal Region Of Southeast China Using Multi-Temporal Satellite Images
AB  - Mangroves provide many ecological, economic, and social benefits to humans. In the Jiulong River Estuary of Fujian Province, China, many mangroves have been lost largely due to human activities and so artificial planting has been implemented. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of mangrove forests are still largely unknown at this location. This study aimed to identify changes to mangrove distribution and aboveground biomass (AGB) in three periods (1995-2004, 2004-2014 and 1995-2014) in order to influence mangrove management. Landsat satellite imagery and the threshold value method were used to classify mangroves. Landsat satellite imagery, field-based biomass investigations, elevation data and an allometric biomass equation were employed to develop an AGB model using a multiple linear regression method. Both mangrove area and AGB increased from 1995 to 2014 with an increase rate of 5.5\% and 7.2\% for mangrove area and AGB, respectively. Mangrove expansion was the main cause for AGB and area increase. In addition, AGB increase due to the growth of mangroves without extending the area also has great potential in AGB increase. Similar to AGB, above-ground carbon increased from 57 t C/ha in 1995 to 79 t C/ha in 2014, which demonstrated that mangroves in this region can help to mitigate climate warming. However, a large-scale continuous decrease of mangrove forest in the JRE was observed, likely caused by growing human activities. Moreover, tidal range change during 2004-2014 resulted in a more adverse impact on mangroves.

TI  - Walkability Under Climate Pressure: Application To Three Unesco World Heritage Cities In Central Spain
AB  - Walkability is a modern concept that has become important in recent years due to the doubtless effects it has on aspects such as health and wellbeing, sustainable development, climate change, and tourism. It is necessary, therefore, that urban development strategies aim to achieve walkable cities. The main objective of this study is to define a methodology to calculate the walkability index in tourist cities and to predict the effects of climate change on this index, which is applied to three World Heritage cities in central Spain: Salamanca, avila, and Segovia. The methodology is developed in three phases. Phase I focus on the calculation of walkability, considering the following factors: facilities and services, accessibility, sidewalk width, population density, green areas, and urban trees. In Phase II, walkability in 2020, climate-related variables were added to the previous result: temperatures, solar radiation, and shadows. Finally, the third phase, walkability under climate change pressure in 2030, 2050, and 2100, establish predictions for different climate scenarios. The results show excellent walkability indices (higher) in city centers and newly built neighborhoods and low values in the rest of the peripheral areas, industrial estates, and neighborhoods. Climate predictions showed a generalized decrease in walkability over time, even higher in the scenario with high greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, the models can be an excellent tool for the tourist management of cities since they show the most walkable areas and, therefore, the most suitable for tourist routes.

TI  - Geohazard Modeling Using Remote Sensing And Gis
AB  - Geohazards are environmental conditions leading to widespread damage or risk to human life and property triggered by earth processes. Rapid industrial growth, urbanization, deforestation and carbon economy has resulting in climate driven geohazards. Earth observation through remote sensing coupled with ground based network of sensors have helps us monitor small changes in our environment which are helpful in predicting the vulnerability of a region to geohazards. Such technology has helped minimize the impact of the event thereby increasing the resilience of society to such hazards. GIS based information analysis and modelling of environmental parameters and earth observations have not only supported predictive analyses for securing future investments and vulnerable sections of society but also have demonstrated their utility in assessing the damage and the reconstruction of the region. This chapter discusses the role of Remote Sensing and GIS in modelling geohazards and their impact through examples from different parts of the planet, summarizing the opportunities and challenges for the future. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.

TI  - Maxent Modeling For Predicting The Potential Distribution Of Medicinal Plant, Justicia Adhatoda L. In Lesser Himalayan Foothills
AB  - The population of the medicinal plant, Malabar nut (Justicia adhatoda L.) is shrinking in Dun valley due to habitat fragmentation, invasion by Lantana camara, over-exploitation, and an ever-increasing human population - the most important being the increasing demand on land for agriculture, industries and the urbanization. Predicting potential geographic distribution of the species is important from species and habitat restoration point of view. This paper reports the results of a study carried out in the Lesser Himalayan foothills in India (Dun valley) on potential distribution modeling for Malabar nut using Maxent model. The Worldclim bioclimatic variables, slope, aspect, elevation, and the land use/land cover (based on IRS LISS-III) data and 46 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution of J. adhatoda in ca. 1877km2 study area. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 92.3. The approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species and thus, can be an effective tool in species restoration and conservation planning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-Term Spatial And Temporal Maize And Soybean Evapotranspiration Trends Derived From Ground-Based And Satellite-Based Datasets Over The Great Plains
AB  - Estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) from any given crop is essential for agricultural water consumption analyses, hydrologic modeling, understanding vegetation response to climatic changes, and related studies. Even though it is a simplification of the complex physiological and surface energy balance relationships in accurately estimating ET, crop coefficient (K-c)-based estimation of crop ET is one of the widely used approaches. This study developed and evaluated crop-specific (maize and soybean) K-c versus normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) relationships using satellite imagery data and observed crop ET fluxes. These models were used to estimate spatiotemporal K-c of maize and soybean using multiplatform satellite imagery to aid in computation of crop ET across these scales. Crop ET was characterized spatially (across the entire Great Plains) and temporally (1982-2013) and direction and magnitudes of trends were quantified. The study area comprises of 9 states and 834 counties, representing a total land area of 2,307,410 km(2), which is approximately 30\% of the terrestrial area of the United States. The coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (NSE), and root mean square difference (RMSD) for K-c-NDVI models were 0.93, 87.5\%, and 0.172, respectively, for maize and 0.76, 75\%, and 0.20 for soybean, respectively, which denotes acceptable accuracy. Monthly and growing season maize and soybean ET was computed on a county basis for the study period using the developed monthly K-c values and reference ET, which was determined across 800 sites in the region. Maize ET in the region varied from 242 mm in Park County, Wyoming, to 942 mm in San Jacinto County, Texas. Soybean ET ranged from a minimum of 367 mm in Baca County, Colorado, to a maximum of 753 mm in Creek County, Oklahoma. The regional average magnitude of growing season maize and soybean ET was 651 and 564 mm, respectively. Spatial and temporal variability and trends in county-scale monthly and growing season maize and soybean ET were investigated for the period 1982 to 2013. For the majority of the maize and soybean growing counties, increasing trends in crop ET were detected, despite decreasing trends in reference ET. The significant positive trends in maize ET over the region ranged from 1.48 to 3.86 mm year(-1), with an average of 2.65 mm year(-1). For soybean, the significant positive trends varied from 0.88 to 4.13 mm year(-1), with an average of 2.1 mm year(-1). The analyses presented in this study inspire the use of satellite-derived indices to monitor crop development and water use to evaluate regional magnitudes of spatial and temporal ET. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal trend analysis for county-scale crop ET can be instrumental to make informed assessments, decisions, and forecasts about agroecosystem water resources management policy in the Great Plains region by state and federal agencies, producers, and other water resources associated professionals.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Assessment Of Responder Exposure To Snag Hazards In Post-Fire Environments
AB  - Researchers and managers increasingly recognize enterprise risk management as critical to addressing contemporary fire management challenges. Quantitative wildfire risk assessments contribute by parsing and mapping potentially contradictory positive and negative fire effects. However, these assessments disregard risks to fire responders because they only address social and ecological resources and assets. In this study, we begin to overcome this deficiency by using a novel modeling approach that integrates remote sensing, field inventories, imputation-based vegetation modeling, and empirical models to quantify post-fire snag hazard in space and time. Snag hazard increased significantly immediately post-fire, with severe or extreme hazard conditions accounting for 47\%, 83\%, and 91\% of areas burned at low, moderate and high-severity fire, respectively. Patchsize of severe or extreme hazard positively correlated with fire size, exceeding > 20,000 ha (60\% of our largest fire) 10-years post-fire when reburn becomes more likely. After 10 years, snag hazard declined rapidly as snags fell or fragmented, but severe or extreme hazard persisted for 20, 30 and 35 years in portions of the low, moderate and high-severity fire areas. Because forests are denser and wildfires burn with greater severity than historically, these hazardous conditions may represent novel management challenges where risk of injury or death to responders outweighs the benefits of directly engaging the fire. Mapping snag hazard with our methodology could improve situational awareness for both decision makers and fire responders as they mitigate risk during fire management. However, as more landscapes burn we anticipate increased responder exposure to extremely hazardous conditions, which may further entrench the wildfire paradox as fire managers weigh current response decisions with future challenges. Aligning land management objectives with wildfire management needs, in part by mapping responder exposure to snags and other hazards, could help overcome the wildfire paradox and produce desirable long-term outcomes. This research also demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to account for risk to all aspects of fire prone social-ecological systems as we learn to live with fire in rapidly changing environments.

TI  - Gis Modeling Of Environmental Parameters For Identification Of Landscape For Expansion Of Biodiversity Conservation, And Greenery Projects (A Case Study For Neom Region, Saudi Arabia)
AB  - Trees play vital roles in urban space such as regulating temperature in a microclimatic environment, maintaining soil health, providing oxygen, and many direct and indirect human health benefits. The study evaluated the bioclimatic parameters of the proposed Neom geographical area for identifying the potential landscape for tree scaling linked to biodiversity conservation strategies. The potentially suitable ten spatial factors (slope; elevation: DEM, soil wetness; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: Landsat data, aridity index, annual precipitation, annual temperature, potential evapotranspiration, the temperature of the coldest quarter, and temperature of the warmest quarter) were identified and brought into GIS modeling for integration based on AHP statistical methods. The hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) was carried out for better understanding. The analysis revealed that approximately 22% (4948 km2) of the landscape has greater than 50% of potentiality for restoration of nature conservation goals linked to biodiversity, afforestation, and ecosystem services. The hotspot analysis manifested that 2596 km2 (with a 99% of confidence level) has high suitability for biodiversity conservation goals if harnessed scientifically. Neom’s proposed area needs one billion additional trees as carbon neutrality to accommodate one million persons in the future. This research is important because this is the first preliminary evaluation modeled in the GIS environment based on standard statistical methods for making outstanding synergic future strategies for the expansion of biodiversity conservation, and greenery projects within the proposed land area of Neom. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - The Seasonal Carbon And Water Balances Of The Cerrado Environment Of Brazil: Past, Present, And Future Influences Of Land Cover And Land Use
AB  - The Brazilian savanna (known as Cerrado) is an upland biome made up of various vegetation types from herbaceous to arboreal. In this paper, MODIS remote sensing vegetation greenness from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and evapotranspiration (ET) data for the 2000-2012 period were analyzed to understand the differences in the net primary productivity (NPP-proxy), carbon, and the evaporative flux of the major Cerrado natural and anthropic landscapes. The understanding of the carbon and evaporative fluxes of the main natural and anthropic vegetation types is of fundamental importance in studies regarding the impacts of land cover and land use changes in the regional and global climate. The seasonal dynamics of EVI and ET of the main natural and anthropic vegetation types of the Cerrado biome were analyzed using a total of 35 satellite-based samples distributed over representative Cerrado landscapes. Carbon and water fluxes were estimated for different scenarios, such as, a hypothetical unconverted Cerrado, 2002 and 2050 scenarios based on values derived from literature and on the PROBIO land cover and land use map for the Cerrado. The total growing season biomass for 2002 in the Cerrado region was estimated to be 28 gigatons of carbon and the evapotranspiration was 1336 gigatons of water. The mean estimated growing season evapotranspiration and biomass for 2002 was 576 Gt of water and 12 Gt of carbon for pasture and croplands compared to 760 Gt of water and 15 Gt of carbon for the Cerrado natural vegetation. In a modeled future scenario for the year 2050, the ET flux from natural Cerrado vegetation was 394 Gt less than in 2002 and 991 Gt less than in an unconverted scenario, with only natural vegetation, while the carbon was 8 Gt less than in 2002 and 21 Gt less than in this hypothetical pre-conversion Cerrado. On the other hand, the sum of the pasture and cropland ET flux increased by 405 Gt in 2050 relative to 2002 and the carbon by 11 Gt of carbon. Given the increasing global demand for agricultural products and the insufficient protected areas in the Cerrado (with a significant area of remaining native vegetation in privately owned lands that may be legally deforested), our analyses suggest that potential future changes to the water and carbon balances are likely to be highly significant in the severely threatened Cerrado biome. On the other hand, our results also suggest that the recovery of degraded pastures can have a positive impact on climate, due to the higher rates of carbon sequestration and water transfer to the atmosphere. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

TI  - Regional Water Balance Based On Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration And Irrigation: An Assessment Of The Haihe Plain, China
AB  - Optimal planning and management of the limited water resources for maximum productivity in agriculture requires quantifying the irrigation applied at a regional scale. However, most efforts involving remote sensing applications in assessing large-scale irrigation applied (IA) have focused on supplying spatial variables for crop models or studying evapotranspiration (ET) inversions, rather than directly building a remote sensing data-based model to estimate IA. In this study, based on remote sensing data, an IA estimation model together with an ET calculation model (ETWatch) is set up to simulate the spatial distribution of IA in the Haihe Plain of northern China. We have verified this as an effective approach for the simulation of regional IA, being more reflective of regional characteristics and of higher resolution compared to single site-specific results. The results show that annual ET varies from 527 mm to 679 mm and IA varies from 166 mm to 289 mm, with average values of 602 mm and 225 mm, respectively, from 2002 to 2007. We confirm that the region along the Taihang Mountain in Hebei Plain has serious water resource sustainability problems, even while receiving water from the South-North Water Transfer (SNWT) project. This is due to the region's intensive agricultural production and declining groundwater tables. Water-saving technologies, including more timely and accurate geo-specific IA assessments, may help reduce this threat.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Pattern And Cause Analysis For Accurate Management Of Remote Sensing Zoning At Field Scale In Black Soil Areas
AB  - Division of accurate management area can make a great contribution to the ecological conservation in precision agriculture, particularly on preventing excessive fertilization and pesticides. There is a regularly uniform distribution of management zoning in different years in the same field. It is necessary to quantitatively analyze the spatial-temporal changes of zoning for better field accurate management according to local conditions. Most previous studies focused on the accurate partition, with emphasis on the selection of input quantity for high accuracy of zoning. The innovation of this study lies in the quantitative expression of a multiyear pattern after the division, together with the influencing factors of zoning. A corn field was selected as the research area at the Youyi Farm in Heilongjiang Province of northeastern China. The remote sensing images were captured from the Sentinel-2A satellite under the European Space Agency (ESA) during the corn seedling stage in the first ten days of June 2017-2020. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was extracted from the preprocessed images on the ArcGIS software. The object-oriented segmentation was used to segment NDVI images, where the coefficient of variation was selected to evaluate each segmentation. The coefficients of variation in the NDVI were reduced by more than 70% after segmentation. In the partition, a natural breakpoint was used to classify the NDVI. A superposition analysis was utilized to calculate the spatial transfer matrix. The results showed that the patterns of maize in the seedling stage were similar in the study area. The coefficients of variation for the elevation and slope after segmentation were reduced by 42.857%-57.143% and 30.723%-34.940%, respectively, indicating that the growth of crops was affected by terrain factors. There was also a significant correlation between the NDVI and terrain factors, such as the elevation and slope. The sensors of soil temperature and humidity were embedded in four different positions on the slope along the ridge line with obvious topographic relief. A line chart or histogram was obtained for the four NDVI, the average values of soil moisture and temperature on the same ridge line according to the elevation changes in June. The highest NDVI values in the four stages were observed on the sunny slope, while gradually decreased from the top to the bottom of a slope. The reason was that the soil temperature of the sunny slope was the highest, while the soil moisture was sufficient, suitable for the emergence conditions of crops, where the emergence was faster with the high NDVI. On the shady slope, the soil temperature was relatively low, unsuitable for the emergence conditions with a low NDVI. In a specific field, the precise management pattern was similar to the same crop in the growth period over many years. The growth of crops at the early stage and the zonings of precise management depended mainly on the distribution of soil moisture and temperature under the different topographies. The findings can provide a spatiotemporal framework to integrate accurate management with variable fertilization and pesticides in precision agriculture. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Scale Effects Of Leaf Area Index Inversion Based On Environmental And Disaster Monitoring Satellite Data
AB  - The spatial distribution of sub-pixel components has an impact on retrieval accuracy, and should be accounted for when inverting a three-dimensional adiative transfer model to retrieve leaf area index (LAI). To investigate this effect, we constructed three realistic scenarios with the same LAI values and other properties, except that the simulated plants had different distributions. We implemented the radiosity method to subsequently produce synthetic bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) datasets based upon these simulated scenes. The inversion was conducted using these data, which showed that spatial distribution affects retrieval accuracy. The inversion was also conducted for LAI based on charge-coupled device (CCD) data from the Environment and Disaster Monitor Satellite (HJ-1), which depicted both forest and drought-resistant crop land cover. This showed that heterogeneity in coarse-resolution remote sensing data is the main error source in LAI inversion. The spatial distribution of global fractal dimension index, which can be used to describe the area of sub-pixel components and their spatial distribution modes, shows good consistency with the coarse resolution LAI inversion error. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - River Flow Estimation Method Based On Uav Aerial Photogrammetry
AB  - River discharge is the basis for water resources and ecological protection, and it is an essential part of the hydrological cycle. However, some large areas in the world lack hydrological data. How to obtain river hydrological data conveniently and accurately remains a hot topic in the prediction of ungauged basins, especially in small and medium rivers. Solving the problem of data acquisition in areas lacking traditional hydrological data is beneficial for the management of water resources and rapid prediction of water disasters. Remote sensing technology, which is a non-contact data acquisition method, has been applied in many fields. This technology breaks the limits of space in acquiring river discharge, especially in areas where obtaining basic data is difficult, and has become a preferred method of data acquisition.Therefore, this study tries to take advantage of low-altitude remote sensing in obtaining terrain data. The study combines high-density terrain data with classical Manning-Strickler formula to estimate the river discharge. This study is based on representative rivers in the Junggar Basin, which is the second largest inland basin in China. The Kazanying section, Bortonggu section, Anji Sea section, Daheiyanzi section, and Rocha River section are selected as study sections. Combined with the Manning-Strickler formula, Digital Orthophoto Map (DOM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) image data obtained by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are used to calculate the theoretical river discharge. The Manning-Strickler formula needs four parameters to calculate discharge: cross-section area, hydraulic radius, hydraulic gradient, and roughness. Cross-section area and hydraulic radius are extracted in cross-section, which is combined with DSM and measured data; hydraulic radius reflects the slope of the river, which is calculated with DSM and DOM in Arc GIS; roughness, an empirical value that measures the level of obstruction of water flow in the river bed and embankment, is obtained by using DOM. On the basis of the values of these parameters, we calculated the discharge in Kazanying section, Bortonggu section, Anji Sea section, Daheiyanzi section, and Rocha River section. Their calculated values are 28.73 m3/s, 46.29 m3/s, 104.84 m3/s, 19.77 m3/s, and 6.83 m3/s, respectively. To verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the low-altitude remote sensing method in river flow calculation, we used traditional measurements to record the measured values of river discharge. This study selected 20% of the allowable error as the standard of Relative Accuracy (RA) and used the measured value to evaluate the calculated value. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Percentage Error (MPE) are important methods of evaluating accuracy, which are used as criteria for evaluating overall reliability.According to the established evaluation method, the results in the five sections show that the average error is 10.74%, the maximum value is 28.48%, the minimum value is 1.43%, the RMSE is 4.82m3/s, and the MPE is 0.065. The reason why the maximum relative error occurs in the Bortonggu section is because the value of roughness is too small. The results of the accuracy analysis indicate that the method used in this study is reasonable and has a well applicability in the study area. Moreover, the results prove that the classic Manning-Strickler formula can be combined with low-altitude remote sensing data.To resolve the problem of river discharge monitoring in ungauged areas, this study developed a new method that integrates classic river discharge algorithms with low-altitude remote sensing. The advantages of UAV are fully exploited in this study, and the use of UAV complements the research gap in the acquisition of small and medium-sized river discharge through remote sensing data. Research results have significant values for the application of flow simulation methods in ungauged regions and also provide a new solution for rapid and convenient collection of hydrological information. This study has unique advantages for water resources management and water disaster monitoring in key areas. © 2021 SinoMaps Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Identification Of Soil Erosion-Prone Zone Utilizing Geo-Informatics Techniques And Wspm Model
AB  - Geo-informatics techniques are viable being utilized in recent decades as a critical apparatus in deciding the quantitative portrayal of morphometry of a watershed. These procedures portray the high exactness of mapping and estimation of the morphometric analysis. The point of this study is, hence, to break down the GIS (Geographic information System)-based morphometric exercises of the River Ganga basin. This analysis requires depiction of every single existing stream. The estimation and investigation of the basin and its seventeen noteworthy sub-watersheds are carried on GIS stage. The parameters required as inputs are pour point, stream order map, and DEM (Digital Elevation Model). The results uncovered that the mean estimation of Form Factor (Ff) is 0.29 and Compactness coefficient (Cc) is 3.16, which demonstrates the shape of the watershed is not circular, it is elongated. The mean estimation of Stream Frequency (Sf) is 1.22 which be evidence for that the basin has reduced infiltration capacity. The value 2.87 of bifurcation Ratio (Rb) proposes that the watershed is steady. The distinctive estimations of Texture Ratio (T) recommend that the watershed has a fluctuating slope yet plain at the more significant part of the area. The prioritization of the sub-watersheds has been made using a novel approach Weighted Sum Priority Model (WSPM). Combined rank for each sub-watershed has been calculated using the WSPM model. Based on that model, it can likewise be reasoned that the sub-watersheds SW15 and SW16 are more soil erosion-prone sub-watersheds among all the seventeen sub-watersheds. Results of the study can be further utilized for prioritizing watershed for soil erosion-prone areas and also for watershed management planning zones. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Evaluation Of Morphometric Parameters Derived From Cartosat-1 Dem Using Remote Sensing And Gis Techniques For Budigere Amanikere Watershed, Dakshina Pinakini Basin, Karnataka, India
AB  - The quantitative analysis of drainage system is an important aspect of characterization of watersheds. Using watershed as a basin unit in morphometric analysis is the most logical choice because all hydrological and geomorphic processes occur within the watershed. The Budigere Amanikere watershed a tributary of Dakshina Pinakini River has been selected for case illustration. Geoinformatics module consisting of ArcGIS 10.3v and Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) version 1 of resolution 1 arc Sec (32 m) data obtained from Bhuvan is effectively used. Sheet and gully erosion are identified in parts of the study area. Slope in the watershed indicating moderate to least runoff and negligible soil loss condition. Third and fourth-order sub-watershed analysis is carried out. Mean bifurcation ratio (R (b)) 3.6 specify there is no dominant influence of geology and structures, low drainage density (D (d)) 1.12 and low stream frequency (F (s)) 1.17 implies highly infiltration subsoil material and low runoff, infiltration number (I (f))1.3 implies higher infiltration capacity, coarse drainage texture (T) 3.40 shows high permeable subsoil, length of overland flow (L (g)) 0.45 indicates under very less structural disturbances, less runoff conditions, constant of channel maintenance (C) 0.9 indicates higher permeability of subsoil, elongation ratio (R (e)) 0.58, circularity ratio (R (c)) 0.75 and form factor (R (f)) 0.26 signifies sub-circular to more elongated basin with high infiltration with low runoff. It was observed from the hypsometric curves and hypsometric integral values of the watershed along with their sub basins that the drainage system is attaining a mature stage of geomorphic development. Additionally, Hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral value proves that the infiltration capacity is high as well as runoff is low in the watershed. Thus, these mormometric analyses can be used as an estimator of erosion status of watersheds leading to prioritization for taking up soil and water conservation measures.

TI  - A Planetary Health Innovation For Disease, Food And Water Challenges In Africa
AB  - Many communities in low- and middle-income countries globally lack sustainable, cost-effective and mutually beneficial solutions for infectious disease, food, water and poverty challenges, despite their inherent interdependence1–7. Here we provide support for the hypothesis that agricultural development and fertilizer use in West Africa increase the burden of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis by fuelling the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation that chokes out water access points and serves as habitat for freshwater snails that transmit Schistosoma parasites to more than 200 million people globally8–10. In a cluster randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03187366) in which we removed invasive submerged vegetation from water points at 8 of 16 villages (that is, clusters), control sites had 1.46 times higher intestinal Schistosoma infection rates in schoolchildren and lower open water access than removal sites. Vegetation removal did not have any detectable long-term adverse effects on local water quality or freshwater biodiversity. In feeding trials, the removed vegetation was as effective as traditional livestock feed but 41 to 179 times cheaper and converting the vegetation to compost provided private crop production and total (public health plus crop production benefits) benefit-to-cost ratios as high as 4.0 and 8.8, respectively. Thus, the approach yielded an economic incentive—with important public health co-benefits—to maintain cleared waterways and return nutrients captured in aquatic plants back to agriculture with promise of breaking poverty–disease traps. To facilitate targeting and scaling of the intervention, we lay the foundation for using remote sensing technology to detect snail habitats. By offering a rare, profitable, win–win approach to addressing food and water access, poverty alleviation, infectious disease control and environmental sustainability, we hope to inspire the interdisciplinary search for planetary health solutions11 to the many and formidable, co-dependent global grand challenges of the twenty-first century. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

TI  - Recent Korean R\&D In Satellite Communications
AB  - The R\&D in satellite communications in Korea has been driven mainly by KCC (Korea Communications Commission) but in a small scale compared to Korea space development program organized by MEST (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology). Public and civilian satcom sector R\&D has been led mainly by ETRI with small/medium companies contrary to rare investment in private sector while military sector R\&D has been orchestrated by ADD with defense industry. By the COMS (Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite) experimental Ka-band payload, Korea pursues a space qualification of own technology for national infrastructure evolution as well as industrialization of space R\&D results. Once COMS launched and space qualified in 2009, subsequent application experiments and new technology R\&D like UHDTV will entail service and industry promotion. The payload technology is expected for the next Korean commercial satellites or for new OBP satellites. The COMS ground control system and GNSS ground station technologies are under development for COMS operation and enhanced GNSS services along with advent of Galileo respectively. Satellite broadband mobile VSAT based on DVB-S2/RCS (+M) and low profile tracking antennas have been developed for trains, ships, and planes. While APSI is developing GMR-1 based Thuraya handset functions, ETRI is designing IMT-Advanced satellite radio interface for satellite and terrestrial dual-mode handheld communication system like Japanese STICS, with universities' satellite OFDM researches. A 21 GHz Ka-band higher-availability scalable HD broadcasting technology and SkyLife's hybrid satellite IPTV technology are being developed. In near term Korea will extend R\&D programs to upgrade the space communication infrastructure for universal access to digital opportunity and safer daily life from disaster, and to promote space green IT industrialization, national security, and space resources sovereign. Japanese stakeholders are invited to establish a collaborative R\&D with Korea for mutual benefit of the future.

TI  - Monitoring Groundwater Storage Changes In Complex Basement Aquifers: An Evaluation Of The Grace Satellites Over East Africa
AB  - Although the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to monitor groundwater storage changes has become commonplace, our evaluation suggests that careful processing of the GRACE data is necessary to extract a representative signal especially in regions with significant surface water storage (i.e., lakes/reservoirs). In our study, we use cautiously processed data sets, including GRACE, lake altimetry, and model soil moisture, to reduce scaling factor bias and compare GRACE-derived groundwater storage changes to in situ groundwater observations over parts of East Africa. Over the period 2007–2010, a strong correlation between in situ groundwater storage changes and GRACE groundwater estimates (Spearman's ρ = 0.6) is found. Piecewise trend analyses for the GRACE groundwater estimates reveal significant negative storage changes that are attributed to groundwater use and climate variability. Further analysis comparing groundwater and satellite precipitation data sets permits identification of regional groundwater characterization. For example, our results identify potentially permeable and/or shallow groundwater systems underlying Tanzania and deep and/or less permeable groundwater systems underlying the Upper Nile basin. Regional groundwater behaviors in the semiarid regions of Northern Kenya are attributed to hydraulic connections to recharge zones outside the subbasin boundary. Our results prove the utility of applying GRACE in monitoring groundwater resources in hydrologically complex regions that are undersampled and where policies limit data accessibility. © 2016.

TI  - Trackerbots: Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle For Real-Time Localization And Tracking Of Multiple Radio-Tagged Animals
AB  - Autonomous aerial robots provide new possibilities to study the habitats and behaviors of endangered species through the efficient gathering of location information at temporal and spatial granularities not possible with traditional manual survey methods. We present a novel autonomous aerial vehicle system—TrackerBots—to track and localize multiple radio-tagged animals. The simplicity of measuring the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values of very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars commonly used in the field is exploited to realize a low-cost and lightweight tracking platform suitable for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to uncertainty and the nonlinearity of the system based on RSSI measurements, our tracking and planning approaches integrate a particle filter for tracking and localizing and a partially observable Markov decision process for dynamic path planning. This approach allows autonomous navigation of a UAV in a direction of maximum information gain to locate multiple mobile animals and reduce exploration time and, consequently, conserve on-board battery power. We also employ the concept of search termination criteria to maximize the number of located animals within power constraints of the aerial system. We validated our real-time and online approach through both extensive simulations and field experiments with five VHF radio-tags on a grassland plain. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Physical Distancing And Risk Of Covid-19 In Small-Scale Fisheries: A Remote Sensing Assessment In Coastal Ghana
AB  - The novel coronavirus is predicted to have dire implications on global food systems including fisheries value chains due to restrictions imposed on human movements in many countries. In Ghana, food production, both agriculture and fisheries, is exempted from restrictions as an essential service. The enforcement of COVID-19 prevention protocols, particularly social distancing, has been widely reported in Ghana's agricultural markets whereas casual observations and media reports on fish landing sites suggest no such enforcements are in place. This study aimed to provide sound scientific evidence as a basis for informed policy direction and intervention for the artisanal fishing sector in these challenging times. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle in assessing the risk of artisanal fishers to the pandemic using physical distancing as a proxy. From analysis of cumulative distribution function (G-function) of the nearest-neighbour distances, this study underscored crowding at all surveyed fish landing beaches, and identified potential "hotspots" for disease transmission. Aerial measurements taken at times of peak landing beach activity indicated that the highest proportion of people, representing 56\%, 48\%, 39\% and 78\% in Elmina, Winneba, Apam and Mumford respectively, were located at distances of less than one metre from their nearest neighbour. Risk of crowding was independent of the population at the landing beaches, suggesting that all categories of fish landing sites along the coast would require equal urgency and measured attention towards preventing and mitigating the spread of the disease.

TI  - A Critical Review Of The Data Pipeline: How Wastewater System Operation Flows From Data To Intelligence
AB  - Faced with an unprecedented amount of data coming from evermore ubiquitous sensors, the wastewater treatment community has been hard at work to develop new monitoring systems, models and controllers to bridge the gap between current practice and data-driven, smart water systems. For additional sensor data and models to have an appreciable impact, however, they must be relevant enough to be looked at by busy water professionals; be clear enough to be understood; be reliable enough to be believed and be convincing enough to be acted upon. Failure to attain any one of those aspects can be a fatal blow to the adoption of even the most promising new measurement technology. This review paper examines the state-of-the-art in the transformation of raw data into actionable insight, specifically for water resource recovery facility (WRRF) operation. Sources of difficulties found along the way are pinpointed, while also exploring possible paths towards improving the value of collected data for all stakeholders, i.e., all personnel that have a stake in the good and efficient operation of a WRRF. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Optimal Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network Based Road Damage Detection
AB  - Floods are one of the most severe and most frequent natural calamities. It causes enormous economic damage and even leads to higher mortality rates. Studies on damage detection of roads using artificial intelligence (AI) methods gained more attention currently, especially in the development of smart cities. Therefore, this study designs an optimal Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network based Road Damage Detection (OFWNN-RDD) technique for Flooding Management. The OFWNN-RDD technique aims to exploit the remote sensing images to classify different kinds of roads. For noise removal process, the OFWNN-RDD technique utilizes Gabor filtering (GF) technique. In addition, the OFWNN-RDD technique uses the DenseNet121 model for feature vector generation with modified barnacles mating optimization (MBMO) based hyperparameter optimizer. Finally, FWNN image classification approach is used for road damage detection. The simulation values exhibit the supremacy of the OFWNN-RDD technique over other models with improved road damage detection accuracy of 98.56\%.

NDVI make use of the multi-spectral remote sensing data band combinations techniques to find out landscape such as agriculture, vegetation, land use/cover, water bodies and forest. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology is becoming an essential tool to combing multiple maps and information from different sources as satellite, field and socio-economic data. Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data were used to generate NDVI time series from Sep. 2017 to Nov. 2018. This research work was the procedure by pre-processing, signal filtering and interpolation of monthly NDVI time series that represent a complete crop phonological cycle. NDVI method is applied according to its specialty range from –1 to +1. We divided whole agriculture area into five part according to NDVI Values such as no agriculture, low agriculture, medium agriculture, high agriculture and very high agriculture area. The simulation results show that the NDVI is highly useful in detecting the surface feature of the area, which is extremely beneficial for sustainable development of agriculture and decision making. The methodology of reform NDVI time series had been providing feasible to improve crop phenology mapping. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.

TI  - The Restoration Potential Of The Grasslands On The Tibetan Plateau
AB  - While the alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have generally improved in recent years, some grasslands still suffer from varying degrees of degradation. Studying the restoration potential (R) of the grasslands on the TP is crucial to the conservation and restoration of its alpine grassland ecosystems. Few studies have assessed the restoration value of the alpine grasslands on the TP. We attempt to estimate the actual (ANPP) and potential net primary productivity (PNPP) of the grasslands on the TP. On this basis, we defined R as the “gap” between the current and highest achievable levels of restoration of a grassland. Then, R estimates were yielded for the alpine grasslands on the TP, which we used to analyze the restoration value of these grass-lands. Specifically, based on the meteorological data for the period 2001–2019, in conjunction with remote-sensing imagery acquired by a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer for the same period, the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford approach model was selected to produce ANPP estimates for the grasslands on the TP. Then, the Thornthwaite memorial model, the principle of similar habitats, and the Chikugo model, were employed to generate PNPP estimates for these grasslands. In addi-tion, the R of these grasslands was then assessed based on the difference between their PNPP and ANPP. The main results are summarized as follows. (1) A multiyear mean R of 332.33 g C·m–2 (81.59% of the ANPP) was determined for the grasslands on the TP over the period 2001–2019. A notable spatial distribution pattern of high Rs in the southwestern, eastern and middle parts of the TP, and low Rs in the northwestern part of the TP were also identified. Most of the grasslands in areas such as the southern part of Nagqu, the southwestern part of Ngari, Xigaze, Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefec-ture, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture were found to have high restoration value. (2) Grasslands with a stable R account were the highest pro-portion (76.13%) of all the grasslands on the TP, followed by those with a decreasing R (19.62%) and those with an increasing R (4.24%). Grasslands with an increasing R were mainly concentrated in the southern part of Xigaze, and parts of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. (3) Analysis based on the local conditions of the TP revealed a high restoration value for three types of grassland (i.e., alpine mead-ows, mountain meadows, and temperate meadow steppes), the grasslands distributed at altitudes of 3000–4000 m, and the grasslands located in the warm temperate zone. The results of this study are expected to provide scientific and theoretical support for the formulation of policies and measures aimed at conserving grasslands, as well as restoring ecosystems and degraded grasslands on the TP. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Agricultural Drought Characteristics In A Typical Plain Region Considering Irrigation, Crop Growth, And Water Demand Impacts
AB  - Hydrological models and drought indices based on simulation of soil moisture have been widely used in largescale agricultural drought assessments. However, hydrological models often oversimplify crop modules and does not consider irrigation, crop growth, and water demand impacts. Therefore, in the present study, a coupled hydrological-crop growth model Variable Infiltration Capacity - Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (VICEPIC) was used to consider the impact of the irrigation process on drought and propose a crop water anomaly percentage index (CWAPI) based on the crop water demand and consumption processes. Identification and assessment methods of drought events were also evaluated. The validation results of the VIC-EPIC model showed that the correlation coefficients between the MODIS evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration at 37\% merged grids were above 0.74. The correlation coefficient (0.79) of the CWAPI-simulated values and statistical values of drought area rates was greater than that (0.72) of soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), indicating that the simulation of drought area rate based on CWAPI was more reasonable. After identifying regional drought events and comparing the identified characteristic values of these events with the average drought data of each city, it was found that SMAPI misjudged some regions with high hydraulic conductivity as severe drought regions. This limitation was overcome by CWAPI, which directly reflects the degree of crop water shortage and considers the impact of irrigation on drought. Agricultural drought occurs due to low soil water content, which is caused by rapid percolation of soil water and insufficient storage of local and irrigation water. This study of drought indices will help develop a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with droughts by considering the impacts of irrigation, crop growth, and water demand on drought.

TI  - Geospatial Perspectives Of Sustainable Forest Management To Enhance Ecosystem Services And Livelihood Security
AB  - Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) contributes to human well-being by meeting people's socioeconomic, ecological, cultural, and spiritual needs at local, national, and global levels. Integrated SFM enhances forests' carbon value, and maintains or improves other important local or global ecosystem services to support local livelihoods. Enhancing the carbon stock of forests has the potential to make a large contribution to carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. Forests also aid in the preservation of groundwater aquifers that contribute significantly to overall agricultural productivity. The geospatial techniques provide a systematic, consistent picture of earth at regular intervals that help in detecting land cover changes and revealing biodiversity dimensions. With the availability of high-resolution satellite data, remote sensing has aided in the detection and recovery of forest disturbances. Adoption of a landscape-based approach to comprehensive land use planning, with a focus on forest ecosystem services and their long-term usage to support local livelihoods may contribute to SFM. Forest management should be guided by broad environmental and socioeconomic objectives that lead to ecosystem-based approaches (EbAs) to manage the entire ecological system in a holistic and integrated manner. The current chapter lays forth a comprehensive approach for supporting long-term forest management, with a focus on India. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2023 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - A Google Earth Engine-Based Framework To Identify Patterns And Drivers Of Mariculture Dynamics In An Intensive Aquaculture Bay In China
AB  - Although mariculture contributes significantly to regional/local economic development, it also promotes environmental degradation. Therefore, it is essential to understand mariculture dynamics before taking adaptive measures to deal with it. In the present study, a framework that integrates the Google Earth Engine (GEE) based methods and GeoDetector software was developed to identify patterns and drivers of mariculture dynamics. This framework was then applied to Zhao'an Bay, which is an intensive aquaculture bay in Coastal China, based on Landsat 8 OLI (2013-2022) and Sentinel-2 (December 2015-May 2022) data. The results show that the GEE-based method produces acceptable classification accuracy. The overall accuracy values for the interpretation are >85\%, where the kappa coefficients are >0.9 for all years, excluding 2015 (0.83). Mariculture increased in the study area from 2013 to 2022, and this is characterised by distinct spatiotemporal variations. Cage mariculture is primarily concentrated around islands, whereas raft mariculture is dominant in bay areas, and pond and mudflat mariculture types are mostly in nearshore areas. The growth of mariculture in Zhao'an Bay is attributed to a combination of geographic and human factors. The initial area associated with mariculture in a grid significantly impacted the expansion of the raft, cage, and mudflat mariculture. The distance to an island, spatial proximity to similar types of mariculture and types of mariculture are the main drivers of change in mariculture. Human activities greatly contribute to the dynamics of mudflat mariculture; regulation regarding the clearing of waterways directly impacts the dynamics of mariculture. The present study demonstrates that the proposed framework facilitates the effective monitoring of the mariculture dynamics and identification of driving factors. These findings can be exploited for the local planning and management of mariculture in similar coastal bays.

TI  - Adapting Yet Not Adopting? Conservation Agriculture In Central Malawi
AB  - Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been widely promoted as a pathw a y to sustainably intensi f y agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Yet despite decades of promotion, CA uptake in SSA remains sparse with only few analyses of its impacts on farming and rural livelihoods. This study, which focuses on areas in Central Malawi considered to have a relatively high uptake of CA , uses analyses of satellite images, field observations, interviews with farmers, extension workers and other people involved in CA promotion, as wel l as a household survey, to investigate how CA has been adapted. We find that the three CA principles - (1) continuous minimu m tillage, e.g. no-ridging, (2) permanent ground cover, and (3) crop rotation/intercropping - were not practiced as intended. First, one-thi r d of non-ridged land was tilled during the growing season, and ha l f was again ridged in the following season. Second, unless crop residues were added, the soil's surface of non-ridged plots was usually bare at planting, causing weed control problems, and an increased risk of erosion. Most farmers added large volumes of crop residues to their non-ridged plots. They collected these from the surrounding fields, but this practice severely restricted the size of these plots. Third, crop rotation/intercropping was practiced less when farmers stopped ridging. Thus overall, very few farmers practised a l l of the three CA principles simultaneously. CA promotion appeared to only increase yields on plots where mulch was added, but this practice is not scalable. CA promotiondoes not seem to have provided substantial benefits for overa l l farm productivity, labour-savings or soi l conservation.

TI  - Assessing Vegetation Decline Due To Pollution From Solid Waste Management By A Multitemporal Remote Sensing Approach
AB  - Nowadays, the huge production of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is one of the most strongly felt environmental issues. Consequently, the European Union (EU) delivers laws and regulations for better waste management, identifying the essential requirements for waste disposal operations and the characteristics that make waste hazardous to human health and the environment. In Italy, environmental regulations define, among other things, the characteristics of sites to be classified as "potentially contaminated". From this perspective, the Basilicata region is currently one of the Italian regions with the highest number of potentially polluted sites in proportion to the number of inhabitants. This research aimed to identify the possible effects of potentially toxic element (PTE) pollution due to waste disposal activities in three "potentially contaminated" sites in southern Italy. The area was affected by a release of inorganic pollutants with values over the thresholds ruled by national/European legislation. Potential physiological efficiency variations of vegetation were analyzed through the multitemporal processing of satellite images. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to calculate the trend in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the years. The multitemporal trends were analyzed using the median of the non-parametric Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, the Mann-Kendall test was applied to evaluate trend significance featuring areas according to the contamination effects on investigated vegetation. The applied procedure led to the exclusion of significant effects on vegetation due to PTEs. Thus, waste disposal activities during previous years do not seem to have significantly affected vegetation around targeted sites.

TI  - Mangrove Restoration In Vietnamese Mekong Delta During 2015-2020: Achievements And Challenges
AB  - Mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta plays important roles in protecting coasts from soil erosion and strong waves, supplying seafood, and accumulating carbon. Despite these benefits, mangroves have been and continue to be severely damaged by the impacts of natural and socioeconomic activities. In recent years, large areas of mangrove forest have been restored through planting and other various management actions. In this study, we analyzed high-resolution WorldView-2 images to quantify changes in the mangrove forest in seven coastal provinces (Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Kien Giang) of the Mekong Delta from 2015 to 2020. Our study is one of the first to analyze mangrove forest change at the commune scale, the smallest official administrative unit in Vietnam, to determine the area of restored mangroves. The potentials and challenges in future mangrove restoration were also assessed by analyzing satellite imagery and field survey data. In the study area, mangrove forest area increased by 11,184 ha (approximately 2,237 ha per year) from 79,593 ha in 2015 to 90,777 ha in 2020. A total area of 16,138 ha (approximately 20.3\%) was lost due to mangrove conversion to other land uses, aquaculture activities and coastal erosion, etc., while 27,322 ha (approximately 34.1\%) was restored or newly planted during state- and NGO-funded mangrove restoration projects and programs. These results confirmed that mangrove restoration projects and programs have played a significant role in maintaining and increasing mangrove forest cover in Mekong Delta. The results can also assist managers and decision makers in mangrove restoration evaluation, and suggest analyzing WorldView-2 images to monitor mangrove restoration over time in Vietnam.

TI  - Analysing Hiker Movement Patterns Using Gps Data: Implications For Park Management
AB  - In natural areas, park management organisations need to cater for economic, environmental, recreation and social demands and values. However, multifunctional land use also creates conflicts. Increased numbers of people using an area could exceed its ecological carrying capacity. The recreational quality of areas could be negatively impacted by conflicts in recreational behaviour. Therefore, park managers require spatio-temporal data on visitor flows, but there appears to be a shortage of suitable visitor data. If there are data available, these often do not deliver the information required by managers and there is little guidance on appropriate monitoring variables. This paper therefore combines user movement analysis with environmental and ecological factors for natural resource management. Through a case study we describe the entire working process from field data acquisition to usable park management information. GPS and itinerary data from 138 visitors to the Drents-Friese Wold National Park (the Netherlands) were collected to estimate visitor densities and distribution patterns within the park. Data acquisition is efficient in the working process, but careful error handling is a time consuming but necessary part of it. We introduce the definition of 'hard' and 'soft' errors to make spatial analysis more flexible. We show that walking speed, trip time and spatial distributions varied between park visitor groups. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis showed that factors such as the presence of marked trails, distance to facilities but not land use (such as forest or arable land) explained visitor distributions. Patterns differ between respondent groups based on group size and composition, which is also true for itinerary variables such as walking speed and trip time. The combination of high resolution location data with itinerary information from respondents provides a good impression of the different walking preferences of different respondent groups. We conclude therefore that combining GPS data with itinerary information is a useful tool in profiling different natural park visitors. This is useful information for park managers in steering tourists and in catering for different visitor demands in natural parks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature And Urban Policies: The Ferrara City Case Study
AB  - Today's global challenges are increasingly complex, and forecast scenarios show a general increase in risks that could compromise human permanence in some areas of the planet. In this context, cities have a key role, both because they concentrate an increasing number of inhabitants and because they will be among the first areas to feel these effects. As pointed out by the IPCC, addressing these challenges requires a redefinition of the organization of urban spaces by assigning, more or less explicitly, a key role to spatial planning. Urban and territorial planning may be the main tool in the regulation of transformation processes. Planning has a crucial role, especially if territorial transformations are no longer mainly linked to expansive logics. In this case, it is possible to orient urban choices and policies towards a sustainable use of resources, including land resources that continue to be overexploited. Starting from these assumptions, the present work intends to analyze the relationship between the LST (Land Surface Temperature) extracted from the data provided by MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and the level of soil sealing within the municipality of Ferrara in northern Italy. The reference period is between 2015 and 2021. The objective is dual. The first is investigating how the environmental matrix can influence the temperature values detected; the second is investigating how the implementation of transformative forecasts provided by the urban planning tool in force, could influence the thermal comfort of the study area.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing And Crop Models To Assess The Sustainability Of Stakeholder-Driven Groundwater Management In The Us High Plains Aquifer
AB  - Nonrenewable groundwater contributes ∼20% of global irrigation water. As a result, key agricultural regions around the world are on unsustainable trajectories due to aquifer depletion, threatening food production and local economies. With increasing resource scarcity in the central High Plains Aquifer in the United States, an innovative stakeholder-driven groundwater management framework emerged in Kansas referred to as the Local Enhanced Management Area (LEMA) program. This framework enables groups of irrigators to join together to implement measures to conserve groundwater. Here, we assessed the efficacy of the first LEMA to move the region toward sustainability with a process-based crop model driven by well records and satellite-derived annual land use. We found increased irrigation efficiency under the LEMA program reduced groundwater extraction by 25% (40 million m3). However, only 22% of pumping reductions benefitted the net water balance (9 million m3) due to decreased irrigation return flow resulting from increased irrigation efficiency. We then estimated economic impacts using simulated crop yields, commodity prices, and estimated energy saved from reduced groundwater pumping. Cost savings from reduced pumping were about 4.5 times greater than the income lost from minor yield penalties. This suggests that the program promotes both economic and water sustainability, but water targets may need to be more strict to stabilize groundwater levels. As aquifer depletion threatens crop production in many parts of the world, approaches that integrate dynamic process-based models with in situ and satellite data can inform economically and hydrologically sustainable management strategies. Our work highlights the need to consider both economic factors and root zone processes when evaluating irrigation conservation programs. © 2021. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Observation Scheduling For A State-Of-The-Art Sareos: Two Adaptive Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms
AB  - An observation scheduling for Gaofen-12 (OSFGF-12), a state-of-the-art earth observation satellite installed a novel synthetic aperture radar, is investigated in this paper. Considering a novel observation capability, uninterrupted imaging mode, we build a three-objective optimization model OSFGF-12 to minimize the loss rate of ground targets, the invalid observation and the times of opening sensor. We design two adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, ALNS + NSGA-II and ALNS + NSGA-III, where an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is adopted as the breeding algorithm, and NSGA-II and NSGA-III are respectively adopted as selection mechanisms. A supplemental selection mechanism is proposed to remedy NSGA-III, by which the iteration values of hypervolume obtained by ALNS + NSGA-III increase stably, and ALNS + NSGA-III achieves the Pareto frontier much faster. Extensive simulation instances are designed to test these two algorithms. © 2022

TI  - Soil Erosion Assessment By Rusle, Google Earth Engine, And Geospatial Techniques Over Rel River Watershed, Gujarat, India
AB  - The assessment of soil erosion holds paramount significance in sustainable land management and environmental conservation. In this context, the integration of advanced technologies such as the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), Google Earth Engine (GEE), and geospatial techniques presents a formidable approach for evaluating soil erosion dynamics. This integrated methodology proves particularly valuable when applied to the Rel River watershed, where factors such as terrain, land use, and precipitation patterns intricately influence erosion processes. The collective use of two methods, the quantitative method focused on RUSLE to assess soil under various circumstances of erosion and sediment yield, whereas the qualitative approach focused on spectral indices of soil erosion in GEE to generate degradation map. This study was aimed at evaluating soil erosion and land degradation across the Rel River watershed in the western region of Gujarat, India. Soil loss has been estimated using soil loss models, i.e., RUSLE and geoinformation datasets, which were extracted from GEE. The degraded area was prepared using GEE and mapped using geographical information system (GIS). The results demonstrate that estimated value for erosion due to rainfall is 37 to 40 MJ mm h-1 ha-1 year-1, soil erodibility is 0.01 to 0.05 ton h MJ-1 mm-1, topographic variables lies in a range from 0 to 20, and crop management factor is 0.001 to 1. The findings also demonstrate that the total annual soil loss for flood events in 2017 is 35.36 t/ha/year, which is categorized into the severe zone of degradation. According to the soil degradation map created using GEE, the majority of the study region falls into the low and medium degradation zones, while the northeastern part and river fall into the high degradation zone. The findings will be helpful in implementing soil management and conservation techniques to arrest soil erosion in the Rel River watershed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Monitoring Of Hydrilla {[}Hydrilla Verticillata (L. F.) Royle] To Aid Management Actions
AB  - Hydrilla is an invasive aquatic plant that has rapidly spread through many inland water bodies across the globe by outcompeting native aquatic plants. The negative impacts of hydrilla invasion have become a concern for water resource management authorities, power companies, and environmental scientists. The early detection of hydrilla infestation is very important to reduce the costs associated with control and removal efforts of this invasive species. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a tool for rapid, frequent, and large-scale monitoring and predicting spatial extent of hydrilla habitat. This was achieved by integrating in situ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager satellite data for Lake J. Strom Thurmond, the largest US Army Corps of Engineers lake east of the Mississippi River, located on the border of Georgia and South Carolina border. The predictive model for presence of hydrilla incorporated radiometric and physical measurements, including remote-sensing reflectance, Secchi disk depth (SDD), light-attenuation coefficient (K-d), maximum depth of colonization (Z(c)), and percentage of light available through the water column (PLW). The model-predicted ideal habitat for hydrilla featured high SDD, Z(c), and PLW values, low values of K-d. Monthly analyses based on satellite images showed that hydrilla starts growing in April, reaches peak coverage around October, begins retreating in the following months, and disappears in February. Analysis of physical and meteorological factors (i.e., water temperature, surface runoff, net inflow, precipitation) revealed that these parameters are closely associated with hydrilla extent. Management agencies can use these results not only to plan removal efforts but also to evaluate and adapt their current mitigation efforts.

TI  - Classification Of Hyperspectral Images With Copulas
AB  - In the last decade, supervised learning methods for the classification of remotely sensed images (RSI) have grown significantly, especially for hyper-spectral (HS) images. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have produced encouraging results for the land cover classification of HS images. In particular, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have shown good performance. However, these methods suffer for the problem of the hyperparameter optimization or tuning that requires a high computational cost; moreover, they are sensitive to the number of observations in the learning phase. In this work we propose a novel supervised learning algorithm based on the use of copula functions for the classification of hyperspectral images called CopSCHI (Copula Supervised Classification of Hyperspectral Images). In particular, we start with a dimensionality reduction technique based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in order to extract a small number of relevant features that best preserve the characteristics of the original image. Afterward, we learn the classifier through a dynamic choice of copulas that allows us to identify the distribution of the different classes within the dataset. The use of copulas proves to be a good choice due to their ability to recognize the probability distribution of classes and hence an accurate final classification with low computational cost can be conducted. The proposed approach was tested on two benchmark datasets widely used in literature. The experimental results confirm that CopSCHI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods considered in this paper as competitors. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - The Relationship Between Fire Severity And Burning Efficiency For Estimating Wildfire Emissions In Mediterranean Forests
AB  - Forests are exposed to changing climatic conditions reflected by increasing drought and heat waves that increase the risk of wildfire ignition and spread. Climatic variables such as rain and wind as well as vegetation structure, land configuration and forest management practices are all factors that determine the burning potential of wildfires. The assessment of emissions released by vegetation combustion is essential for determining greenhouse gases and air pollutants. The estimation of wildfire-related emissions depends on factors such as the type and fraction of fuel (i.e., live biomass, ground litter, dead wood) consumed by the fire in a given area, termed the burning efficiency. Most approaches estimate live burning efficiency from optical remote sensing data. This study used a data-driven method to estimate live burning efficiency in a Mediterranean area. Burning severity estimations from Landsat imagery (dNBR), which relate to fuel consumption, and quantitative field data from three national forest inventory data were combined to establish the relationship between burning severity and live burning efficiency. Several proxies explored these relationships based on dNBR interval classes, as well as regression models. The correlation results between live burning efficiency and dNBR for conifers (R = 0.63) and broad-leaved vegetation (R = 0.95) indicated ways for improving emissions estimations. Median estimations by severity class (low, moderate-low, moderate-high, and high) are provided for conifers (0 .44 - 0.81) and broad-leaves (0.64 - 0.86), and regression models for the live fraction of the tree canopy susceptible to burning (< 2 cm, 2 - 7 cm, > 7 branches, and leaves). The live burning efficiency values by severity class were higher than previous studies.

TI  - Land Cover Dynamics Since The 1950s In Chemoga Watershed, Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
AB  - This study evaluated changes in land cover in the Chemoga watershed, headwater to the Blue Nile. Two sets of aerial photographs (1957 and 1982) and a multispectral Spot image (1998) were used as inputs to produce 3 GIS-based land cover maps of the area. The results show that during the last 41 years, forest cover increased at a rate of about 11 ha per annum in the 36,400-ha watershed. Woodlands and shrublands decreased between 1957 and 1982 but increased between 1982 and 1998, approximately to their previous levels. Farmland and settled areas gained from the other cover types (13\% increase) in the first period but lost around 586 ha (2\% decrease) in the second. Grassland and degraded land decreased, accounting for 4.8\% of the total area of the watershed in 1982 and 3.5\% in 1998, as against 9.6\% in 1957. Riverine trees suffered the greatest destruction, shrinking by 79\% over the 4 decades; much of this decline was due to cultivation. Marshlands increased in the first period and decreased in the second. A new pond emerged amid the marshlands between 1982 and 1998. Population growth and the associated demand for land and trees was the major driving force behind the changes. This study shows that the deforestation trend was reduced and even partly reversed in the area because local people planted trees as a source of fuel and income. This trend ought to be encouraged through appropriate interventions-in particular by promoting planting of local species rather than eucalyptus-to increase not only economic but also ecological benefits. Indeed, the current state of land cover and its dynamics have environmental implications at the local scale and beyond. Hence, environmental management for sustainable development requires interregional and international cooperation.

TI  - Trade-Offs And Synergies In Ecosystem Service Values Of Inland Lake Wetlands In Central Asia Under Land Use/Cover Change: A Case Study On Ebinur Lake, China
AB  - The ecosystem service value (ESV) of wetlands is a major concern in ecological research. However, inland lake wetland ecosystems in arid areas are easily overlooked and seldom quantitatively evaluated due to their relatively low biological production. In this study, the ESVs of the Ebinur Wetland Complex (EWC) in Xinjiang, China, were investigated for 11 land use types based on satellite data collected in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The results show that the land use/cover change (LUCC) in the EWC has been both naturally and anthropogenically affected since 2010, especially in constructed lands, shoal lands and marsh lands. The ESV of the EWC has increased overall, with a total increase of 6.34 x 108 yuan from 2000 to 2015. The ESVs were quantitatively evaluated according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) under different LUCCs. The ecosystem service factors (food supply (FS), wind prevention and sand fixation (WPSF), soil conservation (SC), and carbon fixation and oxygen supply (CFOS)) exhibited strong correlations (R-2 > 0.75) and synergies. The FS value accounted for the largest proportion (38.78\%) of the ESV in the EWC, followed by the WPSF value (31.93\%) and SC value (19.33\%). Among the LUCCs, the ESV arable lands accounts for the largest fraction (49.97\%) of the total ESV in the EWC. However, the increase was caused by the significant improvement in provisioning services such as arable lands at the expense of regulating and supporting services such as grassland and forest land (mainly cultivated to arable lands). Therefore, integrated strategies, such as the use of plantation water-saving crops, drip irrigation, captive breeding and the establishment of a nature reserve, will lead to sustainable development of the ESV in the EWC.

TI  - Increased Prevalence Of Some Birth Defects In Korea, 2009-2010
AB  - Background: Birth defects are a leading cause of neonatal and infant mortality, and several studies have indicated an increase in the prevalence of birth defects; more recent investigations have suggested that the trends of some defects are increasing in rapidly industrialized areas. This study estimates the prevalence rate and types of birth defects in Korea. Methods: This study used medical insurance benefit data of 403,250 infants aged less than one year from the National Health Insurance Corporation from seven metropolitan areas in Korea for 2009 and 2010. Results: The prevalence rate of birth defects was 548.3 per 10,000 births (95 % CI: 541.1-555.6), 306.8 among boys and 241.5 among girls. Anomalies of the circulatory system (particularly septal defects) were the most common (180.8 per 10,000), followed by defects of the genitourinary tract (130.1 per 10,000) (particularly obstructive genitourinary and undescended testis), musculoskeletal system (105.7 per 10,000), digestive system (24.7 per 10,000), and central nervous system (15.6 per 10,000). Conclusions: Relatively higher rates of some birth defects were found in the metropolitan areas. The high differences of birth prevalences for septal heart defects and undescended testis are probably due in part to progress in clinical management and more frequent prenatal diagnosis. Environmental exposure might play a critical role in the development of some birth defects. In attempting to describe the prevalence and spatio-temporal variations of birth defects in Korea, establishment of a registry system of birth defects and environmental surveillance are needed. © 2016 Lamichhane et al.

TI  - Applying Multi-Temporal Landsat Satellite Data And Markov-Cellular Automata To Predict Forest Cover Change And Forest Degradation Of Sundarban Reserve Forest, Bangladesh
AB  - Overdependence on and exploitation of forest resources have significantly transformed the natural reserve forest of Sundarban, which shares the largest mangrove territory in the world, into a great degradation status. By observing these, a most pressing concern is how much degradation occurred in the past, and what will be the scenarios in the future if they continue? To confirm the degradation status in the past decades and reveal the future trend, we took Sundarban Reserve Forest (SRF) as an example, and used satellite Earth observation historical Landsat imagery between 1989 and 2019 as existing data and primary data. Moreover, a geographic information system model was considered to estimate land cover (LC) change and spatial health quality of the SRF from 1989 to 2029 based on the large and small tree categories. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) technique was employed to classify the historical images with five different LC types, which were further considered for future projection (2029) including trends based on 2019 simulation results from 1989 and 2019 LC maps using the Markov-cellular automata model. The overall accuracy achieved was 82.30\%similar to 90.49\% with a kappa value of 0.75 similar to 0.87. The historical result showed forest degradation in the past (1989-2019) of 4773.02 ha yr(-1), considered as great forest degradation (GFD) and showed a declining status when moving with the projection (2019-2029) of 1508.53 ha yr(-1) and overall there was a decline of 3956.90 ha yr(-1) in the 1989-2029 time period. Moreover, the study also observed that dense forest was gradually degraded (good to bad) but, conversely, light forest was enhanced, which will continue in the future even to 2029 if no effective management is carried out. Therefore, by observing the GFD, through spatial forest health quality and forest degradation mapping and assessment, the study suggests a few policies that require the immediate attention of forest policy-makers to implement them immediately and ensure sustainable development in the SRF.

TI  - Analysis Of The Surface Subsidence Induced By Mining Near-Surface Thick Lead-Zinc Deposit Based On Numerical Simulation
AB  - This paper describes a case study of surface subsidence in the Hongling Lead-Zinc Mine. Hongling Lead-Zinc Mine is located in Inner Mongolia, China, about 240 km away from the border between China and Mongolia. There is a batch of outcrops of the near-surface thick steep-dip metamorphic orebody. The large-scale surface subsidence induced by underground excavation has brought some impact on the safety of herdsmen and their daily husbandry activities nearby. The requirements of reclamation for subsidence areas in the relevant laws and regulations, raise enormous pressure and risk on safe and economic operation. In this paper, a 3D numerical model of this mine was built by 3DMine and FLAC3D to analyse the excavation procedure and mechanism. The results of the simulation were in good agreement with the field subsidence data collected by satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles from 2009 to 2019. The analysis showed that the current mining method—an integrated underground method of stoping and caving—accelerated the surface subsidence, and some measures of monitoring, controlling and management were expected to take in order to improve economic and ecological benefits. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - The Potential Of Global Reanalysis Datasets In Identifying Flood Events In Southern Africa
AB  - Sufficient and accurate hydro-meteorological data are essential to manage water resources. Recently developed global reanalysis datasets have significant potential in providing these data, especially in regions such as Southern Africa that are both vulnerable and data poor. These global reanalysis datasets have, however, not yet been exhaustively validated and it is thus unclear to what extent these are able to adequately capture the climatic variability of water resources, in particular for extreme events such as floods. This article critically assesses the potential of a recently developed global Water Resources Reanalysis (WRR) dataset developed in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (EU-FP7) eartH2Observe (E2O) project for identifying floods, focussing on the occurrence of floods in the Limpopo River basin in Southern Africa. The discharge outputs of seven global models and ensemble mean of those models as available in the WRR dataset are analysed and compared against two benchmarks of flood events in the Limpopo River basin. The first benchmark is based on observations from the available stations, while the second is developed based on flood events that have led to damages as reported in global databases of damaging flood events. Results show that, while the WRR dataset provides useful data for detecting the occurrence of flood events in the Limpopo River basin, variation exists amongst the global models regarding their capability to identify the magnitude of those events. The study also reveals that the models are better able to capture flood events at stations with a large upstream catchment area. Improved performance for most models is found for the 0.25 degrees resolution global model, when compared to the lower-resolution 0.5 degrees models, thus underlining the added value of increased-resolution global models. The skill of the global hydrological models (GHMs) in identifying the severity of flood events in poorly gauged basins such as the Limpopo can be used to estimate the impacts of those events using the benchmark of reported damaging flood events developed at the basin level, though this could be improved if further details on location and impacts are included in disaster databases. Large-scale models such as those included in the WRR dataset are used by both global and continental forecasting systems, and this study sheds light on the potential these have in providing information useful for local-scale flood risk management. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights in the applicability of global reanalysis data for identifying impacting flood events in data-sparse regions.

TI  - Hydrologic Evaluation Of The Trmm Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis Over Ganjiang Basin In Humid Southeastern China
AB  - This study assesses the successive Version-6 and Version-7 TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) products including near-real-time products (3B42RTV6 and 3B42RTV7) and post-real-time research products (3B42V6 and 3B42V7) from March 2002 to February 2008 over Ganjiang Basin in the humid southeastern China, located in the lower reach of Yangtze River. Direct comparison of TMPA rainfall estimates with ground observation shows that the spatial and temporal rainfall characteristics over this region are well captured by 3B42V6, 3B42RTV7, and 3B42V7. In terms of daily grid-based comparison, 3B42RTV7 has been improved over 3B42RTV6 by reducing relative bias (RB) from-30.25\% to 4.93\%; 3B42V6, 3B42RTV7, and 3B42V7 show close performance with each other with RB less than 5\% and moderate correlative coefficient (CC, 0.59). Daily hydrologic simulation with Xin'anjiang hydrologic model using these TMPA products as input shows that: 1) 3B42V6 and 3B42V7 demonstrate very comparable hydrologic skills, which are close to those of the reference rainfall with high Nash-Sutcliffe index (NSCE, 0.71 and 0.72, respectively) and strong correlation (CC = 0.88); and 2) 3B42RTV7 displays a better hydrologic performance than 3B42RTV6 by increasing the NSCE from 0.56 to 0.59, improving CC from 0.81 to 0.87, and reducing RB from -33.15\% to 20.93\%. This improvement of real-time TMPA product shows its potential hydrologic utility in water resource management and flood forecast. Finally, this study provides useful reference for TMPA developers and insights for the end users in their applications.

TI  - Mapping Groundwater Prospective Areas Using Remote Sensing And Gis-Based Data Driven Frequency Ratio Techniques And Detecting Land Cover Changes In The Yellow River Basin, China
AB  - Groundwater is an essential resource that meets all of humanity's daily water demands, supports industrial development, influences agricultural output, and maintains ecological equilibrium. Remote sensing data can predict the location of potential water resources. The current study was conducted in China's Yellow River region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR). Through the use of a GIS-based frequency ratio machine learning technique, nine layers of evidence influenced by remote sensing data were generated and integrated. The layers used are soil characteristics, aspect, and roughness index of the terrain, drainage density, elevation, lineament density, depressions, rainfall, and distance to the river from the location. Six groundwater prospective zones (GWPZs) were found to have very low (13\%), low (30\%), moderate (25\%), high (16\%), very high (11\%), and extreme potentiality (5.26\%) values. According to well data used to validate the GWPZs map, approximately 40\% of the wells are consistent to very high to excellent zones. Information about groundwater productivity was gathered from 150 well locations. Using well data that had not been used for model training, the resulting GWPZs maps were validated using area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis. FR models have an accuracy rating of 0.759. Landsat data were used to characterize the study area's changes in land cover. The spatiotemporal differences in land cover are detected and quantified using multi-temporal images which revealed changes in water, agricultural, and anthropogenic activities. Overall, combining different data sets through a GIS can reveal the promising areas of water resources that aid planners and managers.

TI  - Environmental Variables Influencing Occurrence And Distribution Of Delphinus Delphis In The Eastern Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean Sea)
AB  - Cetaceans are considered bioindicators of the health state of marine ecosystems owing to their wide distribution across the different aquatic ecosystems in the world and their significant top-down control role in the food chain, despite their low biomass. At the same time, effective management of wild cetacean populations severely affected by human pressure requires extensive knowledge on species distribution, habitat use, and associated threats. In this context, defining the factors that directly influence the local occurrence and distribution of cetaceans is one of the underlying challenges and is essential for their conservation and long-term survival. Delphinus delphis sightings data, collected between 2017 and 2021 during 284 standardized vessel-based surveys, were used to set up a presence–absence distribution model in the eastern Aegean Sea, eastern Mediterranean Sea. Binomial generalized additive models with logit as link function were run using the R package mgcv (restricted maximum likelihood method) and different biogeochemical explanatory variables collected from different sources. Longitude, latitude, salinity, chlorophyll a, dissolved ammonium, and dissolved phosphate were selected as non-collinear predictive variables. Through a model validation based on a 10-fold cross-validation approach and a random data splitting procedure of 70%/30% (train/test dataset), a model formula has been selected with an explained deviance of 38.10%, an Akaike information criterion value of 1,661.3, and an area under curve of 0.91. The study confirms that long-term time series of satellite-derived data are useful to assess the occurrence and the spatial distribution of D. delphis, suggesting the need for a better understanding of the influence of these environmental factors especially in the framework of climate changes. Outcomes highlight the need to test further variables and further methods in order to provide increasingly reliable results in view of the conservation measures that must be adopted to stop or reduce the degree of pressure to which these species are subjected. © 2023 The Authors.

TI  - The Utility Of Remote Video Technology In Continuing Neurosurgical Care In The Covid-19 Era: Reflections From The Past Year
AB  - Objective: In 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed existing stressors in the neurosurgical care infrastructure in the United States. We aimed to detail innovative technologic solutions inspired by the pandemic-related restrictions that augmented neurosurgical education and care delivery. Methods: Several digital health and audiovisual innovations were implemented, including use of remote video technology to facilitate inpatient consultations and outpatient ambulatory virtual visits, optimize regional hospital neurosurgical coverage, expand interdisciplinary patient management conferences (i.e., tumor board), and further enhance the neurosurgical resident education program. Enterprise patient experience data were queried to evaluate patient satisfaction following the switch to virtual visits. Results: Between January 2020 and April 2021, use of virtual visits more than doubled in the Department of Neurosurgery. A survey of 10,772 patients following ambulatory visits showed that virtual visits were equal if not better in providing satisfactory patient care than in-person visits. After switching our interdisciplinary spine tumor board to a virtual meeting, we increased surgeon participation and attendance by 49.29%. Integration of remote audiovisual technology in resident didactics and clinical training improved our ability to provide comprehensive and personalized educational experiences our trainees. Conclusions: Digital health technology has improved neurosurgical care and comprehensive training at our institution. Investment in the technologic infrastructure required for these remote audiovisual services during the COVID-19 pandemic will facilitate the expansion of neurosurgical care provision for patients across the United States in the future. Governing bodies within organized neurosurgery should advocate for the continued financial and licensing support of these service on a national fiscal and policy level. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Review Of Best Management Practices For Potato Crop Using Precision Agricultural Technologies
AB  - Precision agricultural technologies (PATs) have revolutionized the way farmers grow crops, including potatoes. This review paper presented an overview of the best management practices (BMPs) such as soil preparation, proper irrigation, crop fertilization, pest and disease management, and harvest and storage of potato crop using PATs. The paper evaluated the economic and environmental aspects of the BMPs in five major research engines, such as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Sciences, and IEEEXplore. The paper discussed the challenges faced by potato farmers in terms of increasing yields, improving quality and reducing production costs. The use of PATs, such as yield monitoring systems, precision planting, variable rate application of inputs, and remote sensing among others, is discussed as a solution to these challenges. The paper summarized the current state of the art in these technologies and provided a comprehensive review of the existing literature. The review highlighted the benefits of using PATs in potato crop management, including increased yields, improved efficiency, and reduced environmental impact. The review paper provided recommendations for gaps and limitations in BMPs using PATs. The paper concluded by providing suggestions for future research in this area, including the need for more interdisciplinary studies and the development of new PATs.

TI  - From Modular To Distributed Open Architectures: A Unified Decision Framework
AB  - This paper introduces a conceptual, yet quantifiable, architecture framework by extending the notion of system modularity in its broadest sense. Acknowledging that modularity is not a binary feature and comes in various types and levels, the proposed framework introduces higher levels of modularity that naturally incorporate decentralized architecture on the one hand and autonomy in agents and subsystems on the other. This makes the framework suitable for modularity decisions in Systems of Systems and for analyzing the impact of modularity on broader surrounding ecosystems. The stages of modularity in the proposed framework are naturally aligned with the level of variations and uncertainty in the system and its environment, a relationship that is central to the benefits of modularity. The conceptual framework is complemented with a decision layer that makes it suitable to be used as a computational architecture decision tool to determine the appropriate stage and level of modularity of a system, for a given profile of variations and uncertainties in its environment. We further argue that the fundamental systemic driving forces and trade-offs of moving from monolithic to distributed architecture are essentially similar to those for moving from integral to modular architectures. The spectrum, in conjunction with the decision layer, could guide system architects when selecting appropriate parameters and building a system-specific computational tool from a combination of existing tools and techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a case for fractionated satellite systems based on a simplified demo of the DARPA F6 program is presented where the value of transition from a monolithic architecture to a fractionated architecture, as two consecutive levels of modularity in the proposed spectrum, is calculated and ranges of parameters where fractionation increases systems value are determined. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Simple Luminosity Normalization Of Greenness, Yellowness And Redness/Greenness For Comparison Of Leaf Spectral Profiles In Multi-Temporally Acquired Remote Sensing Images
AB  - Observation of leaf colour (spectral profiles) through remote sensing is an effective method of identifying the spatial distribution patterns of abnormalities in leaf colour, which enables appropriate plant management measures to be taken. However, because the brightness of remote sensing images varies with acquisition time, in the observation of leaf spectral profiles in multi-temporally acquired remote sensing images, changes in brightness must be taken into account. This study identified a simple luminosity normalization technique that enables leaf colours to be compared in remote sensing images over time. The intensity values of green and yellow (green+red) exhibited strong linear relationships with luminosity (R20.926) when various invariant rooftops in Bangkok or Tokyo were spectral-profiled using remote sensing images acquired at different time points. The values of the coefficient and constant or the coefficient of the formulae describing the intensity of green or yellow were comparable among the single Bangkok site and the two Tokyo sites, indicating the technique's general applicability. For single rooftops, the values of the coefficient of variation for green, yellow, and red/green were 16% or less (n=6-11), indicating an accuracy not less than those of well-established remote sensing measures such as the normalized difference vegetation index. After obtaining the above linear relationships, raw intensity values were normalized and a temporal comparison of the spectral profiles of the canopies of evergreen and deciduous tree species in Tokyo was made to highlight the changes in the canopies' spectral profiles. Future aspects of this technique are discussed herein. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - The Scientific Framing Of Forestry Decentralization In Nepal
AB  - Technical forest management plans have become a precondition for transferring authority to local institutions in processes of participatory forest management. The plans are intended to safeguard environmental values and are justified by their relevance in daily forest management. To serve these functions, the plans must be informed by accurate information about the forest and be actively used by local communities. Based on studies in Nepal, this paper seeks to further our understanding of the role of so-called scientific planning in community-level management through time series analyses of remote sensing images, detailed forest inventories and interviews with community forest managers and public forest authorities. Results indicate that technical forest management plans have been elaborated haphazardly and that local communities base their management on other sources of knowledge. Further, community-level managers appear well-informed about forest condition and their practices contribute to sustainable forest development. We suggest the need to further scrutinize the regime of scientific management planning as its practical relevance appears questionable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Inelastic And Elastic Storage Properties And Daily Hydraulic Head Estimates From Continuous Global Positioning System (Gps) Measurements In Northern Iran
AB  - This study uses land measurements from the continuous global positioning system (GPS) covering the Gorgan Plain in northern Iran, over the period 2006-2016. The measurements show long-term displacements of about 84 cm downward, 17 cm northward, and 26 cm eastward relative to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame, and seasonal amplitudes of 25.19, 2.23, and 0.81 mm along vertical, north-south, and east-west directions, respectively, in the Gorgan confined-aquifer system (GCAS). Results indicate that the periodic signals in both vertical and horizontal displacements are consistent with seasonal head fluctuations in the GCAS, but the changes in horizontal components appear much later compared to the vertical component. The inelastic skeletal storativity is computed from GPS measurements to be as much as 12 times greater than the elastic value. Moreover, the daily hydraulic heads reconstructed from well and GPS data jointly are consistent with head measurements from piezometers. Furthermore, the irreversible component of groundwater-storage (GWS) variations incorporated from dewatering of compacted aquitards (0.62 m(3)/m(2)) is computed to be 9.5 times greater than its recoverable component associated with aquifer units (0.0655 m(3)/m(2)). This study indicates that quantification of inelastic storativity and irreversible GWS in those aquifers of significant subsidence is essential for sustainable water resources management.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Studies In South Asia: A Critical Review
AB  - South Asian cities are home to nearly 15\% of the world's urban population. These cities are experiencing rampant environmental deterioration, making them vulnerable to the impacts of climate change phenomenon, one of which is urban-rural temperature difference known as urban heat island (UHI) effect. While South Asian UHI research publications have tripled since 2000, a comprehensive overview of the experimental results, significant advancements and predominant directions in research is necessary to add clarity to the scientific understanding of tropical and subtropical urban climates and also, to aid city planning and policy-making. A review of 85 original research publications from peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in last five decades, covering 28 representative South Asian cities, revealed that Delhi, Chennai and Colombo were most frequently studied and satellite imagery based thermal mapping was used predominantly. Results from few significant studies have shown practical implications for energy use and management, human health, comfort and productivity, reducing air pollution and urban land-use planning. With similar patterns of urbanization, geographies and climate types prevailing across international borders, cities in South Asian region could mutually benefit from collaborative multi-disciplinary research efforts and knowledge sharing to competently respond to and manage the detrimental impacts of urban heat islands.

TI  - The Balance Between Economic Development And Ecosystem Service Value In The Process Of Land Urbanization: A Case Study Of China's Land Urbanization From 2000 To 2015
AB  - Beginning in the 21st century, the world entered a stage of the rapid development of land urbanization. In general, land urbanization sacrifices ecosystem service value for economic value. Optimizing the spatial pattern of land urbanization is the best means of balancing economic development and ecosystem service value. Taking China as an example, through remote sensing and GIS methods, this paper studies the basic situation of regional land urbanization and the distribution of other types of ecosystems from 2000 to 2015, assessing the relationship between the characteristics of regional land urbanization and economic growth and the value cost of ecosystem services. The results show that the spatial differences of land urbanization practices in China is significant and that the extensive development of land urbanization is a serious issue; the urbanization speed of provinces and cities with a larger scale of land urbanization is faster; the intensive, economical and centralized utilization of land urbanization is an effective way to improve GDP per unit area; and the ecosystem service value cost of land urbanization varies significantly among different ecosystem types and regions. For example, the loss of the ecosystem service value of wetland ecosystems due to land urbanization is the greatest, and the cost of the ecosystem service value of Inner Mongolia per 100 million yuan of new GDP is 13.1-fold that of Shanghai. Therefore, to improve the GDP output per unit area and reduce the value cost of ecosystem services, this study draws a series of conclusions and puts forward corresponding policy suggestions that clarify the development mode and priority development area of land urbanization.

TI  - Extracting Plant Phenology Metrics In A Great Basin Watershed: Methods And Considerations For Quantifying Phenophases In A Cold Desert
AB  - Plant phenology is recognized as important for ecological dynamics. There has been a recent advent of phenology and camera networks worldwide. The established PhenoCam Network has sites in the United States, including the western states. However, there is a paucity of published research from semi-arid regions. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of camera-based repeat digital imagery and use of R statistical phenopix package to quantify plant phenology and phenophases in four plant communities in the semi-arid cold desert region of the Great Basin. We developed an automated variable snow/night filter for removing ephemeral snow events, which allowed fitting of phenophases with a double logistic algorithm. We were able to detect low amplitude seasonal variation in pinyon and juniper canopies and sagebrush steppe, and characterize wet and mesic meadows in area-averaged analyses. We used individual pixel-based spatial analyses to separate sagebrush shrub canopy pixels from interspace by determining differences in phenophases of sagebrush relative to interspace. The ability to monitor plant phenology with camera-based images fills spatial and temporal gaps in remotely sensed data and field based surveys, allowing species level relationships between environmental variables and phenology to be developed on a fine time scale thus providing powerful new tools for land management.

TI  - Phenological Analysis Of Sub-Alpine Forest On Jeju Island, South Korea, Using Data Fusion Of Landsat And Modis Products
AB  - Climate change poses a disproportionate risk to alpine ecosystems. Effective monitoring of forest phenological responses to climate change is critical for predicting and managing threats to alpine populations. Remote sensing can be used to monitor forest communities in dynamic landscapes for responses to climate change at the species level. Spatiotemporal fusion technology using remote sensing images is an effective way of detecting gradual phenological changes over time and seasonal responses to climate change. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is a widely used data fusion algorithm for Landsat and MODIS imagery. This study aims to identify forest phenological characteristics and changes at the species-community level by fusing spatiotemporal data from Landsat and MODIS imagery. We fused 18 images from March to November for 2000, 2010, and 2019. (The resulting STARFM-fused images exhibited accuracies of RMSE = 0.0402 and R-2 = 0.795. We found that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value increased with time, which suggests that increasing temperature due to climate change has affected the start of the growth season in the study region. From this study, we found that increasing temperature affects the phenology of these regions, and forest management strategies like monitoring phenology using remote sensing technique should evaluate the effects of climate change.

TI  - Ground Subsidence Susceptibility (Gss) Mapping In Grosseto Plain (Tuscany, Italy) Based On Satellite Insar Data Using Frequency Ratio And Fuzzy Logic
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating and mapping Ground Subsidence Susceptibility (GSS) in the Grosseto plain (Tuscany Region, Italy) by exploiting multi-temporal satellite InSAR data and by applying two parallel approaches; a bivariate statistical analysis (Frequency Ratio) and a mathematical probabilistic model (Fuzzy Logic operator). The Grosseto plain experienced subsidence and sinkholes due to natural causes in the past and it is still suffering slow-moving ground lowering. Five conditioning subsidence-related factors were selected and managed in a GIS environment through an overlay pixel-by-pixel analysis. Firstly, multi-temporal ground subsidence inventory maps were prepared in the study area by starting from two inventories referred to distinct temporal intervals (2003-2009 and 2014-2019) derived from Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) data of ENVISAT and SENTINEL-1 satellites. Then, the susceptibility modelling was performed through the Frequency Ratio (FR) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) approaches. These analyses led to slightly different scenarios which were compared and discussed. Results show that flat areas on alluvial and colluvial deposits with thick sedimentary cover (higher than 20 m) on the bedrock in the central and eastern sectors of the plain are the most susceptible to land subsidence. The obtained FR- and FL-based GSS maps were finally validated with a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, in order to estimate the overall performance of the models. The AUC (Area Under Curve) values of ROC analysis of the FR model were higher than the ones of FL model, suggesting that the former is a better and more appropriate predictor for subsidence susceptibility analysis in the study area. In conclusion, GSS maps provided a qualitative overview of the subsidence scenarios and may be helpful to predict and preliminarily identify high-risk areas for environmental local authorities and decision makers in charge of land use planning in the study area. Finally, the presented methodologies to derive GSS maps are easily reproducible and could also be applied and tested in other test sites worldwide, in order to check the modeling performance in different environmental settings.

TI  - Runoff Observation In A Tropical Brantas Watershed As Observed From Long-Term Globally Available Terraclimate Data 2001-2020
AB  - Runoff information and its dynamics are critical for supporting watershed management; however, spatio-temporal data about runoff is rare or unavailable in data-scarce regions. Information about the performance of remote sensing-based runoff and its potential application is limitedly known. In data-scarce regions, this condition impedes comprehensive watershed assessment especially in the midst of climate change impacts. This study examined the performance of globally available monthly runoff dataset provided by TerraClimate at similar to 4 km spatial resolution and employed them to assess the runoff dynamics in a humid tropic watershed. Monthly TerraClimate data shows a moderate performance with an r of 0.63, RMSE of 57-127 mm/month and NRMSE of 18-30\% to the simulated runoff from a well-calibrated model. The upper region of Brantas watershed was found to be the hotspot of high runoff. About 25\% of the study area belongs to high runoff (0-33rd percentile). Over the last two decades, runoff has been slightly increased across the study area. Green vegetation fraction (GVF), precipitation, and topography are critical for regulating runoff dynamics. While topography and precipitation impact on runoff are straightforward, the GVF's role is complex and site-specific. High runoff was found mostly to be associated with high precipitation and steep slope. GVF appears to be less effective in representing ground cover against runoff generation due to high variability of actual ground cover types. Using time-series and change vector analysis (CVA) of runoff and GVF, the dynamics of watershed condition was examined. Long-term CVA analysis also found that the condition in Brantas watershed was fluctuated with slight increase in impaired condition. The study exemplified the potential use of the remote sensing-based runoff data in a tropical data-scarce region. Despite limitation of the runoff data due to its moderate performance, the globally available monthly runoff data from TerraClimate can be used to support regional water resource assessment in data-scare regions. Future improvement that includes downscaling and use of machine learning can be considered to improve the remotely sensed runoff data to deliver the bigger benefits of such data.

TI  - The Influences Of Land Use Changes On The Value Of Ecosystem Services In Chaohu Lake Basin, China
AB  - The loss of ecosystem services is mainly caused by the land use changes around the world. This study examined the influence of land use changes on the value of ecosystem services in Chaohu Lake Basin, China. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of land use changes on ecosystem services. An analysis of the land use changes was conducted based on Landsat images from 1985, 1995, 2000 and 2007. The method used to estimate the ecosystem service values (ESV) in this study extracted the equivalent weight factors of ecosystem services per hectare of terrestrial ecosystems and modified the value coefficients, and then the ESV were estimated by multiplying the area of a given land use type by the corresponding value coefficient. With the help of a sensitivity analysis, the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values was detected. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes in Chaohu Lake Basin's ESV using GIS-RS technology during the study period. The results indicated that: (1) the total ESV of the Chaohu Lake Basin was 10.16 billion Yuan in 1985, 10.13 billion Yuan in 1995, 10.03 billion Yuan in 2000 and 11.44 billion Yuan in 2007. There was an increase of approximately 12.61 \% over the period between 1985 and 2007, primarily because of increases in woodland and water body, (2) the area with increase in the ESV in study periods declined sharply. Where the areas were 44.24 \% of total area from 1985 to 1995, 27.52 \% from 1995 to 2000, 18.94 \% from 2000 to 2007 and 17.34 \% from 1985 to 2007, (3) the change rate of ESV in Chaohu Lake Basin was positive from 1985 to 2007. Generally, it should be emphasized on protecting woodland, water body and farmland as they have high ecosystem service value coefficients and large areas. In this way, a balance between economic development and ecosystem health will be maintained in the future. It is hoped that the results will be helpful for the management of Chaohu Lake Basin's terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Review Of Precision Agriculture Development Situations In The Main Countries In The World And Suggestions For China
AB  - It is needed to solve the problems such as relatively low input-output ratio and environmental pollution for Chinese agriculture, with the large amount of agricultural production and consumption. In the background of changing international situation and frequent natural disasters, transforming traditional agricultural production methods in China is an urgent. Driven by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud platform, automatic control, and new generation communication and so on, precision agriculture came out and was undoubtedly an effective way. Precision agriculture has become a common choice for developing sustainable and high-yield agriculture around the world. In order to obtain the development orientation of precision agriculture and successful practices in the world, this paper reviews the studies on precision agriculture developing status. The aim of this paper is to refine the experiences of precision agriculture developing in the main developed countries and regions and take a look at the precision agriculture development in China. Adopting the method of systematic literature analyzing and summary, Section 1 studies the development status of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions, such as America, Japan, European Union and Israel. The idea of precision agriculture was first proposed in America. Until today, America has developed mature precision agriculture system, which benefits from the highly developed technologies. Considering the serious contradiction between large population and less farmland, during 1970s, Japan took measures of consolidating farmland on a large scale and building farmland infrastructure and so on to improve the agricultural production conditions. The agricultural community was also formed to operate collaboratively the agricultural production. The development of precision agriculture in European Union is driving by digital technologies. The water-saving agriculture represented by drip-irrigation and sprinkler-irrigation has made remarkable results in Israel. The development experiences of precision agriculture in the main developed countries and regions enlighten us that: 1) the leading by government is the key; 2) the informatization construction is the foundation; 3) the advanced technology is the core; 4) the cultivation of new type of farmers is the guarantee. Section 2 analyzed the basements and weaknesses for developing precision agriculture in China. The weaknesses are the emphasis in this section. First, the farmland in China is scattered and the infrastructure is not perfect. Taking the informatization perspective, even though number of agriculture related information systems exist, the data and information are not interoperable between these systems. Second, at the present stage, we cannot acquire the temporal and spatial continuous agricultural information due to the rarity domestic satellite data and ground sensors for agriculture monitoring. Third, automatic variable operating system and equipment are lacking since the technology integration of information technology, communication and agricultural machine has not been achieved. Fourth, insufficient high-quality agricultural talents. Facing these weakness and Chinese conditions, Section 3 provided five suggestions to develop precision agriculture in China. Firstly, our government should overall plan and give guarantee in police making, infrastructure construction and financial support, etc. Secondly, we should improve the agricultural production condition through expanding moderately the operating scale of farmland and constructing the field infrastructure net and the national agricultural information platform. Thirdly, the key technology research, such as the information retrieval using remote sensing and technology integration of communication, automatic controlling, spatial information and smart machinery must be focused. Fourthly, the new type of personnel in agricultural field can be cultivated. Fifthly, pilot demonstration can be carried out ac ording to the regional difference. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Mapping Spatial Distribution Of Invasive Alien Species Through Satellite Remote Sensing In Karachi, Pakistan: An Urban Ecological Perspective
AB  - The exponential population growth of Karachi city has taken a very heavy toll on the indigenous environment of this South Asian megacity. In this context, the unlikely roadsides plantation of nonnative species by the city decision-makers was a short-term solution to cultivate green belts, ultimately, to improve city environment. However, this has backfired and become a very serious ecological crisis as the species become invasive alien species and destroyed the native ecological environment of the city significantly. This study provided an accurate spatial extent of invasive alien species and evaluated the intensity of the problem using remote sensing technology. Firstly, the importance value index was developed to highlight the intensity of invasive alien species in native plant communities. Afterwards, the hot spots were sampled to develop training areas for Object Based Image Analysis to map the extent of invasive alien species in the city using high-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery. The overall accuracy of mapping was 93.17% with Kappa coefficient value of 0.904. In addition, to explore hyperspectral remote sensing analysis, two techniques—Derivative Vegetation Index and Spectral Angle Mapper—were employed on EO-I hyperspectral imagery to map invasive alien species using spectral signatures. The analysis revealed 99.94% correlation between the two mapping techniques. Finally, to identify the impact of invasive alien species on the microclimate of the city, a spatiotemporal analysis (1992–2016) at selected sites was performed on Landsat thermal images. The study ruled out the concept of invasive alien species influence on the microclimate of the city as both vegetation growth and ambient air temperature change were not interdependent. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

TI  - Ship Detection In Spaceborne Infrared Image Based On Lightweight Cnn And Multisource Feature Cascade Decision
AB  - Infrared remote-sensing images have irreplaceable value in military and civilian research, such as remote surveillance and military reconnaissance. However, under the conditions of complex scenes, infrared ship detection still faces great challenges. Most importantly, because of the limited hardware resource, the spaceborne satellites usually have weak computational processing ability, which makes the traditional convolution neural network (CNN)-based detection algorithms difficult to show their power. In terms of the above facts, this article proposes a high-performance but low-computation and storage-efficient ship detection algorithm to adapt the severe spaceborne environment. Overall, our method contains the following technical steps: 1) we first present a novel iterative precise segmentation of land and sea algorithm to preprocess the complex and diverse remote-sensing scenes; 2) the multivariate Gaussian distribution is then selected to extract the ship target candidate regions to guarantee the detection recall; 3) we adopt the optical panchromatic data to assist the limited infrared data training; and 4) the cascade decision of multisource features including global and local cues is next utilized to gradually eliminate false alarms. Due to the high efficiency, the proposed method can implement well on the hardware platform of DSP and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture. We conduct a series of experiments and compare with the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. Experimental results show that our method has fewer parameters but can achieve strong detection robustness against the noise, cloud and reef interfere, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Pattern Of Gypsum Blooms In The Salton Sea, California, During 2000-2018
AB  - Algal blooms and the resulting deterioration of water quality have threatened the environmental health of inland lakes. This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea, the largest inland water body in California. An innovative gypsum bloom index (GI) was proposed to detect gypsum blooms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra data for three bands (469, 555, and 859 nm) during 2000-2018. Discoloration (from green to reddish brown) was observed in the gypsum bloom-infested waters mapped using the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color model. We found that: (1) the GI is able to effectively map gypsum blooms in the Salton Sea with a relatively high accuracy (85 \%); (2) the largest gypsum bloom area was observed in summer (August and September), with notable gypsum blooms lasting more than 40 days in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2016, and 2018; (3) the gypsum bloom-infested waters shifted from the center to the southeastern shore of the lake during 2003-2018, and the frequency of gypsum blooms significantly increased since 2008. Meanwhile, the temporal and spatial differences between the northwestern and south-eastern lake increased over the observation period; and (4) discoloration occurred in the gypsum bloom-infested waters and lasted for 14 days on average, longer periods of discoloration (more than 20 days) occurred d in 2002, 2016, and 2018. The reconstruction of gypsum bloom dynamics in the Salton Sea provides valuable information for the practical management and restoration of the Salton Sea.

TI  - The Economic Impacts Of The Commercial Space Industry
AB  - The market structure of government investment domination in the space industry is being disrupted as commercial companies began working in the commercial space sector. As the 1960s was known as a government-funded space race, the 21st century may be known as a private interest space race. U.S. policy intended to speed innovation and drive costs down by expanding the role of commercial space companies. Hence, the 2018 orbiting sports car, yet more importantly, reusable rockets, satellites, and associated services developed as a result of the deliberate shift in government policy starting with the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984. As growth is expected to accelerate, input-output analysis is useful to predict what industries will benefit and inform the government in their policy decisions. Using a benchmarked growth rate, this research constructed the projected economic impact of yearly growth in commercial space on the U.S. and Florida economies and industries. Growth in the sector not only spurs growth in higher labor income jobs but also causes growth in jobs in other sectors, some of which also have higher than average labor income. Furthermore, growing these types of jobs would have a positive influence on the U.S. and Florida's economy and tax revenues. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Developing Multidisciplinary Clinics For Neuromuscular Care And Research
AB  - Multidisciplinary care is considered the standard of care for both adult and pediatric neuromuscular disorders and has been associated with improved quality of life, resource utilization, and health outcomes. Multidisciplinary care is delivered in multidisciplinary clinics that coordinate care across multiple specialties by reducing travel burden and streamlining care. In addition, the multidisciplinary care setting facilitates the integration of clinical research, patient advocacy, and care innovation (e.g., telehealth). Yet, multidisciplinary care requires substantial commitment of staff time and resources. We calculated personnel costs in our ALS clinic in 2015 and found an average cost per patient visit of $580, of which only 45% was covered by insurance reimbursement. In this review, we will describe classic and emerging concepts in multidisciplinary care models for adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease. We will then explore the financial impact of multidisciplinary care with emphasis on sustainability and metrics to demonstrate quality and value.

TI  - Assessing Redd+ Performance Of Countries With Low Monitoring Capacities: The Matrix Approach
AB  - Estimating emissions from deforestation and degradation of forests in many developing countries is so uncertain that the effects of changes in forest management could remain within error ranges (i.e.undetectable) for several years. Meanwhile UNFCCC Parties need consistent time series of meaningful performance indicators to set credible benchmarks and allocate REDD+ incentives to the countries, programs and activities that actually reduce emissions, while providing social and environmental benefits. Introducing widespread measuring of carbon in forest land (which would be required to estimate more accurately changes in emissions from degradation and forest management) will take time and considerable resources. To ensure the overall credibility and effectiveness of REDD+, parties must consider the design of cost-effective systems which can provide reliable and comparable data on anthropogenic forest emissions. Remote sensing can provide consistent time series of land cover maps for most non-Annex-I countries, retrospectively. These maps can be analyzed to identify the forests that are intact (i.e.beyond significant human influence), and whose fragmentation could be a proxy for degradation. This binary stratification of forests biomes (intact/non-intact), a transition matrix and the use of default carbon stock change factors can then be used to provide initial estimates of trends in emission changes. A proof-of-concept is provided for one biome of the Democratic Republic of the Congo over a virtual commitment period (20052010). This approach could allow assessment of the performance of the five REDD+ activities (deforestation, degradation, conservation, management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) in a spatially explicit, verifiable manner. Incentives could then be tailored to prioritize activities depending on the national context and objectives. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Dynamics And Drivers Of Land Use And Land Cover Change In The Upper Awash Basin, Central Rift Valley Of Ethiopia
AB  - This study analyzed the patterns and drivers of LULC dynamics in relation to the expansion of large-scale irrigated agriculture in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia from 1972 to 2016. Aerial photographs (1972), Landsat images (1980, 2000) and SPOT5 satellite images (2016) were analyzed using GIS tools to reveal LULC changes, and documentation, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were used to ascertain the biophysical and socioeconomic implications and drivers of these dynamics. The study revealed that cultivated and rural settlement land, and urban built-up areas had expanded at the expense of forestland, woodland, shrubland and grassland. While an increase in the production of cash crops had brought some benefits to smallholder farmers, such as access to irrigation and modern agricultural inputs and technologies, the unregulated conversion of natural vegetation to cultivated land resulted in a loss of biodiversity, deforestation, and reduction of pasture and firewood. We identified that significant LULC changes in the study area were caused by intersecting biophysical, economic, institutional, technological and demographic factors, which reinforced each other with varying magnitudes at different moments in time. These changes were underpinned by one key driver, that is, government agricultural policies that promoted investment in commercial agriculture for national and export markets. The study shows that understanding the complex interaction between the contributing factors and drivers of LULC change is crucial to inform decision-making and policies, in particular, by directing responses towards the underlying drivers of change rather than only the proximate causes.

TI  - Two Steps Back: The Uncertain Promise For The Strategic Use Of Commercial Satellite Imagery
AB  - This chapter addresses the American experience in commercializing an earth observation and satellite imagery industry, particularly as it touches on defence and security policy. It discusses how the United States has attempted to achieve that synergy, and will evaluate the degree of success achieved. The American case is interesting because if the US can successfully reach some sort of accommodation between military, civil and commercial space interests, it stands to achieve enormous benefits. Some analysts have noted that the United States may have sought to encourage the early creation of a commercial satellite imagery industry, in order to ‘accustom people to photographs in space’ and help lend legitimacy to US military reconnaissance efforts. Encouraging a commercial satellite imagery would serve to meet both of these ends. Some analysts have noted that the attempt to diversify merely let many of the subsidiary firms already engaged in intelligence-community work transfer data back to the parent corporations for use in the commercial market. © 2004 James F.

TI  - Regional And Global Modeling Estimates Of Policy Relevant Background Ozone Over The United States
AB  - Policy Relevant Background (PRB) ozone, as defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), refers to ozone concentrations that would occur in the absence of all North American anthropogenic emissions. PRB enters into the calculation of health risk benefits, and as the US ozone standard approaches background levels, PRB is increasingly important in determining the feasibility and cost of compliance. As PRB is a hypothetical construct, modeling is a necessary tool. Since 2006 EPA has relied on global modeling to establish PRB for their regulatory analyses. Recent assessments with higher resolution global models exhibit improved agreement with remote observations and modest upward shifts in PRB estimates. This paper shifts the paradigm to a regional model (CAMx) run at 12. km resolution, for which North American boundary conditions were provided by a low-resolution version of the GEOS-Chem global model. We conducted a comprehensive model inter-comparison, from which we elucidate differences in predictive performance against ozone observations and differences in temporal and spatial background variability over the US. In general, CAMx performed better in replicating observations at remote monitoring sites, and performance remained better at higher concentrations. While spring and summer mean PRB predicted by GEOS-Chem ranged 20-45. ppb, CAMx predicted PRB ranged 25-50. ppb and reached well over 60. ppb in the west due to event-oriented phenomena such as stratospheric intrusion and wildfires. CAMx showed a higher correlation between modeled PRB and total observed ozone, which is significant for health risk assessments. A case study during April 2006 suggests that stratospheric exchange of ozone is underestimated in both models on an event basis. We conclude that wildfires, lightning NO. x and stratospheric intrusions contribute a significant level of uncertainty in estimating PRB, and that PRB will require careful consideration in the ozone standard setting process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Looking Into The Green Roof Scenario To Mitigate Flash Flood Effects In Mamak, Turkey, Via Classifying Images Of Sentinel-1, 2, And Planetscope Satellites With Libsvm Algorithm In Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
AB  - This research aimed to increase the green space factor to mitigate flash flood effects on urban storm water runoff in the Ankara Mamak region and to minimize the damages by flash floods. The land use/cover map was first obtained by using the images of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope satellites with the LIBSVM algorithm on the Google Earth Engine. The GSF value was then calculated and it was low (0.26) compared to world standards. This study was proposed as a solution for the flood disaster, using the extensive green roof scenario. After green roof conversion scenarios, the GSF value was recalculated. It was found to be above the minimum of green infrastructure that human settlements should achieve, regardless of density or land use (0.43). Offering high resolution images and the possibility of processing them via different algorithms of machine learning has revolutionized the environmental and urban-related studies as they help urban managers and planners to make decisions accurately and quickly. © Česká geografická společnost, z. s., 2022.

TI  - Overlap Between Highly Suitable Habitats And Longline Gear Management Areas Reveals Vulnerable And Protected Regions For Highly Migratory Sharks
AB  - Highly migratory species (e.g. sharks, tunas, turtles, cetaceans) present unique conservation management challenges due to their wide-ranging movements. Consequently, the extent to which management areas protect habitats for highly migratory species is often unknown. Within the southeast region of the USA's exclusive economic zone, highly migratory sharks are target and/or bycatch species in pelagic and bottom longline fisheries. Here, we developed maximum entropy habitat suitability models for great hammerhead sharks Sphyrna mokarran, tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier, and bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas within the southeast region based on satellite tag (n = 96) and remotely sensed environmental data. Modeled highly suitable habitats were compared to longline gear management areas to determine what proportion of these habitats are protected from, and vulnerable to, longline fisheries. The percentages of highly suitable habitats overlapping with longline management areas varied by species and season (78\% warm, 36\% cool season for great hammerhead sharks; 48\% warm, 79\% cool for tiger sharks; and 2\% warm, 100\% cool for bull sharks). Highly suitable great hammerhead and tiger shark habitats were relatively well protected from pelagic longline fisheries yet vulnerable to bottom longline fisheries. Additionally, both species were vulnerable to pelagic and bottom longline fisheries off southwestern Florida; thus, extending gear restrictions to this area may benefit both species. Bull shark highly suitable habitats were only well protected from longline gear during the cool season. These results demonstrate how habitat suitability modeling can be used to help assess the efficacy of spatial management strategies and inform conservation plans for highly migratory species.

TI  - Assessment Of Municipal Solid Waste Collection In Bolivia: Perspectives For Avoiding Uncontrolled Disposal And Boosting Waste Recycling Options
AB  - Solid waste open dumping is a big issue in the developing world. Environmental and social impacts due to this practice affect population health, increasing the spread of diseases and child mortality. The safe collection of waste is the first step for reducing these impacts. This research assesses households’ waste collection in a Bolivian developing city with the aim to find a solution to fostering waste safe disposal and recycling. The novelty of the study consists in implementing field analysis together with the use of geographic information systems and the life cycle assessment approach where the lack of data is challenging. Following the results of the research, the system optimization, compared to the current scenario, implies that: (1) collection distances increase by 8%, while the selective collection increases them by 27.8%; (2) the collection coverage increase from 51% to 94% and selective collection switch from zero to 6.7%; (3) about 75% of CO2-eq emissions are reduced, as well as the eutrophication potential (about 55%); (4) recycling reduces the human toxicity potential of 260% and depletion of abiotic resources of 30%; (5) finally, the cost per ton of waste collected reduces from 36.2USD t−1 to 26.5USD t−1, and rises to 39.7USD t−1 if the selective collection is applied. The research demonstrates how waste collection optimization can be implemented obtaining enormous benefits in developing cities. The methods and outcomes presented can be of reference for policymakers and stakeholders of the developing world for addressing safe collection toward sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating Tree-Related Power Outages For Regional Utility Network Using Airborne Lidar Data And Spatial Statistics
AB  - Trees play an integral role in the ?green? framework of an urban ecosystem. However, just as they are beneficial to the environment, they can pose a significant risk to utility infrastructure networks, particularly in severe weather events. The objectives of this research were to explore the effect of scale and spatial variation on the relationships between trees and utility assets for vegetation-related power outages through the incorporation of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) analysis. Tree location and structural metrics derived from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were combined with regional utility network GIS data to test the prediction analysis capabilities of global and local statistics at multiple scales. Pearson?s correlation was carried out to examine the relationships between tree structure and utility asset variables to vegetationrelated power outages, including the effect of the resolution, or grid-cell size, on those relationships. To test the performance of global and local regression modeling on outage prediction, ordinary least square (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were evaluated using four explanatory variables (utility wire length, utility pole count, tree canopy area, maximum tree height) at four different grid cell scales (50 m, 500 m, 1 km, 2 km). In general, Pearson?s correlation demonstrated the strongest positive relationship between explanatory variables and power outages when only aggregating 50-m grid cells exhibiting co-location of trees and utility assets to 2-km grid cells. Local regression models performed better than global models at all scales, with GWR producing the highest adjusted R2 and lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) values of 0.955 and 3213, respectively. Additionally, the performance of OLS and GWR models increased with scale as both models produced the highest adjusted R2 at 2-km grid-cell scale. GWR model outputs demonstrated unique spatial patterning across the study area. This research demonstrated the effect of scale and spatial variation on regression analysis for the estimation of tree-related power outages.

TI  - Lost But Not Forgotten: Identifying Unmapped And Unlisted Environmental Hazards Including Abandoned Mines
AB  - Environmental databases play an essential role in the management of land and communities, including mapping and monitoring environmental hazards over time (i.e., abandoned mines). Over the last century, mines have closed for many reasons, but there has been no comprehensive database of the locations of closed and abandoned mine sites kept for many regions of the world. As such, the locations of many mines have been lost from public knowledge, with no way for managers to assess the risks of land and water contamination, as well as subsidence. To address this knowledge gap, we present an integrated framework for identifying abandoned mine sites using a combination of satellite imagery, historical records, geographic evidence, and local knowledge. We tested this framework within the Newcastle, Illawarra, and Lithgow regions of NSW, Australia. We identified 61 abandoned coal mines which are currently unaccounted for in mine registries, with 56\% of all mines in the Newcastle region being unmarked (N = 32), 36\% in the Illawarra region (N = 22), and 20\% in the Lithgow region (N = 7). These findings demonstrate that our framework has promising utility in identifying historic and unmarked environmental hazards in both national and international contexts.

TI  - Research On The Siting Of Rural Public Cultural Space Based On The Path-Clustering Algorithm: A Case Study Of Yumin Township, Yushu City, Jilin Province, China
AB  - Cultural revitalization is the foundation of rural revitalization. Rural public cultural spaces are important places for rural residents to participate in cultural activities and important carriers for the occurrence, inheritance and development of rural culture. In this study, we propose a siting analysis method for public cultural spaces based on a path-clustering algorithm. Then, Yumin Township in Jilin Province is used as a case study to test the method. Within the township area, public cultural spaces are divided into three types based on the difference in service scope: "single-village decentralized", "single-village concentration" and "multi-village concentration". This paper focuses on the analysis of the siting of the "multi-village concentration" type of public cultural spaces using a path-clustering algorithm. First, the path-clustering algorithm is written, and then its parameters, initial clustering centers and number of clusters are analyzed for their effect on the clustering results. Two parameters, within-cluster sum of path distance (WCSPD) and maximum value of the path distance within-cluster (MPDWC), are proposed to evaluate the results of the algorithm. Then, taking Yumin Township of Jilin Province as an example, the villages in the township are clustered with travel distance as the main influencing factor. It is ensured that the shortest path distance from the central village in each cluster to other villages is no greater than the set travel distance. Finally, the public cultural space is constructed in the central village to serve all villages in the cluster. This siting analysis method can output a variety of results that can be used as a reference for decision making in rural public cultural space planning.

TI  - Assessment Of Hydrological Drought Vulnerability Using Geospatial Techniques In The Tons River Basin, India
AB  - Drought is one of the most severe natural disasters caused due to water scarcity, causing an adverse impact on an area's agriculture and water resources. The occurrence of drought depends on the amount, duration and frequency of rainfall. In this study, the SPI-12 time series was calculated using average rainfall over the basin for 69 years. It was observed that there was a total of 21 drought events in the Tons basin, i.e., once in every three years. Maximum rainfall departure was observed for the year 1965 with a value of - 39.4\%. An extreme drought event of 24 months was observed from June 2009 to May 2011 with severity of - 39.3 and mean intensity of - 1.6. Spatial vulnerability to drought calculated by using various geospatial layers was used for this purpose: elevation zones, soil type, land use land cover, population density, distance from river reach, slope, depth to groundwater level, and drought frequency map. These layers were prepared and overlaid using a geographic information system to form a composite map of the Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) to depict the spatial vulnerability of drought. The DVI map showed that 18.2\%, 42.4\%, and 37.9\% of the total basin area fall under moderate, severe, and critical vulnerability zones. Rewa, Satna, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra districts were found to be under the severely vulnerable category. This methodology provides essential information to decision-makers to identify the critical areas susceptible to drought and formulate the mitigation plan to minimize the damage to the economy.

TI  - Science Missions Using Cubesats
AB  - As the role of missions and experiments carried out in outer space becomes more and more essential in our understanding of many earthly problems, such as resource management, environmental problems, and disaster management, as well as space science questions, thanks to their lower cost and faster development process CubeSats can benefit humanity and therefore, young scientists and engineers have been motivated to research and develop new CubeSat missions. Not very long after their inception, CubeSats have evolved to become accepted platforms for scientific and commercial applications. The last couple of years showed that they are a feasible tool for conducting scientific experiments, not only in the Earth orbit but also in the interplanetary space. For many countries, a CubeSat mission could prompt the community and young teams around the world to build the national capacity to launch and operate national space missions. This paper presents an overview of the key scientific and engineering gateways opened up to the younger scientific community by the advent and adaptation of new technology into CubeSat missions. The role of cooperation and the opportunities for capacity-building and education are also explored. Thus, the present article also aims to provide useful recommendations to scientists, early-career researchers, engineers, students, and anyone who intends to explore the potential and opportunities offered by CubeSats and CubeSats-based missions. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Improving Resilience Of An Old-Growth Urban Forest In Southern Italy: Lesson (S) From A Stand-Replacing Windstorm
AB  - There is a current concern that the capacity of urban forests to recover from the effects of climate change may be diminishing. New management options are needed so that they can continue to provide ecosystem services to local communities. After a windstorm occurred on June 2014 pre- and post-disturbance stand conditions (years 2010 and 2015, respectively) of the historical old-growth holm oak forest of Parco Gussone were analysed by combining ground- and satellite-based methodologies. Results highlighted that Parco Gussone was primarily valued for its historical importance and, despite the phytosanitary conditions of the trees, no silvicultural treatments were made since 1986, most probably due to conflicts arisen between different stakeholders. Therefore in 2014, the windstorm damaged 406 trees (8.1\% of the total aboveground forest dry biomass) and it was stand-replacing on 1.53 ha (9.3 \% of the total forest area). Windthrows, heterogeneously distributed and unequally sized (103 canopy gap ranging between similar to 6 to 1632 m(2)), caused, overall, a significant reduction of LAI (similar to 19\%). The presence of large gaps promoted the invasion of non-native herbaceous species whereas native species of the shrubs and herbaceous layers were favoured when felled trees were left on the ground or removed mechanically during harvest, respectively. In this context, urban forests should be considered as 'complex adaptive systems', therefore natural processes can be simulated by applying a 'close-to-nature' silviculture (e.g. by opening small gaps), vulnerability assessed (e.g. using a tree-by-tree VTA), biodiversity and ecological resilience improved and short- and long term disturbance effects evaluated (e.g. analysis of disturbance attributes and stand dynamics) so that specific conservation goals can be adapted to a specific landscape and biotic community. By implementing and applying the proposed guidelines in urban forest planning, we are confident that the resilience of those Mediterranean urban forest ecosystems could be effectively restored and improved.

TI  - Methods For Specifying Spatial Boundaries Of Cities In The World: The Impacts Of Delineation Methods On City Sustainability Indices
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze how different definitions and methods for delineating the spatial boundaries of cities have an impact on the values of city sustainability indicators. It is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities from the outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. For this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. Although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. Those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. These methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. Furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. For example, the average values of CO2 emissions per capita and PM10 concentration in cities with more than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. When analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. It is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policy making. Otherwise, ineffective and inefficient policies will be developed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Archetypes Of Remnant West African Forest Patches, Their Main Characteristics And Geographical Distribution
AB  - Remnant West African forest patches provide crucial ecosystem functions and services while contributing to sustaining the livelihoods of vast numbers of people. The vast majority lie outside of protected areas, although relatively few are managed as sacred forests, which limits their access and use. This lack of protection, together with a growing demand for arable land and forest resources, have accentuated their fragmentation, degradation, and deforestation. There is therefore an urgent need to generate knowledge on their social-ecological characteristics and change pressures to support their conservation. This study investigates what are i) the main biophysical and social-ecological characteristics of remnant forest patches, and ii) the potential change pressures and drivers. Within this scope, we apply archetype analysis to discern processes affecting remnant forest patches. Biophysical and socio-ecological indicators were selected from a published dataset via expert consultation, and nine archetypes were developed by applying a cluster analysis. Evaluating the results in relation to ecoregions and landscape features using high resolution imagery, we identify common underlying social-ecological change pressures and characteristics. The most common archetype (2) is characterized by being close to protected areas and having a low average annual precipitation and cluster along the northern fringe of the study area. The second most common archetype (5) is characterized by lying in highly disturbed landscapes, having undergone biomass losses, and widely distributed throughout central and western Nigeria. Patches of archetype 8 found predominantly in mangrove and swamp forests, exhibit positive above-ground biomass changes and greening trends; we propose that these vegetation changes could benefit conservation measures and carbon sequestration programs. In contrast, archetype 10 patches show both forest and biomass losses and gains and are often encompass fragmented forests in urban/arable landscapes. Identifying such common patterns of anthropogenic and ecological change provides a means of prioritizing regionalized strategies for their conservation and sustainable use. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Object-Based Image Information Fusion Using Multisensor Earth Observation Data Over Urban Areas
AB  - At present, the majority of the world's population is living in urban areas. Cities undergo constant development in their morphology. The latter is always a turned-into-stone representation of the coetaneous social, economical and technical values. The technical developments in recent years of very high-resolution spaceborne earth observation methods enable mapping of large urban areas with a decent level of detail. Additionally, detailed elevation information of urban areas in developed countries is widely available. Digital surface models (DSMs) support the classification of urban structures beyond two-dimensional classifications. We present a hierarchical, object-based and transferable framework to extract the urban structure on a high level of geometric detail for two test sites in Germany. The results show accuracies of above 90\% for the land-use/land-cover classification for both test sites applying the same routines. DSMs from various sources have been utilised for the extraction of the individual building structures with accuracies of 90\% and 80\%, respectively. The methodology is suited to extract the urban structure on the level of individual buildings and the results can be utilised as 3D city model for the purpose of decision-making, urban planning and further analyses.

TI  - “What's Next? Calling Beer-Drinking A Sport?!”: Virtual Resistance To Considering Esport As Sport
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study virtual resistance towards the introduction of Norway's first professional eSport league in the category of sport video games (SVGs), Eserien – the professional FIFA league and its inclusion in the Norwegian Football Federation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative content analysis of texts published from the first season of Eserien was launched (December 2018) and during the first season of Eserien (April 2019 to December 2019) in Norwegian online spaces. Based on this approach, a total of 23 texts were subjected to a qualitative content analysis. The theoretical framework for the analysis of the material is Guttmann's (1978/2004) characteristics of modern sport and processes of sportification, as well as conceptualizations of the sport-health ideology in national and international sport policies today. Findings: The arguments made against the inclusion of the professional FIFA league Eserien as part of the Norwegian Football Federation revolves around three main themes: (1) eSport as something unhealthy and inactive, (2) issues of cheating and match fixing in professional eSports and (3) threats professionalized eSport poses for traditional football clubs and players in terms of securing sponsorship and gaining media attention. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is the small sample size consisting of data from the first season of the first professional FIFA league organized by a Norwegian governing sport body. More research is needed to support the results found here, and readers should be careful to transfer the findings from this study to other sporting contexts. Originality/value: This study is an empirical exploration of resistance towards eSport expressed by traditional sport fans. These insights expand on existing sport management research on spectators, commercialization and professionalization of eSport. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Remote Monitoring Of Garbage Bins Using Internet Of Things
AB  - The Internet of Things based smart bins with IR sensors which measure the level of dustbin being filled up. The container is divided into three levels of garbage being collected on it. Every time the garbage crosses a level the sensors receives the data of the fill level. This data is further sent to the garbage analyzer as instant message and view in the webpage. However, three sensors can be employed at different heights like h/3, 2h/3 and h, where h is the height of the bin, and it is used to measure the different level of wastage in the smart bin. Threshold distance is the difference in height at which sensor is placed and the level of garbage fill. Once the garbage level exceeds the threshold value, the corresponding information sent to the garbage collection unit and updated in the webpage via WI-FI module. The user can also know the status of the garbage level of the smart bin at any time by sending the query through the webpage, and the status of the particular smart bin will be displayed on the webpage. © 2017, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

TI  - Research On Construction Of Land Surface Temperature/Vegetation Index Feature Space
AB  - The land surface temperature/vegetation index feature space has important application in quantitative soil remote sensing inversion and drought monitoring, water resources management, such as soil water content, evapotranspiration. However, the study of its feature space construction method is still relatively lacking. In this study, we take the Oklahoma state of the United States as an example, the fitting method of the dry and wet edges of the land surface temperature/vegetation index feature space is carried out, and the linear and index, logarithm, polynomial, and power functions are used to fit the dry and wet edges, respectively, and the fitting results were evaluated by the measured soil water content data. We found that the results by polynomial function fitting, r-squared is the highest in the five fitting modes, and r-squared is more than 0.66 in the dry and wet edges of the feature space; and the water content of soil surface was compared with that of soil moisture content, and the root mean square error value is the smallest. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that the polynomial function fitting the dry and the wet edges is the best way to construct the land surface temperature/vegetation index feature space.

TI  - Determining Spatio-Temporal Variations Of Ecological Water Consumption By Natural Oases For Sustainable Water Resources Allocation In A Hyper-Arid Endorheic Basin
AB  - Natural oases, including desert riparian vegetation and terminal lakes, play an important role in maintaining the stability and development of endorheic river systems in arid areas. Determining the ecological water consumption (EWC) of natural oases is a critical task for achieving sustainable ecosystem restoration and services in endorheic basins. In this study, the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation, evaporation of water area, and seepage in lakes and rivers were considered in the EWC. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model was combined with Landsat-8 images and eddy covariance flux measurements to calculate the daily EWC of natural oases in the lower Heihe River Basin (northwest China) during 2014 and 2015. The spatio-temporal variations of EWC were investigated in detail. The SEBS model could satisfactorily simulate the evapotranspiration (ET) of forest, shrub, mixed forest and water body with R-2 value greater than 0.84 and RMSE value less than 0.9 mm/day. The total EWC in 2014 and 2015 was 6.59 x 10(8 )m(3) and 7.65 x 10(8) m(3) , respectively, and the EWC of the Ejina Oasis accounted for approximately 50\% of total value in the study area. The cumulative EWC increased gradually with the distance away from the riverbank as an exponential function and reached the plateau at certain distance. The monthly variation of EWC followed a unimodal curve with the peak in June and July, accounting for 42.16\% and 36.28\% of annual EWC in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The water balance analysis indicated that the river flow was not sufficient to provide the EWC of natural oases and water requirements of agriculture and social economy, and additional 1.23 x 10(8 )m(3) and 2.09 x 10(8) m(3) of groundwater needed to be exploited in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Several strategies for sustainable water resources allocation and ecosystem management in the study area were provided. Overall, this study provides an integrated approach with combinations of multiple techniques and high-resolution data for EWC calculation, which is useful for water footprint analysis and water resources management on the basin scale in arid areas.

TI  - Ethnobiology, Socio-Economics And Management Of Mangrove Forests:: A Review
AB  - There is growing research interest in the ethnobiology, socio-economics and management of mangrove forests. Coastal residents who use mangroves and their resources may have considerable botanical and ecological knowledgeable about these forests. A wide variety of forest products are harvested in mangroves, especially wood for fuel and construction, tannins and medicines. Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm protection. The overlapping of marine and terrestrial resources in mangroves creates tenure ambiguities that complicate management and may induce conflict between competing interests. Mangroves have been cut and cleared extensively to make way for brackish water aquaculture and infrastructure development. More attention is now given to managing remaining forests sustainably and to restoring those degraded from past use. Recent advances in remotely sensed, geo-spatial monitoring provide opportunities for researchers and planners to better understand and improve the management of these unique forested wetlands.

TI  - Assessing Wetland Degradation And Loss Of Ecosystem Services In The Niger Delta, Nigeria
AB  - The Niger Delta, being the most extensive freshwater wetland and aquatic ecosystem in West Africa, provides numerous services both to local people and to the West African economy. Ongoing environmental pressure exerted by large-scale oil extraction and illegal timber logging, however, are suspected to have had a substantial impact on the Delta's ecosystems over the last decades. Knowledge on impact of these activities on the region's wetlands now or in the past is scarce and patchy. To address this lack of knowledge, this study assesses spatiotemporal changes in two wetlands in the region by using satellite data from 1984 to 2011 and GIS methods. The results show that both wetlands have experienced substantial degradation, particularly with respect to the area of forest lost. Although comprehensive environmental protection laws were introduced in 1988, ecosystem services of up to US\$ 65 million in value were lost over the study period. The introduction of new legislation in 2007, however, is potentially a first step towards a more 'wise use' of wetlands in Nigeria.

TI  - The 2008 Map Of Consolidated Rural Areas In The Brazilian Legal Amazon State Of Mato Grosso: Accuracy Assessment And Implications For The Environmental Regularization Of Rural Properties
AB  - Accurate land use mapping in the Amazon is crucial to support the implementation of environmental policies. The new Brazilian Forest Code published in 2012 defines a ?consolidated rural area? (CRA) as an area within a rural property and occupied by humans prior to July 22, 2008. Environmental infractions that occurred before that date are granted amnesty and landowners are exempted from the obligation to restore the degraded areas. To assess the compliance of rural property owners with the environmental legislation, the Brazilian government created the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR), for mandatory electronic self-declaration of all rural private properties. The successful implementation of the CAR relies on the accurate mapping of CRA before the reference date of July 2008. The objective of the present paper is to assess the accuracy of the 2008 map of consolidated rural areas (CRA2008) that is the result of a fruitful collaboration between a non-governmental organization (NGO), a state administration and academic institutions. The CRA2008 map was produced by photo interpretation of high resolution remote sensing images and validated after comparison with 90 aerial photographs. The validation metrics (overall accuracy = 0.926, Kappa index = 0.851 and F-score = 0.924) confirmed the reliability of the CRA2008 map. Most errors identified were due to imprecision at the edges between CRA and native vegetation because of different spatial resolutions of the CRA2008 and the aerial photographs. Consequently, the results were slightly lower (although still high; Kappa = 0.835) in the Amazon biome where landscapes are more fragmented. Finally, in a context of severe criticisms expressed by national government leaders towards Brazilian research institutions and NGOs, our results clearly demonstrate the benefits of combining institutional efforts and of working in synergy to produce relevant information with the aim of ensuring the implementation of public environmental policies and thereby improving land use sustainability in the Amazon.

TI  - Digital Assessments Of Soil Organic Carbon Storage Using Digital Maps Provided By Static And Dynamic Environmental Covariates
AB  - Understanding the vertical and lateral distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is indispensable for soil use and environmental management because of their vital role in soil quality assessments. Primarily, they are needed in calculating soil organic carbon storage (SOCS). The objective of this research was to provide digital maps of SOC and SOCD variation as well as their uncertainties at multiple standardized depths (H1: 0–5, H2: 5–15, H3: 15–30, H4: 30–60 and H5: 60–100 cm) using a parsimonious model with optimized terrain-related attributes and satellite-derived data. SOCS were evaluated at soil subgroup levels. An area of about 808 km2 with varying elevation, plant cover and lithology from the Miandoab region, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran was selected as a case study area. A total of 386 soil samples were collected from 104 profiles comprising various soil genetic horizons. A continuous spline function was then fitted to the target properties in advance of creating a dataset at five standard depth intervals (following the GlobalSoilMap project). These were then grouped into three classes including top (H1), middle (H2, H3 and H4) and bottom (H5) depths to ease interpretation. Static and dynamic covariates (30-m resolution) were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and a suite of Landsat-8 spectral imageries, respectively. Four candidate models including stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), random forest (RF), cubist (CU) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) Tree were tested in this study. Finally, the digital maps at 30-m resolution of SOC and SOCD and their uncertainties were prepared using the best-fit model and the bootstrapping method, respectively. Four soil subgroups (Gypsic Haploxerepts, Typic Calcixerepts, Typic Haploxerepts and Xeric Haplocalcids) were identified across the study area. The covariates had variable contributions on the evaluated models. The XGBoost Tree model generally outperformed other models for prediction of SOC and SOCD (R2 = 0.60, on average). Regardless of soil subgroups, the uncertainty analysis showed that the SOCD map had a low prediction interval range value indicating high accuracy. Additionally, the highest SOCS and SOCD was observed at the top followed by middle and bottom depths in the study area. All subgroups exhibited a decreasing trend of SOCD with increasing depth. A similar trend was also observed for SOCS. The highest SOCD (on average) was observed in Gypsic Haploxerepts (4.71 kg C/m2) followed by Typic Calcixerepts (4.46 kg C/m2), Typic Haploxerepts (4.45 kg C/m2) and Xeric Haplocalcids (4.40 kg C/m2). Overall, the SOCS normalized by area within soil order boundaries was greater in Inceptisols than Aridisols across the study area. The findings of this study provide critical information for sustainable management of soil resources in the area for agricultural production and environmental health in the Miandoab region of Iran. © 2023 British Society of Soil Science.

TI  - Potential Development Of Irish Agricultural Sustainability Indicators For Current And Future Policy Evaluation Needs
AB  - There is a significant and detailed range of sustainability indicators for Irish agri-food production, but there remain areas where further indicator development or new indicators could prove valuable. This review provides an outline of potential developments in Irish assessment of agricultural sustainability following the latest research and in order to meet policy demands. Recent research findings have suggested means of improved quantitative modelling of greenhouse gas emissions, but additional dietary and soil data may be important for this, especially for the potential inclusion of any soil sequestration. This information could also benefit more detailed modelling of nutrient losses to water. Specific concerns over pesticide and antibiotic use may require additional survey work on the particular locations or types of farms of interest. Biodiversity monitoring could be improved by expanding the range of results-oriented agri-environment schemes or employing remote-sensing habitat monitoring, likely supplemented with targeted field surveys for specific objectives. Farm-level economic sustainability is largely well-covered, but additional data collection may be of benefit to address specific issues such as labour costs. Recent additional surveys on farm-level social sustainability have addressed important social indicators of isolation and access to local services, and could be rolled out on a larger number of farms in the future. Wider societal concerns such as animal welfare, genetically modified materials in foodstuffs and antibiotic resistance have limited indicators currently available, and could also benefit from additional surveys. The breadth and detail required in agri-food sustainability indicators present a significant challenge to survey design and implementation, but many developments can be achieved without additional surveys through the use of remote sensing and geospatial technologies and integration of existing datasets. Despite the important benefits of further developments in Irish sustainability indicators, consideration must also be given to farmer confidentiality and survey fatigue.

TI  - Mapping Urban Tree Cover Changes Using Object-Based Convolution Neural Network (Ob-Cnn)
AB  - Urban trees provide social, economic, environmental and ecosystem services benefits that improve the liveability of cities and contribute to individual and community wellbeing. There is thus a need for effective mapping, monitoring and maintenance of urban trees. Remote sensing technologies can effectively map and monitor urban tree coverage and changes over time as an efficient and low-cost alternative to field-based measurements, which are time consuming and costly. Automatic extraction of urban land cover features with high accuracy is a challenging task, and it demands object based artificial intelligence workflows for efficiency and thematic accuracy. The aim of this research is to effectively map urban tree cover changes and model the relationship of such changes with socioeconomic variables. The object-based convolutional neural network (CNN) method is illustrated by mapping urban tree cover changes between 2005 and 2015/16 using satellite, Google Earth imageries and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets. The training sample for CNN model was generated by Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) using thresholds in a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The tree heatmap produced from the CNN model was further refined using OBIA. Tree cover loss, gain and persistence was extracted, and multiple regression analysis was applied to model the relationship with socioeconomic variables. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of tree cover extraction was 96\% and 0.77 for 2005 images and 98\% and 0.93 for 2015/16 images, indicating that the object-based CNN technique can be effectively implemented for urban tree coverage mapping and monitoring. There was a decline in tree coverage in all suburbs. Mean parcel size and median household income were significantly related to tree cover loss (R-2= 58.5\%). Tree cover gain and persistence had positive relationship with tertiary education, parcel size and ownership change (gain: R-2= 67.8\% and persistence: R-2= 75.3\%). The research findings demonstrated that remote sensing data with intelligent processing can contribute to the development of policy input for management of tree coverage in cities.

TI  - The Application Of Geographic Information Systems And Remotely Sensed Data To The Conservation Of Heathland Fragments
AB  - The integration of data from field observations and remote sensing within geographic information systems (GIS) offers the potential for rapid, cost-effective surveying and assessment of biotopes of high conservation value. A case study of the Dorset heathlands in southern England illustrates the application of this approach. Information on the historical extent of the heathlands was combined with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to assess the current extent of the heathlands together with the potential for adjacent other lands (formerly heathland) to be converted to heathland again. The results of this work showed that the current extent of the Dorset heathlands is about 44·3 km2. Heathland that had been converted to grassland since 1960 was considered to be the category of land use most suitable for the restoration of heathland. It was found that 27·5% of this type of land falls within 100 m of existing heathland and, under changed management, could significantly improve the natural resource of the region. This work draws upon an existing understanding of heathland ecology and demonstrates the application of geographical information systems to the solution of ecological and conservation problems. © 1995.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling Of Forest Above-Ground Biomass Distribution Patterns Based On Landsat 8 Oli Images And A Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression Algorithm
AB  - Forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is an excellent indicator for the health status and carbon sink potential of forest ecosystems, as well as the effectiveness of sustainable forest management practices. However, due to the strong heterogeneity of forest structures, acquiring high-accuracy and high-resolution AGB distributions over wide regions is often prohibitively expensive. To fill the resulting gap, this paper uses part of Lishui city, Zhejiang province as the study area, based on 168 forest sample observations, and proposes a novel integrated framework that combines a multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) with the co-kriging algorithm to refine the spatial downscaling of AGB. Specifically, optimal predictor variable sets identified by random forest importance ranking, multiple stepwise regression, and Pearson VIF methods were first assessed based on their total explanatory power (R square), followed by reconfirmation of the optimal predictor variable set based on the non-stationarity impact of each variable's action scale (bandwidth) on the output pattern of AGB downscaling. The AGB downscaling statistical algorithms included MGWR, GWR, random forest (RF), and the ordinary least square (OLS), and their downscaling performances were quantitatively compared to determine the best downscaling method. Ultimately, the downscaled AGB pattern was produced using the best method, which was further refined by considering the spatial autocorrelation in AGB samples by implementing a co-kriging interpolation analysis of the predicted AGB downscaling residuals. The results indicated that the variable set selected by random forest importance ranking had the strongest explanatory power, with a validation R square of 0.58. This was further confirmed by the MGWR analysis which showed that the set of variables produced a more spatially smooth downscaled AGB pattern. Among the set of optimal variables, elevation and aspect affected AGB at local scales, representing a strong spatial heterogeneity. Some textural features and spectral features showed a smooth action scale relative to AGB, showing insignificant spatial scale processes. In the study area with complex terrain, using aspect as a covariant, the co-kriging (CK) model achieved a higher simulation accuracy for the MGWR-predicted AGB residuals than the ordinary kriging model. Overall, the proposed MGWR-CK model, with a final validation R square value of 0.62, effectively improved the spatial distribution characteristics and textural details of AGB mapping without the additional costs of procuring finer satellite images and GIS-based features. This will contribute to the accurate assessment of carbon sinks and carbon stock changes in subtropical forest ecosystems globally.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution Of Actual Evapotranspiration In The Indus Basin Irrigation System
AB  - Strategic planning of optimal water use requires an accurate assessment of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to understand the environmental and hydrological processes of the world's largest contiguous irrigation networks, including the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) in Pakistan. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) has been used successfully for accurate estimations of ETa in different river basins throughout the world. In this study, we examined the application of SEBS using publically available remote sensing data to assess spatial variations in water consumption and to map water stress from daily to annual scales in the IBIS. Ground-based ETa was calculated by the advection-aridity method, from nine meteorological sites, and used to evaluate the intra-annual seasonality in the hydrological year 2009-2010. In comparison with the advection-aridity, SEBS computed daily ETa was slightly underestimated with a bias of -0.15mmday(-1) during the kharif (wet; April-September) season, and it was overestimated with a bias of 0.23mmday(-1) in the rabi (dry; October-March) season. Monthly values of the ETa estimated by SEBS were significantly (P<0.05) controlled by mean air temperature and rainfall, among other climatological variables (relative humidity, sunshine hours and wind speed). Because of the seasonal (kharif and rabi) differences in the water and energy budget in the huge canal command areas of the IBIS, ETa and rainfall were positively correlated in the kharif season and were negatively correlated during the rabi season. In addition, analysis of the evaporation process showed that mixed-cropping and rice-wheat dominated areas had lower and higher water consumption rates, respectively, in comparison with other cropping systems in the basin. Basin areas under water stress were identified by means of spatial variations in the relative evapotranspiration, which had an average value of 0.59 and 0.42 during the kharif and the rabi seasons, respectively. The hydrological parameters used in this study provide useful information for understanding hydrological processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Results of this study further suggest that the SEBS is useful for evaluation of water resources in semi-arid to arid regions over longer periods, if the data inputs are carefully handled.

TI  - Measuring Community Greening Merging Multi-Source Geo-Data
AB  - Urban residential greening provides opportunities for social integration and physical exercise. These activities are beneficial to promoting citizens' mental health, relieving stress, and reducing obesity and violent crimes. However, how to measure the distribution and spatial difference of green resources in urban residential areas have been controversial. This study takes the greening of urban residential units in Shenzhen City as its research object, measures the various greening index values of each residential unit, and analyses the spatial distribution characteristics of residential greening, regional differences, and influencing factors. A large sample of street view pictures, urban land use and high-resolution remote sensing image data are employed to establish an urban residential greening database containing 14,196 residential units. This study proposes three greening indicators, namely, green coverage index, green view index, and accessible public green land index, for measuring the green coverage of residential units, the visible greening of surrounding street space and the public green land around, respectively. Results show that (1) the greening level of residential units in Shenzhen City is generally high, with the three indicators averaging 32.7\%, 30.5\%, and 15.1\%, respectively; (2) the types of residential greening differ per area; and (3) the level of residential greening is affected by development intensity, location, elevation and residential type. Such findings can serve as a reference for improving the greening level of residential units. This study argues that one indicator alone cannot measure the greenness of a residential community. It proposes an accessible public green land index as a measure for the spatial relationship between residential units and green lands. It suggests that future green space planning should pay more attention to the spatial distribution of green land, and introduce quantitative indicators to ensure sufficient green lands around the walking range of residential areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing For Surface Coal Mining And Reclamation Monitoring In The Central Salt Range, Punjab, Pakistan
AB  - The expansion and exploitation of mining resources are essential for social and economic growth. Remote sensing provides vital tools for surface-mining monitoring operations as well as for reclamation efforts in the central Salt Range of the Indus River Basin, Pakistan. This research demonstrates the applicability of remote sensing techniques to the coal mining monitoring scheme to allow for effective and efficient monitoring and to offset the adverse consequences of coal mining activities. Landsat 8 OLI images from June 2019 and 2020, and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image from June 2002, were used for this study. A three-phase methodology including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis, land cover mapping, and change detection approaches was adopted. Image classification based on Tasseled Cap Transformation and the brightness temperature At-satellite using the K-means algorithm was implemented in a GIS program to identify seven land cover classes within the study area. The results show some level of surface disturbance to the landscape due to the coal mining reclamation activities that had taken place over the 18-year time period. From 2019 to 2020, about 3.622 km2 of coal mines or barren land were converted into bare agricultural land. Over the years, it was also observed that reclamation areas exhibited higher values of NDVI than coal mining areas. The mean NDVI for coal mining areas was 0.252 km2, and for areas of reclamation, it was 0.292 km2 in 2020, while in 2019, the value for coal mining sites was 0.133 km2, and 0.163 km2 for reclamation sites. This trend suggests that coal-mining operations can be monitored using satellite data, and the progress of reclamation efforts can be assessed using satellite NDVI data from the target locations. This study is beneficial to agencies responsible for monitoring land cover changes in a coal mine because it provides a cost-effective, efficient, and robust scientific tool for making mine site allocation decisions and for monitoring the progress of reclamation efforts. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Area-Based Scenario Development In Land-Use Change Modeling: A System Dynamics-Assisted Approach For Mixed Agricultural-Residential Landscapes
AB  - This study aimed to enhance land use and land cover (LULC) change models by addressing their main limitations, which include the lack of accountability and temporal stability of driving forces. Additionally, the study aimed to create area-based scenarios to forecast future LULCs, rather than solely relying on distribution-based scenarios. To accomplish this goal, the study developed a coupled System Dynamics (SD) and Cellular Automata (CA) modeling system to simulate possible LULC changes in the Gavkhooni Basin, central Iran. The study utilized LULC maps from Landsat images in 2001, 2011, and 2021 to analyze spatio-temporal land use changes in the region. Agricultural and residential transition suitability layers were produced using a spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation procedure and applied to inform the CA model in the proper allocation of LULC changes. Three interconnected water supply, agricultural, and residential area projection subsystems were developed using system dynamics method to determine land requirements for LULC conversions from 2020 to 2041, taking into account factors such as water availability, land suitability, agricultural labor force, and economic development. Ten scenarios were developed based on changes in the key variables affecting the limiting factors, such as climatic conditions and water management policies, to project agricultural and residential areas in the future. The CA's spatial allocation informed by transition suitability layers was found to be satisfactory with a Kappalocation value of 0.85. The subsystems were competent in projecting water supply with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 6.57\% and the dynamics of agricultural and residential areas with MAE values of 2.94\%, whereas those of the Markovian Chain model were found to be 23.02\% and 7.5\% for agricultural and residential areas, respectively. The study found that available agricultural areas varied significantly between 86.53 and 1480 sq.km under different climatic conditions, irrigation efficiency, and agricultural water assignment coefficients between 2024 and 2033. Residential area demand was found to be increasing with different rates under the scenarios between 47.40 and 73.01 sq.km. The SD-CA coupled framework presented in this research can be viewed as a decision support system to develop compensatory strategies for better management and planning of agricultural and residential lands.

TI  - Quantifying The Dynamics Of Pig Movements Improves Targeted Disease Surveillance And Control Plans
AB  - Tracking animal movements over time may fundamentally determine the success of disease control interventions. In commercial pig production growth stages determine animal transportation schedule, thus it generates time-varying contact networks showed to influence the dynamics of disease spread. In this study, we reconstructed pig networks of one Brazilian state from 2017 to 2018, comprising 351,519 movements and 48 million transported pigs. The static networks view did not capture time-respecting movement pathways. For this reason, we propose a time-dependent network approach. A susceptible-infected model was used to spread an epidemic over the pig network globally through the temporal between-farm networks, and locally by a stochastic model to account for within-farm dynamics. We propagated disease to calculate the cumulative contacts as a proxy of epidemic sizes and evaluate the impact of network-based disease control strategies in the absence of other intervention alternatives. The results show that targeting 1,000 farms ranked by degree would be sufficient and feasible to diminish disease spread considerably. Our modelling results indicated that independently from where initial infections were seeded (i.e. independent, commercial farms), the epidemic sizes and the number of farms needed to be targeted to effectively control disease spread were quite similar; indeed, this finding can be explained by the presence of contact among all pig operation types The proposed strategy limited the transmission the total number of secondarily infected farms to 29, over two simulated years. The identified 1,000 farms would benefit from enhanced biosecurity plans and improved targeted surveillance. Overall, the modelling framework provides a parsimonious solution for targeted disease surveillance when temporal movement data are available. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

TI  - Sensitivity Of Vegetation To Climate Variability And Its Implications For Malaria Risk In Baringo, Kenya
AB  - The global increase in vector borne diseases has been linked to climate change. Seasonal vegetation changes are known to influence disease vector population. However, the relationship is more theoretical than quantitatively defined. There is a growing demand for understanding and prediction of climate sensitive vector borne disease risks especially in regions where meteorological data are lacking. This study aimed at analyzing and quantitatively assessing the seasonal and year-to-year association between climatic factors (rainfall and temperature) and vegetation cover, and its implications for malaria risks in Baringo County, Kenya. Remotely sensed temperature, rainfall, and vegetation data for the period 2004-2015 were used. Poisson regression was used to model the association between malaria cases and climatic and environmental factors for the period 2009-2012, this being the period for which all datasets overlapped. A strong positive relationship was observed between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and monthly total precipitation. There was a strong negative relationship between NDVI and minimum temperature. The total monthly rainfall (between 94 -181mm), average monthly minimum temperatures (between 16-21 degrees C) and mean monthly NDVI values lower than 0.35 were significantly associated with malaria incidence rates. Results suggests that a combination of climatic and vegetation greenness thresholds need to be met for malaria incidence to be significantly increased in the county. Planning for malaria control can therefore be enhanced by incorporating these factors in malaria risk mapping.

TI  - Feeding Cities: Singapore's Approach To Land Use Planning For Urban Agriculture
AB  - Commercial urban agriculture is typically restricted to agriculture land use, green or open spaces, or underutilised or undeveloped land. As urbanising cities face the double threats of urban food insecurity and land scarcity, multi-functional urban land uses that integrate rather than separate agriculture from other land uses could be a critical adaptation for the sustainability of future cities. With less than 1\% of land in agricultural use, the high-density, city-state of Singapore is testing integrative approaches to where and how food can be grown in the city. The shift toward land use multiplicity is prompting cross-agency collaboration in policy development. The aims of this paper were to map changes in agricultural use of land and describe emerging policy trends in Singapore related to cross-agency collaboration and land use multiplicity. Given growing global attention to urban food policy, Singapore is a timely example where policies support integrated urban food production through high-tech intensification, a model AgriFood Innovation Park, and promotion of industrial and commercial land uses toward efficient and value-added activities that include urban farms. More examples of agriculture co-located with other land uses are needed to understand opportunities and challenges related to multior shared-use spaces particularly for tenure rights. Resolving regulatory and legal constraints will enable high and low tech farms to produce substantially more food in the city.

TI  - Estimating In-Season Actual Evapotranspiration Over A Large-Scale Irrigation Scheme In Resource-Limited Conditions
AB  - Reliable and readily available data on actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over large-scale areas throughout the crop growing season are critical for improved agricultural irrigation and water resource management. On-site data collection is costly, labour-intensive, and very challenging in resource-limited conditions. Thus, open-source satellite-based approaches might be adopted as cost-effective alternatives. In this study, the performance of a cost-effective and open source satellite-based approach for estimating ETa over a large-scale (1200 ha) irrigation system, the Kou Valley Irrigation Scheme (KVIS), in Burkina Faso was assessed. ETa values over the critical irrigation period during the 2014 dry season (January-April) were estimated using the Python module for Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model (PySEBAL). Then, they were compared against the Water Productivity Open-access (FAO-WaPOR), and United States Geological Survey-Famine Early Warning Systems Network Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (USGS-FEWS NET's SSEBop) ETa over the same period at different temporal scales. Overall, ETa values were satisfactorily estimated throughout the crop growth season across the Kou Valley irrigation scheme using PySEBAL. They spatially varied depending on the soil type and crop, with daily values ranging from 4.09 mm day(-1) to 7.7 mm day(-1), for a seasonal average of 619 mm. The finer spatial resolution (30 m) of PySEBAL outputs allowed better estimations compared to the FAO-WaPOR and SSEBop-based approaches. Our findings help ascertain the use of the PySEBAL model in semi-arid environment in Burkina Faso, and could serve as a basis for developing strategies for improved irrigation water management in countries experiencing similar conditions such as Burkina Faso.

TI  - Comparison Of Mangrove Index (Mi) And Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi) For The Detection Of Degraded Mangroves In Alas Purwo Banyuwangi And Segara Anakan Cilacap, Indonesia
AB  - Deterioration of the environmental quality of mangrove ecosystem must be identified as early as possible for management and threat mitigation. Degraded mangrove areas have to be distinguished from healthy ones. Low value of Mangrove Index (MI) corresponded to the degraded mangrove area where dominated by two species (Derris trifoliata and Acanthus ilicifolius), which are indicators of mangrove degradation at Segara Anakan mangrove area. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) failed to detect the degaradation due to existing of these species by detecting as high index value. The study was designed to (1) test the performance of MI at Alas Purwo mangrove area which categorized as a non-degraded mangrove forest, (2) compare the spatial pattern of MI images with that of NDVI images, and (3) further investigate the ability of MI to detect areas of degraded mangrove when it occurs in only small areas. We used Landsat-8 OLI imagery because it includes the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands required to generate MI. Both direct visual comparison and correlation analysis of the resulting maps were conducted to evaluate the ability of these indices to detect degraded and non-degraded areas of mangroves. In general, both indices detected a similar pattern, which is contrary to the results from Segara Anakan images. However, a difference value between MI and NDVI of >0.2 indicated the presence of small areas of vegetation with a spectral reflectance similar to that of species indicating degradation at Segara Anakan. This finding was confirmed by field observation of mangrove species. A difference of >0.2 between MI and NDVI indicates mangrove degradation for small areas. This study provides a new tool to determine the condition of mangrove forest remotely, allowing for rapid and targeted management action to tackle degradation.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Retrieval Of Soil Moisture Content Using Stacking Ensemble Learning Models
AB  - Machine learning combined with multisource remote sensing data to assess soil moisture content (SMC) has attracted considerable attention in SMC studies, but the retrieval results still remain uncertain. The purpose of this study is to combine multiple single machine learning models with integrated learning algorithms and propose an SMC retrieval method based on multiple differentiated models under a stacking integrated learning architecture. First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning methods-classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient, temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy, with root mean square error values of 1.87\% and 1.64\%, respectively. The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for land desertification studies and ecological environment management in the study region.

TI  - Outer Frontiers Of Banking: Financing Space Explorers And Safeguarding Terrestrial Finance
AB  - For decades, governments alone financed launching, operating, and returning space objects and humans. Scientific exploration of space propulsion, navigation, communication, and life safety advances resulted in commercially viable technologies and business methods. Scientific research and mission goals depended on government space mission priorities and budget appropriation processes. Government funding of exploration still predominates, outspending private sector investments. Commercial satellites are financed based on their terrestrial revenues and the risks of launch and in-service life. Space entrepreneurs are emerging with the wealth and explorer spirit to attract teams to do what governments and space industry contractors have not prioritized or funded: asteroid-hunting satellites, space tourism, space freight, lunar and asteroid mining, and habitats on the Moon and Mars. Concurrently, developing countries are launching satellites and missions, diversifying space entrepreneurship. Space finance is an inherent barrier or right. Space finance is a silent technology enabler or mission continuity risk. Space exploration is a unique setting to reimagine better space and terrestrial finance options and principles based on functional valuation models. Space law was written in the language of foreign policy and security concerns rooted in the Cold War Era. For more private sector financing to explore space, space law and transaction frameworks will need exploration and updating. Finance is essential to advance peaceful discoveries and uses of space assets. If exploring space is to be truly open to all humankind, then options for financing and insuring space explorers and missions must expand accordingly and inclusively, beyond governments and high net worth entrepreneurs. This article reviews relevant treaties and transactional frameworks for financing space operations. Historical context, principles, and inspirations are gathered from bank, finance, and market precedents of funding terrestrial exploration and development. The article summarizes transferable principles and practices of modern asset valuation models, transactional frameworks, and strategies for allocating project benefits and mitigating project risk. Based on such principles and precedents, the article identifies the challenges of, and suggests arrangements for, banking and finance of space-borne assets and activities. A space bank is described to prove that banking in space is viable and improves on terrestrial money flows for fragile regions affected by war, corruption, disaster, or breakdown of basic human rights. Weighing historical and modern context and space-based humanitarian and business continuity advantages, the article concludes by recommending that policymakers elevate space banking, finance, and insurance as topics of scientific inquiry, on par with other scientific explorations and technologies, to unleash a reliable future of human exploration of space.

TI  - Precipitation Dynamics And Chemical Properties In Tropical Mountain Forests Of Ecuador
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems in southern Ecuador are strongly affected by interannual climate variations. This holds especially true for the episodic El Niño events, which cause above-normal precipitation in the coastal region of Ecuador and below normal values in the eastern provinces of the Amazon basin (Bendix, 1999). For the transitional zone between these two extremes, which consists mainly of the andean slopes and larger interandean basins the effect on interannual climate variability is not well known. The PREDICT project monitors regional climate in the provinces of Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe (4°S/79°W), where a strong gradients of precipitation are observed. Between the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Real and the dry valley of Catamayo, which are only 70 km apart, rain totals drop from over 4000 mm to only 300 mm per year. These two extremes represent the both sides of the Andean mountain chain and are completely covered by the study area, which is 120km in diameter. Methods used are a combination of point measurements (climate stations) and remote sensing devices (weather radar, satellite imagery), which enable a high-resolution real-time observation of rain distribution and underlying processes. By this, ideal conditions are given to monitor a potential shift of the transition zone between below-average and above-average rainfall situated in this region, if another ENSO-anomaly occurs. Furthermore variability of atmospheric nutrient inputs is analysed within the scope of the project, to assess further impacts on this ecosystem.

TI  - Detecting Overmature Forests With Airborne Laser Scanning (Als)
AB  - Building a network of interconnected overmature forests is crucial for the conservation of biodiversity. Indeed, a multitude of plant and animal species depend on forest structural maturity attributes such as very large living trees and deadwood. LiDAR technology has proved to be powerful when assessing forest structural parameters, and it may be a promising way to identify existing overmature forest patches over large areas. We first built an index (IMAT) combining several forest structural maturity attributes in order to characterize the structural maturity of 660 field plots in the French northern Pre-Alps. We then selected or developed LiDAR metrics and applied them in a random forest model designed to predict the IMAT. Model performance was evaluated with the root mean square error of prediction obtained from a bootstrap cross-validation and a Spearman correlation coefficient calculated between observed and predicted IMAT. Predictors were ranked by importance based on the average increase in the squared out-of-bag error when the variable was randomly permuted. Despite a non-negligible RMSEP (0.85 for calibration and validation data combined and 1.26 for validation data alone), we obtained a high correlation (0.89) between the observed and predicted IMAT values, indicating an accurate ranking of the field plots. LiDAR metrics for height (maximum height and height heterogeneity) were among the most important metrics for predicting forest maturity, together with elevation, slope and, to a lesser extent, with metrics describing the distribution of echoes' intensities. Our framework makes it possible to reconstruct a forest maturity gradient and isolate maturity hot spots. Nevertheless, our approach could be considerably strengthened by taking into consideration site fertility, collecting other maturity attributes in the field or developing adapted LiDAR metrics. Including additional spectral or textural metrics from optical imagery might also improve the predictive capacity of the model.

TI  - Multi-Scenario Simulation Of Land Use Structure Based On Dual Combined Models
AB  - Land is not only a fundamental requirement for people's life, but also an indispensable factor in economic development. However, utilizing land usually results in changes to the structure and function of ecological systems, which may have a notable impact on the environment and natural resources. Since the industrial revolution, the overuse and damage of land has become the main cause of a decline in ecological function and the deterioration of the environment, and has led to the loss of sustainability for the entire biosphere. Recently, the essential roles of ecological services have been recognized, and attention has been called to the ecological and economic benefits of related projects. Allocation of land use in order to optimize its spatial structure of is a prerequisite for enhancing its economic and ecological benefits. In this study, we analyzed the changes in both the structure of land use and the rules used to determine its functions from 2006 to 2013 in Lulong County, based on remote sensing data from this period. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the most influential factors and to characterize their inter-relationships and relative functions. The factors identified were examined by successfully simulating the spatial distribution of 6 land use types in Lulong. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) values greater than 0.80 for the land use types categorized as: “cultivated land,” “garden plot,” “forest,” “construction land,” “water,” and “other land” were observed. Following this, the land use types for Lulong County in 2020 were predicted using the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small region extent (CLUE-S) model. To improve both the economic functioning and the ecological services provided by land in Lulong, Multi-objective Programming (MOP) and CLUE-S models were integrated. This integration enabled the optimization of the quantity and spatial structure of land used, through building constraint functions and conversion rules developed using remote sensing images on a 100 m X 100m grid scale. Comparison of the results obtained with the traditional land use simulation method between the multi-model and CLUE-S showed that the economic functions of Lulong County could be increased by 12.95% from 2013 to 2020, while ecological services are likely to be reduced. Because of the increase in areas of cultivated land, garden plots, and construction sites predicted by 2020, the economic function of land in Lulong will increase, while there will be associated losses in ecological services (due primarily to sharp decreases in the water and forest areas). Optimizing the land use structure of Lulong County using the integrated model created with MOP and CLUE-S may facilitate increases in both economic and ecological functions by 8.20% and 8.40%, respectively. This predicts greater increases in ecological services and total functional value than the simulation results obtained with the CLUE-S model alone. Simulated results that showed a decrease in the “unused land” areas, coupled with an increase in areas of cultivated land, garden plot, forest, and construction sites confirmed that combing the CLUE-S and MOP models provided improved results than with the CLUE-S model alone. This indicates that our method has potential to be an effective tool for managing and planning economic services and leading to the stabilization of the soil ecosystem balance, as well as achieving sustainable use of zone-limited land resources. This data could facilitate sustainable development of Lulong County's economy and ecology. Additionally, Lulong is located within the economic sphere of influence of Jing-Jin-Ji and Bohai Rim. Thus, it is readily influenced by several regional policies. Increased simulation accuracy would be expected if more detailed and accurate zonal policy data are acquired. © 2016, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - Movements Of Olive Ridley Sea Turtles Lepidochelys Olivacea And Associated Oceanographic Features As Determined By Improved Light-Based Geolocation
AB  - We demonstrate the use of pop-off satellite archival tags (PSAT)-derived geolocations to determine the most probable tracks (MPTs) of olive ridley sea turtles Lepidochelys olivacea off Costa Rica. We use a Kalman filter state-space model (KFSST) that uses light-based longitude and latitude and sea surface temperatures (SST). PSATs placed on 14 turtles remained fixed for an average 53 d (range: 29 to 111 d). The average reduction in longitude and latitude standard deviations was φlon = 0.62 and φlat = 0.28 between the raw and KFSST-derived MPTs, respectively. Geolocations were linked in time to oceanographic features such as SST and chlorophyll a, as reported by satellite-based sensors. Turtles went in all directions from their respective release points, independent of year and capture type (longline-caught vs. hand-caught). Turtles remained within a SST range between 23.3 and 30.5deg;C (mean = 27.1deg;C), with over 75% of all recorded temperatures between 25.0 and 28.0°C. Turtle locations were associated with mean chlorophyll a = 0.37 mg m-3. MPT data suggest that turtles spent a disproportionate amount of time in the general region of the Costa Rica Dome, a nutrientrich quasi-permanent cyclonic eddy. Taken together, these findings support the increased utility of filtered light-based geolocation data in identifying environmental features characteristic of sea turtles' preferred habitat, information which can be useful in managing regional fisheries. © Inter-Research 2009.

TI  - Analysis Of The Evolution Of Mangrove Landscape Patterns And Their Drivers In Hainan Island From 2000 To 2020
AB  - The ecological services provided by mangroves are of great value and significance in regard of the achievement of the major strategic goals of carbon neutrality and the carbon peak. Here, we first evaluated the uses of five machine learning methods combined with Sentinal-2A data band features to identify and extract mangrove forests in Dongzhai Harbor, northeast Hainan Province, China. Then, the XGBoost algorithm with the highest accuracy was selected to identify and extract information on mangrove forests on Hainan Island, focusing on five periods from 2000 to 2020. The landscape pattern index, dynamic attitude model, and mathematical statistics were integrated to analyze trends over this 20-year period. The results revealed the following: (1) The total mangrove landscape area of Hainan Island between 2000 and 2020 showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing. In the past 20 years, the mangrove area has increased by 1315.75 ha, with an annual change rate of 65.79 ha/a. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the mangroves in Hainan Island were characterized by increased fragmentation, increased heterogeneity, decreased connectivity, and increased richness, while proportion of each landscape type tends to be equilibrated. (3) Natural factors such as the annual average temperature in the study area were the main factors driving the large-scale reduction in mangroves and the deepening of landscape fragmentation, followed by human factors, and the impact of macro-policies cannot be ignored. The results of this study can provide a significant reference for future remote sensing data extraction from mangrove forests and their ecological protection and restoration on Hainan Island. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Environmental Heterogeneity Patterns And Assessment Of Trophic Levels In Two Mediterranean Lagoons: Orbetello And Varano, Italy
AB  - The management of coastal lagoons is of particular interest due to their high economical importance. In spite of their great productivity, coastal lagoons are often impacted by human pressure which produces water eutrophication. The aim of this paper is to assess the trophic state of the two Mediterranean lagoons taking into account chemical-physical parameters, nutrient concentrations and biological parameters. Two Italian lagoons, Orbetello and Varano (respectively located in Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coast, Italy) were studied between May 2003 and April 2005. Both these systems receive treated urban outflows, agricultural effluents and rivers freshwater inputs. Field collected data showed that studied lagoons were characterized by different human and natural pressures. Orbetello showed the highest water eutrophication, highlighted by the trophic index values, while Varano showed lower eutrophication levels except for the summertime. The values of physical, chemical and biological parameters measured in Orbetello and Varano lagoons indicate that a wide spatial and seasonal gradient of the water characteristics was established during the study period, but in particular in winter. This gradient, typical of estuarine systems, was essentially due to the mixing of freshwater, seawater and anthropogenic inputs. Orbetello lagoon seemed much more affected by the urban impact and the fish-farming activities than Varano lagoon, but the latter showed a greater agriculture activities impact as showed by the remote sensing images.

TI  - Factors Influencing Variation Of Bulk Milk Antibiotic Residue Occurrence, Somatic Cell Count, And Total Bacterial Count In Dairy Sheep Flocks
AB  - To study the variations of bulk tank milk variables in dairy ewe flocks and to identify the main target practices and flock groups to improve milk quality and safety, a total of 71,228 records of antibiotic residue (AR) and milk yield and 68,781 records of somatic cell count (SCC) and total bacterial count (TBC) were obtained over 5 yr from the same 209 dairy ewe flocks of the Assaf breed belonging to the Consortium for Ovine Promotion of Castilla-León (Spain). Based on a logistic regression model, year, month, semester, SCC, TBC, dry therapy, and milk yield significantly contributed to AR variation. High SCC was associated with increased AR violations. When antibiotic dry therapy was implemented, AR occurrence was higher than when this practice was not used. A polynomial monthly distribution throughout the year was observed for AR occurrence; the highest values were in autumn, coinciding with low milk yields per flock. Yearly occurrences drastically diminished from 2004 (1.36%) to 2008 (0.30%), probably as a result of effective educational programs. The mixed-model ANOVA of factors influencing variation in SCC and TBC indicated that year, month, AR, dry therapy group, milking type, and year interactions were significant variation factors for SCC and TBC; mathematical model accounted for 74.1 and 35.4% of total variance for each variable, respectively. Differences in management and hygiene practice caused significant SCC and TBC variations among flocks and within flocks throughout the 5-yr study. Over time, continuously dry treated flocks showed lower logSCC (5.80) and logTBC (4.92) than untreated (6.10 and 5.18, respectively) or discontinuously dry treated (6.01 and 5.05, respectively) flocks. Continuously dry treated flocks had lower AR occurrences than did discontinuously dry treated flocks. As a whole, AR occurrence and SCC and TBC bulk tank milk variables can be used for monitoring mammary health and milk hygiene and safety in dairy sheep throughout time. © 2010 American Dairy Science Association.

TI  - Designing The Climate Observing System Of The Future
AB  - Climate observations are needed to address a large range of important societal issues including sea level rise, droughts, floods, extreme heat events, food security, and freshwater availability in the coming decades. Past, targeted investments in specific climate questions have resulted in tremendous improvements in issues important to human health, security, and infrastructure. However, the current climate observing system was not planned in a comprehensive, focused manner required to adequately address the full range of climate needs. A potential approach to planning the observing system of the future is presented in this article. First, this article proposes that priority be given to the most critical needs as identified within the World Climate Research Program as Grand Challenges. These currently include seven important topics: melting ice and global consequences; clouds, circulation and climate sensitivity; carbon feedbacks in the climate system; understanding and predicting weather and climate extremes; water for the food baskets of the world; regional sea-level change and coastal impacts; and near-term climate prediction. For each Grand Challenge, observations are needed for long-term monitoring, process studies and forecasting capabilities. Second, objective evaluations of proposed observing systems, including satellites, ground-based and in situ observations as well as potentially new, unidentified observational approaches, can quantify the ability to address these climate priorities. And third, investments in effective climate observations will be economically important as they will offer a magnified return on investment that justifies a far greater development of observations to serve society's needs. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - A Polsar Change Detection Index Based On Neighborhood Information For Flood Mapping
AB  - Change detection using Remote Sensing (RS) techniques is valuable in numerous applications, including environmental management and hazard monitoring. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have proven to be even more effective in this regard because of their all-weather, day and night acquisition capabilities. In this study, a polarimetric index based on the ratio of span (total power) values was introduced, in which neighbourhood information was considered. The role of the central pixel and its neighbourhood was adjusted using a weight parameter. The proposed index was applied to detect flooded areas in Dongting Lake, Hunan, China, and was then compared with the Wishart Maximum Likelihood Ratio (MLR) test. Results demonstrated that although the proposed index and the Wishart MLR test yielded similar accuracies (accuracy of 94\% and 93\%, and Kappa Coefficients of 0.82 and 0.86, respectively), inclusion of neighbourhood information in the proposed index not only increased the connectedness and decreased the noise associated with the objects within the produced map, but also increased the consistency and confidence of the results.

TI  - A Remote Sensing-Based Method For High-Resolution Crop Water Footprint Quantification In An Irrigation District With Complex Planting Structure
AB  - The crop water footprint (WF) refers to the water consumption per unit grain production, which can reflect the quantity and types of water consumption over the entire growth period, providing a comprehensive view that is useful for agricultural water resources management. Generally, crop water consumption and crop yield are the main component of WF, but there are inconsistencies in their spatial resolution, thus it is difficult to effectively evaluate agricultural water usage under complex and variable planting structures. This study quantified crop yield and crop water consumption at fine resolution (250 m) using remote sensing methods and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability of the green water footprint (WFg) and blue water footprint (WFb) of Chinese Baojixia Irrigation District (BID). Specifically, we firstly mapped the spatial distribution of the wheat and maize field using a remote sensing-based support vector machine (SVM) method, then the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was used to construct the yield estimation model based on multi-temporal remote sensing data, and a remote-sensing-based water balance assessment tool (RWBAT) model were constructed to quantify water consumption. Finally, the spatiotemporal variability of WFg and WFb at 250 m resolution was analyzed. The results show that the average annual WFg of wheat and maize in BID is 0.525 and 0.469 m3/kg, accounting for 81 \% and 93 \% of the total WF, respectively. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the low values of the total WF are concentrated in the central BID, while the high values are distributed in northwest part. The remote sensing-based method can effectively reflect the WF at high spatial and temporal resolution under complex planting structures, which can provide a basis for guaranteeing the efficient use and regulation of agricultural water resources.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Using A Novel Hybrid Model Of Statistical Bivariate Methods (Fr And Woe) And Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (Anfis) At Southern Zagros Mountains In Iran
AB  - The aim of landslide susceptibility mapping ( LSM) is to produce the most important and basic information required for overall landslide disaster planning and mitigation. Different statistical bivariate methods such as frequency ratio ( FR) and weights-of-evidence ( WOE) have been widely used for LSM. Although results of these aforementioned statistical methods are generally acceptable, however, they can be improved further by fine tuning the conditioning factor's classes. The purpose of this paper is to overcome some drawbacks of the bivariate models by developing a novel hybrid method using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system ( ANFIS) and statistical bivariate methods ( FR and WOE) in geographical information system. The provinces of southern Zagros Mountains ( Iran) are chosen as a case study to implement the proposed method. First, landslide inventory map was produced using various data source such as historical landslides locations, remote sensing images and land surveying techniques. Second, the inventory data were divided into a ratio 70: 30 for training and testing the models. Third, twelve landslide conditioning and triggering factors ( such as altitude, slope, aspect, plan and profile curvatures, distance to roads, distance to streams, distance to faults, rainfall, seismicity, land use and lithology) were selected and categorized in two groups consisting of numerical and nominal values. Then, each conditioning factor was classified and the weight of each class was determined by using FR and WOE models. The outputs of individual statistical and hybrid methods were applied to determine nominal and continuous numerical data, respectively. In the hybrid approach, the calculated weights of each class were allocated to the center of each class, and the rest of the weights were determined by ANFIS. Landslide locations which were not used in training the models were used for validation. The produced susceptibility maps were validated and compared using area under the curve ( AUC). Results indicated that predictive performances of hybrid models ( FR-ANFIS and WOE-ANFIS) have better performance than the statistical models ( FR and WOE). The AUCs of success rates are 85, 86, 87 and 87\% and the AUCs of predicted rates are 82, 82, 85 and 84\% for FR, WOE, FR-ANFIS, and WOE-ANFIS, respectively. Additionally, frequency ratio plots ( FRP) and seed cells area index SCAI methods were also employed for a second round of validation. The FRP and SCAI graphs illustrated higher performance for the hybrid LSM models. The proposed approach can be applied in other types of natural hazard modeling such as flood, land subsidence, and gully erosion.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment In Mountainous Area: A Case Study Of Sichuan-Tibet Railway, China
AB  - In the southeastern Tibetan Plateau with complex geological conditions, the frequent and disastrous geological hazards have posed a severe challenge to the construction and operation safety of the planning Sichuan-Tibet railway. Based on the remote sensing and field investigation, the detailed landslide inventory of Jiacha-Langxian segment of Sichuan-Tibet railway was established. After analyzing the general development characteristics of landslides, a total of seven causative variables were selected as input parameters to evaluate landslide susceptibility using the weight of the evidence model. Combined with the probability prediction map and field validation, the landslide susceptibility was classified into four categories: very high, high, moderate and low susceptibility. Based on the landslide susceptibility assessment map, the very high and high susceptibility zones are mainly distributed on the both sides of the Yarlung Zangbo river and its tributaries, and the moderate and low susceptibility zones are located 5 km north to the river. Considering the terrain and landslide disaster prone situation in this region, the planning railway line in tunnel on the north bank of the Yarlung Zangbo river is considered to be reasonable. As for the subgrade and bridge section of the railway, especially for tunnel entrance, necessary slope reinforcement should be carried out. Considering the objective safety threat from landslides to the railway, we hold the opinion that it is necessary to compare the scheme of changing route and taking engineering protection measures in the Langzhen-Langxian segment.

TI  - Robust Geographical Detector
AB  - Geographical detector (GD) is a method to measure spatial associations using a power of determinant (PD) value that compares the variance of data within spatial zones and in the whole study area. Recent studies have implemented GD in diverse fields, such as environmental and socio-economic issues. Spatial data discretization is an essential stage for determining zones using explanatory variables. However, the spatial data discretization process has been sensitive to the GD results. To address this issue, this article proposes a Robust Geographical Detector (RGD) to overcome the limitations of the sensitivity in spatial data discretization and estimate robust PD values of explanatory variables using a B-value. The RGD determines spatial zones with numerical interval breaks using an optimization algorithm of variance-based change point detection. In this study, RGD is implemented in a nationwide case study exploring potential factors of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) density in industrial regions across Australia, where data on both NO2 and potential factors are sourced from satellite images and remote sensing products using Google Earth Engine. Results show that RGD can effectively explore the maximum PD values of spatial associations between response and explanatory variables due to the optimization algorithm-based spatial zones. In addition, RGD-based PD values are generally higher, more robust, and more stable than GD-based PD values since RGD can guarantee the increment of PD values with the increase of interval numbers, which is a challenge in previous GD models. Finally, RGD could provide a more reliable interpretation of PD as RGD finds optimal intervals-based spatial zones determined by potential factors. This study demonstrates that the developed RGD model can provide robust and reliable solutions to explore spatial associations and identify geographical factors.

TI  - Physical Dynamics Of Lake Victoria Over The Past 34 years (1984–2018): Is The Lake Dying?
AB  - Understanding changes in the physical dynamics of lakes (e.g., areas and shorelines) is important to inform policies, planning and management during climate extremes (e.g., floods and droughts). For Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake, its physical dynamics and associated changes are not well understood as evidenced, e.g., from the citations of its area 66,400 – 69,485 km2, length 300 – 412 km, width 240 – 355 km, and shorelines 3300 – 4828 km. Its sheer size and lack of research resources commitment by regional governments hamper observations. This contribution employs a suite of remotely sensed products for the past 34 years (1984–2018); Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS, Google Earth Pro, CHIRPS, Multivariate El’ Niño-Southern Oscillation Index and altimetry data together with the physical parameters from 37 publications (1969–2018) to (i) study the lake's dynamics and establish its current (2018) state, (ii) identify and analyse hotspots where significantly dynamic changes occur, and (iii), study the contributions of climate change and anthropogenic activities on these dynamics. Utilizing manual digitisation, MNDWI, NDVI and PCA methods, the study shows the lake's mean surface area to be 69,295 km2 (i.e., 812 km2 or 1.2% more than that of the 37 publications) and its 2018 value to be 69,216 km2 (i.e., ∼733 km2 (1.1%) more than that of the 37 publications). As to whether the lake is dying, it shrunk by 203 km2 (0.3%) compared to its 1984 value, a decrease noted mainly in four hotspot Gulfs (Birinzi 40%, Winam 20%, Emin Pasha 38% and Mwanza 55%). Correspondingly, the expansion of Nalubaale Dam (2002–2006) decreased the areas by 31%, 10%, 21% and 44%, respectively. Seasonal analysis shows an increase of 9 km2 in the lake's area during the heavy rainy season (March–May) while the ENSO enlarged the area by 0.23% (2007) and 0.45% (2010). It is evident, therefore, that both climate variability/change and anthropogenic activities are exerting a toll on the tropical's largest freshwater body thereby necessitating careful exploitation and management plans. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Effect Of Port Development On Coastal Water Quality: Evidence Of Eutrophication States In Indonesia
AB  - Developing transport infrastructure must involve a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, and accounting for environmental quality changes associated with such an infrastructure is one important aspect that can help complete this problem. In this study, we used difference-in-difference to estimate coastal water quality changes, measured by the Chlorophyll-a concentration, related to port development in Indonesia over the last decade. Using unique MODIS-derived monthly water quality data, we found that the presence of a local small port causes a 1.7\% increase in Chlorophyll-a in coastal areas within 6 km of the port. The effects are concentrated in the first two months of operation, and there is also evidence for anticipation effects associated with the construction period. We found a greater effect in Indonesia's eastern regions, which rely on small ports for their local ac-tivities. Furthermore, we argue that the effect can be substantial in a larger port, despite posing a limited risk on marine pollution.

TI  - Spatialising Health Work In Schools–Exploring The Complex Interconnection Of Space, Health, Physical Education And Masculinity
AB  - The spaces of schooling are not mere settings or backdrops where students’ learning take place, but are implicated in the production of knowledge and identities/subjectivities–spaces embody specific values, beliefs and traditions. In this paper, we draw on visual ethnographic data from an all-boys school in New Zealand to examine how the spaces of schooling and physical education (PE) perform health work in relation to the all-round development of healthy young masculinities. By drawing on a complexivist philosophy, we draw attention to how school policies, spaces, bodies, students, teachers all intersect to provide the boys with a socio-spatial context in which knowledge and learning about healthy young masculinities is constructed. We demonstrate how stereotypical notions of what boys should be doing and what they like doing is, for instance, materialised by the design and provision of schooling and PE as sporting spaces, based on a form of ‘healthism’, which privileges individualistic notions of health and the assumption that sport=fitness=health. We conclude that although the design and provision of schooling and PE spaces based on healthism is an important source of pleasures for young men, it also reinforces narrowly defined and even problematic forms of healthy young masculinities. © 2016 Göran Gerdin and Alan Ovens.

TI  - Groundwater Prospecting And Management In An Agro-Based Rural Environment Of Crystalline Terrain Of India
AB  - An integrated hydrogeological investigation was made to delineate the socioeconomic problems in the agro-based rural environment of the crystalline terrain of Guntur district; Andhra Pradesh, India. The integrated investigation comprised geoelectrical (GE) surveys, remotely recorded data and pumping tests. The subsurface layer parameters obtained from the sounding interpretation are presented in the form of GE sections and a fence diagram. Characteristic resistivities of various layers were obtained by correlating the known lithology with the GE sounding data. Total transverse resistance (TTR) and total longitudinal conductance (TLC) were computed from the interpretation of the sounding data. The TTR map was compared with the depth of bedrock map and the values of TLC were correlated with the thickness of geoelectrical layers and water quality. Lineaments were mapped from the satellite imageries: Hydraulic properties were determined; using the standard pumping test analysis. Potentiality of aquifer zones was assessed, after comparing the known thickness of aquifer formations with the corresponding discharge (Q) values. The integrated study helps to evolve a criterion to classify the groundwater potential zones (GPZ) into medium and high; based on the thickness of the aquifer. zone and its corresponding resistivity, TTR, TLC and Q. A management plan has been proposed TLC,and Q. A management plan has been for sustainable development of groundwater in the region on to eliminate water scarcity and its related problems.

TI  - The Impact Of National Space Legislation On Space Industry Contracts
AB  - The Isle of Man space strategy is highlighted to show how space initiatives in small jurisdictions can benefit the local environment, whilst addressing international markets and abiding by international conventions. The initiative to create a space industry on the Isle of Man came in 1998 by a private company called ManSat Ltd. The public private group is comprised of the Isle's leading insurance firms, tax and accounting firms, legal offices, corporate service providers, banks, satellite companies and space-related businesses, as well as relevant government departments. Economic development is the primary objective of the Manx government's strategy with limited focus on engaging directly in space science or exploration. The Isle of Man has appointed a commercial due diligence and risk management service provider experienced in space insurance to further examine the risk element as it may apply to the Isle of Man Government in regards to the licensing process and third party liability. © 2011 Lesley Jane Smith and ingo Baumann.

TI  - Assessment Of Sentinel-2 To Monitor Highly Dynamic Small Water Bodies: The Case Of Louro Lagoon (Galicia, Nw Spain)
AB  - Coastal lagoons have been providing ecological, economic and cultural benefits for many centuries. Despite their importance, the monitoring of coastal lagoons poses numerous challenges related to their complex environmental processes, their large variability in size and their remote location, inhibiting effective management programmes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 satellites to map highly dynamic morphological and hydrological changes in the Louro lagoon, a small choked lagoon located on the Galician coast (NW Spain). For this purpose, a simple methodology using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) has been evaluated, which allows to monitor the sand barrier changes and the inlet formation. The results show that the sand barrier's opening and closing might take only a very short period, and the recovery of the lagoon to its full water level can happen in less than a month. Sentinel-2 images also reveal drastic changes in the water level once the sand barrier is broken. A water surface area of 0.24 km(2) was estimated on 04/11/2019, while this surface was reduced to 0.10 km(2) on 04/12/2019. Monitoring these changes is critical to understand the different processes ongoing in these valuable environments and making informed decisions for their management and protection.

TI  - Detection Of Irrigated Crops From Sentinel-1 And Sentinel-2 Data To Estimate Seasonal Groundwater Use In South India
AB  - Indian agriculture relies on monsoon rainfall and irrigation from surface and groundwater. The interannual variability of monsoon rainfalls is high, which forces South Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated areas to local water availability. In this study, we have developed and tested a methodology for monitoring these spatiotemporal variations using Sentinel-1 and -2 observations over the Kudaliar catchment, Telangana State (~1000 km2). These free radar and optical data have been acquired since 2015 on a weekly basis over continental areas, at a high spatial resolution (10-20 m) that is well adapted to the small areas of South Indian field crops. A machine learning algorithm, the Random Forest method, was used over three growing seasons (January to March and July to November 2016 and January to March 2017) to classify small patches of inundated rice paddy, maize, and other irrigated crops, as well as surface water stored in the small reservoirs scattered across the landscape. The crop production comprises only irrigated crops (less than 20% of the areas) during the dry season (Rabi, December to March), to which rain-fed cotton is added to reach 60% of the areas during the monsoon season (Kharif, June to November). Sentinel-1 radar backscatter provides useful observations during the cloudy monsoon season. The lowest irrigated area totals were found during Rabi 2016 and Kharif 2016, accounting for 3.5 and 5% with moderate classification confusion. This confusion decreases with increasing areas of irrigated crops during Rabi 2017. During this season, 16% of rice and 6% of irrigated crops were detected after the exceptional rainfalls observed in September. Surface water in small surface reservoirs reached 3% of the total area, which corresponds to a high value. The use of both Sentinel datasets improves the method accuracy and strengthens our confidence in the resulting maps. This methodology shows the potential of automatically monitoring, in near real time, the high short term variability of irrigated area totals in South India, as a proxy for estimating irrigated water and groundwater needs. These are estimated over the study period to range from 49.5 ± 0.78 mm (1.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2016, and 44.9 ± 2.9 mm (6.5% uncertainty) in the Kharif season, to 226.2 ± 5.8 mm (2.5% uncertainty) in Rabi 2017. This variation must be related to groundwater recharge estimates that range from 10 mm to 160 mm·yr-1 in the Hyderabad region. These dynamic agro-hydrological variables estimated from Sentinel remote sensing data are crucial in calibrating runoff, aquifer recharge, water use and evapotranspiration for the spatially distributed agro-hydrological models employed to quantify the impacts of agriculture on water resources. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Water Allocation And Water Consumption Of Irrigation Agriculture And Natural Vegetation In The Heihe River Watershed, Nw China
AB  - To implement effective water resource management strategies, a sufficient data basis about the hydrologic situation must be available. An important parameter is the water consumption by the natural environment, e.g., evapotranspiration (ET). This study delivers actual evapotranspiration rates (ETa) computed on the basis of Landsat TM/ETM+ and MODIS data. Vegetation mappings recorded during a field work campaign in 2012 allowed the correlation of ET rates to certain units of vegetation. The study site is located in the Heihe river basin, Northwest China, where the landscape is characterized by extending land under cultivation along the middle reaches and ecologically valuable Tugai vegetation further downwards. Due to the arid climate, all agriculture depends on irrigation with water taken from the Heihe River. As a result of a massive expansion of irrigated land in the last decades, an imbalance with regard to water allocation has developed. It is characterized by an overexploitation of the water resources in the middle reaches and a strong degeneration of the natural Tugai vegetation along the lower reaches due to water shortage. As a response, a water distribution plan has been adopted to define target amounts of water that shall reach the lower parts of the river. Total values of the ETa over the whole vegetation period for corn, dates, orchards and grapes amount to 667.7, 762.2, 703.5 and 483.9 mm, respectively. For forest vegetation (ground coverage 80 \%) and for shrub vegetation (80-100 \% ground coverage), values of 496-530 mm and 177-233 mm were calculated, respectively. Areas with lower ground coverage show significantly lower ETa values. Spatially, ETa values decrease from the center towards the border of the oasis and from the middle towards the lower reaches. Agricultural land presents the largest water consumer. The total ETa values over the vegetation period amount to 2.15 km(3) (middle reaches) and 0.28 km(3) (lower reaches), respectively. On this basis, a minimum discharge of 0.34 km(3) was calculated to maintain the natural vegetation downstream.

TI  - Marine Macroinvertebrate Ecosystem Services Under Changing Conditions Of Seagrasses And Mangroves
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of changing environmental conditions on MMI ES in seagrasses and mangroves. We used data from satellite and biodiversity platforms combined with field data to explore the links between ecosystem pressures (habitat conversion, overexploitation, climate change), conditions (environmental quality, ecosystem attributes), and MMI ES (provisioning, regulation, cultural). Both seagrass and mangrove extents increased significantly since 2016. While sea surface temperature showed no significant annual variation, sea surface partial pressure CO2, height above sea level and pH presented significant changes. Among the environmental quality variables only silicate, PO4 and phytoplankton showed significant annual varying trends. The MMI food provisioning increased significantly, indicating overexploitation that needs urgent attention. MMI regulation and cultural ES did not show significant trends overtime. Our results show that MMI ES are affected by multiple factors and their interactions can be complex and non-linear. We identified key research gaps and suggested future directions for research. We also provided relevant data that can support future ES assessments.

TI  - Application Of Handheld Laser Scanning Technology For Forest Inventory Purposes In The Ne Turkey
AB  - Forest inventory (FI) is the most challenging stage of forest management and planning process. Therefore, in situ surveys are often reinforced by modern remote sensing (RS) methods for collecting forestry-related data more efficiently. This study tests a state-of-the-art data collection method for practical use in the Turkish FI system for the first time. To this end, forest sampling plots were conventionally measured to collect dendrometric data from 437 trees in Artvin and Saçınka Forest Enterprises. Then, each plot was scanned using a handheld mobile laser scanning (HMLS) instrument. Finally, HMLS data were compared against ground measurements via basic FI measures. Based on statistical tests, no apparent differences were found between the two datasets at the plot level (P < 0.05). There were also robust correlations for diameter breast height at individual tree level (r > 0.97; P < 0.01). Residual analysis showed that both positive and negative errors had a homogeneous distribution, except for plot 8 where tree stems were in irregular shapes due to anthropogenic pressures. When all plots’ data were aggregated, average values for the number of trees, basal area, and timber volume were estimated as 535 trees/ha–1, 49.6 m2/ha–1, and 499.7 m3/ha–1, respectively. Furthermore, secondary measures such as the number of saplings and slope were successfully retrieved using HMLS method. The highest overestimation was in timber volume with less than 10% difference at the landscape level. The differences were attributed to poor data quality of conventional measurements, as well as marginal site conditions in some plots. We concluded that the HMLS method met the accuracy standards for most FI measures, except for stand height. Thus, the Turkish FI system could benefit from this novel technology, which in turn supports the implementation of sound forest management and planning. © TÜBİTAK.

TI  - Mapping And Characterization Of Intensity In Land Use By Pasture Using Remote Sensing
AB  - The current demand for food has been met through the exploitation of natural reserves. Brazil has 26\% of its extension occupied by agricultural uses, 62\% of which are pastures. Degraded pastures have greater land use intensity than well-managed pastures, leading to greater degradation of the environment. Land use classification systems consider that pastures are well managed, a misconception for the Brazilian reality. Based on this approach, it was aimed to develop a methodology for mapping the intensity of land use by pasture via remote sensing. The method of mapping was developed and validated in basins with different soil and climatic characteristics. Three calibrations were performed based on NDVI values to ascertain the influence on the results, being evaluated from the field campaigns and the kappa and weighted kappa indices. The kappa and weighted kappa indices presented reasonable and moderate agreement, respectively. The results were considered as satisfactory for the three calibrations, evidencing that the degree of degradation of the pastures can be estimated in a simple way by remote sensing. The Limoeiro River Basin has around 46.9\% of pastures, at least, heavily degraded and 96.6\% with some degree of degradation, which contributes to degradation of the natural resources and reduction of livestock farming and economic potential of the basin.

TI  - Next-Generation Biomass Mapping For Regional Emissions And Carbon Inventories: Incorporating Uncertainty In Wildland Fuel Characterization
AB  - Biomass mapping is used in variety of applications including carbon assessments, emission inventories, and wildland fire and fuel planning. Single values are often applied to individual pixels to represent biomass of classified vegetation, but each biomass estimate has associated uncertainty that is generally not acknowledged nor quantified. In this study, we developed a geospatial database of wildland fuel biomass values to characterize the inherent variability within and across major vegetation types of the United States and Canada. For vegetation types that had sufficient quantification of biomass by fuel type (e.g., canopy, shrub, herbaceous, fine downed wood, coarse downed wood, and organic soil layers), we developed empirical distribution estimates. Based on available data, fitted distributions will be useful for informing the first-generation biomass mapping that incorporates variability in loading by vegetation and fuel type and to evaluate potential errors in point estimates given in current map products. Because combustible biomass is a common input in fire and smoke models, variability estimated for fitted distributions can be used to inform data input uncertainty in predictions of wildland fuel consumption and emissions and to provide stochastic inputs of biomass to ensemble simulation models.

TI  - Evaluation Of Six Algorithms To Monitor Wheat Leaf Nitrogen Concentration
AB  - The rapid and non-destructive monitoring of the canopy leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) in crops is important for precise nitrogen (N) management. Nowadays, there is an urgent need to identify next-generation bio-physical variable retrieval algorithms that can be incorporated into an operational processing chain for hyperspectral satellite missions. We assessed six retrieval algorithms for estimating LNC from canopy reflectance of winter wheat in eight field experiments. These experiments represented variations in the N application rates, planting densities, ecological sites and cultivars and yielded a total of 821 samples from various places in Jiangsu, China over nine consecutive years. Based on the reflectance spectra and their first derivatives, six methods using different numbers of wavelengths were applied to construct predictive models for estimating wheat LNC, including continuum removal (CR), vegetation indices (VIs), stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs). To assess the performance of these six methods, we provided a systematic evaluation of the estimation accuracies using the six metrics that were the coefficients of determination for the calibration (R-C(2)) and validation (R-V(2)) sets, the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for the calibration and validation sets, the ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD), the computational efficiency (CE) and the complexity level (CL). The following results were obtained: (1) For the VIs method, SAVI(R-1200, R-705) produced a more accurate estimation of the LNC than other indices, with R-C(2), R-V(2), RMSEP, RPD and CE values of 0.844, 0.795, 0.384, 2.005 and 0.10 min, respectively; (2) For the SMLR, PLSR, ANNs and SVMs methods, the SVMs using the first derivative canopy spectra (SVM-FDS) offered the best accuracy in terms of R-C(2), R-V(2), RMSEP, RPD, and CE, at 0.96, 0.78, 0.37, 2.02, and 21.17, respectively; (3) The PLSR-FDS, ANN-OS and SVM-FDS methods yield similar accuracies if the CE and CL are not considered, however, ANNs and SVMs performed better on calibration set than the validation set which indicate that we should take more caution with the two methods for over-fitting. Except PLS method, the performance for most methods did not enhance when the spectrum were operated by the first derivative. Moreover, the evaluation of the robustness demonstrates that SVM method may be better suited than the other methods to cope with potential confounding factors for most varieties, ecological site and growth stage; (4) The prediction accuracy was found to be higher when more wavelengths were used, though at the cost of a lower CE. The findings are of interest to the remote sensing community for the development of improved inversion schemes for hyperspectral applications concerning other types of vegetation. The examples provided in this paper may also serve to illustrate the advantages and shortcomings of empirical hyperspectral models for mapping important vegetation biophysical properties of other crops.

TI  - Assessment Of Habitat Suitability Of Ovis Ammon Polii Based On Maxent Modeling In Taxkorgan Wildlife Nature Reserve
AB  - Marco Polo sheep (Ovis ammon polii) is an endemic species and also a flagship species of Pamir Plateau. Assessment of habitat suitability is the prerequisite and basis for the effective conservation of this species. From May to November 2017, 104 occurrence points of Marco Polo sheep were confirmed by using the line transect method. Combining 27 kinds of environmental variable factors, the MaxEnt model was used to determine the main factors affecting the distribution of Marco Polo sheep, and to assess its potentially suitable habitat in Taxkorgan Wildlife Nature Reserve. The results showed that the AUC (area under ROC curve) value was 0.955, suggesting perfect predictive effect of the model. Suitable habitat of Marco Polo sheep was mainly distributed in the northwest part of the reserve. The area of suitable habitat was around 1288.53 km2, which only accounted for 8.12% of the total area. Altitude, temperature seasonality, vegetation type, mean temperature of wettest quarter, lowest temperature of coldest month, and slope were the most important environmental factors affecting the suitable habitat distribution of Marco Polo sheep, whereas human disturbance and land use had less influence. The suitable vegetation types of Marco Polo sheep were mainly desert and grassland, and the range of altitude was 3500-4800 m. We proposed two strategies on the conservation and management measures of Marco Polo sheep population: Controlling human disturbance and establishing a migration corridor among suitable habitats. © 2019 editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - Rice Crop Detection Using Lstm, Bi-Lstm, And Machine Learning Models From Sentinel-1 Time Series
AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series allows describing the rice phenological cycle by the backscattering time signature. Therefore, the advent of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 program expands studies of radar data (C-band) for rice monitoring at regional scales, due to the high temporal resolution and free data distribution. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model has reached state-of-the-art in the pattern recognition of time-sequenced data, obtaining a significant advantage at crop classification on the remote sensing images. One of the most used approaches in the RNN model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and its improvements, such as Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). Bi-LSTM models are more effective as their output depends on the previous and the next segment, in contrast to the unidirectional LSTM models. The present research aims to map rice crops from Sentinel-1 time series (band C) using LSTM and Bi-LSTM models in West Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). We compared the results with traditional Machine Learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Normal Bayes (NB). The developed methodology can be subdivided into the following steps: (a) acquisition of the Sentinel time series over two years; (b) data pre-processing and minimizing noise from 3D spatial-temporal filters and smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filter; (c) time series classification procedures; (d) accuracy analysis and comparison among the methods. The results show high overall accuracy and Kappa (>97% for all methods and metrics). Bi-LSTM was the best model, presenting statistical differences in the McNemar test with a significance of 0.05. However, LSTM and Traditional Machine Learning models also achieved high accuracy values. The study establishes an adequate methodology for mapping the rice crops in West Rio Grande do Sul. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - A Novel Study Of The Interrelationship Of Seasonality, Satellite Data And Weed Compositional Changes Of The Agro-Ecological System Of Gujrat, Pakistan
AB  - The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25 each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during 2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1. Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2. Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields, suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most important in controlling the variations in the weed species data followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area. Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing, quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity, quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing, quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.

TI  - Risk-Based Methods For Fish And Terrestrial Animal Disease Surveillance
AB  - Over recent years there have been considerable methodological developments in the field of animal disease surveillance. The principles of risk analysis were conceptually applied to surveillance in order to further develop approaches and tools (scenario tree modelling) to design risk-based surveillance (RBS) programmes. In the terrestrial animal context, examples of risk-based surveillance have demonstrated the substantial potential for cost saving, and a similar benefit is expected also for aquatic animals. RBS approaches are currently largely absent for aquatic animal diseases. A major constraint in developing RBS designs in the aquatic context is the lack of published data to assist in the design of RBS: this applies to data on (i) the relative risk of farm sites becoming infected due to the presence or absence of a given risk factor; (ii) the sensitivity of diagnostic tests (specificity is often addressed by follow-up investigation and re-testing and therefore less of a concern); (iii) data on the variability of prevalence of infection for fish within a holding unit, between holding units and at farm level. Another constraint is that some of the most basic data for planning surveillance are missing, e.g. data on farm location and animal movements. In Europe, registration or authorisation of fish farms has only recently become a requirement under EU Directive 2006/88. Additionally, the definition of the epidemiological unit (at site or area level) in the context of aquaculture is a challenge due to the often high level of connectedness (mainly via water) of aquaculture facilities with the aquatic environment. This paper provides a review of the principles, methods and examples of RBS in terrestrial, farmed and wild animals. It discusses the special challenges associated with surveillance for aquatic animal diseases (e.g. accessibility of animals for inspection and sampling, complexity of rearing systems) and provides an overview of current developments relevant for the design of RBS for fish diseases. Suggestions are provided on how the current constraints to applying RBS to fish diseases can be overcome. © 2013.

TI  - Estimation Of Long-Term River Discharge And Its Changes In Ungauged Watersheds In Pamir Plateau
AB  - The Pamir Plateau is an extremely important water resource area for over 60 million people in Central Asia. With the increasingly significant response of water resources to climate change, timely hydrological predictions for the future supply are necessary. In the plateau, accessing and monitoring the glaciers and their melt outflow are challenging due to the harsh geographic environments. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with remote sensing technologies offer great potential for providing information to improve water resources management and decision-making. In this study, we integrated UAV and satellite remote sensing data, and applied a water balance model to estimate monthly and annual river discharges for the ten river sections in the Eastern Pamir Plateau, China from 1999 to 2020. We found that the glacier area in the controlled basins of these sections has decreased by approximately 63\% from 1999 to 2020. Basins with smaller glacier areas are more sensitive to climate change. The ten river sections are characterized by decreasing trends in monthly river discharge, with an average reduction of -21.05\%. The annual variation of total runoff and glacial meltwater discharge is consistent with the monthly variation of discharge, and the average discharge from glacier meltwater accounts for 83\% of the total runoff. We conclude that the overall decreasing trend of discharge is closely related to the recession of glaciers. Under the background of climate warming in the region, glaciers are no longer sufficient to support the increase in river discharge, which has passed its peak value and shows a decreasing trend.

TI  - Detroit's Lines Of Desire: Footpaths And Vacant Land In The Motor City
AB  - Informal footpaths known as desire lines crisscross the city of Detroit and are visible from space. Despite their prevalence, especially in postindustrial cities, no comprehensive study of desire lines exists for any urban area. How extensive are these lines, how do people use them, and how are they changing over time? What is their potential to reinvigorate the fabric of neighborhoods and communities? We conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of desire lines in Detroit by combining remote sensing and spatial analysis with physical audits and interviews. Our results show that Detroit has more than 5680 of these footpaths, totaling more than 150 miles ( > 240 km). Transportation planners may value desire lines for their efficiency, reducing travel time and distance. Urban theorists and community activists, however, view desire lines as a form of resistance and reclamation of space for a public poorly served by urban institutions. The results of our mixed-methods approach demonstrate how these two perspectives can co-exist. Desire lines are creative attempts to expand urban possibilities, enhance efficiency, and reaffirm agency in increasingly regulated cities. Desire lines in Detroit, however, are rapidly disappearing. From 2010 to 2016, the Lower Eastside region of the city witnessed a 70 percent reduction in the total length of these lines. Our analysis shows that this correlates with changes in land ownership, management practices, and population dynamics. The loss of desire lines exposes the limits of informal practices and indicates the need for connections to broader relationships of power and governance. Creative engagements with the state can formalize lines and help residents realize their rights to the city.

TI  - Modeling Rare Endemic Shrub Habitat In The Uinta Basin Using Soil, Spectral, And Topographic Data
AB  - Conserving rare plants is important to biodiversity. Shrubby reed-mustard [Schoenocrambe suffrutescens (Rollins) S.L. Welsh and Chatterly] (SRM), a shrub endemic to the Uinta Basin, faces habitat loss due to energy development of fossil fuels. Little is known about the soil and site properties required for successful establishment, growth, and survival of SRM. Our goal was to create random forests models to identify potential SRM habitat and to verify habitat suitability in the field with easily measured properties. The soil properties (SP) model indicated that CaCO3 equivalent, silt, and dry color value predicted the presence or absence of SRM with 10% out-of-bag (OOB) error. Soil properties were correlated with Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper spectral data and a digital elevation model in a Soil-Spectral Correlation (SSC) model. Yellowness, 3/2 normalized difference ratio (NDR), and 3/1 NDR were most strongly correlated with CaCO3 equivalent and silt, and they predicted SRM habitat with 28% OOB error. Guided by SSC model output, 250 additional field presence or absence points were used to train the Spectral-Topographic (ST) model, which was validated by an independent set of SRM plant locations. The ST model using area solar radiation, 7/2 NDR, 5/2 NDR, and the normalized difference vegetation index gave an OOB error of 23%. The ST model can be used to identify potential habitat across a large area. Once identified, easily measured soil and site data from the SP model can verify SRM habitat suitability. These models can help land managers locate and check key soil properties at potential SRM habitat sites. © 2016 Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada.

TI  - Does Citizen Science Bring “Power To The People”? Evaluating A Remote Mapping Project To Identify Best Practices For Positive Impact On Volunteers
AB  - A core tenet of citizen science is mutual benefit to the professional researcher and the citizen scientist. While the impacts on the citizen scientist are often implicitly assumed to be positive, this is infrequently studied directly. Here, we evaluate the impacts of the Power to the People remote mapping citizen science project on volunteers to explore best practices for positive impact. We analyze beta feedback collected before project launch, discussion board posts made during the project, an end-of-project evaluation survey, and mapping data generated during the project. We found that this project attracted a diverse global community who were motivated to contribute to research with the potential to create real-world impact. 87% of respondents had a “good” or “excellent” experience with the project, and 66% learned something by participating. Best-practices identified through this evaluation are to: (1) account for the intersectionality of contributor demographics; (2) emphasize project interdisciplinarity and real-world impact potential; (3) provide learning opportunities at multiple levels of depth; (4) remember that the most vocal contributors do not represent the entire community; and (5) evaluate data quality regularly to identify silent issues. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Tree Defoliation Classification Based On Point Distribution Features Derived From Single-Scan Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data
AB  - Forest disruption caused by pest insects is a common disaster occurring in plantations, and is a threatening factor to forest health. Therefore, a precise method for monitoring individual tree health and estimating disturbance severity is urgently needed. Theoretically, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a promising tool in high resolution remote sensing, which can provide information regarding the structural change of the affected trees with millimeter precision. However, few studies have explored the potential of TLS application in this field, especially when using only mono-temporal data. In this study, a single-scan TLS data-based method was developed and validated to classify defoliation at both individual-tree scale and plot scale. The objects were classified into three classes: healthy/slightly defoliated, moderately defoliated and severely defoliated. Sixty features were extracted from TLS data and optimized to six (individual-tree scale) and five (plot scale) explanatory variables by using a Random Forest method to accomplish the classification. By this approach, individual trees can be classified into three defoliation levels with 80% overall accuracy (kappa value 0.70), while plot-scale classification had 94% overall accuracy (kappa value 0.91). Point distribution characteristics proposed in this method were among the most important features for defoliation estimation. Evidently, the methods presented in this study are capable of providing satisfactory estimates of defoliation severity, and supporting a precise inventory and monitoring of forest health. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Quantifying And Modelling Decay In Forecast Proficiency Indicates The Limits Of Transferability In Land-Cover Classification
AB  - The ability to provide reliable projections for the current and future distribution of land-cover is fundamental if we wish to protect and manage our diminishing natural resources. Two inter-related revolutions make map productions feasible at unprecedented resolutions—the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data and the development of machine-learning algorithms. However, ground-truthed data needed for training models is in most cases spatially and temporally clustered. Therefore, map production requires extrapolation of models from one place to another and the uncertainty cost of such extrapolation is rarely explored. In other words, the focus has mainly been on projections, and less on quantifying their reliability. Using the concept of “forecast horizon”, we suggest that the predictability of land-cover classification models should be quantitatively explored as a continuum against distances measured along multiple dimensions—space, time, environmental and spectral. Focusing on ten agricultural sites from England and using models specifically designed to predict multivariate decay-curves, we ask: how does a model's predictive performance decay with distance? More specifically, we explored if we could predict the proficiency (kappa statistics) of a model trained in one site when making predictions in another site based on the spatial, temporal, spectral and environmental distances between sites. We found that model proficiency decays with distance between sites in each dimension. More importantly, we found for the first time, that it is possible to predict the performance a model transferred to or from a novel site will have, based on its distances from known sites. The spectral distance variables were the most important when predicting model transferability. Exploring model transferability as a continuum may have multiple usages including predicting uncertainty values in space and time, prioritisation of strategies for ground-truth data collection, and optimising model characteristics for defined tasks. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Cloud-Based Typhoon-Derived Paddy Rice Flooding And Lodging Detection Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1&2
AB  - Rice production in China’s coastal areas is frequently affected by typhoons, since the associated severe storms, with heavy rain and the strong winds, lead directly to the rice plants becoming flooded or lodged. Long-term flooding and lodging can cause a substantial reduction in rice yield or even destroy the harvest completely. It is therefore urgent to obtain accurate information about paddy rice flooding and lodging as soon as possible after the passing of the storm. This paper proposes a workflow in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for mapping the flooding and lodging area of paddy rice in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang, following super typhoon Maria (Typhoon No.8 in 2018). First, paddy rice in the study area was detected by multi-temporal Sentinel-1 backscatter data combined with Sentinel-2-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the Random Forests (RFs) algorithm. High classification accuracies were achieved, whereby rice detection accuracy was calculated at 95% (VH + NDVI-based) and 87% (VV + NDVI-based). Secondly, Change Detection (CD) based Rice Normalized Difference Flooded Index (RNDFI) and Rice Normalized Difference Lodged Index (RNDLI) were proposed to detect flooding and lodged paddy rice. Both RNDFI and RNDLI were tested based on four different remote sensing data sets, including the Sentinel-1-derived VV and VH back-scattering coefficient, Sentinel-2-derived NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Overall agreement regarding detected area between the each two different data sets was obtained, with values of 79% to 93% in flood detection and 64% to 88% in lodging detection. The resulting flooded and lodged paddy rice maps have potential to reinforce disaster emergency assessment systems and provide an important resource for disaster reduction and emergency departments. © 2019, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - City Of Kampung: Risk And Resilience In The Urban Communities Of Surabaya, Indonesia
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to bring a new perspective on the meaning of resilience in Indonesia's main urban settlement type, known as kampung. The paper reviews kampung in major urban centres in Indonesia, but focuses on a case study of Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city. Despite effectively accommodating the majority of Surabaya's population, kampung inhabitants are stigmatised and kampung are viewed as slum-like habitats. Such a pejorative view neglects to consider the importance of kampung and ignores their inherent and potential resilience. It is important to study both the risks and resilience of kampung so that they can be developed to address social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities in Southeast Asian cities. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify the risks and resilience of kampung. Key themes were mapped from the literature and used to construct a framework for understanding and enhancing resilience within this distinctive vernacular settlement type. In addition, a place-based approach constructed from remote sensing and field studies provide a deeper understanding of the structure of this urban settlement type. FindingsKampung play an important role in housing the majority of Surabaya's population and are an intrinsic part of the city's urban structure. The characteristics and conditions of kampung vary throughout Indonesia. Surabaya has a variety of kampung types which demonstrates distinctive forms of both risk and resilience. This research finds that there are many positive dimensions of kampung and that this vital form of settlement is well suited to support the growth and sustainability of Southeast Asia's emerging megacities. Research limitations/implications This paper evaluates the current state of knowledge on risk and resilience of kampung within Surabaya. To gain a clearer understanding of why kampung are resilient, long-term field work and deeper analysis of kampung, in particular the social and physical structures, are needed. Practical implications Planning for high-density urban development needs to integrate kampung as a part of existing and new urban settlements to accommodate diverse populations. Originality/value This paper demonstrates that knowledge on kampung resilience is relevant to the adaptation of existing urban settlements and the future development of new urban settlements. This paper contributes a clearer understanding of why kampung in Surabaya are not slums and establishes a framework that supports the development of kampung as a resilient and functional settlement type in current and future urban developments. Considering the large and rapidly growing populations who depend on kampung in the Southeast Asian region, this research is of considerable significance.

TI  - Vegetation Responses To Climate Change In The Qilian Mountain Nature Reserve, Northwest China
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of vegetation responses to climate change can provide important information for environmental management. The Qilian Mountain Nature Reserve in Northwest China, a high-altitude mountainous region that is of critical ecological importance, has been affected by drastic climate change. However, the response of vegetation to climate change in this area has not been established. This study aims to address three unanswered questions. First, what is the relative importance of temperature and precipitation change in driving regional vegetation change? Second, how does this vegetation-climate relationship manifest itself across different timescales (e.g., seasonal)? Third, what is the spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation-climate relationship? Based on MODIS data and daily meteorological data from 41 stations within and adjacent to the reserve, we used Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), Theil-Sen median trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test, and Pearson correlation analysis to study the evolution of temperature, precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The key results are as follows: (1) during 1985-2019, the temperature in the reserve has increased by an average of 0.048 degrees C/a, with the largest average annual increases occurring in spring (0.069 degrees C) and summer (0.056 degrees C); (2) during the same period, precipitation in the reserve increased by an average of 1.17 mm/a, with the largest annual increases occurring in autumn (0.669 mm) and summer (0.545 mm); (3) during 2001-2019, the NDVI increased by an average of 0.004/a; an average annual increase was experienced in all seasons, although the largest increase occurred in summer; (4) there is a statistically significant positive correlation (0.619) between the NDVI and temperature at the annual scale; (5) in contrast, the correlation between the NDVI and precipitation is weaker and not statistically significant (0.368), which indicates that temperature is the dominant factor affecting vegetation changes in the reserve; (6) there exist seasonal differences in the vegetation-climate relationship. The positive correlation between NDVI and temperature is strongest in spring whereas the positive correlation between NDVI and precipitation is strongest in summer; (7) the vegetation-climate relations demonstrate a degree of spatial heterogeneity driven by variability in climate factors and ecosystems. The value of this research is that it analyzes the response characteristics of vegetation to climate change using multiple methods and at multiple scales, providing a useful reference for understanding vegetation changes and their response to climate change in high-altitude mountain regions.

TI  - Building The Bioeconomy Through Innovation, Monitoring And Science-Based Policies
AB  - Concerns about climate change, food security and biodiversity loss are challenging society and the scientific community to modify our modes of operation. This involves the transition from relying on non-renewable resources to renewable resources, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, sequestering and storing carbon, and at the same time, improving the well-being of much of humanity who live in poverty. Establishing a modern bioeconomy is essential for the transition. The BioMonitor Project highlights benefits of establishing a modern bioeconomy and the constraints slowing its development. We propose policies to overcome these constraints, emphasising the importance of monitoring its progress. We present some of its findings and recommendations to improve the performance of the EU bioeconomy. This includes a science-based regulatory process to balance risk and benefit of new innovations, combined with effective liability rules and sound assessment of the side effects of new regulations without unnecessary delay and extra regulatory costs. Government support is crucial for agricultural and industrial research and development leading to the emergence of new supply chains. Since developing bioeconomy industries that increase productivity and reduce externalities provide public goods, some government support for infant bioeconomy sectors may be justified. © 2023 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists.

TI  - Investigating Water Use Over The Choptank River Watershed Using A Multisatellite Data Fusion Approach
AB  - The health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem has been declining for several decades due to high levels of nutrients and sediments largely tied to agricultural production systems. Therefore, monitoring of agricultural water use and hydrologic connections between crop lands and Bay tributaries has received increasing attention. Remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration (ET) can provide valuable information in support of these hydrologic modeling efforts, spatially and temporally describing consumptive water use by crops and natural vegetation and quantifying response to expansion of irrigated area occurring with Bay watershed. In this study, a multisensor satellite data fusion methodology, combined with a multiscale ET retrieval algorithm, was applied over the Choptank River watershed located within the Lower Chesapeake Bay region on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, USA to produce daily 30 m resolution ET maps. ET estimates directly retrieved on Landsat satellite overpass dates have high accuracy with relative error (RE) of 9\%, as evaluated using flux tower measurements. The fused daily ET time series have reasonable errors of 18\% at the daily time step - an improvement from 27\% errors using standard Landsat-only interpolation techniques. Annual water consumption by different land cover types was assessed, showing reasonable distributions of water use with cover class. Seasonal patterns in modeled crop transpiration and soil evaporation for dominant crop types were analyzed, and agree well with crop phenology at field scale. Additionally, effects of irrigation occurring during a period of rainfall shortage were captured by the fusion program. These results suggest that the ET fusion system will have utility for water management at field and regional scales over the Eastern Shore. Further efforts are underway to integrate these detailed water use data sets into watershed-scale hydrologic models to improve assessments of water quality and inform best management practices to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay.

TI  - A Study On The Possibility Of Religious Governance Of New Religions In Korea: Focusing On The Ecological Worldview Of Donghak And Won Buddhism
AB  - The most serious threats to humankind today are environmental and ecological problems. The global warming in particular is generally perceived as a serious threat to the survival of humanity and this sense of urgency has given us a chance to consider our place in the ecosystem and question our anthropocentrism. Various faiths acknowledge human obligations to protect the environment and preserve biodiversity. In the Korean context, while the eco-friendly worldviews of Buddhism are well-known, very little is known about other Korean religions' views on the environment. This paper examines whether representative new religions of Korea, namely Donghak and Won Buddhism, can contribute as "religious mechanisms" in alleviating ecological problems. The paper particularly focuses on the former's doctrine of samgyeong or "the Threefold Respect" and the latter's philosophy of saeun or "the Fourfold Grace," examining their relevance for religious governance. The paper argues that these two doctrines are permeated with an ecological view implying the need for all living things, including humans, animals and plants as well as the natural environment, to coexist. The paper also argues that these two religions, complete with guidelines for actions or practices, provide a path for building the possibility of religious governance through religious awakening of believers, mutual respect and mutual trust, and mutual communication and reflective cooperation.

TI  - Burning Urban Cities Of South Africa Due To Civil Turmoil 2021: Socio-Economic And Environmental Consequences
AB  - A violent outbreak of civil unrest (Jul 7-19, 2021) triggered immediately after the incarceration of the former South African president claimed 337 lives and brought disruptive damages to societal movements, environment, and COVID-19 containment measures. The present work aimed to analyze the hotspots of fire sites, its significances on societal activities, air quality and COVID-19 pandemic using ground based and geospatial data. The results revealed steady rise in air pollution levels all through the region due to increase in fire activities. Positive influence on the regional air quality was observed to be high than the limits set forth by WHO. The daily mean values of PM2.5 (62.37-104.34 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (108.86-156.78 mu g/m(3)) presented potential short and long-term risks to public health. Similarly, COVID-19 cases also increased during the social unrest period even when the community mobility was less than the normal conditions. This type of cost benefit analysis proves to provide evidence of deteriorating air quality and aids to examine the adverse impacts on human health during the global pandemic.

TI  - Assessment Of Multi-Resolution Image Data For Mangrove Leaf Area Index Mapping
AB  - The increasing development pressures from urbanization, aquaculture and tourism on worldwide coastal environments and the ecosystem services that mangroves provide make it essential to monitor and manage these environments more effectively. Measuring and monitoring mangrove structure through variables like Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential part of this action. This study investigated the effects of different mangrove environmental settings, satellite image spatial resolutions, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and mapping approaches for LAI estimation. We compared and contrasted the ability of WorldView-2 (WV-2), ALOS AVNIR-2 (AVNIR-2) and Landsat TM (TM) image data (2 m, 10 m and 30 m pixel sizes, respectively), to estimate LAI through regression analysis at sites in Moreton Bay (Australia) and Karimunjawa Island (Indonesia). We also investigated the effect of different pixel averaging windows (3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 7 × 7 pixels) and multi-resolution segmentation scale parameters (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) applied to the WV-2 image for LAI estimation. The results showed that LAI estimation using remote sensing data varies across sites and sensors. Estimation of LAI in this study was influenced by the local spatial variation of mangrove phenological stages and canopy cover. The regression analyses showed significant coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.50 to 0.83 across different sensors (TM, AVNIR-2, WV-2), segmentation scales (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) and SVIs (SR, NDVI, SAVI, EVI). The sensor and SVIs assessment identified the ALOS AVNIR-2 and NDVI as the optimal estimators of LAI, with R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.54 for Moreton Bay, and R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.31 for Karimunjawa Island. The optimum image pixel size for estimating LAI was related to the average canopy size (about 10 m in diameter) and the field sampling size (10 m). Image segmentation significantly increased the LAI estimation accuracy by approximately 14% for both sites. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the relationship between image spatial resolution, field sampling size and spatial variation of mangrove vegetation for estimating LAI. These findings can be potentially used as a guide for selecting the optimum imagery for LAI estimation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - High Fire Disturbance In Forests Leads To Longer Recovery, But Varies By Forest Type
AB  - Across the world, millions of hectares of forest are burned by wildfires each year. Satellite remote sensing, particularly when used in time series, can describe complex disturbance-recovery processes, but is underutilized by ecologists. This study examines whether a greater disturbance magnitude equates to a longer recovery length, in the fire-adapted forests of south-east Australia. Using Landsat time series, spectral disturbance and recovery maps were first created, for 2.3 million hectares of forest, burned between 2002 and 2009. To construct these maps, a piecewise linear model was fitted to each pixel's Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) temporal trajectory, and used to extract the disturbance magnitude (change in NBR) and the spectral recovery length (number of years for the NBR trajectory to return to its pre-fire state). Pearson's correlations between disturbance magnitude and spectral recovery length were then calculated at a state level, bioregion level and patch level (600 m × 600 m, or 36 hectares). Our results showed overall correlation at the state level to be inconclusive, due to confounding factors. At the bioregion level, correlations were predominantly positive (i.e. a greater disturbance equals a longer recovery). At the patch level, both positive and negative correlations occurred, with clear evidence of spatial patterns. This suggests that the relationship between disturbance magnitude and recovery length is dependent on forest type. This was further explored by investigating the major vegetation divisions within one bioregion, which provided further evidence that relationships varied by vegetation type. In Heathy Dry Forests, for example, a greater disturbance magnitude usually led to a longer recovery length, while in Tall Mist Forests, the opposite behaviour was evident. Results of the patch-level analysis were particularly promising, demonstrating the utility of satellite remote sensing in producing landscape scale information to inform policy and management. © 2019 The Authors Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Zoological Society of London

TI  - From The Cloud To The Ground: Converting Satellite Data Into Conservation Decisions
AB  - An estimated 65% of the world’s land and more than 80% of Earth’s biodiversity are under indigenous or local community customary ownership, care, and use. Recent developments in remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), mobile, and cloud computing provide the opportunity to systematically and cost-effectively monitor land-cover and land-use changes and threats at multiple scales. It is now possible, via satellite observations, to obtain a synoptic view of ecosystems at spatial and temporal resolutions that are more detailed, locally relevant, and consistent from village to global scales. However, to make geospatial data and technologies work for conservation, we still need to understand how data turn into actionable information and conservation decisions. This chapter uses Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation as a framework to discuss insights from 18 years of using geospatial technologies with the local communities, village and district governments, and other partners to monitor chimpanzee habitats and threats and inform chimpanzee conservation strategies and actions in Tanzania. It focuses on how Earth Observation data and associated technologies enabled and benefitted from the creation of research-implementation spaces in which stakeholders were able to collaborate and interact with geospatial data and results in a diversity of ways. This enabled development of geospatial applications and solutions ‘with’ and not ‘for’ local stakeholders, resulting in expansion of new protected areas managed by village and districts governments and restoration of habitats in some degraded village forest reserves. © Oxford University Press 2021.

TI  - Using Satellite Radar Backscatter To Predict Above-Ground Woody Biomass: A Consistent Relationship Across Four Different African Landscapes
AB  - Regional-scale above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates of tropical savannas and woodlands are highly uncertain, despite their global importance for ecosystems services and as carbon stores. In response, we collated field inventory data from 253 plots at four study sites in Cameroon, Uganda and Mozambique, and examined the relationships between field-measured AGB and cross-polarized radar backscatter values derived from ALOS PALSAR, an L-band satellite sensor. The relationships were highly significant, similar among sites, and displayed high prediction accuracies up to 150 Mg ha-1 (±∼20%). AGB predictions for any given site obtained using equations derived from data from only the other three sites generated only small increases in error. The results suggest that a widely applicable general relationship exists between AGB and L-band backscatter for lower-biomass tropical woody vegetation. This relationship allows regional-scale AGB estimation, required for example by planned REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) schemes.

TI  - Pleasant Value Of Residential Green Space Of Oasis City In Arid Land Based On Wtp
AB  - Pleasure value is the value identification of the ecology and social services of green space based on human perception. It is of great significance to quantify the value of the externality of urban green space, which is of growing concern for many researchers. The green space of residential land (hereinafter referred to as residential green space) belongs to urban ancillary green space. Residential green space is close to residents'daily life and has the highest frequency and accessibility. Its construction level directly reflects residents'living standards, the quality of regional human settlements, and the modern concept of human-oriented principles. Thus, it is particularly important to evaluate the pleasure value of urban residential green space. The value of urban green space, particularly the pleasure value of oasis cities in arid areas, is usually underestimated, which leads to a lack of an internal driving force in the investment and construction of the urban green space. As a result, the rate of green space in the residential area of an oasis city is relatively low, and the quality of the living environment is not high. Therefore, it is meaningful to quantify the residents'willingness to pay (WTP) for the residential green space of the oasis city and measure the pleasure value of the residential green space at the urban level. Recent research has shown that the WTP of individuals varies among different cities, residential areas, and types of green areas. Moreover, the differences between cities and residential areas are smaller, while the differences between different types of green areas are larger. The influencing factors of WTP primarily include gender, age, occupation, income, family structure, use frequency, and satisfaction. In other words, residents'socioeconomic characteristics impact their WTP. Based on a review of the literature on the theory of pleasure value, the WTP measurement methods, and its influencing factors, the following work was performed: Using typical oasis city Urumqi, Xinjiang, China as an example, a sampling survey was distributed to residents throughout the main urban areas. Based on the data, we used the CVM method of card payment and Tobit regression model to quantify the residents'WTP for residential green space and analyzed the influencing factors of the residents'social and economic attributes. With the aid of the marginal theory from western economics, we analyzed the marginal influence of non-virtual variables on the residents'decision-making as well. The WTP differences among residential areas with different attributes and residents from different parts of the urban areas were discussed. Additionally, the decomposition of the pleasure value of urban residential green space was calculated. The results indicated that the individual WTP of Urumqi's residents was 148.75 yuan·a-1, which was much higher than that in the eastern region. Moreover, the WTP of residents from residential areas with different attributes varied upon comparison. We also found that the respondents'gender, income, family structure, demand preference, cognition, and consciousness had a significant impact on their WTP and that the impact of non-virtual variables on their decision-making could be measured by means of the marginal theory. At the urban level, the pleasure value of green space in residential areas was 3.31 × 108 yuan·a-1, in which the value of ecological services was slightly higher than that of social services. Further research is needed to determine how to establish green payment mechanisms of different types and scales, increase the sample quantity, and improve the existing survey methods to reduce the WTP value deviation caused by personal understanding. Additionally, more confirmatory research should be carried out in oasis cities in arid regions to enrich the study of urban residential green space. © Science Press (China). All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Object-Based Image Analysis For Distinguishing Indigenous And Exotic Forests In Coffee Production Areas Of Ethiopia
AB  - Indigenous forest management and conservation has a major importance for ecosystem services in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspots. In the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia, indigenous forests are particularly relevant for coffee producers, given that Coffea arabica grows as understory shrub in these forests. Currently, identifying and mapping understory coffee using remote sensing is still considered a challenging task because exotic tree plantations are largely overspread among indigenous forests. In this paper, a rule set was developed for recognizing indigenous forests from high-resolution satellite imagery using object-based image analysis (OBIA). The study applies a multiscale approach, in which aerial photographs (0.5 m), SPOT-5 satellite image (2.5 m), and field observations were integrated to discriminate indigenous from exotic forests. The rule-set combined segmentation (multiresolution, spectral difference, and contrast splitting), classification algorithms, and knowledge-based threshold functions. Moreover, principal component analysis and imagery texture indexes (e. g., homogeneity) were used to feed the classification algorithms. The results show that the applied methodology could separate indigenous from exotic forests with an overall accuracy of 84.3 \% based on a fourfold cross-validation. The user and producer accuracy of indigenous forest were 84.7 and 94.4 \%, respectively. On the other hand, exotic forest was classified with user accuracy of 87.9\% and producer accuracy of 61.9 \%. This study contributes not only to coffee and environmental researchers but also benefits local communities by allowing the identification of indigenous and exotic forest areas, and leading to better informed natural resources management and conservation.

TI  - Assessing The Impact Of China's Timber Industry On Congo Basin Land Use Change
AB  - Through the rise of global commodity chains, consumer demand in China and the USA has given rise to the extraction of natural resources in the Congo Basin. The Chinese market for high-valued animal products such as elephant ivory and pangolin scales has encouraged poaching, exploitation and trafficking of these goods in Africa. Chinese demand for other African commodities, however, remains less well known. Using data across a 15-year period (2001–2015), we analysed the relationship between Chinese timber imports and tree-cover loss in the Congo Basin. Tree-cover loss was measured via remote sensing and the value of imports was obtained from official trade statistics. Results indicate that the total accumulated export of wood from Congo Basin countries to China doubled between 2001 and 2015, with 50% of exports originating from Cameroon and the Republic of Congo. We found a positive relationship between measures of Chinese logging and the loss of tree cover in the Congo Basin. Further investigation of the timber products market showed that US demand for Chinese-made furniture was positively correlated with Chinese timber imports from the Congo Basin. These findings suggest that US demand for furniture encourages Chinese economic actors to harvest timber from Congo Basin forests. Our results help to illuminate the complex environmental and economic drivers surrounding trade and deforestation and can help inform consumers about more sustainable ways to purchase wood products from one of the world's preeminent biodiversity hotspots.

TI  - Calculating Potential Of Solar Energy And Co2 Emissions Reduction For City-Scale Buildings Based On 3d Remote Sensing Technologies
AB  - Solar energy utilization will play an increasingly important role in sustainable urban development because it will help motivate low-carbon development. This study proposed a framework that calculates the solar irradiance on roofs and façades of city-scale buildings, as well as the potential reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions that can be derived from solar energy utilization. This framework consolidates data acquired using 3D remote sensing techniques (e.g., light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and digital photogrammetry) with existing 3D building vector models from urban planning and building design. To further the economical use of solar energy, the framework provides a new strategy based on three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation), for a more realistic analysis of the available area of roofs and façades, by combining street view images and point clouds. Nanjing, China, was selected as a study area for validating and analyzing the proposed framework. The experimental area covers approximately 30 km2 and 5216 buildings. The reliability of the proposed method was validated by comparing the results with the computation modules of mainstream commercial programs and previous international studies. The following conclusions were drawn from the experimental area. (1) Annual solar energy on the roofs of all buildings was 9647.89 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield of 1447.18 GWh, which equates to reductions of 584.66 kt in standard coal consumption and 1261.94 kt in CO2 emissions. The annual solar energy on the façades was 5364.63 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield of 804.69 GWh, which equates to reductions of 325.10 kt in standard coal consumption and 701.69 kt in CO2 emissions. (2) Based on the calculated potential solar energy utilization of the building envelopes, it was shown that the utilization of solar radiation on roofs and façades would promote low-carbon urban development. The utilization of solar energy on the façades of high buildings will contribute to the supply of energy for these buildings and help balance their energy consumption. (3) As the solar incidence angle changes over time, the reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to PV power generation are maximal in summer for building roofs, whereas no significant seasonal differences were observed for façades. (4) Incorporating the available area translates the utilization of solar energy and potential CO2 reductions from theory to practical application by reducing inefficient and invalid areas. The percentages of available area of roof and façade were estimated at 47% and 16% by comprehensive calculations considering three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation). The corresponding potential of solar energy on the roofs and façades in the validation area B are 167.18 GWh and 53.63 GWh, respectively, compared to the original theoretic values of 316.97 GWh and 237.98 GWh. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Mapping The Spatial And Temporal Variability Of Flood Susceptibility Using Remotely Sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index And The Forecasted Changes In The Future
AB  - Accurate runoff forecasting plays a considerable role in the appropriate water resource planning and management. The spatial and temporal evaluation of the flood susceptibility was explored in the Quebec basin, Canada. This study provides a new strategy for runoff modelling as one of the complicated variables by developing new machine learning techniques along with remote sensing. A novel scheme of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) known as the generalized structure of GMDH (GSGGMDH) is developed to overcome this classical approach's limitation. A simple time series based scenario with exogenous variables including precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was introduced for runoff forecasting. MODIS data included MOD13Q1 product was employed and a JavaScript code was developed to preprocess collected data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Using different seasonal and non-seasonal lags of all input variables, the developed GSGMDH found the most optimum input combination for each station in terms of simplicity and accuracy, simultaneously (average values; SI = 0.554, RMSRE = 1.55, MAE = 5.076). The precipitation values are modelled with the CanEsm(2) climate change model. To apply NDVI for runoff forecasting, a simple spatial-temporal GSGMDH based model was developed (average values; SI = 0.27; RMSRE = 8.27, MAE = 0.08). The forecasting results indicated that the months in which the maximum runoff occurred have changed, and these months have increased compared to the historic period. In the historical period, the frequency of maximum runoff was in April and March. Still, for the two forecasting periods (i.e. 2020-2039 and 2040-2059), the months in which the maximum runoff has occurred have changed, and their amount has been reduced and added to other months, especially February and August.

TI  - Impact Of Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Carbon Stock In Aceh Besar District, Aceh, Indonesia
AB  - The international community affirms the critical role of forests in climate change mitigation, which includes reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation, carbon stock conservation, sustainable forest management, and increasing carbon stocks in developing countries. It relates to land use and land cover changes. This study aims to review land use and land cover changes (LULC) in two decades, namely 2000-2010 and 2010-2020, and the impact on carbon stocks. Landsat satellite imagery in 2000, 2010, and 2020 are classified into six categories: built-up area, cropland, forest, water body, bareland, and grassland. This classification uses supervised classification. The accuracy kappa coefficient values obtained for the LULC 2000, LULC 2010, and LULC 2020 maps were 89.61%, 83.90%, and 87.10%, respectively. The most dominant systematic LULC change processes were forest degradation in 2000-2020; the transition of forest to cropland (349.20 ha), forest to bareland (171.19 ha), and forest to built-up area (661.68 ha). Loss of using the forest for other uses was followed by a decrease in carbon stock. There was a high decrease in carbon stock in the forest category (11,000 Mg C∙y-1). The results showed a significant change in land use and cover. The decline in the area occurred in the forest category, which decreased from year to year. Meanwhile, the built-up area increases every year. Carbon stocks also decrease from year to year, especially forests as the most significant carbon store, decreasing in the area. © 2023 Sciendo.

TI  - Effective Management Of Slums- Case Study Of Kalaburagi City, Karnataka, India
AB  - As urbanization grows, we may expect that slums will tend to grow even faster. Kalaburagi is a second tier city and an important commercial hub for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region located in the north eastern part of Karnataka state. It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11\% of city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to advance the living conditions of slum dwellers. Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented. As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA) model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors. When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective implementation of slum development programs.

TI  - Influence Of Typhoon Nangka Process On Ozone Pollution In Hainan Island
AB  - In order to explore the influence of the 2016 typhoon Nangka on ozone (O3 ) concentration in Hainan Island, this study employed correlation analysis and backward trajectory simulated methods, using the hourly air quality monitoring data, meteorological data, EAR5 reanalysis data, and bright temperature (TBB) infrared from the Himawari-8 satellite from October 10 to 14, 2020. The results showed that, during the typhoon process from October 11 to 13, the O3 - 8h (maximum of 8 hours sliding average) concentration exceeded the standard. The averaged ρ(O3 -8h) of Hainan Island reached its peak value (130. 5 μg.m - 3 ) in October 12, 2020, with the O3 -8h concentration exceeding the standard in four cities and counties, in which Lingao County reached the highest concentration of 198. 44 μg.m - 3 . During the typhoon process, the hourly O3 concentration was negatively correlated with precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed and positively correlated with air pressure and air temperature. Moreover, the correlation coefficients between O3 with precipitation, air pressure, and relative humidity exceeded the 99. 9% confidence level. The southeastern coastal provinces of China were the main contribution source area for this ozone pollution process on Hainan Island. Affected by the downdraft inside the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the downdraft outside the circumference of typhoon Nangka, vertical transport in the atmosphere appeared over the contribution source area. The meteorological conditions were favorable for atmospheric photochemical reactions. Air pollutants were transported to Hainan Island along the northeast airflow around the typhoon, resulting in the occurrence of an O3 pollution event. In addition, this study built a weather conceptual model of O3 pollution in Hainan Island affected by typhoon Nangka, which can be used as a reference for the joint pollution prevention and control by air pollution prediction, early warning, and environmental management departments. © 2023 Science Press.

TI  - Study Of Regional Evapotranspiration Based On Modcycle Model
AB  - Efficient and accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) not only has significant implications for research in land-atmosphere interactions and climate change, but also has important application values in regional water resources management. In this paper, a distributed hydrology mode - MODCYCLE model is applied to study regional ET in Tianjin. MODCYCLE model is based on the dual water cycle theory and is recently developed by the Department of Water Resources, China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR). The MODCYCLE model was implemented in Tianjin with a set of data, including daily meteorological and hydrological data, annual water usage from 1997 to 2004, and other spatial information, such as remote sensing imagery, DEM (90 m), the digital channel system map, the land use map, and the soil type map. The model was calibrated to match the ET derived from remote sensing data. The modelled monthly ET was compared with the monthly remote sensing ET and the correlation coefficient of two data reached 0.95. The components and the temporal-spatial distribution of modelled ET in Tianjin were analysed, which laid the foundation for identifying ineffective and effective ET and implementing ET management. This study provides a new distributed hydrology model calibration method which uses areal ET instead of streamflows and other hydrological components. This method yields more accurate simulated results of hydrological processes in semiarid areas. In addition, this study which combines with sensing technology and the distributed hydrology model offers a new insight into regional ET estimation. © 2012, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Shaping A Legal Framework For China's Beidou Navigation Satellite System
AB  - As the service provision to Asia-Pacific region and the construction of global constellation are being pushed forward step by step, the lack of soft power on the governance and management over BDS, including institutional, policy and legal arrangements, is clipping the wings of the deployment, development, exploration and application of BDS, and constraining its further popularization at both the domestic and global level. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a comprehensive legal framework for BDS to keep the sustainable development of BDS and to balance the interests of all stakeholders in the value chain of BDS. Bearing that in mind, this paper offers the whole thinking of shaping that legal framework based on the specific analysis on the legal regimes on the supervision mechanism, certification system, mandatory application, ownership, operation, cost of recovery, sovereign rights, liability regime, data and privacy protection as well as other legal issues in the context of BDS.

TI  - Fire Risk Assessment Along The Climate, Vegetation Type Variability Over The Part Of Asian Region: A Geospatial Approach
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the long term MODIS fire counts with the grid spacing 1° × 1° over the part of continent of Asia. The grid show high percent of fire events was assigned to high risk grid. The study further evaluated three selected 2 × 2 window representing the risk grid. We have analyzed the fire events along various vegetation types as well as country boundary. The climate data set is further analyzed and statistical analysis was performed to understand the relationship with fire events. The first selected 2 × 2 window grid roughly represents over region of Punjab and Haryana state of India show 83% of total fire in the month of October and November due to agricultural residues burning. The result of the analysis of vegetation types with fire events manifest the vegetation types dominated by shifting cultivation which occupies the geographical area of 8% whereas they retain fire percent equivalent of 30% of total fire events. Country based fire events analysis shows that Burma fire events per unit geographical area were found roughly 3.5 times higher when compared with India. The analysis of fire events and climate data from February to July in grids over a part of the Asian region (central part of India) exhibit the 50% fire events was in the month of March with maximum temperature (°C), precipitation (mm) and solar radiation (KJ/m2/day) with range of (26.7–35.9), (6–26) and (22680–24366) respectively. The evaluation of Crammer’s V coefficient (CVC) values of precipitation, mean maximum temperature and solar radiation are found in decreasing order and in the range of 0.77–0.31. The highest CVC value of precipitation (0.77) shows that among all other climatic parameters the precipitation has very strong relationship to fire events. Remote sensing data (fire and climate) when coupled with various analyses in GIS domain reflect better understanding of their relationship which will greatly help in management/planning/ making strategy on fire prevention/control. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - No Pixel Left Behind: Toward Integrating Earth Observations For Agriculture Into The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Framework
AB  - Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.

TI  - Ice-Water Classification In Inner Mongolia Reach Of The Yellow River Based On Remote Sensing Images
AB  - Timely delivery of detailed information on the spatial distribution of river ice during ice-flood season is highly valuable for predicting, and improving communication on, ice disaster. Remote sensing technology provides a key method for obtaining the spatial distribution of river ice. However, the large amount of suspended sediment in the Yellow River represents a challenge to high-precision discrimination between ice and water based on remote sensing technology. Taking the Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River as an example, this study compares and evaluates the performance of five indices in the classification of river ice and water: near-infrared reflectance; normalized difference water index (NDWI); normalized difference snow index (NDSI); improved normalized snow index (MNDSI); and normalized difference unfrozen water index (NDUWI). The overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient (a measure of reliability) were calculated for each index, and the threshold stability of each index was analyzed. The results show that NDUWI achieves the highest accuracy and reliability (Kappa coefficient) in each studied subregion. The overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient of NDUWI are more than 90.0% and 0.90, respectively, and the optimal discrimination threshold between river ice and ice-free water is close to the median value. These results can provide a basis for the selection of ice monitoring methods and optimization of ice-blasting locations on the Yellow River during ice-flood season. © 2022 Science Press (China)

TI  - Isolated Trees And Small Woody Patches Greatly Contribute To Connectivity In Highly Fragmented Tropical Landscapes
AB  - Decreasing landscape connectivity, due to habitat loss and agricultural expansion, is a threat for species movement and other flux-dependent ecological processes. Tree cover within the agricultural matrix provides perching sites, dispersal routes, and extra habitat for animals. Isolated trees and living fences in tropical pastures add structural complexity to actual matrices, but their role in landscape connectivity is undervalued. Our main objective was to assess the potential value of small (<= 1ha) woody patches for maintaining landscape connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes using birds as focal species. We used high-resolution images and LIDAR data to classify different tree cover types. We assess the probability of connectivity for different hypothetical dispersal distances between woody patches, using a graph-theoretic approach and simulating scenarios that differed in tree cover composition. We estimated the impacts and contribution of tree cover class removals on landscape connectivity. The connectivity index increased widely among scenarios with increasing tree cover composition. The highest connectivity value was obtained in the scenario that included all arboreal elements currently present in the matrix. Small wooded patches and isolated trees contributed from 26\% to 59\% to overall connectivity. The presence of small (<= 1ha) patches of tree cover greatly enhance landscape connectivity for animals with low vagility and behavioral limitations on crossing gaps. Isolated trees and living fences play a crucial role in increasing habitat reachability within rural landscapes and ensuring and enhancing connectivity for animals that perform daily-movements at short-distances. The spatial distribution of arboreal elements within landscapes could be optimized to increase connectivity and must be considered in conservation planning.

TI  - Remote Sensing Solutions To Monitor Biotic And Abiotic Dynamics In Coastal Ecosystems
AB  - Land- and seascapes are complex systems heterogeneous in space and variable in time. Land- and seascapes can be characterized by attributes and exchanges of energy and mass between these attributes. Under such conditions the most realistic interpretation of nearshore land- and seascapes is as open systems, with multiple interactions between attributes and environment.Spatial trends of vegetation cover/typology, sediment/soil distribution, and seabed classification could be implemented to obtain detailed classification from both optical and radar satellite data. These are obtained by means of subpixel processing techniques (e.g., spectral mixing analysis). Then, classifications are analyzed in terms of spatial (power law) and temporal (empirical orthogonal function) patterns. The specific added value of the remote sensing mapping methodology can provide an integrated assessment of coastal dynamics, as it allows both environmental and anthropogenic change analysis, giving new insight to the management policy for coastal ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An Overview Of Management And Monitoring Of Harmful Algal Blooms In The Northern Part Of The Persian Gulf And Oman Sea (Hormuzgan Province)
AB  - Algal bloom as a common phenomenon in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman had catastrophic effects on environmental, social, economic, and human health aspects from 2008 to 2009. Since 2008, the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman Ecological Research Institute (PGSOERI) has monitored and managed algal blooms in the Hormuzgan coast along the northern Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Management strategies have included regular monitoring of chlorophyll, water quality, and remote sensing. In this regard, relevant departments and the Regional Organization for Protection of Marine Environment (ROPME) collaborated with each other to prevent and forecast algal blooms. We reviewed historical and current monitoring, mitigation, and management systems of algal blooms in the Hormuzgan coast. In addition, complications and challenges of algal bloom monitoring and management were also discussed. Documenting algal bloom monitoring and research, improving forecasting and modeling of blooms, educating the public and fishermen, developing a cooperative monitoring framework, and controlling pollution input entering the ROPME region are the main challenges of algal bloom management in the Hormuzgan coast. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Evaluate And Analyze Land Cover Change Dynamics, Driving Force And Their Implications To Biodiversity In The Western Escarpment Of The Rift Valley
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) changes are caused by natural and human alterations of the landscape that could largely affect forest biodiversity and the environment. The study aimed to analyze LULC change dynamics and driving forces in the western escarpment of the rift valley of the Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Digital satellite images, which are downloaded from USGS, were analyzed using ERDAS Imagine (14) and Arc GIS 10.2 software and supervised image classification was used to generate LULC classification, accuracy assessment, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Drivers of LULC change were identified and analyzed. Four land classes were identified such as forest, farmland, settlement, and water-wetlands. Settlement and farmlands have increased by 8\% and 6\%, respectively. On the other hand, both forest and water-wetlands decreased by aerial coverage of 9\% and 5\%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the study area was 92.86\%, 94.22\%, and 94.3\% with a kappa value of 0.902, 0.92, and 0.922, respectively. NDVI values ranged between -0.42 and 0.73. Agricultural expansion (31.4\%), expansion of settlement (25.7\%) and Fuelwood collection and Charcoal production (22.9\%) were the main driving forces that affected the biodiversity of the vegetation in the study area. Integrated land use and policy to protect biodiversity loss, forest degradation and climate changes are deemed necessary.

TI  - Analyzing About Sixty Years Of Land-Cover Change And Associated Landscape Fragmentation In Shiretoko Peninsula, Northern Japan
AB  - The aim of this study is to detect and quantify the dominant land cover changes in a human dominated forest site in Northern Japan. Vegetation maps prepared from aerial photos and socioeconomic information were used to define three land cover change trajectories: the rapid cultivation stage (1947-1968), the abandonment stage (1968-1978) and the plantation/reforestation stage (1978-2004). The analysis revealed that in the rapid cultivation stage, the degradation from broadleaved forest to dwarf bamboo brush occurring in more than 3% of the landscape was the only dominant signal of change. In the abandonment stage, the pasture land-dwarf bamboo brush, dwarf bamboo brush-broadleaved forest, and broadleaved forest-conifer-broadleaved forest transitions covering about 18% of the landscape were the dominant change processes. In the plantation stage where the dominant signals of change affected about 27% of the landscape, these three transitions were also observed in addition to pasture and dwarf bamboo brush-conifer plantation transitions. Patch density (PD) increased in the rapid cultivation stage. In spite of natural revegetation and the large-scale reforestation project between 1978 and 2004, the mean patch size of the landscape in 2004 was only 24% of the pre-cultivation era. Mean proximity index (MPI) and interspersion juxtapostition index (IJI) showed contrasting trends, but the latter exhibited high values at extreme values of mean patch size (MPS). The relative ability of other pattern metrics to measure fragmentation of the landscape is highlighted. Prompt mitigation of adverse land change requires close monitoring by land use planners. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring Of Drought In Southwest China Using Random Forest And Extreme Gradient Boosting Methods
AB  - A drought results from the combined action of several factors. The continuous progress of remote sensing technology and the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology have enabled the use of multisource remote sensing data and data-driven machine learning (ML) methods to mine drought features from different perspectives. This method improves the generalization ability and accuracy of drought monitoring and prediction models. The present study focused on drought monitoring in southwest China, where drought disasters occur frequently and with a high intensity, especially in areas with limited meteorological station coverage. Several drought indices were calculated based on multisource satellite remote sensing data and weather station observation data. Remote sensing data from multiple sources were combined to build a reconstructed land surface temperature (LST) and drought monitoring method using the two different ML methods of random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost 1.5.1), respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method was used for the model’s hyperparameter optimization and accuracy evaluation. The performance of the model was also assessed and validated using several accuracy assessment indicators. The model monitored the results of the spatial and temporal distributions of the drought, drought grades, and influence scope of the drought. These results from the model were compared against historical drought situations and those based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the meteorological drought composite index (MCI) values estimated using weather station observation data in southwest China. The results show that the average score of the 5-fold CV for the RF and XGBoost was 0.955 and 0.931, respectively. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the LST values reconstructed using the RF model on the training and test sets was 1.172 and 2.236, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.847 and 1.719, and the explained variance score (EVS) was 0.901 and 0.858, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients (CCs) were all greater than 0.9. The RMSE of the monitoring values using the XGBoost model on the training and test sets was 0.135 and 0.435, the MAE was 0.095 and 0.328, the EVS was 0.976 and 0.782, and the CC was 0.982 and 0.868, respectively. The consistency rate between the drought grades identified using SPEI1 (the SPEI values of the 1-month scale) based on the observed data from the 144 meteorological stations and the monitoring values from the XGBoost model was more than 85%. The overall consistency rate between the drought grades identified using the monitoring and MCI values was 67.88%. The aforementioned two different ML methods achieved a high comprehensive performance, accuracy, and applicability. The constructed model can improve the level of dynamic drought monitoring and prediction for regions with complex terrain and topography and formative factors of climate as well as where weather stations are sparsely distributed. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Site History’s Role In Urban Agriculture: A Case Study In Kisumu, Kenya, And Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) is a widespread practice often considered low-profit, taking place on marginal lands. This is supported by the lack of quantitative data on UA’s contributions to food security and employment, yet contradicted by prevalence and high participation rates. This case study of six UA sites in Kisumu, Kenya and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso explores the relationship between prior land use and current management and soil quality. A soil survey is performed determining the soil macronutrient and soil mineral composition. Agricultural management, ownership, and prior land use are investigated through interviews, satellite imagery, and historic publications. Results show three UA sites predating surrounding urban development, and data on soil nutrient content show that sites likely were chosen for their soil. The three younger sites are smaller and less embedded in the local economy, but soil analysis shows medium-rich to rich agricultural soils. We conclude that one cannot assume that UA is practiced on marginalized soils. Consequently, both value attribution to and the sustainable agricultural management of UA soils must be based on their characteristics, such as mineralogy and nutrient status, to prevent valuable soil resources from being lost. Through this, the more accurate value attribution of UA can be achieved, lending weight to the value attributed to UA by local communities. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Vigilance Behavior In The Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus Histrionicus) During The Preincubation Period In Labrador: Are Males Vigilant For Self Or Social Partner?
AB  - Males of several avian species are more vigilant than their female partners, particularly during the preincubation period. Male vigilance may function as a deterrent of extrapair copulation attempts (EPCs) or to ensure male survival, because males of sexually dimorphic species may be more conspicuous to predators than females. However, vigilant males may act as antipredator sentinels to enhance female survivorship, which may also allow females to feed and rest more efficiently, thereby enhancing their ability to form clutches. We attempted to distinguish between the "male benefits" and "female benefits" hypotheses by studying the behavior of unpaired males and paired Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) during the preincubation period. Paired males were, on average, four times more vigilant than unpaired males and their mates, which suggests that elevated levels of vigilance by paired males does not function primarily for self-protection against predators. Males were not more vigilant during the female's fertile period, contrary to the "paternity assurance" hypothesis. Male vigilance during feeding bouts was highest when pairs fed alone near shore - a condition in which feeding was likely more "risky." Male vigilance was positively correlated with female feeding when females fed near shore, but not at other times. During resting bouts, males were vigilant 14 ± 0.01% of the time in all conditions. We suggest that male vigilance may be important to enhance female survival, especially when females feed under risky conditions. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.

TI  - Variability Of No2 Concentrations Over China And Effect On Air Quality Derived From Satellite And Ground-Based Observations
AB  - The variation of NO2 concentrations in mainland China is analyzed on different timescales, from decadal to weekly, using both satellite data and data from ground-based monitoring networks. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) data were used to study the spatial variations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (TVCDs) over the study area during 16-20 weeks after the Chinese Spring Festival (25 January 2020). These data were used to select 11 regions for more detailed analysis of the variation of NO2 TVCDs on a decadal timescale. In this analysis, monthly and annual averaged NO2 TVCDs derived from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) observations were used for the years 2011 to 2019. The results show the NO2 TVCD trends for different regions, all decreasing in response to emission reduction policies but with a different onset and a possible halt of the decrease in recent years; trends and period in the south of the study area are different from those in the north. Variations of NO2 TVCDs on shorter timescales, monthly and weekly, were analyzed using TROPOMI data. In addition, the variations of weekly-averaged ground-based NO2 concentrations in 11 major cities were analyzed together with those for O3 and PM2:5. In particular these data were used to determine their effect on the air quality as expressed by the air quality index (AQI). For quantitative estimates, the use of weekly concentrations is more accurate than the use of monthly values, and the effects of long-term trends and their reversal needs to be taken into account for the separation of effects of the lockdown and the Spring Festival. Neglecting the possible reversal of the trends leads to overestimation of the lockdown effect in the south and underestimation in the north. The ground-based data confirm earlier reports, based on satellite observations, that the expected improvement of air quality due to the reduction of NO2 concentrations was offset by the increase of the concentrations of O3 and the different effects of the lockdown measures on PM2:5, as well as effects of meteorological influences and heterogeneous chemistry. The AQI seems to be mostly influenced by PM2:5 rather than NO2. A qualitative comparison between time series of satellite and ground-based NO2 observations shows both similarities and differences. The study further shows the different behaviors in city clusters in the north and south of China, as well as inland in the Sichuan and Guanzhong basins. Effects of other holidays and events are small, except in Beijing where the air quality in 2020 was notably better than in previous years. This study was undertaken for China, but the methodology and results have consequences for air quality studies in other areas, and part of the conclusions are generally applicable. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

TI  - Wind Power Assessment In The Caribbean Region Of Colombia, Using Ten-Minute Wind Observations And Era5 Data
AB  - The Caribbean region of Colombia is a strategic source of wind energy for Colombia's economic development. However, current estimates of wind energy potential for this region are based on low-resolution observations from a sparse set of weather stations that falls short of the temporal and spatial scales required by the wind energy sector. We present a novel characterization of the wind resource over the Colombian Caribbean, using 10-min average wind records from 13 meteorological stations and comparing the results with newer ERA5 reanalysis data to generate reliable information for the feasibility and operational stages of wind farms. According to the 10-min observations, average wind speeds in the region are in a 2.2 m s−1 to 8.3 m s− 1 range. Based on Weibull distributions and hourly Wind Power Density (WPD) calculations, we found several locations that offer commercial wind potential, with many having WPD above 800 W m−2. Furthermore, our estimates based on ERA5 show a wide offshore region in the Caribbean with a WPD over 800 W m−2 yearlong. Finally, we calculate the Annual Energy Production (AEP) for the stations with promising potential, obtaining capacity factors around 50%, comparable to those of the most productive wind farms worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Preliminary Regional Flood Damage Investigation
AB  - It is fully realized that absolute immunity from flood damage is not physically possible even in the distant future because of unpredictability of several natural forces which might cause unprecedented situation. Even so, with proper planning and continuous effort we can certainly look forward to an appreciable diminution of distress with an accelerated implementation of flood management measures. It i s commonly accepted that the measures to mitigate flood losses need to be given the most efforts wherein flood damage estimation is the primary measure of mitigation. This has been viewed mainly as a physical method of protection from floods. As a first step, a floodplain of SinNan area is undertaken as the study area that would naturally be affected by flooding in such a way that a river rises above its banks, or high tides and stormy seas cause flooding in coastal areas. Generally the satellite photograph is about 20 × 20 meters and may not yield very precise idea of the measurement. In order to increase the accuracy of measurement, 1/1000 aerial photographs for the study area are made as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with 50 × 50 cms resolution was produced all thru Light Detection And Ranging¡ALiDAR. This DTM is used with a hydraulic model for simulation of flooding extent and depths while a net-work of observation stations where gauges have been installed in order to record river flow, flood depth etc. and then assess its effectiveness. And other available topographic maps have been utilized as well to study direct economic damages. The present position regarding maintenance of rain gauges, recording of rainfall, transmission of data, post-disaster data collection etc., need to be streamlined as use for the regional flood damage assessment of the economic losses such as crops, houses, property, public utilities etc. There is a lot of spatial distributed information involved in and GIS was used in this study to build up geo-database and to do spatial analysis for a more rational algorithm for flood damage assessments. Flood data are crucial for the net-work of this project while typhoon-induced flood events during the summer seasons may be the major contribution. The net-work should come into operation within 9 months in this year and it expects to result in the regional flood damage investigation in SinNan area. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

TI  - Geospatial Modeling Of Heterogeneous Geotechnical Data Using Conventional And Enhanced Conception Of Modified Shepard Method-Based Idw Algorithms: Application And Appraisal
AB  - Characterization and accurate assessment of subsurface soil information from geological and geotechnical perspectives are the major challenges considering urban planning, site selections, and designing preemptive response systems. In this regard, this article deals with the application and appraisal of inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation algorithms for the characterization and development of geotechnical maps (GMs) using a conventional Geographic Information System (GIS) and state-of-the-art Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Unlike GIS, the modified GEE-based IDW algorithm operates on the enhanced conception of the modified Shepard method that adds artificial diffusion and smoothens the prediction surface. Contrarily, GIS-based IDW outcomes steep prediction with compromised accuracy. Besides, GMs performance utilizing GIS- and GEE-based IDW algorithms based on key performance indices (KPIs) is yet to be defined. Soil type, standard penetration test (SPT-N), activity (A-value), and soil consistency are used to develop GMs, which are major geotechnical parameters for foundation design. GIS- and GEE-based IDW interpolation algorithm-based GMs demonstrate distinct variations in the areal coverage of geotechnical categories across the region, ranging between 3 and 5%. GEE-based GMs showed a smooth transition of prediction values. Based on KPIs, GEE-based GMs showed 10–15% less error than GIS and correlated better with field values. Conclusively, the GEE-based IDW interpolation algorithm is more effective in reducing error and exhibits a strong correlation with field values. The study’s findings highlighted the adoption of the enhanced conception of a modified IDW algorithm using the GEE platform due to its better prediction. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Environmental Risk-Based Hydroeconomic Evaluation For Alluvial Aquifer Management In Arid River Basin
AB  - Groundwater has resource, ecology, economy and society attributes. In recent years, ecological degradation caused by intensive groundwater exploitation to support socio-economic development has been of growing concern in arid and semiarid regions. To protect the groundwater sustained ecosystem, this paper developed a novel environmental risk-based hydroeconomic model to evaluate the tradeoff between groundwater utilization and ecological environmental protection in Golmud river catchment of Qaidam basin, a typical inland river watershed and alluvial aquifer, in northwestern China. Field survey, remote sensing and groundwater level monitor were conducted to obtain the threshold of groundwater dependent ecosystem. Results show that depth to groundwater table should be larger than 25.5 m in alluvial plain to prevent downstream Golmud city urban waterlogging, depth to groundwater table should be smaller than 10 m in groundwater overflow zone and fine soil plain to sustain groundwater dependent vegetation survive, and groundwater recharge to the terminal lake should be larger than 282.0 hm(3) yr (1) to maintain the minimum water surface area. Meanwhile, ecosystem services value was established according to equivalent value factors per unit area provided by different types of ecosystem in Golmud river catchment. Numerical simulations model was applied to evaluate the potential environment risk, cost and benefit of ecosystem services under different groundwater demand. The investigation results show that groundwater exploitation in 2030 with 240.9 hm(3) yr (1) will cause environment risk, which is terminal lake surface area smaller than permitted minimum threshold. And the recommended maximum amount of groundwater exploitation is 219.0 hm(3) yr (1). This study provides guidance for regional groundwater management to maintain environment protection and socio-economy development, especially in arid regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil Water Content And High-Resolution Imagery For Precision Irrigation: Maize Yield
AB  - Improvement in water use efficiency of crops is a key component in addressing the increasing global water demand. The time and depth of the soil water monitoring are essential when defining the amount of water to be applied to irrigated crops. Precision irrigation (PI) is a relatively new concept in agriculture, and it provides a vast potential for enhancing water use efficiency, while maintaining or increasing grain yield. Neutron probes (NPs) have consistently been used as a robust and accurate method to estimate soil water content (SWC). Remote sensing derived vegetation indices have been successfully used to estimate variability of Leaf Area Index and biomass, which are related to root water uptake. Crop yield has not been evaluated on a basis of SWC, as explained by NPs in time and at different depths. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the optimal time and depth of SWC and its relationship to maize grain yield (2) to determine if satellite-derived vegetation indices coupled with SWC could further improve the relationship between maize grain yield and SWC. Soil water and remote sensing data were collected throughout the crop season and analyzed. The results from the automated model selection of SWC readings, used to assess maize yield, consistently selected three dates spread around reproductive growth stages for most depths (p value < 0.05). SWC readings at the 90 cm depth had the highest correlation with maize yield, followed closely by the 120 cm. When coupled with remote sensing data, models improved by adding vegetation indices representing the crop health status at V9, right before tasseling. Thus, SWC monitoring at reproductive stages combined with vegetation indices could be a tool for improving maize irrigation management.

TI  - Scenario Analysis For The San Pedro River, Analyzing Hydrological Consequences Of A Future Environment
AB  - Studies of future management and policy options based on different assumptions provide a mechanism to examine possible Outcomes and especially their likely benefits and consequences. The San Pedro River in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico is an area that has undergone rapid changes in land use and cover, and subsequently is facing keen environmental crises related to water resources. It is the location of a number of studies that have dealt with change analysis, watershed condition, and most recently, alternative futures analysis. The previous work has dealt primarily with resources of habitat, visual quality, and groundwater related to urban development patterns and preferences. In the present study, previously defined future scenarios, in the form of land-use/land-cover grids, were examined relative to their impact on surface-water conditions (e.g., surface runoff and sediment yield). These hydrological outputs were estimated for the baseline year of 2000 and predicted twenty years in the future as a demonstration of how new geographic information system-based hydrologic modeling tools can be used to evaluate the spatial impacts of urban growth patterns on surface-water hydrology.

TI  - Biologically Important Areas Ii For Cetaceans In U.s. And Adjacent Waters - Arctic Region
AB  - We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) in the Arctic region. The Arctic region extends from the Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Amundsen Gulf, and Viscount Melville Sound. This NOAA-led effort uses structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of NOAA BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, BIA II products incorporated a scoring and labeling system to improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to support marine spatial planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the development of conservation measures for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for Arctic BIA II came from data derived from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite telemetry; passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification; aboriginal subsistence harvests, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents; and prey studies. BIAs were identified for bowhead (Balaena mysticetus), gray (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. In total, 44 BIAs were delineated and scored for the Arctic, including 12 reproduction, 24 feeding, and 8 migration BIAs. BIAs were identified in all months except January-March. Fifteen candidate areas did not have sufficient information to delineate as BIAs and were added to a watch list for future consideration in the BIA process. Some BIAs were transboundary between the Arctic region and the Aleutian Islands-Bering Sea region. Several BIAs were transnational, extending into territorial waters of Russia (in the Chukchi Sea) and Canada (in the Beaufort Sea), and a few BIAs were delineated in international waters.

TI  - Assessing The Effectiveness Of Land Restoration Interventions In Dry Lands By Multitemporal Remote Sensing - A Case Study In Ouled Dlim (Marrakech, Morocco)
AB  - Atriplex nummularia has been extensively planted in Northern Africa to combat desertification. However, few studies evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions. This study aimed at assessing the dynamic performance of a number of Atriplex plantations located in the Marrakech province in terms of multitemporal dry biomass production. Three SPOT 5 images (2004, 2008 and 2012) and field biomass measurements were integrated to quantify the dry biomass production dynamics of plantations established from 1996 to 2007. Different plant ages covered the whole plant life cycle curve. Vegetation indices were derived from the images and those of 2012 were coupled to the measured biomass of 2012 to formulate biomass models. An analysis of shrub biomass production was conducted in plantations and in adjacent rangelands, covering varying degree of plant development, and an estimate of the economic benefits generated by the plantations in terms of available fodder biomass was performed. The results show that, on average, the plantation sites produced 221 to 361Mgha(-1) of dry biomass more than the surrounding rangelands. The best performing plantations yielded even greater differences, up to more than 7Mgha(-1). It was observed that the most performing plantations, while contributing to mitigating land degradation, have generated economic value and could compensate the economic cost of the intervention even under drought conditions. However, in several cases the plantation performance was far from sustainability, particularly due to poor management (early and/or over grazing), revealing that management is a critical factor for the success of this restoration practice.

TI  - The Impact On The Ecosystem Services Value Of The Ecological Shelter Zone Reconstruction In The Upper Reaches Basin Of The Yangtze River In China
AB  - With regional socio-economic development and increasing population, the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystem environments on the earth's surface have changed markedly. Ecological shelter zone reconstruction (ESZR) is an ecosystem restoration and conservation project, which aims to ensure the safety of the ecological environments of-regions and basins. We selected the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (from Yibin to Chongqing) as the study area and determined the connotation of ESZR. At the same time, the planning scope and construction content of the ecological barrier in this specific region have been preliminarily explored. Meanwhile, a set of related planning methods was proposed, the ecological effects of which were quantitatively assessed and confirmed through the calculation of ESVs. Compared with the conditions in 2005, the study showed that the value of the services of the whole ecosystem augmented significantly under the slope classification, increasing by 103.23\%. At the same time, the land use pattern has been optimized, and the vegetation coverage has been enhanced. The ESZR can effectively improve the ecosystem service function of slope land (mainly slope > 25 degrees) and the regional ecological environment, solve the rocky desertification of the study area and provide an effective decision in relation to supporting regional green sustainable development.

TI  - Analyzing Seasonal Variation In The Vegetation Cover Using Ndvi And Rainfall In The Dry Deciduous Forest Region Of Eastern India
AB  - Ecological viability of the environment has been crucially dependent on the vegetation status of the region across the globe. Climate parameters, namely, rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, evapotranspiration, etc., play essential roles in maintaining the health of the vegetation. Thus analyzing the influence of climate parameters on vegetation is essential to maintain their potentiality and sustainability. In the present study the relationship between rainfall and vegetation status was analyzed in Bankura district of West Bengal. Rainfall data from 1901 to 2018 has been collected from six stations located in the study area using CRU and Swat datasets. Trend-Free Pre-whitening (TFPW) Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen’s slope test were employed in the RStudio to examine the rainfall variability at different stations. Normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI) for different seasons were prepared from Landsat 8 OLI data of 2019. The association between NDVI and TFPW-MK values of rainfall was analyzed through regression to assess the influence of rainfall on vegetation. Results indicated a strong increasing trend in rainfall at an annual scale as well as during monsoonal months and post-monsoonal months. Neither a decreasing nor an increasing trend in rainfall was observed during the summer and winter seasons. Significant variability in vegetation was also identified from the seasonal analysis while a relationship was identified between rainfall and vegetation status indicating the influence of rainfall on vegetation in the study area. The approach used here will be instructive for formulating effective management strategies for planning in the forest-dominated region at various scales. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Analysis Of Urban - Industrial Expansion And Increasing Level Of Ozone Concentration As Subsiding An Environmental Management Plan For The East Of Rio De Janeiro Metropolitan Area - Brazil
AB  - The disorderly growth of metropolitan regions, combined with the lack of efficient air quality management strategies, contributes to the potential increase in O3. That impact might undoubtedly cause harmful and immediate and continuous effects on living organisms. In this sense, the primary objective of this research work is to identify and evaluate the threshold values of the O-3 concentration pattern in the expanded region of the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area (RJMA). Landsat images were retrieved and showed that there was an expansion to the east and west of the RJMA at an average rate of 32 km(2). year(-1). After analyzing the air quality data in the region for the period between 2010 and 2018, excess concentrations of O-3 were registered to occur every month and across all weather seasons, mainly from October to March (spring and summer), concerning air quality standards, There are significant differences in ozone violations between Paqueta weather station (t = 184 days, 53.2 \%) and Porto das Caxias weather station (t = 105 days, 30.2 \%). The annual time series of O-3 violations during the study period was highly variable, with peaks in the years 2012 (14.3 +/- 20.1 violations), 2013 (12.3 +/- 15.7 violations), and 2015 (23 +/- 15.7 violations). Furthermore, there was an increase in the value of surpluses of O-3 along 2016, marked by a longer period of excess concentration from August to March. Despite advances in environmental legislation, air quality management protocols still lack effective measures to mitigate the impacts of O-3 on the environment, which highlights the need for developing timely and additional interdisciplinary investigations in the coming future.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Value Change Analysis Of Chishui River Basin Based On Land Use Change
AB  - Based on the remote sensing interpreted land use data of Chishui River basin in 1990, 1999, 2010 and 2018, the localization-corrected equivalent factor method and GIS spatial analysis techniques were used to analyze the land use change characteristics, the ecosystem services value (ESV) change characteristics and the effects of land use change on the change of ESV. The results showed that the area of cultivated land, grassland and unused land decreased, and the area of construction land, forest land and water increased from 1990 to 2018. The land use transfer was mainly reflected in the mutual flow between cultivated land-forest-grassland and the encroachment of construction land on cultivated land and grassland. From 1990 to 2018, ESV increased from 41.190 billion yuan to 41.354 billion yuan in Chishui River basin, forest land was the main contributing part of ESV, and the increase of water area was the main influencing factor of the increase of ESV. The spatial distribution of ESV showed the characteristics of "high in the middle reaches, low in the upper and lower reaches", and the distribution of high value areas overlapped highly with that of forest land. The continuous expansion of urban construction land caused a decrease in ESV, and forest land and watershed, and cropland and grassland contributed positively and negatively to ESV due to area changes, respectively. The implementation of policies such as the change of population structure between rural and urban areas, the return of farmland to forest and watershed ecological management had promoted an increase to ESV. © 2023 Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology.

TI  - A Scientific Approach To Employ Monitoring And Modelling Techniques For Global Change And Terrestrial Ecosystems And Other Related Projects
AB  - The ultimate goal of understanding processes in the Earth's geophysical/biogeochemical/climate system can be achieved by multi-disciplinary studies using global monitoring systems, regional networks and models merging scientific and technological issues. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and its composite parts-Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS)-are on the agenda of current and subsequent international efforts. To outline scientifically the construction of the systems, an approach is proposed that includes the following interrelated blocks: Climate/Biosphere Models, Observation Systems, Geoinformation Systems and Predictability Problems. The opportunity to unify these blocks in the general context of global/regional change studies are determined by the proposed application of the information and thermodynamic properties of the entropy category that reveals its dualism in the information content assessments for data of modelling/monitoring and in state parameter retrievals for natural targets using multi-spectral remote sensing images. The Climate/Biosphere Models block is designed to highlight how global and regional change problems are drawn up in terms of models, data, and processes for natural media (the atmosphere, hydrosphere, land surface, biosphere). The Observation Systems block, linking modelling and monitoring quantities on various scales, serves to account for recommendations to optimization techniques based on certain criteria, value functions and information content metrics. The recommendations are due to the necessity to improve or make cost-effective the systems which are planned within the EOS (Earth Observing System) and similar other programmes. The Geoinformation Systems (GIS) block gives an explanation to what extent GIS-technologies, databases and information systems can be unified with general principles of data processing, related algorithms and procedures. The Predictability Problems block enables one to understand what can be determined from temporal data set analyses and inter-annual variability of multi-spectral satellite products and samples of ground measurements. A mathematical functional, characterized by the signal/noise ratio in a particular topic area, will elucidate how predictable is the effect of any anomalies in the Earth's global system. Another functional, characterized by the ratio of biomass to temperature for the soil-vegetation system, both parameters being retrieved from regular satellite images, will give the scientific explanation of the stability category of the biosphere under natural and anthropogenic influences in the context of the overall problem of sustainable development. The approach is designed for elaborating a universal tool to study cross-cutting themes of monitoring/modelling in GCTE and other projects concerning global and regional change.

TI  - Pledges For Climate Mitigation: The Effects Of The Copenhagen Accord On Co2 Emissions And Mitigation Costs
AB  - The UN Framework Convention of Climate Change 15th Conference of the Parties Copenhagen Accord has been followed up by national pledges of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the year 2020 without specifying measures to enforce actions. As a consequence, the capacity of parties to fulfil their obligations is of basic interest. This article outlines the effects of full compliance with pledges on greenhouse gas emissions, economic growth, and trade. The study is based on the global computable general equilibrium model global responses to anthropogenic changes in the environment (GRACE) distinguishing between fossil and non-fossil energy use. Global emissions from fossil fuels in 2020 turn out to be 15 % lower than in a business as usual scenario and 3 % below the global emissions from fossil fuels in 2005. China and India increase their emissions to 1 % and 5 % above business as usual levels in 2020. India and Russia increase their net export of steel corresponding to around 30 and 45 % of their production levels in 2020. In spite of some leakage of energy intensive production also to China, we find that structural change remains the dominant factor behind the rapid reduction of CO2 emission intensity in China towards 2020. © 2012 The Author(s).

TI  - Joint Analysis And Weighted Synthesis Sparsity Priors For Simultaneous Denoising And Destriping Optical Remote Sensing Images
AB  - Stripe and random noise are two different degradation phenomena that commonly coexist in optical remote sensing images, and they are often modeled as inverse problems. In model-based inverse problems, analysis and synthesis sparse representations (SSRs) are used as regularization terms to obtain approximate solutions due to their respective merits, i.e., the nonzero coefficients in SSR are usually used to describe an image, while the indexes of zeros in analysis sparse representation (ASR) are used to characterize the stripe. Inspired by these merits, we propose a unified variational framework, called a joint analysis and weighted synthesis (JAWS) sparsity model, to simultaneously separate the clean image and the stripe from a single optical remote sensing image. To solve the JAWS sparsity model efficiently, an alternating minimization optimization strategy is first employed to separate it into two subproblems that are used for different tasks. One called as weighted SSR (WSSR) is the main for optical remote sensing image denoising, which can be effectively solved by employing the weighted singular value thresholding operator, while the other called as ASR is the main approach for optical remote sensing image destriping, which is optimized by adopting the split Bregman iteration. By minimizing the two subproblems alternatively, the proposed JAWS sparsity model is efficiently solved. Finally, both quantitative and qualitative results of experiments on synthetic and real-world optical remote sensing images validate that the proposed approach is effective and even better than the state of the arts.

TI  - Evaluation Of Surveillance Strategies For Bovine Brucellosis In Japan Using A Simulation Model
AB  - Bovine brucellosis is caused by Brucella abortus and induces abortions in female cattle, with other cattle at risk of infection from the aborted fetus or contaminated placenta. In Japan, the number of cases has dramatically reduced due to national surveillance and eradication strategies. Bovine brucellosis is now believed to be eradicated in Japan. Here, we examine the surveillance strategies currently in place for early detection of infected cattle in the event of a future reintroduction of the disease. We compared current serological surveillance for the dairy population with bulk-milk surveillance and abortion surveillance, and used time to detection as the main criterion of surveillance efficacy. A stochastic individual-based model (IBM) was developed to simulate disease transmission within and between farms. Using outputs from the transmission model, a comparison of surveillance strategies was simulated. For evaluation of the robustness of the parameter values used in the transmission model, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. For the purpose of evaluating the direct costs of each surveillance strategy, the annual number of samples to be tested and the annual number of farms to be visited were estimated. Our results indicated that current serological surveillance with 60-month test intervals is not effective enough for rapid detection of a brucellosis outbreak. Bulk-milk surveillance appeared the most effective method based on the early detection of infected cows and a reduced number of samples required. The time to detection for abortion surveillance was greater than that of bulk-milk surveillance but varied widely depending on the reported ratio of abortions. Results from the surveillance model were consistent when alternative scenarios were applied to the transmission model. Although our model cannot exactly replicate an actual brucellosis outbreak, or the results of surveillance, our results may help decision-makers to choose the most effective surveillance strategy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping Continuous Depth Functions Of Soil Carbon Storage And Available Water Capacity
AB  - There is a need for accurate, quantitative soil information for natural resource planning and management. This information shapes the way decisions are made as to how soil resources are assessed and managed. This paper proposes a novel method for whole-soil profile predictions (to 1 m) across user-defined study areas where limited soil information exists. Using the Edgeroi district in north-western NSW as the test site, we combined equal-area spline depth functions with digital soil mapping techniques to predict the vertical and lateral variations of carbon storage and available water capacity (AWC) across the 1500 km(2) area. Neural network models were constructed for both soil attributes to model their relationship with a suite of environmental factors derived from a digital elevation model, radiometric data and Landsat imagery. Subsequent fits of the models resulted in an R-2 of 44\% for both carbon and AWC. For validation at selected model depths, R-2 values ranged between 20 and 27\% for carbon prediction (RMSE: 0.30-0.52 log (kg/m(3))) and between 8 and 29\% for AWC prediction (RMSE: 0.01 m/m). Visually, reconstruction of splines at selected validation data points indicated an average fit with raw data values. In order to improve upon our model and validation results there is a need to address some of the structural and metrical uncertainties identified in this study. Nevertheless, the resulting geo-database of quantitative soil information describing its spatial and vertical variations is an example of what can be generated with this proposed methodology. We also demonstrate the functionality of this geo-database in terms of data enquiry for user-defined queries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonality Of Vegetation Types Of South America Depicted By Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) Time Series
AB  - The development, implementation and enforcement of policies involving the rational use of the land and the conservation of natural resources depend on an adequate characterization and understanding of the land cover, including its dynamics. This paper presents an approach for monitoring vegetation dynamics using high-quality time series of MODIS surface reflectance data by generating fraction images using Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) over South America continent. The approach uses physically-based fraction images, which highlight target information and reduce data dimensionality. Further dimensionality was also reduced by using the vegetation fraction images as input to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The RGB composite of the first three PCA components, accounting for 92.9\% of the dataset variability, showed good agreement with the main ecological regions of South America continent. The analysis of 21 temporal profiles of vegetation fraction values and precipitation data over South America showed the ability of vegetation fractions to represent phenological cycles over a variety of environments. Comparisons between vegetation fractions and precipitation data indicated the close relationship between water availability and leaf mass/chlorophyll content for several vegetation types. In addition, phenological changes and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic pressure were identified, particularly those associated with agricultural practices and forest removal. Therefore the proposed method supports the management of natural and non-natural ecosystems, and can contribute to the understanding of key conservation issues in South America, including deforestation, disturbance and fire occurrence and management.

TI  - Deforestation And Economic Growth Trends On Oceanic Islands Highlight The Need For Meso-Scale Analysis And Improved Mid-Range Theory In Conservation
AB  - Forests both support biodiversity and provide a wide range of benefits to people at multiple scales. Global and national remote sensing analyses of drivers of forest change generally focus on broad-scale influences on area (composition), ignoring arrangement (configuration). To explore meso-scale relationships, we compared forest composition and configuration to six indicators of economic growth over 23 years (1992-2015) of satellite data for 23 island nations. Based on global analyses, we expected to find clear relationships between economic growth and forest cover. Eleven islands lost 1 to 50\% of forest cover, eight gained 1 to 28\%, and four remained steady. Surprisingly, we found no clear relationship between economic growth trends and forest-cover change trajectories. These results differ from those of global land-cover change analyses and suggest that conservation-oriented policy and management approaches developed at both national and local scales are ignoring key meso-scale processes.

TI  - Systematic Monitoring Of Heathy Woodlands In A Mediterranean Climate - A Practical Assessment Of Methods
AB  - Practical and useful vegetation monitoring methods are needed, and data compatibility and validation of remotely sensed data are desirable. Methods have not been adequately tested for heathy woodlands. We tested the feasibility of detecting species composition shifts in remnant woodland in South Australia, comparing historical (1986) plot data with temporal replicates (2010). We compared the uniformity of species composition among spatially scattered versus spatially clustered plots. At two sites, we compared visual and point-intercept estimation of cover and species diversity. Species composition (presence/absence) shifted between 1986 and 2010. Species that significantly shifted in frequency had low cover. Observations of decreasing species were consistent with predictions from temperature response curves (generalised additive models) for climate change over the period. However, long-term trends could not be distinguished from medium-term dynamics or short-term changes in visibility from this dataset. Difficulties were highlighted in assessing compositional change using historical baselines established for a different purpose in terms of spatial sampling and accuracy of replicate plots, differences in standard plot methods and verification of species identifications. Spatially clustered replicate plots were more similar in species composition than spatially scattered plots, improving change detection potential but decreasing area of inference. Visual surveys detected more species than point-intercepts. Visual cover estimates differed little from point-intercepts although underestimating cover in some instances relative to intercepts. Point-intercepts provide more precise cover estimates of dominant species but took longer and were difficult in steep, heathy terrain. A decision tree based on costs and benefits is presented assessing monitoring options based on data presented. The appropriate method is a function of available resources, the need for precise cover estimates versus adequate species detection, replication and practical considerations such as access and terrain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - An Insightful Metric For Evaluating Perceived Benefits From Water Quality Enhancement In Waterscape Parks: A Behavioral Analysis Approach
AB  - The rational evaluation of pollution control measures is crucial for advancing water pollution management, ensuring water quality, and creating high-standard urban environments. Currently the evaluation heavily relies on water quality indicators with little regard to the sense of gain of the people. In this paper, we proposed an objective indicator PVH (Park Visiting Hours) to represent the behavioral response, as a materialized sense of humans, to water quality. We demonstrated the application of PVH in four typical waterscape parks in Beijing with multi-source data, and the results showed that: (1) The Mann-Kendall Test and an independent correlation test utilizing Sina Weibo data (Chinese Twitter) indicated that PVH was significantly negatively correlated with the Satellite image based Sensory Pollution Index (SPI), as corroborated the competence of PVH to appraise the sense of gain from water quality improvement. (2) Multivariate regressions showed that an increase in SPI of 0.1 corresponds to an average 8.8 min reduction in PVH. (3) The relationship between PVH and SPI was consistent across various visitor demographics, and whether visitors were in groups or alone. This study introduced PVH as a novel but concise indicator to represent water quality-related behavior of park visitors and would inspire the use of big multisource data for measuring human perceptions of ecosystem services.

TI  - Pipeline Right-Of-Way Encroachment In Arepo, Nigeria
AB  - Encroachment by host communities on pipeline right-of-way (PROW) constitutes a major problem for the oil and gas sector of the economy. This paper uses remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to assess the level of vulnerability of people living along the PROW in Arepo, Ogun State, Nigeria. A satellite imagery of the community was acquired and processed using ArcGIS computer software. A GIS buffering operation was performed on the PROW using 15 m, 30 m, 60 m, and 90 m distances, respectively. Three hundred and forty buildings were identified in the buffered zones, out of which 200 (60\%) were randomly selected for the study. A structured questionnaire was administered to household heads in the sampled buildings. Empirical analysis shows that 140 buildings (70\%) observed less than a 30 m setback to the pipeline. Also, residents benefit from incidents of oil spillage and see these as an avenue to vandalize the pipeline, making them more vulnerable. GIS analysis shows that more than 30\% of respondents are highly vulnerable to the hazard of pipeline explosion incidents. Enforcement of setback regulations by the Town Planning Authority and public education and awareness of risks associated with encroachment on the PROW are canvassed among others.

TI  - A New Robust And Secure 3-Level Digital Image Watermarking Method Based On G-Bat Hybrid Optimization
AB  - This contribution applies tools from the information theory and soft computing (SC) paradigms to the embedding and extraction of watermarks in aerial remote sensing (RS) images to protect copyright. By the time 5G came along, Internet usage had already grown exponentially. Regarding copyright protection, the most important responsibility of the digital image watermarking (DIW) approach is to provide authentication and security for digital content. In this paper, our main goal is to provide authentication and security to aerial RS images transmitted over the Internet by the proposal of a hybrid approach using both the redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) and the singular value decomposition (SVD) schemes for DIW. Specifically, SC is adopted in this work for the numerical optimization of critical parameters. Moreover, 1-level RDWT and SVD are applied on digital cover image and singular matrices of LH and HL sub-bands are selected for watermark embedding. Further selected singular matrices (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) are split into (Formula presented.) non-overlapping blocks, and diagonal positions are used for watermark embedding. Three-level symmetric encryption with low computational cost is used to ensure higher watermark security. A hybrid grasshopper–BAT (G-BAT) SC-based optimization algorithm is also proposed in order to achieve high quality DIW outcomes, and a broad comparison against other methods in the state-of-the-art is provided. The experimental results have demonstrated that our proposal provides high levels of imperceptibility, robustness, embedding capacity and security when dealing with DIW of aerial RS images, even higher than the state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Mapping Temperate Forest Tree Species Using Dense Sentinel-2 Time Series
AB  - Precise information on tree species composition is critical for forest management and conservation, but mapping tree species with satellite data over large areas is still a challenge. Since 2017, Sentinel-2A/B provide multispectral time series with global coverage at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This is a new opportunity for mapping tree species over large areas that has not yet been fully explored. Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution, Sentinel-2 time series improve the characterization of vegetation phenology and canopy structure, parameters that are intrinsically linked to tree species. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a Sentinel-2 time-series based approach for mapping tree species in a temperate forest region in Central Europe. Using stand-wise forest inventory data for single species stands we assess how well main and minor tree species can be mapped, and if the addition of environmental variables and spatial texture metrics improves the classification accuracy. Our time series approach utilizes all available Sentinel-2 observations and an ensemble of radial basis convolution filters to build cloud-free 5-day time series for each spectral band. The time series are then used as input features to classify seventeen tree species. Our results show the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series based classification, but they also show the challenges associated with mapping a diverse portfolio of tree species. Accuracy of the nine main species, with an area proportion greater than 0.5\%, ranged between 98.9\% and 66.8\%, which is promising for a large area. Adding detailed environmental data and texture metrics to the spectral model only marginally increased the accuracy of a few minor tree species. Overall, the eight minor tree species with area proportions less than 0.5\% were most strongly affected by classification errors. Although the absolute mapped area of minor species correlated well with the estimated reference area, the small class areas of minor species lead to high classification errors in relative terms. Mapping minor tree species is challenging for statistical reasons (i.e., class imbalance, small sample size and class variance). Using all available Sentinel-2 data allows building dense time series at high spatial resolution that are mandatory for improved tree species mapping. We were able to show that the spectral time series is the prime explanatory information, even when complementing our analyses with texture information and various environmental data. The results suggest that with the applied data harmonization approach precise regional tree species mapping is feasible.

TI  - Stable Isotope Ecology Of Terra Preta In Caxiuanã National Forest, Brazil
AB  - The Amazon Basin currently hosts the world’s largest pool of terrestrial biodiversity and prior to European colonization of the Americas there were large human communities living in parkland ecosystems. We examine the formation of archaeological sites in the northeast sector of the Caxiuanã National Forest (CNF) using light stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon, total carbon and nitrogen and Optically Stimulated Luminescence to characterize long-term human landscape management practices. Previous research in the CNF has documented differences in pH, calcium, total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) between terra preta and terra marrom contexts as well as different forest structures based on remote sensing analysis. Therefore, we adopt a comparative approach, examining the formation processes of on-site (terra preta), near-site (terra marrom) and offsite (latosol) contexts. TOC and TN values obtained in our study augment and support previous research demonstrating significantly higher on-site values relative to near-site and off-site. However, the stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) assayed from terra preta, terra marrom and latosols show statistically overlapping values, indicating the persistence of closed canopy in off-site and near-site contexts and the use of this canopy in the formation of on-site soils (terra preta). Our results corroborate the hypothesis that closed canopy ecosystems and human settlements persisted in the Amazon for thousands of years and formed the foundation of the region’s rich biodiversity.

TI  - Drought Monitoring And Its Effects On Vegetation And Water Extent Changes Using Remote Sensing Data In Urmia Lake Watershed, Iran
AB  - The assessment of drought hazards is important due to their socio-economic impacts on water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems. In this study, the effects of drought on changing water area and canopy of the Lake Urmia watershed in the northwest of Iran have been monitored and evaluated. For this purpose, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated in short and medium periods (1-month and 3-month) to determine the dry-spell periods in the Lake Urmia basin. In reviewing this analysis, the annual average has been examined and evaluated. Furthermore, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and remote sensing data were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Temperature–Vegetation–Dryness Index (TVDI) to identify the area of water body, water level, and vegetation changes during 20 years (2000–2020). The Pearson correlation coefficient was also employed to explore the relationship between the drought and the remote sensing-derived indices. According to the results of drought analysis, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 had experienced dry spells in the Lake Urmia basin. The NDWI changes also showed that the maximum area of the Lake Urmia happened in 2000, and its minimum was recorded in 2014. The variation of NDVI values showed that the highest values of vegetation cover were estimated to be 2,850 km2 in.2000, and its lowest value was 1,300 km2 in.2014. The maximum EVI and TDVI were calculated in 2000, while their minimum was observed in 2012 and 2014. Also, the correlation analysis showed that the SPI had the highest correlation with NDVI. Meanwhile, 1-month SPI had a higher correlation than the 3-month SPI with NDVI and EVI. As a concluding remark, NDVI and NDWI were more suitable indices to monitor the changes in vegetation and drought-related water area. The results can be used to make sound decisions regarding the rapid assessment of remote sensing-derived data and water-related indices. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Locating Potential Zones For Cultivating Stevia Rebaudiana In Mexico: Weighted Linear Combination Approach
AB  - In order to search for alternative sweeteners for human beings, researchers are recently focusing their attention to find natural sweeteners that have low caloric values and are highly beneficial for the health. Stevia rebaudiana is one of the alternative crops as it produces steviol glycosides with high intense sweeteners. This study introduces a novel application of weighted linear combination approach at pixel level for locating potential zones for cultivating the S. rebaudiana in the Huasteca Potosina region of Mexico. Climatic, topography, soil conditions as well as the proximity to roads for transporting the product were considered the essential requirements for this crop, while soil type and the available land obtained from a classification of Landsat imagery (2014) and Boolean land-use constraints were investigated as spatial constraints. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the stability of outcomes under two approaches: equal weights for the factors and different weights obtained from experts. The results revealed that the area with very high land suitability determined by the expert judgment approach is decreasing which in turns impose restrictions on the cropping of S. rebaudiana. Therefore, this research allowed determining land suitability at pixel level for cultivating S. rebaudiana in the Huasteca Potosina region at the spatial resolution of 30 m.

TI  - Development Of The Metropolitan Water Availability Index (Mwai) And Short-Term Assessment With Multi-Scale Remote Sensing Technologies
AB  - Global climate change will influence environmental conditions including temperature, surface radiation, soil moisture, and sea level, and it will also significantly impact regional-scale hydrologic processes such as evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation, runoff, and snowmelt. The quantity and quality of water available for drinking and other domestic usage is also likely to be affected by changes in these processes. Consequently, it is necessary to assess and reflect upon the challenges ahead for water infrastructure and the general public in metropolitan regions. One approach to the problem is to use index-based assessment, forecasting and planning. The drought indices previously developed were not developed for domestic water supplies, and thus are insufficient for the purpose of such an assessment. This paper aims to propose and develop a "Metropolitan Water Availability Index (MWAI)" to assess the status of both the quantity and quality of available potable water sources diverted from the hydrologic cycle in a metropolitan region. In this approach, the accessible water may be expressed as volume per month or week (i.e., m(3)/month or m(3)/week) relative to a prescribed historical record, and such a trend analysis may result in final MWAI values ranging from 1 to +1 for regional water management decision making. The MWAI computation uses data and information from both historical point measurements and spatial remote-sensing based monitoring. Variables such as precipitation, river discharge, and water quality changes at drinking water plant intakes at specific locations are past "point" measurements in MWAI calculations. On the other hand, remote sensing provides information on both spatial and temporal distributions of key variables. Examples of remote-sensing images and sensor network technologies are in-situ sensor networks, ground-based radar, air-borne aircraft, and even space-borne satellites. A case study in Tampa Bay, Florida is described to demonstrate the short-term assessment of the MWAI concept at a practical level. It is anticipated that such a forecasting methodology may be extended for middle-term and long-term water supply assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - National Redd+ Implications For Tenured Indigenous Communities In Guyana, And Communities' Impact On Forest Carbon Stocks
AB  - Early project-level initiatives of 'reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation' (REDD+) have left a negative impression among many forest-dependent peoples (FDP) across the tropics. As countries move towards national-level implementation and results-based payments, it is timely to analyze the effects of 'national REDD+' on FDP. We use Guyana's technically approved United Nations Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) submission and Opt-In Mechanism to assess how fifteen indigenous communities with tenured forestland may financially benefit from national REDD+, and evaluate whether, and to what extent, Guyana forms a best-case scenario. In addition, we provide a first-time assessment whether field estimates of the average carbon density of mature forests managed by fifteen forest-dependent communities (beyond rotational farming lands) equals that of nearby unmanaged mature forest, as this could affect REDD+ payment levels. We conclude that, notwithstanding some pending issues, Guyana's national REDD+ program could be very beneficial for FDP, even under a modest United States (US) $5 unit carbon price. We present economic evidence to support forest governance change domestically in sovereign developing countries that may ease FDP tenure and national REDD+ implementation. The average carbon density was locally substantially less in FDP-managed forest, but had little effect on the overall carbon stock of the titled forest area, and is considered modest when incorporating ecological and socioeconomic attributes. Partnerships with FDP when combined with advances in remote sensing could have potential for economic monitoring of forest emissions across the tropics. © 2018 by the author.

TI  - Dynamics Of Forage And Land Cover Changes In Teltele District Of Borana Rangelands, Southern Ethiopia: Using Geospatial And Field Survey Data
AB  - Background: The gradual conversion of rangelands into other land use types is one of the main challenges affecting the sustainable management of rangelands in Teltele. This study aimed to examine the changes, drivers, trends in land use and land cover (LULC), to determine the link between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and forage biomass and the associated impacts of forage biomass production dynamics on the Teltele rangelands in Southern Ethiopia. A Combination of remote sensing data, field interviews, discussion and observations data were used to examine the dynamics of LULC between 1992 and 2019 and forage biomass production. Results: The result indicate that there is a marked increase in farm land (35.3%), bare land (13.8%) and shrub land (4.8%), while the reduction found in grass land (54.5%), wet land (69.3%) and forest land (10.5%). The larger change in land observed in both grassland and wetland part was observed during the period from 1995-2000 and 2015-2019, this is due to climate change impact (El-Niño) happened in Teltele rangeland during the year 1999 and 2016 respectively. The quantity of forage in different land use/cover types, grass land had the highest average amount of forage biomass of 2092.3 kg/ha, followed by wetland with 1231 kg/ha, forest land with 1191.3 kg/ha, shrub land with 180 kg/ha, agricultural land with 139.5 kg/ha and bare land with 58.1 kg/ha. Conclusions: The significant linkage observed between NDVI and LULC change types (when a high NDVI value, the LULC changes also shows positive value or an increasing trend). In addition, NDVI value directly related to the greenness status of vegetation occurred on each LULC change types and its value directly linkage forage biomass production pattern with grassland land use types. 64.8% (grass land), 43.3% (agricultural land), 75.1% (forest land), 50.6% (shrub land), 80.5% (bare land) and 75.5% (wet land) more or higher dry biomass production in the wet season compared to the dry season. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Fine-Resolution Forest Height Estimation By Integrating Icesat-2 And Landsat 8 Oli Data With A Spatial Downscaling Method For Aboveground Biomass Quantification
AB  - Rapid and accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) with fine details is crucial for effective forest monitoring and management, where forest height plays a key role in AGB quantification. In this study, we propose a random forest (RF)-based down-scaling method to map forest height and biomass at a 15-m resolution by integrating Landsat 8 OLI and Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) LiDAR data. ICESat-2 photon data are used to derive canopy parameters along 15-m segments, which are considered sample plots for the extrapolation of discrete forest height. Fourteen variables associated with spectral features, textual features and vegetation index are extracted from pan-sharpened Landsat 8 images. A regression function is established between these variables and ICESat-2-derived forest height to produce a 15-m continuous forest height distribution data based on the 30-m forest height product using the RF algorithm. Finally, a wall-to-wall forest AGB at 15-m spatial resolution is achieved by using an allometric model specific to the forest type and height. The Jilin Province in northeast China is taken as the study area, and the forest AGB estimation results reveal a density of 61.15 Mg/ha with a standard deviation of 89.46 Mg/ha. The (Formula presented.) between our predicted forest heights and the ICESat-2-derived heights reaches 0.93. Validation results at the county scale demonstrate reasonable correspondence between the estimated AGB and reference data, with consistently high (Formula presented.) value exceeding 0.65. This downscaling method provides a promising scheme to estimate spatial forest AGB with fine details and to enhance the accuracy of AGB estimation, which may facilitate carbon stock measurement and carbon cycle studies. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Identification Of Invasive Trees In A Brazilian Subtropical Forest Using Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems And Machine Learning
AB  - We aimed to combine the use of images obtained from remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and machine learning (ML) to identify the invasive alien species Psidium guajava in a protected area in southern Brazil. Field data were obtained in a sampling area, where the species' geographic coordinates were collected with a global positioning system device. Remote data were collected with the Parrot Sequoia (R) multispectral camera onboard the Phantom 4 (R) Pro platform. Image processing was used to generate reflectance maps and vegetation indices, after which four classes of interest were defined for model training. The supervised classification involved two approaches (pixel-based-BP and object-based image analysis-OBIA) and two ML algorithms compared (random forest-RF and support vector machine-SVM). For performance analysis, confusion matrices with user and producer accuracies, Kappa values and overall accuracy (OA) were calculated. The results demonstrate that the multispectral composition was excellent in identifying the invasive P. guajava, in an OBIA approach with the RF algorithm (0.90 Kappa and 93\% OA). Thus, considering the priority of biodiversity conservation and the importance of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest for the maintenance of endemic and endangered species, we present a robust methodology to identify the invasive species P. guajava in subtropical forest, which can be applied in management strategies for the species control and eradication.(c) 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Towards An Automated Sar-Based Flood Monitoring System: Lessons Learned From Two Case Studies
AB  - This paper aims at contributing to the elaboration of new concepts for an efficient and standardized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based monitoring of floods. Algorithms that enable an automatic delineation of flooded areas are an essential component of any SAR-based monitoring service but are to date quasi non-existent. Here we propose a hybrid methodology, which combines radiometric thresholding and region growing as an approach enabling the automatic, objective and reliable flood extent extraction from SAR images. The method relies on the calibration of a statistical distribution of 'open water' backscatter values inferred from SAR images of floods. A radiometric thresholding provides the seed region for a subsequent region growing process. Change detection is included as an additional step that limits over-detection of inundated areas. Two variants of the proposed flood extraction algorithm (with and without integration of reference images) are tested against four state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The methods are evaluated through two case studies: the July 2007 flood of the Severn river (UK) and the February 1997 flood of the Red river (US). Our trial cases show that considering a reference pre- or post-flood image gives the same performance as optimized manual approaches. This encouraging result indicates that the proposed method may indeed outperform all manual approaches if no training data are available and the parameters associated with these methods are determined in a non-optimal way. The results further demonstrate the algorithm's potential for accurately processing data from different SAR sensors. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Study On The Building Height Estimation And Accuracy Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
AB  - In order to accommodate the increase in urban population due to government-led national planning and economic growth, many buildings such as houses and business building were supplied. Although the building law was revised and managed to manage the supplied buildings, for the sake of economic benefit, there have been buildings that are enlarged or reconstructed without declaring building permits. In order to manage these buildings, on-site surveys were conducted. but it has many personnel consumption. To solve this problem, a method of using a satellite image and a manned aircraft is utilized, but it is diseconomical and a renewal cycle is long. In addition, it is not utilized to the height, and although it is judged by the shading of the building, it has limitations that it must be calculated individually. In this study, height of the building was calculated by using the unmanned aerial vehicle with low personnel consumption, and the accuracy was verified by comparison with the building register and measured value. In this study, spatial information was constructed using a fast unmanned aerial vehicle with low manpower consumption and the building height was calculated based on this. The accuracy by comparing the calculated building height with the building register and the actual measurement. © 2020, Architectural Institute of Korea. All rights reserved.

TI  - Value-Centric Framework And Pareto Optimality For Design And Acquisition Of Communication Satellites
AB  - Investments in space systems are substantial, indivisible, and irreversible, characteristics of high-risk investments. Traditional approaches to system design, acquisition, and risk mitigation are derived from a cost-centric mindset, and as such they incorporate little information about the value of the spacecraft to its stakeholders. These traditional approaches are appropriate in stable environments. However, the current technical and economic conditions are distinctly uncertain and rapidly changing. Consequently, these traditional approaches have to be revisited and adapted to the current context. We propose that in uncertain environments, decision-making with respect to design and acquisition choices should be value-based. We develop a value-centric framework, analytical tools, and an illustrative numerical example for communication satellites. Our two proposed metrics for decision-making are the system's expected value and value uncertainty. Expected value is calculated as the expected NPV of the satellite. The cash inflow is calculated as a function of the satellite loading, its transponder pricing, and market demand. The cash outflows are the various costs for owning and operating the satellite. Value uncertainty emerges due to uncertainties in the various cash flow streams, in particular because of market conditions. We propagate market uncertainty through Monte Carlo simulation, and translate it into value uncertainty for the satellite. The end result is a portfolio of Pareto-optimal satellite design alternatives. By using value and value uncertainty as decision metrics in the down-selection process, decision-makers draw on more information about the system in its environment, and in making value-based design and acquisition choices, they ultimately make more informed and better choices.

TI  - Evaluating Sustainability Of Wetland System: A Case Study In East Dongting Lake Area, China
AB  - The functions of wetlands are of significant value to social economy and ecology. However, in the past 50 years, wetlands in China have suffered severely from development pressure and are confronted with the threats of area loss. In recent years, assessment of wetland resources has aroused enormous attention, since it can further protect wetland resources and provide scientific basis for decision-makers. In this paper, wetland ecosystems are studied in terms of its ecological, social, and economic benefits, and integrated assessment system of the sustainability of the wetland resources of East Dongting Lake Nature Reserve has been built, adopting DELPHI method, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and PSR model. First, an index system of integrated assessment of wetland resources was constructed, and the indexes involve the following five aspects, ecological environment, safeguard system, reasonable utilization of wetlands, social culture and economic system. An index system of integrated assessment for wetland resources established was composed of 5 subsystems, with 34 indicators involved. By conducting field investigation in East Dongting Lake and by performing remote sensing data processing, an integrated assessment score of 1.035 was given to East Dongting Lake. Finally, a general analysis of the study area was given and a few countermeasures were suggested.

TI  - Remote Sensing In The Coming Decade: The Vision And The Reality
AB  - Investment in understanding the Earth pays off twice. It enables pursuit of scientific questions that rank among the most interesting and profound of our time. It also serves society's practical need for increased prosperity and security. Over the last half-century, we have built a sophisticated network of satellites, aircraft, and ground-based remote sensing systems to provide raw information from which we derive Earth knowledge. This network has served us well in the development of science and the provision of operational services. In the next decade, the demand for such information will grow dramatically. New remote sensing capabilities will emerge. Rapid evolution of Internet geospatial and location-based services will make communication and sharing of Earth knowledge easier. Governments, businesses, and consumers will all benefit. But this exciting future is threatened from many directions. Risks range from technology and market uncertainties in the private sector to budget cuts and project setbacks in the public sector. The coming decade will see a dramatic confrontation between the vision of what needs to be accomplished in Earth remote sensing and the reality of our resources and commitment. The outcome will have long-term implications for both the remote sensing community and society as a whole.

TI  - Semantic Conceptual Framework For Environmental Monitoring And Surveillance-A Case Study On Forest Fire Video Monitoring And Surveillance
AB  - This paper presents a semantic conceptual framework and definition of environmental monitoring and surveillance and demonstrates an ontology implementation of the framework. This framework is defined in a mathematical formulation and is built upon and focused on the notation of observation systems. This formulation is utilized in the analysis of the observation system. Three taxonomies are presented, namely, the taxonomy of (1) the sampling method, (2) the value format and (3) the functionality. The definition of concepts and their relationships in the conceptual framework clarifies the task of querying for information related to the state of the environment or conditions related to specific events. This framework aims to make the observation system more queryable and therefore more interactive for users or other systems. Using the proposed semantic conceptual framework, we derive definitions of the distinguished tasks of monitoring and surveillance. Monitoring is focused on the continuous assessment of an environment state and surveillance is focused on the collection of all data relevant for specific events. The proposed mathematical formulation is implemented in the format of the computer readable ontology. The presented ontology provides a general framework for the semantic retrieval of relevant environmental information. For the implementation of the proposed framework, we present a description of the Intelligent Forest Fire Video Monitoring and Surveillance system in Croatia. We present the implementation of the tasks of monitoring and surveillance in the application domain of forest fire management.

TI  - Comprehensive Urban Space Representation With Varying Numbers Of Street-Level Images
AB  - Street-level imagery has emerged as a valuable tool for observing large-scale urban spaces with unprecedented detail. However, previous studies have been limited to analyzing individual street-level images. This approach falls short in representing the characteristics of a spatial unit, such as a street or grid, which may contain varying numbers of street-level images ranging from several to hundreds. As a result, a more comprehensive and representative approach is required to capture the complexity and diversity of urban environments at different spatial scales. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning-based module called Vision-LSTM, which can effectively obtain vector representation from varying numbers of street-level images in spatial units. The effectiveness of the module is validated through experiments to recognize urban villages, achieving reliable recognition results (overall accuracy: 91.6%) through multimodal learning that combines street-level imagery with remote sensing imagery and social sensing data. Compared to existing image fusion methods, Vision-LSTM demonstrates significant effectiveness in capturing associations between street-level images. The proposed module can provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban spaces, enhancing the research value of street-level imagery and facilitating multimodal learning-based urban research.

TI  - Remote Monitoring And Consultation Of Inpatient Populations With Diabetes
AB  - Purpose of Review: Inpatient hyperglycemia is common and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality. We review current and innovative ways diabetes specialists consult in the management of inpatient diabetes. Recent Findings: With electronic medical records (EMRs), remote monitoring and intervention may improve the management of inpatient hyperglycemia. Automated reports allow monitoring of glucose levels and allow diabetes teams to intervene through formal or remote consultation. Summary: Following a 2-year transition of our complex paper-based insulin order sets to be EMR based, we leveraged this change by developing new daily glycemic reports and a virtual glucose management service (vGMS). Based on a daily report identifying patients with two or more glucoses over 225 mg/dl and/or a glucose <70 mg/dl in the past 24 h, a vGMS note with management recommendations was placed in the chart. Following the introduction of the vGMS, the proportion of hyperglycemic patients decreased 39% from a baseline of 6.5 per 100 patient-days to 4.0 per 100 patient-days The hypoglycemia proportion decreased by 36%. Ninety-nine percent of surveyed medical and surgical residents said the vGMS was both important and helpful. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Modeling Climate-Smart Forest Management And Wood Use For Climate Mitigation Potential In Maryland And Pennsylvania
AB  - State and local governments are increasingly interested in understanding the role forests and harvested wood products play in regional carbon sinks and storage, their potential contributions to state-level greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, and the interactions between GHG reduction goals and potential economic opportunities. We used empirically driven process-based forest carbon dynamics and harvested wood product models in a systems-based approach to project the carbon impacts of various forest management and wood utilization activities in Maryland and Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2100. To quantify state-wide forest carbon dynamics, we integrated forest inventory data, harvest and management activity data, and remotely-sensed metrics of land-use change and natural forest disturbances within a participatory modeling approach. We accounted for net GHG emissions across (1) forest ecosystems (2) harvested wood products, (3) substitution benefits from wood product utilization, and (4) leakage associated with reduced in-state harvesting activities. Based on state agency partner input, a total of 15 management scenarios were modeled for Maryland and 13 for Pennsylvania, along with two climate change impact scenarios and two bioenergy scenarios for each state. Our findings show that both strategic forest management and wood utilization can provide substantial climate change mitigation potential relative to business-as-usual practices, increasing the forest C sink by 29\% in Maryland and 38\% in Pennsylvania by 2030 without disrupting timber supplies. Key climate-smart forest management activities include maintaining and increasing forest extent, fostering forest resiliency and natural regeneration, encouraging sustainable harvest practices, balancing timber supply and wood utilization with tree growth, and preparing for future climate impacts. This study adds to a growing body of work that quantifies the relationships between forest growth, forest disturbance, and harvested wood product utilization, along with their collective influence on carbon stocks and fluxes, to identify pathways to enhance forest carbon sinks in support of state-level net-zero emission targets.

TI  - A Regional Model To Predict The Occurrence Of Natural Events: Application To Phytoplankton Blooms In Continental Waterbodies
AB  - There are significant social, economic and environmental costs related to phytoplankton blooms, particularly when they are dominated by cyanobacteria. However, the climatic, physiographic and morphological drivers involved in bloom phenology create complex spatiotemporal patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition, making monitoring and forecasting challenging. This complexity also limits the ability of process-based algorithms to model bloom phenology. Stochastic approaches and predictive modelling are valuable risk management tools for natural events. This paper presents a novel model to estimate the conditional density of phytoplankton blooms based on environmental covariates, namely the physiography and climate descriptors of lake watersheds. The goal was to provide a tool to project future scenarios of bloom phenology in response to climate change and anthropogenic developments, and to test the efficiency of mitigating approaches. Specifically, we developed a non-stationary regional model to estimate the probability of bloom occurrence in 580 lakes in Quebec, Canada, and to study the impact of physiographic or climate changes over our reference period and future horizons. Results show that the regional model is more precise and accurate than local models, which are usually used in frequency analyses of extreme values. Simulations conducted for different climatic and physiographic scenarios on the watershed of Lake Brome indicate a 65\% increase in bloom frequency on the horizon of years 2080-2100. The model also evaluates the effects of different environmental disturbances on bloom phenology, such as agriculture or settlement increase in the watershed. Disturbance case studies were carried out on lakes with different trophic levels, physiographic and climatic characteristics. Simulations indicate that bloom frequency in a highly urbanized meso-eutrophic lake (Lake Brome) and a eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by agriculture (Missisquoi Bay) would be more responsive to changes in climate rather than land cover, although physiographic disturbances would still generate considerable effects. A meso-eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by forest (Lake Aylmer) would neither respond to increases in agriculture nor settlement but would be most affected by increases in degree days. Another scenario focused on a highly forested oligo-mesotrophic lake (Lake St. Jean). Bloom phenology in this lake was most affected by disturbances in agriculture or settlement land use. Overall, these results suggest that lakes with a high level of eutrophication are the least responsive to the pressures resulting from land cover changes.

TI  - The Strv 1 Microsatellite Series: Exploiting The Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit
AB  - Following 3 Successful years in orbit, the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's two Space Technology Research Vehicle microsatellites (STRV) 1 a\&b will be followed by a second mission. STRV 1 c\&d are now in construction for a planned launch in 1999. The new mission, which includes 22 experimental payloads and developmental spacecraft bus technologies from European, US and Canadian military, civil and commercial sponsors, exploits the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) to offer an affordable, working space research tool for both government and industry. The STRV 1 programme objective is to promote the enhancement of military and civil space communications, remote sensing and navigation capabilities at reduced cost and risk. Additional aims are to help industry to achieve commercial benefit from investment in emerging technologies and to develop the synergy between government, commercial and civilian space applications. The paper explains how STRV 1 exploits the variable altitude and high radiation environment of GTO to investigate the performance of emerging technologies and techniques. This includes the accelerated Life testing of components and materials, such as infra-red detectors, advanced microprocessors and solar cell technologies, and the prototyping of new techniques to improve communications and spacecraft autonomy. Experiments include implementing a secure version of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) packet telecommand and telemetry standards, further development of the Internet-based Space Communication Protocol Standards (SCPS) and evaluating the exploitation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in geosynchronous orbit. The new mission also builds on and extends the comprehensive environmental monitoring achieved by STRV 1 a\&b. Crown copyright (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Airborne Hyperspectral Data Predict Fine-Scale Plant Species Diversity In Grazed Dry Grasslands
AB  - Semi-natural grasslands with grazing management are characterized by high fine-scale species richness and have a high conservation value. The fact that fine-scale surveys of grassland plant communities are time-consuming may limit the spatial extent of ground-based diversity surveys. Remote sensing tools have the potential to support field-based sampling and, if remote sensing data are able to identify grassland sites that are likely to support relatively higher or lower levels of species diversity, then field sampling efforts could be directed towards sites that are of potential conservation interest. In the present study, we examined whether aerial hyperspectral (414-2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to predict fine-scale plant species diversity (characterized as species richness and Simpsonws diversity) in dry grazed grasslands. Vascular plant species were recorded within 104 (4 m × 4 m) plots on the island of Öland (Sweden) and each plot was characterized by a 245-waveband hyperspectral data set. We used two different modeling approaches to evaluate the ability of the airborne spectral measurements to predict within-plot species diversity: (1) a spectral response approach, based on reflectance information from (i) all wavebands, and (ii) a subset of wavebands, analyzed with a partial least squares regression model, and (2) a spectral heterogeneity approach, based on the mean distance to the spectral centroid in an ordinary least squares regression model. Species diversity was successfully predicted by the spectral response approach (with an error of ca. 20%) but not by the spectral heterogeneity approach. When using the spectral response approach, iterative selection of important wavebands for the prediction of the diversity measures simplified the model but did not improve its predictive quality (prediction error). Wavebands sensitive to plant pigment content (400-700 nm) and to vegetation structural properties, such as above-ground biomass (700-1300 nm), were identified as being the most important predictors of plant species diversity. We conclude that hyperspectral remote sensing technology is able to identify fine-scale variation in grassland diversity and has a potential use as a tool in surveys of grassland plant diversity. © 2016 by the authors.

TI  - Novel Water Retention And Nutrient Management Technologies And Strategies Supporting Agricultural Water Management In Continental, Pannonian And Boreal Regions (Publication With Expression Of Concern. See Vol. 14, 2022)
AB  - Urgent water and food security challenges, particularly in continental and boreal regions, need to be addressed by initiatives such as the Horizon 2020-funded project WATer retention and nutrient recycling in soils and streams for improved AGRIcultural production (WATERAGRI). A new methodological framework for the sustainable management of various solutions resilient to climate change has been developed. The results indicate that the effect of the climate scenario is significantly different for peatlands and constructed wetlands. The findings also highlight that remote-sensing-based yield prediction models developed from vegetation indices have the potential to provide quantitative and timely information on crops for large regions or even at the local farm scale. Verification of remotely sensed data is one of the prerequisites for the proper utilization and understanding of data. Research shows that current serious game applications fall short due to challenges such as not clarifying the decision problem, the lack of use of decision quality indicators and limited use of gaming. Overall, WATERAGRI solutions improve water and food security by adapting agriculture to climate change, recycling nutrients and providing educational tools to the farming community. Farmers in small agricultural catchments benefit directly from WATERAGRI, but over the long-term, the general public does as well.

TI  - Delineation Of Potential Groundwater Zones Based On Multicriteria Decision Making Technique
AB  - Groundwater is the most prioritized water source in India and plays an indispensable role in India's economy. The groundwater potential mapping is key to the sustainable groundwater development and management. A hybrid methodology is applied to delineate potential groundwater zones based on remote sensing, geographical information systems (GIS) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as on multicriteria decision making. For the purpose of demonstrating field application, Chittar watershed, Tamilnadu, India is studied as an example. The important morphological characteristics considered in the study are lithology, geomorphology, lineament density, drainage density, slope, and Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN). These six thematic layers are generated in a GIS platform. Based on intersecting the layers, AHP method, the values for adopting the pairwise comparison normalized weight and normalized subclasses weightage were given. The normalized subclass weightage is input into each layer subclass. Then, weighted linear combination method is used to add the data layers in GIS platform to generate groundwater potential Index (GWPI) map. The GWPI map is validated based on the net recharge computed from the differences of measured groundwater levels between the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon in the year 2018. The kappa statistics are used to measure level spatial consistency between the GWPI and net recharge map. The overall average spatial matching accuracy between the two data sets is 0.86, while the kappa coefficient for GWPI with net recharge, 0.78. The results show that in Chittar watershed about 870 km(2) area is divided into high potential zone (i.e. sum of very high and high potential zone), 667 km(2) area, as the moderate one and the rest 105 km(2) area, as the poor zone (i.e. sum of very poor and poor potential zone).

TI  - Spatial Distribution Of The Level Of Return Of Extreme Precipitation Events In Northeast Brazil
AB  - This study aimed to estimate levels of return of extreme daily precipitation events, associating them with natural disasters in Northeast Brazil (NEB), a region characterized by different climatic conditions and low rates of social and economic development. For this, generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) models were adjusted to the daily extreme precipitation data estimated by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 product of the multisatellite precipitation analysis for a period of 16 years (2000–2015). In addition, the estimates of the GPD model were compared using two data sources, TRMM and pluviometer. The investigation showed that the results of the GPD model estimated by means of the extreme data from the rain gauge and the TRMM were statistically the same, with 95% confidence. Thus, using the data referring to the 2,082 grid points of the TRMM, it was possible to map the spatial distribution of the estimates of the levels of return of extreme precipitation to the return periods of 2, 5 and 10 years, per seasonal period. In general, the results indicated that the intensity of expected extreme precipitation depends on the seasonal period and the place of occurrence of precipitation. The eastern NEB stood out as the region where the highest intensities of extreme precipitation are expected. Extreme precipitation values of up to 178 mm are expected in 2 years. The areas where natural disasters occurred in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 are similar to those in which the highest rainfall intensities are expected. The results of this study can allow the evaluation of the spatial distribution of risks related to extreme precipitation events, and therefore, support the planning of regional public policies and environmental management for the prevention of natural disasters in NEB. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society

TI  - Bridging The Data Gap Between The Grace Missions And Assessment Of Groundwater Storage Variations For Telangana State, India
AB  - Because of changing climatic conditions, uneven distribution of rainfall occurs throughout India. As a result, dependence on groundwater for irrigation has increased tremendously for industrial and domestic purposes. In India approximately 89\% of agricultural demands are met through groundwater. Due to increases in population, demand for groundwater and lack of effective utilization have resulted in rapid depletion of groundwater in most parts of the country. Therefore, quantifying groundwater resources is a serious concern in populated states of India, because it is now difficult to supply enough water to every citizen, and will remain so in the future. Because of difficulties in accessing observation data, researchers have begun to depend on satellite-based remote sensing information to deal with groundwater variations. The present study deals with filling the data gap between Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE FO) missions using multilayer perceptron's (MLPs) during 2017-2018 to obtain a continuous terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) series from 2003 to 2020 for Telangana state, India. The MLP model performed well in predicting the TWSA, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.96 between modeled TWSA and GRACE TWSA during the test period. Telangana state observed negative TWSAs (annual) in the years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2016-19. This TWSA series (2003-2020) was then used to evaluate regional groundwater storage anomalies (GWSAs) in Telangana state, which is considered to be one of the water stress regions in India. The TWSAs were converted to GWSAs using Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) parameters. The Telangana state experienced decreasing GWSA in the years 2005, 2009, and 2012, and from 2015 to 2019, leading to severe droughts. Groundwater well measurements were obtained from the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) and converted to GWSA at a seasonal scale. The GWSAs obtained from GRACE (GWSA(GRACE)) were converted to seasonal values and compared with GWSAs obtained from observation well data (GWSA(obs)). The performance metrics of r = 0.74, RMSE = 5.3, and NSE = 0.62 were obtained between (GWSA(GRACE)) and (GWSA(obs)), representing a good correlation among them. Over the past decade, Telangana state has significantly relied on groundwater resources for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes. As a result, evaluating groundwater storage variations at a regional scale may help policy makers and water resource researchers in the sustainable utilization and management of groundwater resources.

TI  - An Investigation Into The Relationship Between Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperatures And Heat Stroke Incident Rates In The Tokyo Prefecture 2010-2019
AB  - This study aims to utilise remotely sensed data to investigate the connection between monthly urban and rural land surface temperatures (LST) and heat stroke incident rates (HSIR) in Tokyo Prefecture. A ward, city, town, and village (WCTV) spatial comparative analysis and a categorical land type collective correlation analysis identified general trends of urban LSTs demonstrating a stronger correlation with HSIRs than rural LSTs. Normalised categorical land type data analysis results show that urban LSTs have a stronger correlation with HSIRs than rural LSTs, with R2 values of 0.59, 0.70, 0.78, and 0.85, for Rural, Sub-rural, Urban, and City Centre, respectively. LSTs cannot solely account for HSIR variation; however, urban LSTs are more influential in HSIR variation than rural LSTs which shows the usefulness of urban LSTs for urban heat island (UHI) and HSIR studies as an independent variable or part of a holistic assessment. Results also highlighted the counterintuitive nature of the relationship between LSTs and HSIRs with increased LSTs and UHI effects not always equating to higher HSIRs. Other factors which contribute to explaining this discrepancy while also being highlighted as significant for HSIR management were identified as working environments, building quality, density and height, elderly populations, and waterways.

TI  - Planning Renewable Energy In Rural Areas: Impacts On Occupation And Land Use
AB  - Reflecting on the role of rural areas in the 21st century is, nowadays, a central theme in the important debate on the long-term renewable energy development. It is the case that while cities demonstrate an ever-growing pattern of energy consumption, rural areas keep themselves as almost low-density territories and with the greatest potential of renewable energy sources. This means a new smart specialization of rural areas as green energy exporters to fuel urban areas, providing effective and long-lasting answers to the climate change, the reduction of energy dependency and respective social, economic and environmental impacts. Nevertheless, the implementation of renewable energy sources requires safeguarding the balance between occupation and land use and, at the same time, preservation and respect for the environmental, cultural and scenic values of these privileged territories. The present paper describes the first stage of an exploratory empirical study on the various impacts caused by the implementation of different renewable energy sources in rural areas. With reference to the County of Loures in Portugal, factors and geographical determinants, underlying the localization of recently implemented photovoltaic power plants and wind farms, have been identified. The level 5 Corine Land Cover 2007 datasets and satellite images have been used along with the information collected during on-site field work. The delimitation of infrastructure areas associated with renewable energy production, has enabled an understanding of the changes in land occupation over the time period of a decade and how these aspects are linked to the spatial dimensions of planning and land management. The results obtained demonstrate the emergence of a functional dichotomy between the preservation of lands with strong agricultural potential and the massive expansion of renewable energy production across rural areas. This allows us to understand how the implementation of renewable energy sources is ever more linked to the local decision-making process associated with spatial planning. The role that municipalities can play in the definition of strategies to ensure an efficient, balanced and sustainable renewable energy zoning in rural areas will therefore be crucial.

TI  - Towards A Combined Human-Natural System Approach In The Northern Red Sea Region: Ecological Challenges, Sustainable Development, And Community Engagement
AB  - The northern Red Sea coastal ecosystem is one of the most diverse coastal ecosystems in the world. Fortunately, it has shown extraordinary resilience against climate change and is predicted to survive global warming during the coming decades. However, with warming waters, increased sediment and pollutants, and other human impacts, the ecosystem and consequently thriving reef tourism which forms a pillar of the ongoing economic diversification policies of the northern Red Sea region are under threat. A variety of evidence indicates significant damage has already been done to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems on both sides of the northern Red Sea. Expenditures on ecosystem protection and research lag behind Egypt's billions in USD revenue from tourism. Unfortunately, the economic drive to generate profit has resulted in sprawling touristic, industrial, and mixed development without careful planning or assessment of the fragility and sustainability of the natural ecosystem. As a result, the future of coastal urban growth is murky. Given its natural, social, and touristic value, the northern Red Sea system requires a special ecological security system with detailed analysis, inclusive development, and proactive governance across coastal cities and their adjacent inland secondary cities. This study identifies the geological research gaps, human-ecological interactions, inclusive urban development challenges, and related literature pertaining to the northern Red Sea. We propose immediate, targeted, multidisciplinary research trajectories and provide policy recommendations to ensure that the region's existing and future developmental pursuits are undertaken in an environmentally sustainable and inclusive approach.

TI  - Land Fragmentation And Variation Of Ecosystem Services In The Context Of Rapid Urbanization: The Case Of Taizhou City, China
AB  - This study analyzes land use dynamics, land fragmentation, variation of ecosystem service value (ESV), and the underlying driving forces in the context of rapid urbanization in Taizhou city, China. An integrated approach utilizing geographic information system and remote sensing was used to analyze land use/land cover change, spatiotemporal patterns of land fragmentation and variation of ESV over the period of 1995-2010. The results show that the areal extent of built-up land increased by 3.72 times, whereas loss of the cropland, forest, and fallow land accounted for 18.52, 34.80, and 28.94 % of the new built-up land, respectively. As observed, in-filling of the major traffic road networks and axis-based expansion of built-up land occurred. Outward expansion of the built-up land, in particular, indicated that human encroachment into surrounding natural and semi-natural ecosystems leading to decreased total ecosystem service functions of the study area. As a whole, significant change in key landscape, especially a net decrease in forest, and remarkable socioeconomic development should be responsible for an overall decline in 36.29 % of total ESV during the recently rapid urbanization process. Therefore, sustainable development policies should address the decline of ESV. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Assessing The Megadrought In Province Of Cachopoal, Chile, Using Modis Products
AB  - The mega-drought affecting the province of Cachapoal, in Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region, Chile, was assessed by mapping the temporal change magnitude of NDVI (normalized difference index) and LST (land surface temperature) variables, retrieved from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)/Terra composite products in quinquennia of the last 20 years. For this purpose, the current values (within a period bounded to mid-summer of 2021) of both variables were compared in accordance to their quinquennial equivalents between 2001 and 2016 and normalized regarding their temporal variability. Results indicate significant relative NDVI relative decreases, as well as significant LST relative increases, involving not only land uses located in the valley but in the mountain as well. These could be attributed to the water shortage advocated by the mega-drought. It is expected this study may orientate further planning and environmental managing actions regarding the mega-drought in the Province, in pursuit of replicate it in other geographical ranges of the Chilean territory. © 2021 by the Author(s).

TI  - Estimating Lichen Volume And Reindeer Winter Pasture Quality From Landsat Imagery
AB  - Reindeer and caribou are keystone species in the circumpolar region, and rely on lichens as their main winter forage to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. Lichen mats, however, can be heavily overgrazed at high deer densities, triggering area abandonment or population declines. Although the species' management and conservation require precise information on the quality of winter grazing areas, no reliable and cost-efficient methods are available to date to measure lichen volume across wide and remote areas. We developed a new Lichen Volume Estimator, LVE, using remote sensing and field measurements. We used a Landsat TM land cover mask to separate lichen heath communities from other vegetation types and, therein, we predicted lichen volume from a two dimensional Gaussian regression model using two indexes: the Normalized Difference Lichen Index, NDLI (Band 5-Band 4/Band 5+Band 4), and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index, NDMI (Band 4-Band 5/Band 4+Band 5). The model was parameterized using 202 ground measurements equally distributed across a gradient ranging from 0 to 80 lichen dm3/m2 (R2=0.74 between predicted and observed ground measurements), and was validated with a ten-fold cross validation procedure (R2=0.67), which also showed a high parameter stability. The LVE can be a valuable tool to predict the quality of winter pastures for reindeer and caribou and, thus, help to improve the species' management and conservation. © 2013.

TI  - Land Cover Change And Its Impact In Crop Yield: A Case Study From Western Nepal
AB  - This study was conducted in Tanahun district of Gandaki Province, Nepal, to analyze the land cover change over two decades, the migration effect in land cover, and the impact caused in crop production by Rhesus macaque. Landsat TM/ETM+ for land use of 2000 and 2010 extracted by ICIMOD and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images for land cover 2019 were downloaded from the USGS website. A purposive sample for household survey was carried out based on crops damaged by the monkey. Two hundred and fifty households were taken as samples. The Landsat images were analyzed by ArcGIS, and the social data were analyzed using SPSS and MS Excel. Land cover change data revealed increment of forest cover from 36.57% to 40.91% and drastic decrease in agriculture crops from 57.52% to 43.78% in the period of 20 years. The accuracy of the data showed overall classification accuracy of 86.11%, 81.08%, and 75% with overall kappa statistics 0.83, 0.77, and 0.74, respectively. The migration effect in the land cover was related to remittance and migrated members and found a significant positive relationship. Analyzing the trend of production with an increase in the forest cover, 21% decrease in paddy, 5% decrease in maize, and 26% decrease in millet were found as compared to the production in 2000. The econometric model concluded that the quantity of crop damage was negatively significant in relation to distance from forest and distance from water body while positively significant to distance from settlements and distance from owner’s home. The quantity of crop damage was estimated 113.89 kg per household, and the cost was 78.82 USD. This study recommends active forest management; regular thinning, and weeding. Remittance generated should be invested in the agriculture field by the households. Damage relief should be made available for the damage cost by Rhesus macaque. Copyright © 2022 Ajay Bhandari et al.

TI  - Gis Application For Hydrogeological Characterization Of Dunar Systems (Erg Chebbi, Morocco)
AB  - Hydrogeological studies in remote areas are difficult to tackle and often logistically complicated. However, in some of these areas the exploitation of groundwater resources is essential for the survival of the communities that inhabit them. The dunes of Erg Chebbi configure a free aquifer about 100 km2 in area. With an average annual rainfall of less than 150 mm, Erg Chebbi represents an extremely delicate hydrological system that requires a very well designed exploitation to enable a sustainable development. This paper addresses the hydrogeological characterization of an erg system by means of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (ArcGis 9.3 y Global Mapper v.12), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and geological information analysis. Results allowed the characterization the dune system and the setting of a hydrogeological model, consistent with field data. The results are relevant to the management of the groundwater exploitation in the studied system, and highlight the utility of this methodology to the characterization of other areas with similar characteristics.

TI  - Residency And Reproductive Status Of Yellowfin Tuna In A Proposed Large-Scale Pelagic Marine Protected Area
AB  - Since the year 2000, the designation of remote, large-scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs) has closed over 15 × 106 km2 of ocean to commercial fishing. Yet, while these mega-reserves have collectively made a major contribution toward meeting global targets for marine conservation, their effectiveness for the protection of highly mobile, pelagic species remains largely unknown. This study reports on the spatial behavior and reproductive status of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) inhabiting a proposed LSMPA around Ascension Island (tropical Atlantic), with the aim of evaluating the conservation benefits for this economically important species. Using a combination of satellite archival tags and conventional mark–recapture it was shown that individual tuna can remain within Ascension Island waters for periods of between 100 and 200 days, with core residency areas (50% “utilization distributions”) generally extending <200 km from shore. The vast majority of activity occurred within 92.6 km (50 nmi) of the island and coincided with a “no-take zone” established around the island in 2016. However, dispersive movements out of this zone were observed in some satellite-tagged individuals, possibly marking the beginning of more extensive oceanic migrations. Gonad staging of 342 individuals sampled over a 32 month period found no evidence of reproductively active (ripe) individuals, strongly suggesting that tuna foraging around Ascension Island migrate elsewhere to breed. Study results provide further evidence of the importance of oceanic islands as residency areas for pelagic megafauna, helping to justify their inclusion within LSMPAs. In the absence of local recruitment, however, these individuals will remain susceptible to exploitation on spawning grounds located outside of reserves, ultimately limiting their effectiveness and thus calling for further research to identify and protect the areas where species are most vulnerable. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Estimation Of Evapotranspiration Based On Metric And Sebal Model Using Remote Sensing, Near Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia
AB  - The current study focuses on estimating evapotranspiration in arid and semi-arid environments in the Northern part of Saudi Arabia near Al-Jouf. The objective of the research is to study, analyze and estimate evapotranspiration (ET) using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) and mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) model and compare the two models with vegetation index and land surface temperature. The image was processed in ArcGIS and MATLAB software with the toolbox LandMOD ET mapper. The area aver-age evapotranspiration is about 2.21 mm/d for the METRIC model, 2.6 mm/d for SEBAL and the average land surface temperature is 324.3 K. ET and land surface temperature are highly inverse correlated, with an R-2 = 0.8. The value of ET ranges from 0.05 to 8 mm for both SEBAL and METRIC models during 2019/07/07. Both highly elevated and agricultural area shows a high value of ET ranging from 5 to 8 mm/d. In addition, the normalized differential vegetation index, leaf area index, and emissivity were also calculated from the surface energy balance equation. The estimation of ET from the SEBAL model is better than the METRIC model based on R-2 of different vegetation indices. The importance of the work is to estimate ET and explain the impact on environmental effects for better planning in water resource development.

TI  - 13 The Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (Ceop) Report: Integrated Data Systems In The Study Of The Water Cycle In Asia
AB  - CEOP has made important progress towards the realization of its long-term guiding scientific goal: "To understand and model the influence of continental hydroclimate processes on the predictability of global atmospheric circulation and changes in water resources, with a particular focus on the heat source and sink regions that drive and modify the climate system and anomalies." The scientific objective for the CEOP Water and Energy Simulation and Prediction (WESP) working group is to use enhanced observations to diagnose, simulate and predict water and energy fluxes and reservoirs over land on diurnal to annual temporal scales as well as apply these predictions for water resource applications. The CEOP Monsoon Studies Working Group aims to achieve another CEOP science objective: to document the seasonal march of the monsoon systems, assess their driving mechanisms, and investigate their possible physical connections. The CEOP Inter-monsoon Model Study (CIMS) has been undertaken to assess, validate and improve the capabilities of climate models in simulating physical processes in monsoon regions around the world. CIMS and WESP are demonstrating the utility of CEOP data for better understanding of the regional and global water cycle and for model physics improvement. The CEOP Data Management, Satellite Data Integration and Model Output Development and Management Working groups are attaining the CEOP goal to provide a database of common measurements from both in situ and satellite remote sensing measurements, as well as matching model output that includes Model Output Location Time Series (MOLTS) data along with four-dimensional data analyses (4DDA; including global/regional reanalyzes) for a specified period. By setting these goals, CEOP is responding to the challenges and priorities that relate to variations in the Earth's water and energy budgets and the cycling rate of the hydrological cycle as posed by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and will contribute to the development of WCRP COPES and the GEO, GEOSS. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - New Pedotransfer Approaches To Predict Soil Bulk Density Using Wosis Soil Data And Environmental Covariates In Mediterranean Agro-Ecosystems
AB  - For the estimation of the soil organic carbon stocks, bulk density (BD) is a fundamental parameter but measured data are usually not available especially when dealing with legacy soil data. It is possible to estimate BD by applying pedotransfer function (PTF). We applied different estimation methods with the aim to define a suitable PTF for BD of arable land for the Mediterranean Basin, which has peculiar climate features that may influence the soil carbon sequestration. To improve the existing BD estimation methods, we used a set of public climatic and topographic data along with the soil texture and organic carbon data. The present work consisted of the following steps: i) development of three PTFs models separately for top (0-0.4 m) and subsoil (0.4-1.2 m), ii) a 10-fold cross-validation, iii) model transferability using an external dataset derived from published data. The development of the new PTFs was based on the training dataset consisting of World Soil Information Service (WoSIS) soil profile data, climatic data from WorldClim at 1 km spatial resolution and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model at 30 m spatial resolution. The three PTFs models were developed using: Multiple Linear Regression stepwise (MLR-S), Multiple Linear Regression backward stepwise (MLR-BS), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The predictions of the newly developed PTFs were compared with the BD calculated using the PTF proposed by Manrique and Jones (MJ) and the modelled BD derived from the global SoilGrids dataset. For the topsoil training dataset (N = 129), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN had a R-2 0.35, 0.58 and 0.86, respectively. For the model transferability, the three PTFs applied to the external topsoil dataset (N = 59), achieved R-2 values of 0.06, 0.03 and 0.41. For the subsoil training dataset (N = 180), MLR-S, MLR-BS and ANN the R-2 values were 0.36, 0.46 and 0.83, respectively. When applied to the external subsoil dataset (N = 29), the R-2 values were 0.05, 0.06 and 0.41. The cross-validation for both top and subsoil dataset, resulted in an intermediate performance compared to calibration and validation with the external dataset. The new ANN PTF outperformed MLR-S, MLR-BS, MJ and SoilGrids approaches for estimating BD. Further improvements may be achieved by additionally considering the time of sampling, agricultural soil management and cultivation practices in predictive models. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Protected Areas Of Borneo Fail To Protect Forest Landscapes With High Habitat Connectivity
AB  - Throughout the world, previously extensive areas of natural habitats have been degraded and fragmented, and improving habitat connectivity may help the long-term persistence of species, and their ability to adapt to climate changes. We focused on Borneo, where many remaining areas of tropical forest are highly fragmented, and we assessed the extent to which Protected Areas (PAs) protect highly-connected forest sites. We analysed remotely-sensed land cover data (0.86 km(2) grid cell resolution) using 'Zonation' reserve design software, and we ranked grid cells (rank 0-1) according to forest extent and connectivity. PAs currently cover 9\% of Borneo, but <20\% of highly-connected cells (i.e. cells with Zonation ranks >= 0.9) lie within PAs. Approximately 65\% of highly-connected cells were located above 400 m elevation, although >60\% of Borneo's total land area lies below 200 m and only 15\% of highly-connected cells occurred in these low elevation areas. These findings were relatively insensitive to assumptions about species' dispersal ability (within the range 1-20 km; representing relatively mobile animal species). The percentage of highly-connected grid cells within PAs could rise from 20 to 50\% under proposed new PAs (including the 'Heart of Borneo' project), although many other highly-connected sites will remain unprotected. On-going land-use changes mean that existing PAs in lowland areas are likely to become increasingly isolated within inhospitable agricultural landscapes, and improving connectivity through reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded forest may be required to maintain the conservation value of these PAs in future.

TI  - Ecological Benefits Of Integrative Weed Management Of Melaleuca Quinquenervia In Big Cypress National Preserve
AB  - The southern tip of North America coalesces into one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands, the Everglades, Florida, USA. Though this region is much like an island, home to high biodiversity and endemism, it is also the site of a century of development and associated landscape-scale species invasions. Melaleuca quinquenervia (hereafter melaleuca), a tree native to tropical Australia, was planted extensively throughout south Florida as street trees, levee stabilizers, and later to reduce standing water in marshy areas. Through extensive cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture's Australian Biological Control Laboratory, several biological control agents were released, three of which later successfully established. Herein we examine evidence that plant community shifts determined from vegetation surveys and remotely sensed images reflect changes from melaleuca-dominated wetlands (before management) to native communities (after management). Melaleuca-dominated community types decreased from 1990 to 2020 by more than 99\%. Vegetation surveys also reflect an increase in cypress wetlands, pinelands, and open water wetlands, all of which were dominated by melaleuca in previous decades. We also found the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased in melaleuca-invaded wetlands during peak infestations but decreased again after communities recovered to sawgrass-dominated wetlands. These responses are concomitant with the development of integrative management techniques for melaleuca that include mechanical, chemical, and biological control. Our results confirm previous findings that biological control likely augments conventional management methods by limiting recovery of invasive species.

TI  - Improvement Of Evapotranspiration Estimates For Grasslands In The Southern Great Plains: Comparing A Biophysical Model (Swat) And Remote Sensing (Modis)
AB  - Study region: Mixed- and tall-grass prairies in the southern Great Plains, USA Study focus: Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are widely available from remote sensing and commonly used for water management. However, this approach is limited by prolonged satellite revisit periods and prominent algorithm-induced bias. We compared ET estimates from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products and those based on the biophysically-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique for a subhumid, tall-grass prairie site near Stillwater, Oklahoma (OK) and a semiarid, mixed-grass prairie site near Clinton, OK in the southern Great Plains, USA. New hydrological insights for the region: SWAT and MODIS produced ET estimates closer to EC measurements for the tall-grass prairie (calibration site) than for the mixed-grass prairie (validation site), with a better performance from SWAT. For the tall-grass prairie, the R2 values were relatively high and comparable (0.77 and 0.87), and the biases were relatively small (−0.40% and 5.04%) for the SWAT and MODIS comparisons to EC. SWAT performed much better than MODIS for the mixed-grass prairie with R2 values of 0.68 vs. 0.13 and bias of − 1.87% vs. − 45.71%, respectively. The SWAT simulation also reproduced better estimates of aboveground net primary productivity than the MODIS products. This study suggests that site-specific SWAT simulations can produce better ET estimates than MODIS products, especially in the water-limited mixed-grass prairie. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Evaluating The Ability Of Community-Protected Forests In Cambodia To Prevent Deforestation And Degradation Using Temporal Remote Sensing Data
AB  - Community forests are known to play an important role in preserving forests in Cambodia, a country that has seen rapid deforestation in recent decades. The detailed evaluation of the ability of community-protected forests to retain forest cover and prevent degradation in Cambodia will help to guide future conservation management. In this study, a combination of remotely sensing data was used to compare the temporal variation in forest structure for six different community forests located in the Phnom Kulen National Park (PKNP) in Cambodia and to assess how these dynamics vary between community-protected forests and a wider study area. Medium-resolution Landsat, ALOS PALSAR data, and high-resolution LiDAR data were used to study the spatial distribution of forest degradation patterns and their impacts on above-ground biomass (AGB) changes. Analysis of the remotely sensing data acquired at different spatial resolutions revealed that between 2012 and 2015, the community forests had higher forest cover persistence and lower rates of forest cover loss compared to the entire study area. Furthermore, they faced lower encroachment from cashew plantations compared to the wider landscape. Four of the six community forests showed a recovery in canopy gap fractions and subsequently, an increase in the AGB stock. The levels of degradation decreased in forests that had an increase in AGB values. However, all community forests experienced an increase in understory damage as a result of selective tree removal, and the community forests with the sharpest increase in understory damage experienced AGB losses. This is the first time multitemporal high-resolution LiDAR data have been used to analyze the impact of human-induced forest degradation on forest structure and AGB. The findings of this work indicate that while community-protected forests can improve conservation outcomes to some extent, more interventions are needed to curb the illegal selective logging of valuable timber trees.

TI  - Impact Of Different Geriatric Conditions On Choice Of Therapy And In-Hospital Outcomes In Elderly Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome
AB  - Introduction: The clinical benefit of invasive therapy in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains unclear. Furthermore, the decision-making process to treat this growing patient group is also debatable. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between elderly ACS patients, the treatment choice and their in-hospital outcomes after non-ST-elevation (NSTE)-ACS in a consecutive series of patients >75 years of age. Methods and Results: Consecutive patients >75 years presenting with NSTE-ACS in our hospital between July 2017 and July 2018 were included during the first 2 days of hospital admission. Demographic data, prior medical history and present medical condition were documented. During day 0 and day 2, geriatric assessments (Clinical Frailty Scale [CFS], Barthel index, Charlson comorbidity index, “timed up and go” test [TUG], Mini-Mental Status Test [MMS], Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS], SF-36 for quality of life, instrumental activities of daily living [IADL], Killip-score, Grace-score and Euro-score) were conducted. After 6 months, patients were re-evaluated. In 106 patients (mean age 81.9±5.3 years, 57% male gender), 68 patients (64%) were treated interventionally, and 38 patients had conservative treatment (36%). Patients treated with intervention were significantly younger (80.9±4.7 years vs 83.5±6.0 years, p=0.015), had a lower rate of prior cerebral events (17.6% vs 26.3%; p=ns) and suffered more often from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.6% vs 34.2%; p=0.050). All other demographic variables were comparable between both groups. The composite clinical endpoint (death, re-infarction, bleeding) was reached in 7 patients (10.3%) of the invasive and in 2 patients (5.3%) of the conservative group. They were not significantly different between both groups. A frailty index, consisting of commonly used parameters of functional impairment in elderly patients, namely, MMS ≤2 at baseline, IADL ≤7, CFS ≥7 and age ≥85 years, significantly predicted conservative treatment. Conclusion: Effective revascularization techniques are still underused in patients of older age in the case of ACS. For decision-making, geriatric tests alone may not predict treatment in those patients, but the combination of different tests may better predict treatment and perhaps the clinical outcomes in those patients. Furthermore, frail patients are at higher risk for not receiving guideline recommended therapy. © 2020 Rittger et al.

TI  - A Bayesian Approach To Understand Controls On Total And Labile Soil Carbon In Cultivated Soils Of Central And Southern Malawi
AB  - Soil degradation on cultivated lands of Sub-Saharan Africa is a threat to food security. Even so, drivers of soil C total and labile pools are little understood for smallholder farms. A unique opportunity to evaluate how environment conditions management drivers was afforded by a systematically representative on-farm study of 1108 cultivated plots in marginal to mesic environments across Central and Southern Malawi. Soil sample collection and analysis and surveys of farmer practice were conducted, and linked to remote-sensed data on environmental and spectral factors. Soil properties included the following ranges (mean values per site), soil clay (6.41% to 17.36%), pH (6.09 to 6.54), soil organic carbon (SOC) (6.31 g C kg soil−1 to 16.17 g C kg soil−1), and two labile soil C assays: permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC) (291.5 mg C kg soil−1 to 504.5 mg C kg soil−1) and 24-h mineralizable C (Cmin) (28.71 mg C kg soil−1 to 65.34 mg C kg soil−1). Incorporation of domain specialists’ expectation of uncertainty levels is key to carrying out a multiscale assessment of soil total and labile C status, thus a Bayesian linear regression approach was used for determining the influential drivers. Overall, the soil clay content is a strong predictor of SOC (0.479–0.517), POXC (0.139–0.266), and Cmin (0.125–0.223) at the 95% Bayesian credibility level from the Gibbs posterior samples. Vegetative cover, reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), is also a dominant driver for SOC (0.234–0.329), POXC (0.163–0.285), and Cmin (0.249–0.38). Of the management practices studied, crop diversity, residue incorporation, and weed presence are all positive drivers for total soil C, whereas fertilizer N is not. At both regional and local scales, labile soil C pools (as reflected by POXC and Cmin) are not consistently responsive to management. The drivers of SOC are highly consistent, a strong indication of statistical robustness. This contributes to the understanding of patterns of carbon pools in intensively cultivated fields in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring In Canada And The Greater Role For Integrated Earth Observation
AB  - Ecosystems are valuable as well as aesthetic. The natural functions of ecosystems can have profound effects on the economy, and human and wildlife health. The aggregate value of these "ecosystem services" may far exceed the economic value derived from resource extraction or industrial development, especially when considering the costs of restoring ecosystems. There is increasing interest, therefore, in monitoring and protecting ecosystems, and accounting for the biodiversity and services they provide. In 2010, Canada undertook a review of ecosystem status and trends that identified the regions and ecosystems where management is most urgently needed. The authors concluded that more large-scale, long-term, standardized, and spatially complete information is needed for effective monitoring and management. Satellite-based earth observation (EO) tools were seen as ameans of addressing this information need. In a separate exercise, a list of priority questions for conservation policy and management at a national level was produced: the resolution of three-quarters of those questions appears to depend on EO tools to a significant or critical extent. Canada has a long and successful history in all aspects of earth observation, placing it amongst the leaders in the international remote sensing community. Whereas the need for measuring ecosystem services to humans and wildlife is increasingly important, the challenges for doing so are increasingly significant and the technology required is increasingly complex. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address emerging conservation priorities including measurement of ecosystem attributes to support habitat conservation for Species at Risk, measuring functional capacity of ecosystems to mitigate effects of climate change, monitoring and mitigating effects of resource extraction, and supporting industrial development in Canada's north. Addressing emerging priorities requires dialogue among ecologists and decision makers, coordinated at regional and national scales, and requires drawing on the best EO technologies and infrastructure available. This review highlights the urgency of a coordinated approach for innovative applications of EO tools toward conservation and discusses some of the key elements that might be included and opportunities and challenges that might be encountered, by such an approach.

TI  - Spatial Analysis Of Groundwater Potential Using Weights-Of-Evidence And Evidential Belief Function Models And Remote Sensing
AB  - As demands for groundwater in the arid and semiarid areas increase, delineation of groundwater potential zone becomes an increasingly valuable technique for implementing a successful groundwater potential analysis. The capability of using weights-of-evidence (WOE) and evidential belief function (EBF) models for groundwater potential mapping is tested and compared in the Ilam Plain, Iran. In the present study, multiple geo-env iron menta l factors including lithology, land use, distance from river, soil texture, drainage density, altitude, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope percent, lineament density, and rainfall were used as inputs for both models. Subsequently, a well inventory map was produced using documentary sources of Iranian Water Resources Department (IWRD) and extensive field surveys. About 145 groundwater productivity data (with high potential yield values of >= 11 m(3)/h) were separated from well locations. Out of these. 101 (70 \%) cases were randomly selected for groundwater potential modeling, and the remaining 44 (30 \%) cases were applied for the validation purpose. In the next step, groundwater potential maps were produced using WOE and EBF models in GIS environment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the produced maps were drawn and the areas under the curves (AUC) were determined. From the analysis, predictive performance of EBF model (AUC=83.7 0) was better than of WOE model (AUC=78.2 \%). The results also show the capability of EBF model in managing uncertainty associated in groundwater potential mapping. Therefore, WOE and EBF models are shown to he an effective prediction models for groundwater potential mapping. The groundwater potential map can he helpful for planners in groundwater management and land use planning.

TI  - Spatial Analysis Of Soil Salinity And Soil Structural Stability In A Semiarid Region Of New South Wales, Australia
AB  - Salt-affected soils are a major threat to agriculture especially in the semiarid regions of the world. The effective management of these soils requires adequate understanding of not only how water and, hence, solutes are transported within the soil, but also how soil salinity and sodicity spatially interact to determine soil structural breakdown. For sustainable agricultural production, information on quantitative soil quality, such as salinity, is required for effective land management and environmental planning. In this study, quantitative methods for mapping indicators of soil structural stability, namely salinity and sodicity, were developed to assess the effect of these primary indicators on soil structural breakdown. The current levels of soil salinity, as measured by electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil/water suspension, soil sodicity, represented by exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and aggregate stability, were assessed. Remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS), and geostatistical techniques-primarily regression-kriging and indicator-kriging-were used to spatially predict the soil sodicity and salinity. The patterns of salinity (EC) and sodicity (ESP > 5\%) were identified. The effect of land use on these soil quality indicators was found to be minimal. Co-spatial patterns were elucidated between sodic soils (defined by ESP > 5\%) and highly probable mechanically dispersive soils predicted from indicator-kriging of ASWAT scores. It was established that the incorporation of EC with ESP into an objective index, called electrolyte stability index (ESI = ESP/EC), gave a good indication of soil dispersion, although the threshold ESI value below which effective structural breakdown might occur is 0.025, which is twice as small as the expected 0.05. The discrepancies between ESI and ASWAT scores suggest that other soil factors than salinity and sodicity are affecting soil structural breakdown. This calls for further investigation. The study provides valuable information in the form of risk zones of soil structural breakdown for land management. These zones, with a probability of mechanical soil dispersion of > 0.70, require immediate management attention with greater monitoring and amelioration techniques, particularly gypsum or lime application and/or altered cultivation techniques.

TI  - Mapping Vegetation Functional Types In Urban Areas With Worldview-2 Imagery: Integrating Object-Based Classification With Phenology
AB  - Mapping urban vegetation is a prerequisite to accurately understanding landscape patterns and ecological services provided by urban vegetation. However, the uncertainties in fine-scale vegetation biodiversity mapping still exist in capturing vegetation functional types efficiently at fine scale. To facilitate the application of fine-scale vegetation spatial configuration used for urban landscape planning and ecosystem service valuation, we present an approach integrating object-based classification with vegetation phenology for fine-scale vegetation functional type mapping in compact city of Beijing, China. The phenological information derived from two WorldView-2 imagery scenes, acquired on 14 September 2012 and 26 November 2012, was used to aid in the classification of tree functional types and grass. Then we further compared the approach to that of using only one WorldView imagery. We found WorldView-2 imagery can be successfully applied to map functional types of urban vegetation with its high spatial resolution and relatively high spectral resolution. The application of the vegetation phenology into classification greatly improved the overall accuracy of classification from 82.3% to 91.1%. In particular, the accuracies of vegetation types was improved by from 10% to 13.26%. The approach integrating vegetation phenology with high-resolution remote sensed images provides an efficient tool to incorporate multi-temporal data into fine-scale urban classification. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Improving Bridge Collapse Detection And On-Site Emergency Alarms: A Case Study In Taiwan
AB  - During the past decades in Taiwan, numerous scour problems have led to the collapse of bridges. Such accidents have caused severe economic losses and killed many people. Although Taiwanese government agencies have mitigated this relationship between natural hazards and bridge collapse, two problems still exist at bridge sites: the lack of convenient mechanisms for bridge collapse detection and the lack of active mechanisms for on-site emergency alarms. Therefore, based on an approach consisting of mixed collapse detectors (i.e., bi-axial tilt sensors, electronic circuits) and compounded wireless networks (i.e., low-rate wireless personal area network, wireless local area network, worldwide interoperability for microwave access), this study proposes a bridge safety monitoring information system. While the mixed collapse detectors identify the status of various bridge elements, the compounded wireless networks streamline the information transmission between on-site bridges and off-site headquarters. This research is composed of two-year tests on six bridges. After 382 earthquakes and 13 typhoons, this study confirmed that the stability of the bridge safety monitoring information system achieved the anticipated results. Thus, this study provides a sound reference for similar applications in bridge and disaster management. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Use Of Satellite Data To Support The Structural Health Monitoring In Areas Affected By Slow-Moving Landslides: A Potential Application To Reinforced Concrete Buildings
AB  - The building stock around the world is exposed to different types of natural actions such as earthquakes or landslides. In particular, Italy is one of the countries worldwide most affected by landslides. Mitigation of landslide risk is a topic of great interest for the evaluation and management of its consequences. Periodical monitoring of the landslide-induced damage on structures require high costs due to the large number of exposed elements. With respect to the reinforced concrete structures, slow-moving landslides can affect primary structural elements, but more frequently damage occurs on the most vulnerable elements of the structure such as infills. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the potential utility of satellite data derived from a remote sensing technique, known as differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, to support the structural health monitoring of reinforced concrete buildings affected by landslides. This article shows the structural health monitoring process for a reinforced concrete infilled building within a landslide-affected area, using the differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry data as input for the structural analysis in order to investigate the evolution of damage over the years. Three-dimensional structure, including the explicit infills consideration, has been modeled based on the information available from a visual survey, obtaining the missing parameters from a simulated design process and from the literature. In the field of the civil protection programs for the landslide risk reduction, this methodology can be quickly repeated for large sets of reinforced concrete buildings. Evidence of the visual survey showed a significant damage pattern in some infills. A good agreement has been found between analytical previsions and existing damage. Moreover, a global infills damage assessment of the case study building is proposed. Finally, assuming a constant increase in displacements in future years, a prediction of the future expected damage is shown.

TI  - Impact Assessment Of Biomass Burning On Air Quality In Southeast And East Asia During Base-Asia
AB  - A synergy of numerical simulation, ground-based measurement and satellite observation was applied to evaluate the impact of biomass burning originating from Southeast Asia (SE Asia) within the framework of NASA's 2006 Biomass burning Aerosols in Southeast Asia: Smoke Impact Assessment (BASE-ASIA). Biomass burning emissions in the spring of 2006 peaked in March-April when most intense biomass burning occurred in Myanmar, northern Thailand, Laos, and parts of Vietnam and Cambodia. Model performances were reasonably validated by comparing to both satellite and ground-based observations despite overestimation or underestimation occurring in specific regions due to high uncertainties of biomass burning emission. Chemical tracers of particulate K+, OC concentrations, and OC/EC ratios showed distinct regional characteristics, suggesting biomass burning and local emission dominated the aerosol chemistry. CMAQ modeled aerosol chemical components were underestimated at most circumstances and the converted AOD values from CMAQ were biased low at about a factor of 2, probably due to the underestimation of biomass emissions. Scenario simulation indicated that the impact of biomass burning to the downwind regions spread over a large area via the Asian spring monsoon, which included Southern China, South China Sea, and Taiwan Strait. Comparison of AERONET aerosol optical properties with simulation at multi-sites clearly demonstrated the biomass burning impact via long-range transport. In the source region, the contribution from biomass burning to AOD was estimated to be over 56\%. While in the downwind regions, the contribution was still significant within the range of 26\%-62\%.

TI  - Predicting The Chlorophyll Content Of Maize Over Phenotyping As A Proxy For Crop Health In Smallholder Farming Systems
AB  - Smallholder farmers depend on healthy and productive crop yields to sustain their socio-economic status and ensure livelihood security. Advances in South African precision agriculture in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide spatially explicit near-real-time information that can be used to assess crop dynamics and inform smallholder farmers. The use of UAVs with remote-sensing techniques allows for the acquisition of high spatial resolution data at various spatio-temporal planes, which is particularly useful at the scale of fields and farms. Specifically, crop chlorophyll content is assessed as it is one of the best known and reliable indicators of crop health, due to its biophysical pigment and biochemical processes that indicate plant productivity. In this regard, the study evaluated the utility of multispectral UAV imagery using the random forest machine learning algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize through the various growth stages. The results showed that the near-infrared and red-edge wavelength bands and vegetation indices derived from these wavelengths were essential for estimating chlorophyll content during the phenotyping of maize. Furthermore, the random forest model optimally estimated the chlorophyll content of maize over the various phenological stages. Particularly, maize chlorophyll was best predicted during the early reproductive, late vegetative, and early vegetative growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 40.4 mu mol/m(-2), 39 mu mol/m(-2), and 61.6 mu mol/m(-2), respectively. The least accurate chlorophyll content results were predicted during the mid-reproductive and late reproductive growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 66.6 mu mol/m(-2) and 69.6 mu mol/m(-2), respectively, as a consequence of a hailstorm. A resultant chlorophyll variation map of the maize growth stages captured the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll within the maize field. Therefore, the study's findings demonstrate that the use of remotely sensed UAV imagery with a robust machine algorithm is a critical tool to support the decision-making and management in smallholder farms.

TI  - Assessment And Prediction Of Urban Expansion Using Ca-Based Sleuth Urban Growth Model: A Case Study Of Kolkata Metropolitan Area (Kma), West Bengal, India
AB  - Unplanned and rapidly increasing urbanization has been observed worldwide, especially in developing countries which causes manifest many environmental issues. The Indian cities have experienced rapid urban growth due to increased population, migration activities, economic development, capitalization, and rising of services and amenities over the last few decades which would led to the expansion of the city structure toward peri-urban areas. Therefore, it causes environmental degradation like landscape fragmentation, adverse effects on urban ecological balance, urban climate change, etc. This paper aims to study the spatiotemporal urban dynamics of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) in terms of urban development trends over the year 2031. The research study has focused on land use/land cover change and incorporated it with an open-source SLEUTH model to predict future urban scenarios. SLEUTH was applied two two parts of KMA such as North KMA and South KMA to compare the urban growth. The model initiation with calibration showed a high value of the spreading coefficient indicating the organic type of growth has happened. New urban centers have grown along with the road networks in the northern part of KMA. Spontaneous growth is noticed in the study area. Urban growth is spreading toward the peripheral areas of Kolkata city over the periods. Therefore, the city and suburban areas have become compact. SLEUTH urban growth model can be considered as a planning-oriented model that would help planners to plan the Kolkata agglomeration city based on future scenarios. Sustainable policies can be introduced in those areas where the compact urbanization challenges are more.

TI  - Spatial Indicators As A Tool To Support The Decision-Making Process In Relation To Different Goals Of Rural Planning
AB  - Indicators based on the application of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques are widely used at all levels of spatial policy. The bulk of studies undertaken have involved examinations of urban and peri-urban areas, but only a few of them have been developed in relation to rural areas. To address this gap, the current paper aims to analyse Spatial Planning Indicators (SPI) based on the data obtained from spatial databases with reference to four scales: rural municipalities, rural villages, public rural spaces and singular building plot from the point of view of supporting the decision-making process. A review of the relevant literature (102 papers) enabled the selection of a set of indices applied for four specific purposes of spatial planning including: (1) landscape/ecological values; (2) sustainability development; (3) risk assessment; and (4) spatial dimension of urbanisation. Then, SPI were calculated in relation to four spatial scales of Spiczyn municipality (Poland). The effectiveness analysis was conducted based on five criteria related to relevance, measurability and applicability. Generally, the analysis demonstrated that the effectiveness of different kinds of indices depends strongly on each specific field of application, and they were found to be more relevant in large geographic regions than smaller ones. These findings indicate the need for the careful selection of SPI to obtain an adequate dataset that is useful for the management of rural areas. Each spatial scale required separate consideration when drawing conclusions with regard to land use planning and the elaboration of relevant indices.

TI  - Preliminary Analysis To Estimate The Spatial Distribution Of Benefits Of P Load Reduction: Identifying The Spatial Influence Of Phosphorus Loading From The Maumee River (Usa) In Western Lake Erie
AB  - Since the early 2000s, Lake Erie has been experiencing annual cyanobacterial blooms that often cover large portions of the western basin and even reach into the central basin. These blooms have affected several ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie to surrounding communities (notably drinking water quality). Several modeling efforts have identified the springtime total bioavailable phosphorus (TBP) load as a major driver of maximum cyanobacterial biomass in western Lake Erie, and on this basis, international water management bodies have set a phosphorus (P) reduction goal. This P reduction goal is intended to reduce maximum cyanobacterial biomass, but there has been very limited effort to identify the specific locations within the western basin of Lake Erie that will likely experience the most benefits. Here, we used pixel-specific linear regression to identify where annual variation in spring TBP loads is most strongly associated with cyanobacterial abundance, as inferred from satellite imagery. Using this approach, we find that annual TBP loads are most strongly associated with cyanobacterial abundance in the central and southern areas of the western basin. At the location of the Toledo water intake, the association between TBP load and cyanobacterial abundance is moderate, and in Maumee Bay (near Toledo, Ohio), the association between TBP and cyanobacterial abundance is no better than a null model. Both of these locations are important for the delivery of specific ecosystem services, but this analysis indicates that P load reductions would not be expected to substantially improve maximum annual cyanobacterial abundance in these locations. These results are preliminary in the sense that only a limited set of models were tested in this analysis, but these results illustrate the importance of identifying whether the spatial distribution of management benefits (in this case P load reduction) matches the spatial distribution of management goals (reducing the effects of cyanobacteria on important ecosystem services).

TI  - Avoidable Mortality Attributable To Anthropogenic Fine Particulate Matter (Pm2.5) In Australia
AB  - Ambient fine particulate matter <2.5 _m(PM2.5) air pollution increases premature mortality globally. Some PM2.5 is natural, but anthropogenic PM2.5 is comparatively avoidable. We determined the impact of long-term exposures to the anthropogenic PM component on mortality in Australia. PM2.5-attributable deaths were calculated for all Australian Statistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 2310) regions. All-cause death rates from Australian mortality and population databases were combined with annual anthropogenic PM2.5 exposures for the years 2006–2016. Relative risk estimates were derived from the literature. Population-weighted average PM2.5 concentrations were estimated in each SA2 using a satellite and land use regression model for Australia. PM2.5-attributable mortality was calculated using a health-impact assessment methodology with life tables and all-cause death rates. The changes in life expectancy (LE) from birth, years of life lost (YLL), and economic cost of lost life years were calculated using the 2019 value of a statistical life. Nationally, long-term populationweighted average total and anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations were 6.5 _g/m3 (min 1.2–max 14.2) and 3.2 _g/m3 (min 0–max 9.5), respectively. Annually, anthropogenic PM2.5-pollution is associated with 2616 (95% confidence intervals 1712, 3455) deaths, corresponding to a 0.2-year (95% CI 0.14, 0.28) reduction in LE for children aged 0–4 years, 38,962 (95%CI 25,391, 51,669) YLL and an average annual economic burden of $6.2 billion (95%CI $4.0 billion, $8.1 billion). We conclude that the anthropogenic PM2.5-related costs of mortality in Australia are higher than community standards should allow, and reductions in emissions are recommended to achieve avoidable mortality. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - National Empirical Models Of Air Pollution Using Microscale Measures Of The Urban Environment
AB  - National-scale empirical models of air pollution (e.g., Land Use Regression) rely on predictor variables (e.g., population density, land cover) at different geographic scales. These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables. ML-K and microscale variables show promise for improving national empirical models. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Contemporary Fire Regimes Provide A Critical Perspective On Restoration Needs In The Mexico-United States Borderlands
AB  - The relationship between people and wildfire has always been paradoxical: fire is an essential ecological process and management tool, but can also be detrimental to life and property. Consequently, fire regimes have been modified throughout history through both intentional burning to promote benefits and active suppression to reduce risks. Reintroducing fire and its benefits back into the Sky Island mountains of the United States-Mexico borderlands has the potential to reduce adverse effects of altered fire regimes and build resilient ecosystems and human communities. To help guide regional fire restoration, we describe the frequency and severity of recent fires over a 32-year period (1985-2017) across a vast binational region in the United States-Mexico borderlands and assess variation in fire frequency and severity across climate gradients and in relation to vegetation and land tenure classes. We synthesize relevant literature on historical fire regimes within 9 major vegetation types and assess how observed contemporary fire characteristics vary from expectations based on historical patterns. Less than 28\% of the study area burned during the observation period, excluding vegetation types in warmer climates that are not adapted to fire (eg, Desertscrub and Thornscrub). Average severity of recent fires was low despite some extreme outliers in cooler, wetter environments. Midway along regional temperature and precipitation gradients, approximately 64\% of Pine-Oak Forests burned at least once, with fire frequencies that mainly corresponded to historical expectations on private lands in Mexico but less so on communal lands, suggesting the influence of land management. Fire frequency was higher than historical expectations in extremely cool and wet environments that support forest types such as Spruce-Fir, indicating threats to these systems possibly attributable to drought and other factors. In contrast, fires were absent or infrequent across large areas of Woodlands (similar to 73\% unburned) and Grasslands (similar to 88\% unburned) due possibly to overgrazing, which reduces abundance and continuity of fine fuels needed to carry fire. Our findings provide a new depiction of fire regimes in the Sky Islands that can help inform fire management, restoration, and regional conservation planning, fostered by local and traditional knowledge and collaboration among landowners and managers.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Mapping Of Northeast Coastal Districts Of Tamil Nadu India Using Multi-Source Geospatial Data And Machine Learning Techniques
AB  - Flooding is one of the most challenging and important natural disasters to predict, it is becoming more frequent and more intense. The study area is badly damaged by devastating flood in 2015. We assessed the flood susceptibility to northern coastal area of Tamil Nadu using various machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost (XGB), Rotation Forest (RTF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used to demarcate flooded areas using Sentinel-l and other multi-source geospatial data to generate influential factors. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) removes weak factors in this study. The flood susceptibility resultant map is classified into five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The GBM algorithm attained high classification accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 92%. The study area is urbanized and vulnerable identifying flood inundation useful for effective planning and implementation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Flood Mapping And Damage Assessment Due To The Super Cyclone Yaas Using Google Earth Engine In Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, India
AB  - This study maps flood inundation and estimates the damage caused by super cyclone Yaas in Purba Medinipur, India. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create a flood inundation map of the research area using pre and post-cyclone Sentinel-1 SAR data. Using ESRI 2020 land cover data, flood damage was analysed. The flood affected 5% (239.69 km2) of the land of Purba Medinipur. The northern and southern regions were affected the most. 95% and 3% of the total flooded area are comprised of agricultural and vegetation, respectively. Kolaghat (24 km2) and Nandigram-II (1 km2) sustained the greatest damage to both agriculture and vegetation. The areas below 18 m were impacted by flooding, with the worst damage occurring below 5 m. The GEE platform was cost-effective, efficient, and faster at calculating with enhanced precision. The outcomes of this study will aid in the management of cyclone-induced hazards. We advocate planting native and salt-tolerant crops to reduce flood damage. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Scale-Dependent Responses Of Ecosystem Service Trade-Offs To Urbanization In Erhai Lake Basin, China
AB  - Urbanization is an important factor affecting ecosystem services (ESs) and their trade-offs. However, little is known about the responses of ES trade-offs to urbanization at different scales. Here, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model was used to evaluate water yield (WY), water purification (WP), carbon storage (CS), and habitat quality (HQ) in Erhai Lake Basin using earth observation data, and the percentage of urban land (PUL), population density (POP), gross domestic product (GDP), and night light index (NLI) were used as urbanization indicators. We quantified the ES trade-offs using the root mean square error and analyzed spatiotemporal changes in urbanization indicators, ESs, and their trade-offs. Finally, we characterized the relationship between urbanization and ES trade-offs using correlation analysis and curve regression at the grid and town scales. From 2000 to 2020, values of PUL/GDP/NLI/POP were high in the south and low in the north; specifically, they were 15, 8, 2, and 0.42 times higher in the south than in the north, respectively. The urban expansion area in the Erhai Basin from 2000 to 2020 resulted in a 123.24\% and 77.03\% increase in WY and WP, respectively, and a 32.38\% and 100\% decrease in CS and HQ, respectively. The trade-offs between WY and CS and between WY and HQ increased, and other ES trade-offs decreased. Urbanization was significantly correlated with most ES trade-offs at the grid scale, but not at the town scale. There was a significant positive correlation between all urbanization indicators and the trade-off between CS and WP (p < 0.05), and the magnitude of the correlation increased with scale. The relationship between ES trade-offs and urbanization was mostly U-shaped and inverted U-shaped at the grid scale, but N-shaped and inverted N-shaped at the town scale. This study provides information that could be used for multi-scale urban planning.

TI  - Local Topographic Wetness Indices Predict Household Malaria Risk Better Than Land-Use And Land-Cover In The Western Kenya Highlands
AB  - Background: Identification of high-risk malaria foci can help enhance surveillance or control activities in regions where they are most needed. Associations between malaria risk and land-use/land-cover are well-recognized, but these environmental characteristics are closely interrelated with the land's topography (e. g., hills, valleys, elevation), which also influences malaria risk strongly. Parsing the individual contributions of land-cover/land-use variables to malaria risk requires examining these associations in the context of their topographic landscape. This study examined whether environmental factors like land-cover, land-use, and urban density improved malaria risk prediction based solely on the topographically-determined context, as measured by the topographic wetness index. Methods: The topographic wetness index, an estimate of predicted water accumulation in a defined area, was generated from a digital terrain model of the landscape surrounding households in two neighbouring western Kenyan highland communities. Variables determined to best encompass the variance in this topographic wetness surface were calculated at a household level. Land-cover/land-use information was extracted from a high-resolution satellite image using an object-based classification method. Topographic and land-cover variables were used individually and in combination to predict household-level malaria in the communities through an iterative split-sample model fitting and testing procedure. Models with only topographic variables were compared to those with additional predictive factors related to land-cover/land-use to investigate whether these environmental factors improved prediction of malaria based on the shape of the land alone. Results: Variables related to topographic wetness proved most useful in predicting the households of individuals contracting malaria in this region of rugged terrain. Other variables related to human modification of the environment also demonstrated clear associations with household malaria. However, these land-cover/land-use variables failed to produce unambiguous improvements in statistical predictive models controlling for important topographic factors, with none improving prediction of household-level malaria more than 75\% of the time. Conclusions: Topographic wetness values in this region of highly varied terrain more accurately predicted houses at greater risk of malaria than did consideration of land-cover/land-use characteristics. As such, those planning control or local elimination strategies in similar highland regions may use topographic and geographic characteristics to effectively identify high-receptivity regions that may require enhanced vigilance.

TI  - Science Opportunities With Solar Sailing Smallsats
AB  - Recently, we witnessed how the synergy of small satellite technology and solar sailing propulsion enables new missions. Together, small satellites with lightweight instruments and solar sails offer affordable access to deep regions of the solar system, also making it possible to realize hard-to-reach trajectories that are not constrained to the ecliptic plane. Combining these two technologies can drastically reduce travel times within the solar system, while delivering robust science. With solar sailing propulsion capable of reaching the velocities of similar to 5-10 AU/yr, missions using a rideshare launch may reach the Jovian system in two years, Saturn in three. The same technologies could allow reaching solar polar orbits in less than two years. Fast, cost-effective, and maneuverable sailcraft that may travel outside the ecliptic plane open new opportunities for affordable solar system exploration, with great promise for heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics. Such missions could be modularized to reach different destinations with different sets of instruments. Benefiting from this progress, we present the "Sundiver" concept, offering novel possibilities for the science community. We discuss some of the key technologies, the current design of the Sundiver sailcraft vehicle and innovative instruments, along with unique science opportunities that these technologies enable, especially as this exploration paradigm evolves. We formulate policy recommendations to allow national space agencies, industry, and other stakeholders to establish a strong scientific, programmatic, and commercial focus, enrich and deepen the space enterprise and broaden its advocacy base by including the Sundiver paradigm as a part of broader space exploration efforts.

TI  - Covid-19 Lockdown And The Impact On Mobility, Air Quality, And Utility Consumption: A Case Study From Sharjah, United Arab Emirates
AB  - This study presents an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on people's mobility trends, air quality, and utility consumption in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Records of lockdown and subsequent easing measures, infection and vaccination rates, community mobility reports, remotely sensed and ground-based air quality data, and utility (electricity, water, and gas) consumption data were collected and analyzed in the study. The mobility trends reflected the stringency of the lockdown measures, increasing in the residential sector but decreasing in all other sectors. The data showed significant improvement in air quality corresponding to the lockdown measures in 2020 followed by gradual deterioration as the lockdown measures were eased. Electricity and water consumption increased in the residential sector during the lockdown; however, overall utility consumption did not show significant changes. The changes in mobility were correlated with the relevant air quality parameters, such as NO2, which in turn was highly correlated to O-3. The study provides data and analysis to support future planning and response efforts in Sharjah. Furthermore, the methodology used in the study can be applied to assess the impacts of COVID-19 or similar events on people's mobility, air quality and utility consumption at other geographical locations.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution And Driving Mechanism Of Green Economic Efficiency At County Level In The Yellow River Delta, China
AB  - A comprehensive measurement of green economic efficiency in the Yellow River Delta region can provide a reference basis for achieving ecological protection and high-quality development. We constructed an evaluation system of green economic efficiency in counties based on multi-source remote sensing data. We adopted the Super-EBM model that considered non-expected output to make a comprehensive measurement of green economic efficiency in Yellow River Delta counties, used the kernel density function estimation method to portray the characteristics of spatial and temporal evolution, and finally used the system generalized moment estimation method to identify influen-cing factors. The results showed that the comprehensive efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the green economy in the Yellow River Delta counties showed a fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2015. The scale efficiency showed a rapid increase and then stayed stable in a 'Γ' type trend, while the increase in comprehensive efficiency transformed from being driven by scale-technology to being led by technology. The comprehensive efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the green economy in the Yellow River Delta counties showed an evolutionary trend from 'club convergence' to 'overall convergence', with the low efficiency counties formed a 'catch-up effect' on the high efficiency counties and the scale efficiency toward a balanced and smooth development. The comprehensive efficiency of green economy and its decomposition efficiency spatially formed a 'mountain' pattern, which was high in the middle, low in the two wings, and the high value area concentrated in the headland of the Yellow River Delta and along the coast of Laizhou Bay. The high-value area showed the characteristics of a northwest-southeast shift, and the east and west wings of the Yellow River Delta formed low-value subsidence areas. Industrial structure, population concentration level, and fixed asset investment intensity had positive effects on green economic efficiency, while population urbanization rate had negative effects on green economic efficiency. There was an obvious 'environmental Kuznets' effect between green economic efficiency and economic development level. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Physical Landscapes
AB  - The scientific discipline of geomorphology is concerned with the processes that act upon and shape the Earth's surface to create physical landscapes. Maps have a very specific utility within this domain as they allow a spatial representation of shapes (or landforms), their material composition, age and the processes that formed them. From the creation of the very first geomorphological maps in the early 1900s, there has been continual development and increased sophistication in the representation of complex datasets. The implementation of geographical information systems, integrated with the widespread availability of satellite imagery and digital elevation models has enabled much greater application across a range of disciplines beyond geomorphology, notably in natural hazard evaluation, disaster response assessment, insurance, infrastructure planning, civil engineering and engineering geology. This chapter provides a brief outline of the development of cartographic techniques where the primary purpose is to provide maps of geomorphology that have met the requirements of different end-users. Initially this involved standard approaches of field mapping and drafting of hardcopy maps but has now developed into the use of much more sophisticated methods of digital data collection and management. This has resulted in significant growth in the use of geomorphological maps, and recognition of their wider societal significance. Whilst geomorphology, by definition, refers to mapping of the Earth's surface, there is increasing use of mapping techniques on planetary bodies across the solar system. The horizons for geomorphological mapping clearly continue to expand and this chapter concludes with a discussion on the future challenges and opportunities within the subject. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2017.

TI  - A Remote Sensing-Based Strategy For Mapping Potentially Toxic Elements Of Soils: Temporal-Spatial-Spectral Covariates Combined With Random Forest
AB  - The selection of predictor variables is a crucial issue in building a digital mapping model of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in soil. Traditionally, the predictor variables for mapping models of soil PTEs have been chosen from sets of spatial parameters or spectral parameters derived from geographical environmental data. However, the enrichment of soil PTEs exhibits significant variations in both spatial and temporal dimensions, with the temporal dimension often being overlooked in the selection of predictor variables for digital mapping models. This limitation hampers the robustness and generalizability of the models. Therefore, multi-source geographical data were used in this study to determine three temporal indices for characterizing the enrichment process of soil PTEs in temporal dimensions, and additionally to construct the temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) covariate combinations. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to map soil PTEs at a regional scale. Results showed that: (1) When using spatial parameters or spectral parameters as predictor variables and measured Pb content as the dependent variable, the values of the model performance indicator RPIQ (ratio of performance to inter-quartile range) were 2.66 and 2.27, respectively. After incorporating the temporal parameters into the model input, values of RPIQ for the RF model reached 3.55 (using spatial-temporal covariates) and 3.21 (using spectral temporal covariates), representing performance improvements of 33.46\% and 41.41\%, respectively. (2) The RF model constructed with the temporal-spatial-spectral covariates achieved satisfactory mapping accuracy (R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.80 mg kg- 1; RPIQ = 4.09). (3) The soil Pb content in the western and northeastern regions was relatively high, while the remaining areas exhibited lower Pb levels, mainly due to industrial activities. (4) The mapping results of Pb obtained in this study were superior to other mapping methods, such as ordinary kriging, artificial neural networks, and multivariate linear regression methods. The soil PTE mapping technique employed in this study that combined TSS covariates with the RF provided an effective methodological approach for preventing soil pollution, controlling environmental risk, and improving soil management.

TI  - Applying Information Theory And Gis-Based Quantitative Methods To Produce Landslide Susceptibility Maps In Nancheng County, China
AB  - The main objective of the present study was to produce a landslide susceptibility map by implementing a novel methodology that combines Information Theory and GIS-based methods for the Nancheng County, China, an area with numerous reported landslide events. Specifically, the information coefficient that is estimated from Shannon's entropy index was used to determine the number of classes of each landslide-related variable that maximizes the information coefficient, while three methods, logistic regression, weight of evidence, and random forest algorithm, were implemented to produce the landslide susceptibility map. The comparison of the various models was based on the assessment of a database of 112 past landslide events, which were divided randomly into a training dataset (70 \%) and a validation dataset (30 \%). The identification of the areas affected was established by analyzing airborne imagery, extensive field investigation, and the examination of previous research studies, while the morphometric variables were derived using remote sensing technology. The geo-environmental conditions in those locations were analyzed regarding their susceptibility to slide. In particular, 11 variables were analyzed: lithology, altitude, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, profile curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to faults, and distance to roads. The comparison and validation of the outcomes of each model were achieved using statistical evaluation measures, the receiving operating characteristic, and the area under the success and predictive rate curves. Each model gave similar outcomes; however, the random forest model had a slightly higher predictive performance in terms of area under the curve (0.9220) against the ones estimated for the weight of evidence (0.9090) and the logistic regression model (0.8940). The same pattern of performance was reported when the success power of the models was calculated. Random forest was slightly better than the other two models in terms of area under the curve (0.9350) in comparison with the weight of evidence (0.9255) and logistic regression (0.9097). The predictive performance was estimated by using the validation dataset, while the success power of the models was estimated by using the training dataset. From the visual inspection of the produced landslide susceptibility maps, the most susceptible areas are located at the west and east mountainous areas, while moderate to low susceptibility values characterize the central area.

TI  - Coastal Oyster Aquaculture Area Extraction And Nutrient Loading Estimation Using A Gf-2 Satellite Image
AB  - The accurate extraction of an aquaculture area is significant in aquaculture management, post-disaster evaluation, and aquatic environment protection. However, little attention has been paid to the aquaculture area extraction in coastal water with high turbidity. In this study, based on the spectral and geospatial features of aquaculture cages in complex coastal water with varying turbidity, we proposed a new aquaculture area extraction method using a Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite image with 0.8-m spatial resolution. The water was classified into clear, medium, and high turbidity categories according to the suspended sediment concentration derived from the inversion of the GF-2 image. Different rules of extraction were developed with respect to those three categories of water body: First, the normalized difference water index threshold was set for the clear water, second, a ratio index (R = Green/NIR) was established for the medium turbid water body, and third, for the turbid water body, feature analysis with a specified classification rule was established. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method worked well, with the high accuracies of 87.3300\% for the overall accuracy, even for the high turbidity water. The kappa coefficient was 0.7375, which was much better than the kappa coefficient values of the three conventional classification methods represented in this article. This study provides effective information support and auxiliary decision analysis for management departments to scientifically plan and environmentally manage coastal aquaculture areas.

TI  - Land Use And Land Cover Changes In The Brazilian Cerrado: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Assess The Impacts Of Agricultural Expansion
AB  - Expansion of agricultural lands have shaped Brazilian Cerrado landscapes in recent decades; however, the environmental consequences of these transformations are still poorly assessed. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach used to assess historical land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their impacts on the environment in southeast Mato Grosso State, a region where the Cerrado has been intensively converted into agricultural lands. The methodology encompassed three main stages: (1) quantifying LULC changes using remote sensing data, (2) assessing LULC change impacts on vulnerable lands (e.g. erosion prone areas and wetlands), and (3) summarizing preceding information into key environmental indicators, assessed within the Pressure-State-Response framework (PSR) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The results indicated a drastic landscape transformation in the selected area, which evolved from predominantly vegetated to a consolidated agricultural region. Crops expanded at high rates from 1985 to 1995, occupying the majority of the lands suited for agriculture. In the following decade, crops continued to expand and encroached into fragile environments (e.g. wetlands and more erodible soils). As a result, from 1985 to 2005, the area lost approximately 42\% of its natural vegetation and erosion risks increased significantly. Our integration of land-use change information with intrinsic environmental vulnerabilities allowed a deeper understanding of LULC changes consequences and provided environmental indicators. This offered a synoptic view of how LULC changes occurred and how they affected the environment at a landscape scale. Furthermore, the assessment of the indicators using the PSR framework, helped to clarify cause-effect relationships thus furnishing key information of value to decision-makers and future comparisons with other areas.

TI  - From Local To Regional: Functional Diversity In Differently Managed Alpine Grasslands
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that ecosystem functions are strongly linked to morphological plant traits, like specific leaf area (SLA) and its variability, which serve as a proxy of functional diversity (FD). Functional diversity is rarely studied at regional scales, and its scale dependence is poorly understood. Capturing trait variations at distinct spatial scales and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging, mainly because a limited number of trait measurements are available and field campaigns are time-consuming. Here, we derived alpha- and beta-FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular absorption profiles of leaves in canopies. We inverted the 1-D columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel-2 reflectance data at canopy level. From the inversion we were able to distinguish different alpine management types based on retrieved SLA. Model uncertainties were mainly related to the different local plant communities, here represented by functional diversity indices and community-weighted means of traits. Thus, successful PROSAIL application was affected by management type. Management categories displaying lower alpha-FD, like mowed and fertilized, delivered the most reliable results. Further, we compared FD (i.e., richness, evenness, divergence) from local to regional scales. Locally, management determines the magnitude of FD, whereas on a regional scale, parcel size and the uniformity of agricultural practices control trait diversity. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying beta-FD from space as it delivers additional information on the impact of management types, differing from locally measured alpha-FD values.

TI  - Mi Risk Score Algorithm Early Rule-Out And Rule-In Strategies For Myocardial Infarction
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chest pain comprise a large proportion of emergency presentations and place a major burden on healthcare resources. Therefore, efforts to safely and rapidly identify those with and without acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are needed. The challenge for clinicians is to accurately identify patients with acute coronary syndromes, while balancing the need to safely and rapidly reassure and discharge those without serious conditions. CONTENT: This review summarizes the evidence to date on optimum accelerated strategies for the rule-in and rule-out of AMI, using strategies focused on optimum use of troponin results. Evidence based on both sensitive and highly sensitive troponin assay results is presented. The use of novel biomarkers is also addressed and the combination of biomarkers with other clinical information in accelerated diagnostic strategies is discussed. SUMMARY: The majority of patients, who are not at risk of myocardial infarction or other serious harm, may be suitable for discharge directly from the emergency setting using approaches focused on troponin algorithms and accelerated diagnostic protocols. Evidence about the clinical and health economic impact of use of such strategies is needed, as they may have major benefits for both patients and healthcare providers. © 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

TI  - Multi-Year Mapping Of Maize And Sunflower In Hetao Irrigation District Of China With High Spatial And Temporal Resolution Vegetation Index Series
AB  - Crop identification in large irrigation districts is important for crop yield estimation, hydrological simulation, and agricultural water management. Remote sensing provides an opportunity to visualize crops in the regional scale. However, the use of coarse resolution remote sensing images for crop identification usually causes great errors due to the presence of mixed pixels in regions with complex planting structure of crops. Therefore, it is preferable to use remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolutions in crop identification. This study aimed to map multi-year distributions of major crops (maize and sunflower) in Hetao Irrigation District, the third largest irrigation district in China, using HJ-1A/1B CCD images with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to find the NDVI characteristics and phenological metrics for both maize and sunflower. Nine combinations of NDVI characteristics and phenological metrics were compared to obtain the optimal classifier to map maize and sunflower from 2009 to 2015. Results showed that the classification ellipse with the NDVI characteristic of the left inflection point in the NDVI curve and the phenological metric from the left inflection point to the peak point normalized, with mean values of corresponding grassland indexes achieving the minimum mean relative error of 10.82\% for maize and 4.38\% for sunflower. The corresponding Kappa coefficient was 0.62. These results indicated that the vegetation and phenology-based classifier using HJ-1A/1B data could effectively identify multi-year distribution of maize and sunflower in the study region. It was found that maize was mainly distributed in the middle part of the irrigation district (Hangjinhouqi and Linhe), while sunflower mainly in the east part (Wuyuan). The planting sites of sunflower had been gradually expanded from Wuyuan to the north part of Hangjinhouqi and Linhe. These results were in agreement with the local economic policy. Results also revealed the increasing trends of both maize and sunflower planting areas during the study period.

TI  - How Do Street Attributes Affect Willingness-To-Walk? City-Wide Pedestrian Route Choice Analysis Using Big Data From Boston And San Francisco
AB  - This study adds to the nascent but growing literature on the use of big data for pedestrian route choice analysis. We explore behavioral preferences for various route attributes in Boston, MA using a large dataset of GPS trajectories (n = 11,165) sourced from a third-party smartphone app. Although the data are anonymized and limit our exploration of user heterogeneity, the sample size and area coverage are both much larger than seen in most previous studies. We estimate route choice preferences using a path size logit model, and operationalize the coefficients for policy-making through ‘willingness-to-walk’ measures. The value of these measures is demonstrated through an application of computing pedestrian accessibility to transit stations. Additionally, we compare our findings to a previous study in San Francisco, CA using similar data and methods, and previous literature to explore similarities and differences in pedestrian route choice behavior across major metropolitan areas more generally. While our findings can inform walkability policy and practice on several counts, we recommend future efforts to focus on supplementing this study by surveying hard-to-reach populations for more equitable policy-making. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An Eco-Hydrological Model-Based Assessment Of The Impacts Of Soil And Water Conservation Management In The Jinghe River Basin, China
AB  - Many soil and water conservation (SWC) measures have been applied in the Jinghe River Basin to decrease soil erosion and restore degraded vegetation cover. Analysis of historical streamflow records suggests that SWC measures may have led to declines in streamflow, although climate and human water use may have contributed to observed changes. This paper presents an application of a watershed-scale, physically-based eco-hydrological modelthe Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys)in the Jinghe River Basin to study the impacts of SWC measures on streamflow. Several extensions to the watershed-scale RHESSys model were made in this paper to support the model application at larger scales (>10,000 km(2)) of the Loess Plateau. The extensions include the implementation of in-stream routing, reservoir sub-models and representation of soil and water construction engineering (SWCE). Field observation data, literature values and remote sensing data were used to calibrate and verify the model parameters. Three scenarios were simulated and the results were compared to quantify both vegetation recovery and SWCE impacts on streamflow. Three scenarios respectively represent no SWC, vegetation recovery only and both vegetation recovery and SWCE. The model results demonstrate that the SWC decreased annual streamflow by 8\% (0.1 billion m(3)), with the largest decrease occurring in the 2000s. Model estimates also suggest that SWCE has greater impacts than vegetation recovery. Our study provides a useful tool for SWC planning and management in this region.

TI  - Quantifying The Severity Of Phytophthora Root Rot Disease In Avocado Trees Using Image Analysis
AB  - Phytophthora root rot (PRR) infects the roots of avocado trees, resulting in reduced uptake of water and nutrients, canopy decline, defoliation, and, eventually, tree mortality. Typically, the severity of PRR disease (proportion of canopy decline) is assessed by visually comparing the canopy health of infected trees to a standardised set of photographs and a corresponding disease rating. Although this visual method provides some indication of the spatial variability of PRR disease across orchards, the accuracy and repeatability of the ranking is influenced by the experience of the assessor, the visibility of tree canopies, and the timing of the assessment. This study evaluates two image analysis methods that may serve as surrogates to the visual assessment of canopy decline in large avocado orchards. A smartphone camera was used to collect red, green, and blue (RGB) colour images of individual trees with varying degrees of canopy decline, with the digital photographs then analysed to derive a canopy porosity percentage using a combination of Canny edge detection' and Otsu's' methods. Coinciding with the on-ground measure of canopy porosity, the canopy reflectance characteristics of the sampled trees measured by high resolution Worldview-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery was also correlated against the observed disease severity rankings. Canopy porosity values (ranging from 20-70\%) derived from RGB images were found to be significantly different for most disease rankings (p < 0.05) and correlated well (R-2 = 0.89) with the differentiation of three disease severity levels identified to be optimal. From the WV-3 imagery, a multivariate stepwise regression of 18 structural and pigment-based vegetation indices found the simplified ratio vegetation index (SRVI) to be strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.96) with the disease rankings of PRR disease severity, with the differentiation of four levels of severity found to be optimal.

TI  - Spatial Water Footprint Optimization Of Crop Planting: A Fuzzy Multiobjective Optimal Approach Based On Mod16 Evapotranspiration Products
AB  - Agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time. To improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production, this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting. This study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information, and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets, spatial water footprint, and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty. To test its feasibility, the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi-arid region in Northwest China. Three performance evaluation indicators, including synthetic degree (SD), sustainability index (SI), and approximation degree of ideal objective value (AD), are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies. Results show that (1) the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation, and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial; (2) the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream with high precipitation, which can improve economic benefit, increase utilization rate of green water, and fairness of allocation; (3) through optimization, the average total, blue, and gray water footprint among IDs are drop while green water utilization rates is raised comparing with status quo (2014); (4) Water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy, society and environment, but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives. The proposed optimal modeling framework can help optimize the spatial water footprint of crop planting and improve irrigation water use efficiency, which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity.

TI  - Prediction Of Water Depth In Paddy Fields Using Water Index Calculated From Images Taken By Uav
AB  - If the spatial characteristics of rice paddies and waterways in relation to water management-specifically, water-depth-can be grasped in an areal and timely manner, then an important environmental consideration for aquatic organism habitat analysis can hence be used. This study verifies whether the water-depths of paddy fields and waterways can be successfully predicted using water indices calculated using a low-altitude-remote-sensing（LARS）approach. A DJI Matrice 300 system equipped with a MicaSense Altum was attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle（UAV）and used to capture images of paddy fields in Sogabe, Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture. The resulting images were processed using photogrammetry to produce orthomosaic representations. A normalized difference water index（NDWI）was calculated from near-infrared and green wavelengths, with water-depths of subject paddy fields and waterways then accordingly measured within 1 h immediately after the capturing the image using the UAV. The NDWI's of the water-depth measurement points were extracted using geographic-information-system technology, with a linear regression equation and coefficient of determination between water-depth and NDWI ultimately calculated. NDWI values were relatively high for flooded paddy fields and there were NDWI differences even for paddy fields with only a single section. Moreover, NDWI values were relatively high for waterways, indicating that NDWI's can be used to help understand the heterogeneity of water-depths within paddy fields and evacuated water areas, such as waterways. Although predicting the water depth by generalizing one regression equation and collectively predicting water-depths during an entire irrigation season through the methods used in this study is difficult, accurately assessing individual-case water-depths depending on paddy field conditions within a discrete study area, especially during the frog breeding season and the start of mid-drying season is possible. Such determinations will ultimately provide critical data in support of new aquatic habitat evaluations for a variety of Kyoto Prefecture wetland settings. © 2023 Ecology and Civil Engineering Society.

TI  - Seasonal Change And Spatial Distribution Of Traffic Noise In Seferihisar, Turkey
AB  - In this study, traffic noise in Seferihisar, which is a holiday resort by the Aegean Sea in the West of Turkey, was investigated. The noise occurring in summer and winter, on weekdays, and at weekends was mapped separately. Besides, land uses exposed to traffic noise were specified. In the carried out method, the land uses were primarily mapped by using the satellite images of the study area. Then, the noise was measured at 46 points during ten days in summer and winter, on weekdays and at weekends, and it was mapped by using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method and by means of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The measurements were taken in the daytime (07: 00-19: 00), in the evening (19: 00-23: 00), and at night (23: 00-07: 00) as stated in the Turkish Regulation of Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise. Since the time interval of the daytime measurements was large, the noise was measured in three different periods for the daytime measurements. In the formation of noise maps, logarithmic averages of all measurements taken at each point were used. The noise maps were overlapped with the land use maps by the help of the GIS techniques; the land use affected by the noise was analyzed. The results showed that the road traffic noise varied from summer to winter seasons in the study area depending on heavy or light traffic. The noise occurring in summer showed an increase both on weekdays and at weekends. While the limit value was exceeded in 49 of the measurement averages taken in winter, the limit value was exceeded in 96 measurements taken in summer. The noise maps formed according to the IDW method displayed that the areas in which the limit value was exceeded in the daytime in summer took up 14.27\% of the study area while this rate went down to 4.06\% in winter. The study area is one of the most important destinations for summer holiday. 20.12\% of the area that exceeded the limit value in summer was builtup and 10.69\% of them was tourism area. The noise together with population and traffic that increase in summer season is an important environmental problem against which some precautions should be taken. The findings of the study present significant results which might guide local governments in preventing and managing the noise.

TI  - Monitoring The Spatiotemporal Changes In Regional Ecosystem Health: A Case Study In Izmir, Turkey
AB  - The maintenance of human well-being and development is dependent on ecosystem goods and services. However, natural ecosystems and biodiversity have been disturbed by human activities. Therefore, assessment of ecosystem health has become one of the main topics in landscape management. The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of land use/land cover (LULC) change on regional ecosystem health (REH) in Izmir, Turkey. The study used the vigour, organization and resilience model together with potential ecosystem services to understand the relationships between LULC structure, ecosystems and human activities using the most populous and urbanized parts of Izmir metropolitan city. For this purpose, the CORINE land cover maps and Landsat satellite images for 1990 and 2018 were used. Our results showed that there was an increase in the mean regional ecosystem health value (from 48.06 to 49.32) during 1990-2018, but it changed in an inconsistent way in the different parts of the study area. The urban sprawl type and the presence of vegetation were important factors affecting the overall REH value. The spatiotemporal LULC changes were effective on all the ecosystem health indicators. Among all the ecosystem health indicators, ecosystem vigour and resilience were the most important factors positively affected the REH level in highly urbanized districts. Overall, our study showed that whilst the gains in vegetation between urban and rural areas enhanced the ecosystem vigour and resilience during 1990-2018, they have also improved the regional health of districts located along the coastal parts of the study area.

Several studies have developed to evaluate the LST and its drivers in the world, but few of them have addressed the annual and seasonal effects in urban areas located in tropical regions. This study assesses the spatiotemporal relationship between LST, green vegetation cover, and built-up areas in Brasília, Federal District, Brazil. We used time series of Landsat images (2000–2019) to retrieve the LST and compare it with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and surface urban heat island (SUHI). Based on our results, the NDVI values increased from 0.46 to 0.58 between 2000 and 2019. A similar increasing trend was observed for LST (24.9 °C in 2000; 32.4 °C in 2019), which indicates that the magnitude of increase of urban vegetation cover was not able to reduce LST. The highest average LST and SUHI values were observed during local spring season (September to December; 41.9 °C and −3.2 °C, respectively). During the autumn (March to June) and winter (June to September) seasons, we observed a progressive increasing trend of the LST values. The NDVI explained 80% of the surface temperature variation within areas of native vegetation and 53% in urban areas. Based on our assessment of the spatiotemporal changes of the LST as a function of normalized difference vegetation and urban spectral indices, we provided crucial information to support urban green cover planning and management that, ultimately, will improve the population's well-being. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Improving Daily Precipitation Estimation In The Data Scarce Area By Merging Rain Gauge And Trmm Data With A Transfer Learning Framework
AB  - Merging the satellite and gauge precipitation has been proofed as an efficient approach to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation. However, for areas with few and unevenly distributed rain gauges, accurate precipitation estimation still remains challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework to improve precipitation estimation for the data scarce area based on transfer learning. Taking the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as a representative case study, we used two transfer learning methods (fine-tuning, domain-adversarial neural network (DANN)) to transfer precipitation fusion model from the source domain to the target domain. Results indicate that in comparison with the original TRMM data, the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the merged precipitation in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during 2001-2005 are reduced by 27.6 \% and 22.5 \% by using the fine-tuning method, and reduced by 29.4 \% and 21.5 \% by using the DANN method, respectively. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient (CC) is increased from 0.54 (TRMM data-rain gauge data) to 0.65 (merged data-rain gauge data). The performances of the proposed methods vary spatially, with CC decreased from southeast (0.80) to northwest (<0.40) of the study area. The DANN method performed well on different precipitation intensities, while Swish loss function can help DANN achieve better results on extreme precipitation estimation, with RMSE and MAE reduced by 2.5 \% and 4.5 \% respectively. The performances of the proposed methods are affected by various factors such as source domain selection and the length of study period. Findings imply that transfer learning provides new insights and new methods to improve precipitation estimation for the data scarce area, which would benefit regional water-related disaster defense and water resources management.

TI  - Effect Of Watershed Land Use On Water Quality: A Case Study In Corrego Da Olaria Basin, Sao Paulo State, Brazil
AB  - The water quality is related to the hydrologic and limnologic properties of ground and surface water, and significant efforts have been made to monitor water sources to understand the effects of land use changes in agricultural areas, with significant socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the qualitative aspects of surface water in subbasins related to land use. Samples were analyzed in terms of physical and chemical parameters on monthly discrete water quality sampling in four representative sites at first order subbasin streams, located at the Polo Regional Centro Norte, Pindorama County, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The land use classification was made by visual detection technique in a multispectral satellite data obtained from LandSat8- spectral bands of the OLI sensor. The watershed was classified into major land cover/use classes and overlay maps generated in ArcGIS 10 indicated a significant shift from natural vegetation to agriculture activities. Water quality monitoring was according to the brazilian protocol and the results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA). The values obtained differ significantly at each sampling point - subbasins, reflecting the effects of land use on water quality. Soil conservation management is important to optimize soil use in order to contribute to the control of water pollution and the formulation of a public policy is necessary for the conservation of water and soil resources.

TI  - Rationale And Proposed Design For A Mars Sample Return (Msr) Science Program
AB  - The Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign represents one of the most ambitious scientific endeavors ever undertaken. Analyses of the martian samples would offer unique science benefits that cannot be attained through orbital or landed missions that rely only on remote sensing and in situ measurements, respectively. As currently designed, the MSR Campaign comprises a number of scientific, technical, and programmatic bodies and relationships, captured in a series of existing and anticipated documents. Ensuring that all required scientific activities are properly designed, managed, and executed would require significant planning and coordination. Because there are multiple scientific elements that would need to be executed to achieve MSR Campaign success, it is critical to ensure that the appropriate management, oversight, planning, and resources are made available to accomplish them. This could be achieved via a formal MSR Science Management Plan (SMP). A subset of the MSR Science Planning Group 2 (MSPG2)-termed the SMP Focus Group-was tasked to develop inputs for an MSR Campaign SMP. The scope is intended to cover the interface to the Mars 2020 mission, science elements in the MSR flight program, ground-based science infrastructure, MSR science opportunities, and the MSR sample and science data management. In this report, a comprehensive MSR Science Program is proposed that comprises specific science bodies and/or activities that could be implemented to address the science functionalities throughout the MSR Campaign. The proposed structure was designed by taking into consideration previous management review processes, a set of guiding principles, and key lessons learned from previous robotic exploration and sample return missions. The Mars Sample Return (MSR) Campaign represents one of the most ambitious scientific endeavors ever undertaken.

Ensuring that all required scientific activities are properly designed, managed, and executed would require significant planning and coordination.

Because there are so many scientific elements that would need to be executed to achieve MSR Campaign success, it is critical to ensure that the appropriate management, oversight, planning, and resources are made available to accomplish them. To date, however, no dedicated budget lines within NASA and ESA have been made available for these purposes, and no formal MSR Science Management Plan (SMP) has yet been established. It is thus evident that: A joint ESA/NASA MSR Science Program, along with the necessary funding and resources, will be required to accomplish the end-To-end scientific objectives of MSR. To aid in planning, the MSR Science Program requires an overarching SMP to fully describe how it could be implemented to meet the MSR scientific objectives and maximize the overall science return. A subset of the MSR Science Planning Group 2 (MSPG2)-termed the SMP Focus Group-was tasked to develop inputs for the MSR Campaign SMP. The scope covers the interface to the Mars 2020 mission, science elements in the MSR flight program, ground-based science infrastructure, MSR science opportunities, and the MSR sample and science data management. Some of the required bodies and activities already exist; the remainder require definition. In this report, a comprehensive MSR Science Program is proposed, comprising specific science bodies and/or activities that could be implemented to address the science functionalities throughout the MSR Campaign. The proposed structure was designed by taking into consideration previous management review processes, a set of guiding principles, and key lessons learned from previous robotic exploration and sample return missions. While w acknowledge that the proposal is non-unique, that is, other implementations could meet the overall needs of the MSR Campaign, we have striven to optimize efficiencies and eliminate unnecessary overlap wherever possible to reduce the potential cost and complexity of the MSR Science Program. Many elements of the proposed Science Program are interdependent, as the decision to trigger certain bodies or activities depend on reaching key milestones throughout the MSR Campaign. Although the timing of certain elements may be flexible depending on the anticipated date of samples arriving on Earth, it is crucial that others are implemented as soon as is feasible. As a first step, formalizing the Science Program's management structure as soon as possible would ensure that impending time-sensitive trades are conducted, and the resulting decisions are made with adequate scientific input. FINDING SMP-1: A joint science management structure and documented agreements among the MSR Partners are required to coordinate the MSR Science Program elements that are not currently defined in existing structures or documents. FINDING SMP-2: A long-Term ESA/NASA MSR Science Program, along with the necessary funding and human resources, will be required to accomplish the end-To-end scientific objectives of MSR. FINDING SMP-3: The MSR Science Management Plan should be linked to, but not encompass, other required functionalities within the MSR Campaign. Input will be needed to produce formal plans for (at a minimum) curation, planetary protection, data management, and public engagement. FINDING SMP-4: The guiding principles proposed in the MSR Science Planning Group (MSPG) Framework document (2019c) remain appropriate and relevant and should be utilized in drafting the MSR Science Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Science Management Plan. FINDING SMP-5 (a): MSR scientific return would be maximized if participation in the MSR Science Program is not limited to scientists sponsored by existing MSR Partners; rather, opportunities should be provided to scientists from around the world. (b) All programmatic decision-making power (e.g., selection of competitive proposals) would still rest with the Partners. FINDING SMP-6: At the implementation level, the MSR Science Program should, wherever possible, leverage structures, programs, and lessons-learned from previous mission organization to benefit from their experiences to engender familiarity among both decision-makers and the science community. FINDING SMP-7: The MSR Science Program requires the establishment of scientific bodies to meet management, science operations, and public participation needs. These bodies require dedicated funding, addressing scientific functionalities that span the entirety of the MSR Campaign. FINDING SMP-8: Some elements of the MSR Science Program cannot be delayed in the event of an MSR Program schedule delay, as they are linked to key decisions or operations of the Mars 2020 mission. © Timothy Haltigin et al., 2022; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2022.

TI  - Using Landsat Data To Assess Fire And Burn Severity In The North American Boreal Forest Region: An Overview And Summary Of Results
AB  - There has been considerable interest in the recent literature regarding the assessment of post-fire effects on forested areas within the North American boreal forest. Assessing the physical and ecological effects of fire in boreal forests has far-reaching implications for a variety of ecosystem processes - such as post-fire forest succession - and land management decisions. The present paper reviews past assessments and the studies presented in this special issue that have largely been based on the Composite Burn Index and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Results from relating and mapping fire/burn severity within the boreal region have been variable, and are likely attributed, in part, to the wide variability in vegetation and terrain conditions that are characteristic of the region. Satellite remote sensing of post-fire effects alone without proper field calibration should be avoided. A sampling approach combining field and image values of burn condition is necessary for successful mapping of fire/burn severity. Satellite-based assessments of fire/burn severity, and in particular dNBR and related indices, need to be used judiciously and assessed for appropriateness based on the users' need. Issues unique to high latitudes also need to be considered when using satellite-derived information in the boreal forest region.

TI  - The Influence Of Individual-Specific Plant Parameters And Species Composition On The Allergenic Potential Of Urban Green Spaces
AB  - Green planning focusses on specific site requirements such as temperature tolerance or aesthetics as crucial criteria in the choice of plants. The allergenicity of plants, however, is often neglected. Cariñanos et al. (2014; Landscape and Urban Planning, 123: 134-144) developed the Urban Green Zone Allergenicity Index (IUGZA) that considers a variety of plant characteristics to calculate the allergenic potential of urban green spaces. Based on this index, we calculated an index for the individual-specific allergenic potential (IISA) that accounts for a varying foliage volume by accurate measurements of crown heights and surface areas occupied by each tree and only included mature individuals. The studied park, located in Eichstätt, Germany, has an area of 2.2 ha and consists of 231 trees. We investigated the influence of species composition using six planting scenarios and analysed the relationship between allergenic potential and species diversity using Shannon index. Only a small number of trees was female and therefore characterised as non-allergenic, 9% of the trees were classified as sources of main local allergens. The allergenic potential of the park based on literature values for crown height and surface was IUGZA = 0.173. Applying our own measurements resulted in IISA = 0.018. The scenarios indicated that replacing trees considered as sources of main local allergens has the strongest impact on the park's allergenic potential. The IUGZA offers an easy way to assess the allergenic potential of a park by the use of a few calculations. The IISA reduces the high influence of the foliage volume but there are constraints in practicability and in speed of the analysis. Although our study revealed that a greater biodiversity was not necessarily linked to lower index values, urban green planning should focus on biodiversity for ameliorating the allergenic potential of parks. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Use Of A Non-Planning Driving Background Change Methodology To Assess The Land-Use Planning Impact On The Environment
AB  - The implementation of land-use planning (LUP) impacts on the environment and may degrade regional environmental quality due to the changes in land-use patterns. To minimize the environmental impact of non-LUP driven (NPD) land-use background changes (LUBC), we propose an NPD land-use background change (NPDLUBC) methodology to improve the LUP environmental impact assessment (LUPEA) process. With the application of the state-impact-state (SIS) framework and spatial information technologies including remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS), the methodology was tested on the eastern Chinese city of Lianyungang. The results indicate that (1) our proposed methodology is capable of distinguishing the environmental impact in implementing a target LUP, i.e. a LUP scheme to be assessed, from those driven by NPDLUBC; (2) the prediction of NPD Land-use pattern simulated through the discrimination of NPD forces provides the basic data to support the LUPEA using our proposed methodology; (3) SO2, PM10, and COD emitted into the atmosphere and water are the major pollutants considered in the LUPEA of the city; and (4) despite the positive impacts of the comprehensive land-use change under the direction of target LUP, the implementation of LUP would have negative impacts on the regional environment in the entire study area and in individual counties/districts respectively in 2020. Our proposed methodology provides a new and operable way for the areas with data to simulate NPD land-use pattern and predict the individual indicator values for the assessment.

TI  - Evaluating Environmental Influences Of Zoning In Urban Ecosystems With Remote Sensing
AB  - The influence of zoning on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiant surface temperature (T-s) measurements is investigated in the City of Indianapolis, IN, USA using data collected by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) remote sensing system. Analysis of variance indicates statistically significant differences in mean T-s and NDVI values associated with different types of zoning. Multiple comparisons of mean T-s and NDVI values associated with specific pairings of individual zoning categories are also shown to be significantly different. An inverse relationship between T-s and NDVI was observed across the city as a whole and within all but one zoning category. A range of environmental influences on sensible heat flux and urban vegetation was detected both within and between individual zoning categories. Examples for implementing these findings in urban planning applications to find examples of high and low impact development are demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Assessment Using Hybrid Machine Learning And Remote Sensing In Quang Tri Province, Vietnam
AB  - Flooding is the most dangerous of all environmental hazards and leads to significant impacts both on the environment and on human life. Environmental protection and water management can be achieved by modeling flood susceptibility, to inform strategy that will reduce flood damage. The aim of this study is to develop novel hybrid models based on a radial basis functions neural network (RBFNN), arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and ant lion optimizer (ALO), to build flood susceptibility maps in the Quang Tri province of Vietnam. The obtained models were trained and validated using 1511 flood points and 14 conditioning factors. Various statistical indices were used to assess the performance of the models, namely root mean square error, receiver operation characteristics (ROC), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The comparison analysis highlights that the RBFNN-ABC model was better than other models with an AUC of 0.98, followed by RBFNN-AOA, support vector machine, and random forest, all with an AUC value of 0.96, and finally RBFNN-ALO, with an AUC of 0.95. From the flood susceptibility map, it can be seen that the eastern areas of the study area have high and very high flood susceptibility, that requires local government attention. The approach and results of this study can support national and local authorities, decision-makers, and other planners in the construction of appropriate strategies to reduce potential damage in the future.

TI  - A Technical And Economical Assessment Of Hydrogen Production Potential From Solar Energy In Morocco
AB  - In this study, a techno-economic analysis of the capacity of Morocco to produce hydrogen from solar energy has been conducted. For this reason, a Photovoltaic-electrolyze system was selected and the electricity and hydrogen production were simulated for 76 sites scattered all over the country. The Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI) data used for the simulation were extracted from the CAMS-Rad satellite database and meteorological stations at ground level. Before simulations, the accuracy of the GHI values from the satellite dataset has been checked, and their uncertainties was calculated against accurate data measured in-situ. After that, the simulated values of the hydrogen mass were interpolated using a GIS software to create a Hydrogen production map of Morocco. Finally, an economical investigation of electricity and hydrogen production costs has been conducted by calculating the LCOE and LCOH2. Results show that the satellite dataset has a mean average deviation of 6.8\% which is a very acceptable error rang. Also, it was found that Morocco have a high potential for hydrogen production, with a daily annual production that varies between 6489 and 8308 Tons/km(2). Moreover, the cost of electricity and hydrogen production in the country are in the range of 0.077-0.099 \$/kWh and 5.79-4.64 \$/Kg respectively. The findings of this study are with high importance as they provide an overall perspective of the country potential of hydrogen production for policy makers and investors, and it was motivated by the lack of information on the subject in the literature since its, at the best of our knowledge, the first study assessing the hydrogen production from solar for the whole country.

TI  - Performance Evaluation Of China?S Photovoltaic Poverty Alleviation Project Using Machine Learning And Satellite Images
AB  - Photovoltaic poverty alleviation project (PPAP) is one of China's essential targeted poverty alleviation projects. This study proposes a machine learning model and uses satellite images to evaluate the performance of PPAP in China. The trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with transfer learning was first used to identify the scale of photovoltaic (PV) power stations. Then the PV power capacity for poverty alleviation and carbon emission mitigation were estimated. The results identified 38 large-scale centralized and approximately 5,063,293 m2PV power stations built in Jinzhai County, Anhui province, China, by November 2020. The main findings are as follows. (1) The power generation and carbon mitigation of PPAP in Jinzhai County is about 1.8 x 103 MWh and 1.389 Mt per year. (2) The PPAP in Jinzhai County can recover the total costs and get benefits within three years, at least after completion. (3) Dynamic subsidy policy is needed to prevent over-scale or excessive government investment in PPAP. (4) The utilization of PPAP needs to be strengthened to transform the current "blood transfusion type" of poverty alleviation that relies more on government subsidies into more sustainable "hematopoietic style" poverty alleviation. This study is of significance to more accurately and comprehensively evaluate the performance of PPAP and give better utilize the role of renewable energy in promoting energy conservation, carbon emission reduction, and economic development.

TI  - Algorithm For Measuring The Outer Contour Dimension Of Trucks Using Uav Binocular Stereo Vision
AB  - Promoting the management of the over-limit of freight transport vehicles plays an important role in the sustainable development of the highway industry. Vehicle outer contour dimension measurement is a key element in highway over-limit detection. The current detection approaches and research methods, however, are insufficient for high-precision flow detection. Therefore, this study proposes an algorithm for measuring the dimensions of a truck’s outer contours, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) binocular stereo vision. First, this study leverages a binocular camera mounted on a UAV to reconstruct the 3D point clouds of the truck. Second, the point cloud data are clustered using an FoF (Friends-of-Friends algorithm); this recognizes the cluster of truck points according to the truck’s characteristics. Finally, the principal component analysis and the Gaussian kernel density estimation are used to generate the outer contour dimensions of the trucks. Twenty model vehicles are selected as test objects to verify the reliability of the algorithm. The average error of the algorithm is represented by calculating the average value of the difference between the real size and the predicted size of the three dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that the average error of this measurement approach is less than 2.5%, and the method is both stable and robust. This approach aligns with national regulations for over-limit detection. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Landscape Pattern And The Recreation Potential Of Urban Parks: The Case Of Beijing Olympic Forest Park
AB  - The health benefits of urban green space are based on the occurrence of recreation behaviors. Recreation potential, a product of the interaction between green space features and the observer’ s psychological processes, plays an important role in the occurrence of recreation behaviors. We analyzed the landscape characteristics of 11 key park areas in Beijing Olympic Forest Park using remote sensing data. Based on the questionnaire survey of 997 visitors, we analyzed the recreation potential of the key park areas in terms of exercise suitability and scenic beauty, and ranked these areas using a combined recreation index integrating the two aspects. The relationship between landscape characteristics and recreation potential was explored. Our results showed that certain landscape indicators can potentially assist the study of recreation potential. For example, the area of deciduous forest, edge density, patch dispersion, and shape index showed different degrees of positive correlation with the recreation potential, while the area of man-made buildings and patch evenness negatively correlated with recreation potential. All the 11 key park areas showed similar graded characteristics in the ranking of exercise suitability and scenic beauty, reflecting a balanced creation of scenic-based and exercise-based recreation potentials. The study also investigated a combined recreation potential index with sub-dimensional aspects. Our study contributes to the understanding of the mechanism underlying the generation of recreation benefits in urban green space, and offers guiding implications for landscape design of urban green space. © 2022 editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - Daily Evapotranspiration Mapping Using Regression Random Forest Models
AB  - Efficient water management in agriculture requires an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET). Even though local measurements can be used to estimate the components of the surface energy balance, these values cannot be extrapolated to large areas due to the heterogeneity and complexity of agricultural and natural land surfaces and the dynamic nature of their heat processes. This extrapolation can be done by using satellite imagery, which provides information in the infrared thermal band; however, this band is not available in most current operational remote sensors. Our work hypothesis is that it is possible to generate a spatially distributed estimation of ETd without thermal band by using nonparametric models as regression random forest models (RRFM). Six Landsat-7 scenes were used to generate the RRFM. Results were evaluated by comparing the values of ETd provided by RRFM with that obtained using the surface energy balance model. It has been shown that the results generated by RRFM present a good agreement with METRIC (mapping ET at high resolution using internalized calibration) results, both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially for agricultural vegetation and forest land covers. Moreover, it has been detected that the RRFM estimation quality depends on the meteorological conditions on the days previous to the satellite register. It can be concluded that the ETd estimated by the RRFM would be feasible for real applications when the thermal band is not available. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Joint Pricing And Power Allocation For Multibeam Satellite Systems With Dynamic Game Model
AB  - Multibeam satellite systems (MSS) enable transmission flexibility and spatial diversity while efficiently reusing the scarce spectrum resource. However, as spectrum reuses tend to introduce co-channel interference, MSS need to address power allocation and interference management carefully. In this paper, we tackle the joint interference pricing and power allocation problems of MSS by formulating the underlying resource allocation problem as a dynamic game model - the Stackelberg model. In our proposed scheme, a fresh satellite user will be charged according to its interference on the satellite system. MSS can dynamically adjust the interference price in order to make a tradeoff between intercell interference and operating profit. Meanwhile, for the satellite user, an equilibrium power allocation should be ascertained in response to the MSS's pricing. A novel market-based solution is proposed for interference management in MSS by introducing an elastic price mechanism. The Nash equilibrium for interference pricing and its iterative convergence for power allocation have further been proven. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the impact of different prices on the utility functions of both MSS and satellite users. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

TI  - How Digital Health Translational Research Is Prioritised: A Qualitative Stakeholder-Driven Approach To Decision Support Evaluation
AB  - Objectives Digital health is now routinely being applied in clinical care, and with a variety of clinician-facing systems available, healthcare organisations are increasingly required to make decisions about technology implementation and evaluation. However, few studies have examined how digital health research is prioritised, particularly research focused on clinician-facing decision support systems. This study aimed to identify criteria for prioritising digital health research, examine how these differ from criteria for prioritising traditional health research and determine priority decision support use cases for a collaborative implementation research programme. Methods Drawing on an interpretive listening model for priority setting and a stakeholder-driven approach, our prioritisation process involved stakeholder identification, eliciting decision support use case priorities from stakeholders, generating initial use case priorities and finalising preferred use cases based on consultations. In this qualitative study, online focus group session(s) were held with stakeholders, audiorecorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results Fifteen participants attended the online priority setting sessions. Criteria for prioritising digital health research fell into three themes, namely: public health benefit, health system-level factors and research process and feasibility. We identified criteria unique to digital health research as the availability of suitable governance frameworks, candidate technology's alignment with other technologies in use,and the possibility of data-driven insights from health technology data. The final selected use cases were remote monitoring of patients with pulmonary conditions, sepsis detection and automated breast screening. Conclusion The criteria for determining digital health research priority areas are more nuanced than that of traditional health condition focused research and can neither be viewed solely through a clinical lens nor technological lens. As digital health research relies heavily on health technology implementation, digital health prioritisation criteria comprised enablers of successful technology implementation. Our prioritisation process could be applied to other settings and collaborative projects where research institutions partner with healthcare delivery organisations. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

TI  - Trade-Offs And Synergies Between Ecosystem Productivity And Stability In Temperate Grasslands
AB  - Aim: It is crucial to monitor how the productivity of grasslands varies with its temporal stability for management of these ecosystems. However, identifying the direction of the productivity-stability relationship remains challenging because ecological stability has multiple components that can display neutral, positive or negative covariations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the direction of the productivity-stability relationship depends on the biotic interactions and abiotic conditions that underlie ecosystem productivity and stability. We decipher the relationships between grassland productivity and two components of its stability in four habitat types with contrasting environments and flora.Location: France.Time period: 2000-2020.Major taxa: Grassland plant species.Methods: We used c. 20,000 vegetation plots spread across French permanent grasslands and remotely sensed vegetation indices to quantify grassland productivity and temporal stability. We decomposed stability into constancy (i.e., temporal invariability) and resistance (i.e., maximum deviation from average) and deciphered the direct and indirect effects of abiotic (namely growing season length and nitrogen input) and biotic (namely plant taxonomic diversity, trait diversity and community-weighted mean traits) factors on productivity-stability relationships using structural equation models.Results: We found a positive relationship between productivity and constancy and a negative relationship between productivity and resistance in all habitats. Abiotic factors had stronger effects on productivity and stability compared with biotic factors. A longer growing season enhanced grassland productivity and constancy. Nitrogen input had positive and negative effects on grassland productivity and resistance, respectively. Trait values affected the constancy and resistance of grassland more than taxonomic and trait diversity, with effects varying from one habitat to another. Productivity was not related to any biotic factor.Main conclusions: Our findings reveal how vital it is to consider both the multiple components of stability and the interaction between environment and biodiversity to gain an understanding of the relationships between productivity and stability in real-world ecosystems, which is a crucial step for sustainable grassland management.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Expansion By Coupling Multi-Temporal Active Remote Sensing And Landscape Analysis: Changes In The Metropolitan Area Of Cordoba (Argentina) From 2010 To 2021
AB  - Uncontrolled and unsustainable urban sprawl are altering the Earth's surface at unprecedented rates. This research explores the potential of active remote sensors for mapping urban areas, for monitoring urban expansion processes and for depicting landscape pattern dynamics in a metropolis of South America. Based on multi-temporal urban cover maps of Cordoba, Argentina, purposely derived from COSMO-SkyMed SAR data by urban extraction algorithms, we quantified urban surface increase and described urbanization processes that occurred during 2010-2021 in sectors with different degrees of soil sealing. We extracted urban extent in four time-steps using an Urban EXTent extraction (UEXT) algorithm and quantified urban expansion, identifying newly built areas on 2.5 ha cells. For these cells, we computed urban cover and a set of landscape pattern indices (PIs), and by projecting them in a composition vs. configuration Cartesian space we performed a trajectory analysis. SAR-based urban extraction and cover change proved to be very accurate. Overall accuracy and Cohen's Kappa statistic evidenced very high values, always above 91.58\% and 0.82, respectively, for urban extraction, and also above 90.50\% and 0.72 concerning the accuracy of urban expansion. Cordoba's urban surface significantly increased (approximate to 900 ha in 10 years) following three main spatial processes in different city sectors (e.g., edge-expansion and outlying on peri-urban areas, and infill inside the ring road), which may have contrasting effects on the sustainability of the metropolitan area. Trajectory analysis highlighted non-linear relations between the urban cover and the PIs. Areas with very low and low urban intensity underwent a steep rise of both urban cover and PI values (e.g., urban patch dimension, complexity and number), depicting urban edge-expansion and outlying processes. In the areas with medium and high urban intensity the increase in patch dimension, along with the decrease in patch number and complexity, evidence the coalescence of urban areas that incorporate in the urban fabric the remnants of non-built up zones and fill the few residual green spaces. The proposed SAR mapping procedure coupled with landscape analysis proved to be useful to detect and depict different moments of urban expansion and, pending more tests on other cities and geographical conditions, it could be postulated among the RS indicators to monitor the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations.

TI  - The Herder's Environment: A Gis Case Study Of Resource Use Patterns Among Pastoralists In Central Tibet
AB  - This article investigates how environmental features such as altitude, aspect, slope, and vegetation cover structure resource use patterns among pastoralists in the Porong region of Central Tibet. Abundance, distribution (spatial and temporal), and use of forage resources in the study area were characterized by integrating field observations, participatory mapping, interviews, and remotely sensed images in a geographic information system (GIS). Georeferenced locations of livestock corrals enabled us to characterize seasonal grazing areas, resulting in a spatially explicit model of the environment in which Porong's herders operate. The methodology, which included the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values to assess inter-and intraannual rangeland productivity, availed this description of the environmental variability with which these nomads cope. Using culturally nuanced and spatially explicit methodologies we can enhance our understanding of pastoral systems in limiting environments, hopefully to gain clearer estimations of how economic and policy changes might affect the livelihoods of livestock-dependent communities in Central Tibet and beyond.

TI  - A Priori Quality Assurance Using A Benchmark Case Of The Randomized Phase 2 Gortec 2014-14 In Oligometastatic Head And Neck Cancer Patients
AB  - Purpose: A Benchmark Case (BC) was performed as part of the quality assurance process of the randomized phase 2 GORTEC 2014-14 OMET study, testing the possibility of multisite stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) alone in oligometastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as an alternative to systemic treatment and SBRT. Material and methods: Compliance of the investigating centers with the prescription, delineation, planning and evaluation recommendations available in the research protocol was assessed. In addition, classical dosimetric analysis was supplemented by quantitative geometric analysis using conformation indices. Results: Twenty centers participated in the BC analysis. Among them, four major deviations (MaD) were reported in two centers. Two (10%) centers in MaD had omitted the satellite tumor nodule and secondarily validated after revision. Their respective DICE indexes were 0.37 and 0 and use of extracranial SBRT devices suboptimal There were significant residual heterogeneities between participating centers, including those with a similar SBRT equipment, with impact of plan quality using standard indicators and geometric indices. Conclusion: A priori QA using a BC conditioning the participation of the clinical investigation centers showed deviations from good SBRT practice and led to the exclusion of one out of the twenty participating centers. The majority of centers have demonstrated rigorous compliance with the research protocol. The use of quality indexes adds a complementary approach to improve assessment of plan quality. © 2021 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO)

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation Of Soil Salinization Risk In Keriya Oasis Based On Grey Evaluation Model
AB  - Soil salinization is a global issue of concern and the biggest global natural disaster. Salt-affected soil is also the most prominent environmental problem in arid and semi-arid regions in China. In this study, the Keriya Oasis in the arid zone of Xinjiang, Northwestern China was chosen as study area, a geodatabase was created with multiple field observations together with laboratory analyses and related datasets including attribute, vector and raster data. Topsoil electrical conductivity (TS_EC) was selected as the ecological endpoint for evaluating the salinization risk. And 14 evaluation indicators were chosen as the main sources of soil salinity risk which included ground evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), surface albedo (Albedo), digital elevation model (DEM), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass (Biomass), groundwater depth (GWD), groundwater electrical conductivity (GW_EC), topsoil water content (SWC), topsoil pH value (pH), land use land / cover type (LULC), population density (PD) and per capita arable land (PCAL). An index system for soil salinization risk assessment was established. Through remote sensing (RS) techniques and quantitative inversion, 7 risk factors were derived such as: NDVI, LAI, Albedo, LST, ET, Biomass, DEM; the other factors were spatially interpolated, then data normalization was applied to all these datasets and overlayed GIS database of soil salinity risk factors was built. Risk weights of evaluation factors were determined and weight coefficients were calculated by adopting Pearson correlation analysis method. The theory of grey relational analysis system was introduced into soil salinization risk assessment, and risk assessment model was constructed in the study area. Then the soil salinity risk of the region was quantitatively assessed and classified, and finally soil salinity risk map was elaborated. The results showed that: the salinization risk values of the whole study area varied from 0.053 to 0.747, with a mean value of 0.190. Spatial distribution heterogeneity of different risks in the Keriya Oasis was prominent, and soil salinity risk was mainly demonstrated moderate risk. The area of risk rating 3 was the largest, and it accounted for 48.94% of total study area, soil salinity risk was moderate, belonging to potential risk area; The area of rating 4 accounted for 27.69%, and it belonged to the low risk region. Rating 2 risk region accounted for 19.35%, and soil salinity risk was relatively high. Rating 1 risk area accounted for only 4.02%, but it was characterized with very high risk soil salinity. Although the high risky area was smaller in size, it might lead a negative influence on the ecological environment and agricultural production in the northern region of the oasis. In conclusion, the quantitative assessment and mapping results of soil salinization risk in Keriya Oasis could be used to make appropriate decisions related to crop production, prevention of soil salinization, and it might offer scientific evidence and consulting for obtaining sustainable development of agriculture and eco-environment in arid and semi-arid regions. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Flash Flood Susceptibility Assessment And Zonation Using An Integrating Analytic Hierarchy Process And Frequency Ratio Model For The Chitral District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
AB  - Pakistan is a flood-prone country and almost every year, it is hit by floods of varying magnitudes. This study was conducted to generate a flash flood map using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) models in the ArcGIS 10.6 environment. Eight flash-flood-causing physical parameters were considered for this study. Five parameters were based on the digital elevation model (DEM), Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), and Sentinel-2 satellite, including distance from the river and drainage density slope, elevation, and land cover, respectively. Two other parameters were geology and soil, consisting of different rock and soil formations, respectively, where both layers were classified based on their resistance against water percolation. One parameter was rainfall. Rainfall observation data obtained from five meteorological stations exist close to the Chitral District, Pakistan. According to its significant importance in the occurrence of a flash flood, each criterion was allotted an estimated weight with the help of AHP and FR. In the end, all the parameters were integrated using weighted overlay analysis in which the influence value of the drainage density was given the highest value. This gave the output in terms of five flood risk zones: very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk, and very low risk. According to the results, 1168 km(2), that is, 8\% of the total area, showed a very high risk of flood occurrence. Reshun, Mastuj, Booni, Colony, and some other villages were identified as high-risk zones of the study area, which have been drastically damaged many times by flash floods. This study is pioneering in its field and provides policy guidelines for risk managers, emergency and disaster response services, urban and infrastructure planners, hydrologists, and climate scientists.

TI  - Assessing Landscape Fire Hazard By Multitemporal Automatic Classification Of Landsat Time Series Using The Google Earth Engine In West-Central Spain
AB  - Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps are needed to identify the interaction between landscape changes and wildland fires. Objectives: In this work, we determined fire hazard changes in a representative Mediterranean landscape through the classification of annual LULC types and fire perimeters, using a dense Landsat Time Series (LTS) during the 1984-2017 period, and MODIS images. Methods: We implemented a semiautomatic process in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to generate annual imagery free of clouds, cloud shadows, and gaps. We compared LandTrendr (LT) and FormaTrend (FT) algorithms that are widely used in LTS analysis to extract the pixel tendencies and, consequently, assess LULC changes and disturbances such as forest fires. These algorithms allowed us to generate the following change metrics: type, magnitude, direction, and duration of change, as well as the prechange spectral values. Results and conclusions: Our results showed that the FT algorithm was better than the LT algorithm at detecting low-severity changes caused by fires. Likewise, the use of the change metrics' type, magnitude, and direction of change increased the accuracy of the LULC maps by 4\% relative to the ones obtained using only spectral and topographic variables. The most significant hazardous LULC change processes observed were: deforestation and degradation (mainly by fires), encroachment (i.e., invasion by shrublands) due to agriculture abandonment and forest fires, and hazardous densification (from open forests and agroforestry areas). Although the total burned area has decreased significantly since 1985, the landscape fire hazard has increased since the second half of the twentieth century. Therefore, it is necessary to implement fire management plans focused on the sustainable use of shrublands and conifer forests; this is because the stability in these hazardous vegetation types is translated into increasing fuel loads, and thus an elevated landscape fire hazard.

TI  - Numerical Simulation For Groundwater Distribution After Mining In Zhuanlongwan Mining Area Based On Visual Modflow
AB  - With large-scale coal resources being discovered and mined in mid-west China, latent environment problems gradually come into view. In arid and semi-arid region, environmental impact assessment of mining on groundwater distribution is a vital mission before mining works. In Zhuanlongwan Mining Area (ZMA), data of surface elevation were performed by remote sensing information and ArcGIS. The study area was divided into clayey fine sand, aeolian loose sand, weathered fracture, and low permeability zones, according to hydrologic conductivities and borehole data. By simplifying as a single-layer system of phreatic groundwater and optimizing with geological parameters in each unit zone, a reasonable model of the groundwater distribution in steady state was then found and calibrated. Combined with local climate, variable groundwater behavior was discussed in relation to different precipitations which reduced the loss of the drain in degrees. The study results may give benefit and safety to management in mining, as well as being refined in the future.

TI  - International Legal And Ethical Issues Of A Future Carrington Event: Existing Frameworks, Shortcomings, And Recommendations
AB  - Solar-geomagnetic superstorms like the 1859 Carrington Event pose significant risks to electrical power utilities and satellite infrastructure. Damage to this critical infrastructure could have significant legal and ethical ramifications, ranging from worldwide economic crises to international disaster response needs of unseen magnitude. Despite these potential consequences, the legal and ethical frameworks for space weather risk management are only just beginning to be developed by regulatory agencies. Furthermore, existing international regulations and ethical standards are designed for typical natural disasters (i.e., floods, droughts, earthquakes, and hurricanes) and may not account for the additional complexity and cascading effects associated with a future Carrington Event, such as combined and large-scale loss of electrical grid and satellite capabilities in countries that typically provide, rather than receive, disaster relief. To address this insufficiency, this article outlines the legal and ethical issues associated with solar-geomagnetic superstorms and provides recommendations for incorporating specific action plans into existing international agreements, national policies, commercial space best practices, and international disaster response law guidelines. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation Of Potential Evapotranspiration And Meteorological Drought Based On Multi-Source Data In Nepal
AB  - Quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamic of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in topographically complex country are often limited by the scarcity and difficulty in obtaining ground-based measured climate data. Remote sensing products have multiple advantage, which allows rapid acquisition of information and status over large areas and long time series. This study compared and explored the spatiotemporal variation of PET across Nepal using three widely-used remote sensing and reanalysis data PET products (CRU_PET, MODIS_PET and PML_PET), and PET estimation using Hargreaves-Samani method based on CHIRTS datasets. On the basis of this, the spatiotemporal dynamic at seasonal and annual level and the periodical change of PET and meteorological aridity index AI (precipitation P/PET) were identified using Mann-Kendall test and Morlet Wavelet method. These PET products showed general spatial consistency over most areas in Nepal with higher PET in the south and less in the north. However, great differences were also found in PET values for four different products. Compared with the three remote sensing and reanalysis data products, CHIRTS_PET performs better in Nepal. The AI based on CHIRTS_PET showed an insignificant increasing (wetting) trend in the western and southern regions, while an insignificant decreasing (drying) trend in the central and northeastern region, which is generally consistent with the spatial pattern of precipitation. In the western and southern regions, the positive impact of increasing precipitation on AI masked the negative effect of increasing PET, and thus making this region getting humid. However, in the central and northeastern region, the increase in PET aggravates the impact of reduced precipitation on the drying trend. Our investigation have broad implications for sustainable water resources management under climate change in a topographically complex country like Nepal. © 2023 National Institute of Natural Hazards, Ministry of Emergency Management of China

TI  - Leaf Area Index As An Indicator Of Ecosystem Services And Management Practices: An Application For Coffee Agroforestry
AB  - Scalable indicators are promising to assess ecosystem services. In a large (660. ha) coffee agroforestry farm, we calibrated the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), calculated on a High Resolution (HR) satellite image and ground-truth LAI, providing a 2-layer (shade trees and coffee) LAI calibration with LAI 2000 and a new technique based on the cumulative distribution of LAI along transects. The effective and apparent clumping of coffee leaves were computed (0.76 and 0.89, respectively). We also calibrated the relationship between the derived HR-LAI farm map and NDVI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to re-construct LAI time-series (2001-2011).Coffee LAI, as derived from MODIS after substracting the contribution of shade tree LAI varied seasonally between 2.4 and 4.4m2m-2, with a maximum by the end of wet season (peak of harvest), steep decline during the drier-cooler season, minimum after annual coffee pruning, recovery during the next rainy season and pause during the grain filling period. MODIS also detected significant inter-annual variations in LAI originating from annual pruning, or plot renovation followed by a progressive LAI recovery during up to 4 years. We related the coffee-LAI time-series with farm registries to examine the impacts of management on LAI and on selected ecosystem services, namely yield and hydrological services. Nitrogen fertilization was adjusted annually by the farmer and appeared as the best yield predictor (R2=0.53). Combining N-fertilization with LAI from 6 significant months of the year, the prediction was improved (R2=0.74), confirming LAI as an important co-predictor of yield. We ended up with a yield prediction model including also the percentage of pruned resprouts (R2=0.79), with potential uses for regional yield mapping or reconstruction of historical yield time-series. The impacts of varying LAI (from nil to double actual values) on hydrological services were simulated. LAI affected the partitioning between green water (evapotranspiration) and blue water (infiltration, aquifer recharge, streamflow), thus the water provisioning. We discussed how LAI was influenced by natural factors (phenology, interaction between vegetative and reproductive components, climate) and by management (pruning, renovation). We confirmed LAI as a powerful scalable indicator for several key ecosystem services. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Determining The Contribution Of Environmental Factors In Controlling Dust Pollution During Cold And Warm Months Of Western Iran Using Different Data Mining Algorithms And Game Theory
AB  - Dust pollution is one of the major environmental crises in the arid regions of Iran and there is a need to predict dust pollution and identify its controlling factors to help reduce its adverse effects on the livelihood of residents of these areas. Although deep neural networks (DNN) are powerful tools in the modelling of environmental phenomena, they are recognized as being challenging to interpret due to their black-box nature. To address this issue and understand the importance of each environmental control on dust pollution, game theory (i.e., Shapley values) was used to better understand the performance and interpretability of DNN models. Here, monthly mean values of precipitation, air temperature, surface wind speed, potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference salinity index, Palmer drought severity index, soil heat flux, and surface pressure were selected as explanatory variables. The dust storm index (DSI), an indicator of dust pollution, was the predicted response variable for the cold and warm months. The results showed that the accuracies of the DNN model in predicting cold months DSI (CMDSI) and warm months DSI (WMDSI) were higher compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms. DNN model increased the R2 by 13% and 15% for predicting CMDSI and WMDSI, respectively, compared to the Random Forest model, which was the second most effective approach. According to the Shapley values, the most important controls on the occurrence of dust storms during the cold months of the study period (2000–2018) were wind speed, soil heat flux, and precipitation. During the warm months, wind speed was the most important controlling factor and was followed by precipitation, soil heat flux, and potential evapotranspiration. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DNN model and game theory in identifying the factors affecting dust pollution, which may help mitigate its impacts on the residents of western Iran. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Optimization Of Land Reuse Structure In Coal Mining Subsided Areas Considering Regional Economic Development: A Case Study In Pei County, China
AB  - Land subsidence, which has caused large-scale settlement loss and farmland degradation, was regarded as the main constraint for land reclamation in the High Groundwater Coal Basins (HGCBs) in the eastern China plain. Both coal mining and agricultural production are important for regional development in this area. In general, the land reclamation direction in this area is greatly affected by the adequacy of filling materials and the land use demand of regional economic development. Taking seven coal mining subsided areas in Pei county, located in the eastern China plain, for example, this study proposed an integrated model (including the Limit Condition model, Logistic Regression model, Grey Linear Programming model and the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) model) to simulate and optimize the post-mining land use structure to meet the economic development needs of Pei county. Then, the post-mining land use structure under different scenarios, which were set based on the subsidence depth, were compared to explore the optimal collapse depth for separating the damaged land into the filling area and non-filling area. The landscape structure, ecological benefits, engineering quantity and reclaimed farmland area were used to compare the reclaimed land use structure of different scenarios. The results showed that the integrated model could efficiently simulate the reclaimed land use structure to meet the land demand for regional development. The optimal collapse depth for separating the damaged area into the filling area and non-filling area was 2.6 m. Currently, the reclaimed land use structure not only needs a low quantity of filling material, but also obtains a good landscape structure and elevated ecosystem services value. Furthermore, the reclaimed urban land was mainly distributed around Pei town, and the reclaimed farmland was mostly distributed in the area between Pei town and Weishan lake, which were consistent with the pattern of urbanization. The study provides valuable information for future land use plans for Pei county and will contribute to the methods of post-mining land reclamation in other HGCBs.

TI  - Planning For The Next Influenza H1n1 Season: A Modelling Study
AB  - Background: The level of herd immunity before and after the first 2009 pandemic season is not precisely known, and predicting the shape of the next pandemic H1N1 season is a difficult challenge. Methods: This was a modelling study based on data on medical visits for influenza-like illness collected by the French General Practitioner Sentinel network, as well as pandemic H1N1 vaccination coverage rates, and an individual-centred model devoted to influenza. We estimated infection attack rates during the first 2009 pandemic H1N1 season in France, and the rates of pre- and post-exposure immunity. We then simulated various scenarios in which a pandemic influenza H1N1 virus would be reintroduced into a population with varying levels of protective cross-immunity, and considered the impact of extending influenza vaccination. Results: During the first pandemic season in France, the proportion of infected persons was 18.1\% overall, 38.3\% among children, 14.8\% among younger adults and 1.6\% among the elderly. The rates of pre-exposure immunity required to fit data collected during the first pandemic season were 36\% in younger adults and 85\% in the elderly. We estimated that the rate of post-exposure immunity was 57.3\% (95\% Confidence Interval (95\% CI) 49.6\%-65.0\%) overall, 44.6\% (95\% CI 35.5\%-53.6\%) in children, 53.8\% (95\% CI 44.5\%-63.1\%) in younger adults, and 87.4\% (95\% CI 82.0\%-92.8\%) in the elderly. The shape of a second season would depend on the degree of persistent protective cross-immunity to descendants of the 2009 H1N1 viruses. A cross-protection rate of 70\% would imply that only a small proportion of the population would be affected. With a cross-protection rate of 50\%, the second season would have a disease burden similar to the first, while vaccination of 50\% of the entire population, in addition to the population vaccinated during the first pandemic season, would halve this burden. With a cross-protection rate of 30\%, the second season could be more substantial, and vaccination would not provide a significant benefit. Conclusions: These model-based findings should help to prepare for a second pandemic season, and highlight the need for studies of the different components of immune protection.

TI  - The Response Of The Upper Ocean To Tropical Cyclone Viyaru Over The Bay Of Bengal
AB  - Better forecast of tropical cyclone (TC) can help to reduce risk and enhance management. The TC forecast depends on the scientific understanding of oceanic processes, air-sea interaction and finally, the atmospheric process. The TC Viyaru is taken as an example, which is formed at the end of 11 May 2013 and sustains up to 17 May 2013 during pre-monsoon season. Argo data are used to investigate ocean response processes by comparing pre- and post-conditions of the TC. Eight oceanic parameters including the sea surface temperature (SST), the sea surface salinity (SSS), and the barrier layer thickness (BLT), the 26 degrees C isotherm depth in the ocean (D-26), the isothermal layer depth (ILD), the mixed layer depth (MLD), the tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) and the effective oceanic layer for cyclogenesis (EOLC) are chosen to evaluate the pre- and post-conditions of the TC along the track of Viyaru. The values of the SST, D-26, BLT, TCHP and EOLC in the pre-cyclonic condition are higher than the post-cyclonic condition, while the SSS, ILD and MLD in the post-cyclonic condition are higher than the pre-cyclonic condition of the ocean due to strong cyclonic winds and subsurface upwelling. It is interesting that the strong intensity of the TC reduces less SST and vice versa. The satisfied real time Argo data is not available in the northern Bay of Bengal especially in the coastal region. A weather research and forecasting model is employed to hindcast the track of Viyaru, and the satellite data from the National Center Environmental Prediction are used to assess the hindcast.

TI  - Comparison Of Different Semi-Empirical Algorithms To Estimate Chlorophyll-A Concentration In Inland Lake Water
AB  - Based on in situ water sampling and field spectral measurement from June to September 2004 in Lake Chagan, a comparison of several existing semi-empirical algorithms to determine chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content was made by applying them to the field spectra and in situ chlorophyll measurements. Results indicated that the first derivative of reflectance was well correlated with Chl-a. The highest correlation between the first derivative and Chl-a was at 680 nm. The two-band model, NIR/red ratio of R710/670, was also an effective predictor of Chl-a concentration. Since the two-band ratios model is a special case of the three-band model developed recently, three-band model in Lake Chagan showed a higher resolution. The new algorithm named reverse continuum removal relies on the reflectance peak at 700 nm whose shape and position depend strongly upon chlorophyll concentration: The depth and area of the peak above a baseline showed a linear relationship to Chl-a concentration. All of the algorithms mentioned proved to be of value and can be used to predict Chl-a concentration. Best results were obtained by using the algorithms of the first derivative, which yielded R 2 around 0.74 and RMSE around 6.39 μg/l. The two-band and three-band algorithms were further applied to MERIS when filed spectral were resampled with regard to their center wavelengths. Both algorithms showed an adequate precision, and the differences on the outcome were small with R 2 = 0.70 and 0.71. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - The National Technological University: Sharing Premier Educational Resources Via Telecommunications
AB  - Since the mid-1960s, instructional television (ITV) in the US has grown steadily so, today, ITV is the primary way engineers and technical managers continue their education while at work. Regional ITV systems operated by individual universities continue to grow, and these networks, since 1985, have been simultaneously interconnected nationally by satellite via the National Technological University (NTU) network. By cooperating, 45 major universities are each year providing almost 26 000 hours of high quality instruction to more than 100 000 technical professionals. Last year, more than 180 MSc degrees were awarded by NTU in 11 disciplines and more than 1750 adult learners are now working towards this goal as part-time students. In addition, 3000 hours of continuing education, research seminars and symposia were delivered to more than 100 000 participants. NTU provides 78% of all university instruction delivered by satellite in North America. The network consists of 43 uplinks and more than 300 receivers linked by a state-of-the-art 2.9 Mbps compressed digital video system. NTU is an accredited and widely respected university. All programmes focus strongly on learner needs. Total quality management is an organizational hallmark. The rapid growth of both member universities and sponsoring employers attests to the success of this unique, cooperative endeavor. To extend educational services globally, national ITV networks interconnected by satellite to serve Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and so forth, need to be planned and implemented. On occasion, for mutual benefit, these satellite networks could be interconnected globally. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

TI  - Python Software Tools For Gnss Interferometric Reflectometry (Gnss-Ir)
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interferometric reflectometry, also known as the GNSS-IR, uses data from geodetic-quality GNSS antennas to extract information about the environment surrounding the antenna. Soil moisture monitoring is one of the most important applications of the GNSS-IR technique. This manuscript presents the main ideas and implementation decisions needed to write the Python code for software tools that transform RINEX format observation and navigation files into an appropriate format for GNSS-IR (which includes the SNR observations and the azimuth and elevation of the satellites) and to determine the reflection height and the adjusted phase and amplitude values of the interferometric wave for each individual satellite track. The main goal of the manuscript is to share the software with the scientific community to introduce new users to the GNSS-IR technique. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The Impact Of Cattle Ranching On Large-Scale Vegetation Patterns In A Coastal Savanna In Tanzania
AB  - 1. The success of large-scale cattle ranching in African savanna vegetation has often been limited by problems of bush encroachment and disease (in particular trypanosomiasis spread by tsetse flies). Mkwaja Ranch, occupying an area of 462 km2 on the coast of Tanzania, is a recent example of a large ranching enterprise that failed within the savanna environment. It was closed in 2000 after 48 years of operation. In this paper we describe the main vegetation types of the area (excluding closed forest vegetation) and relate their patterns of distribution to the former use of the ranch for cattle. 2. The study area comprised the former ranch and parts of the adjacent Saadani Game Reserve, which had not been grazed by cattle for many years and had never been used for large-scale ranching. Following field surveys, 15 distinct types of grassland and bush vegetation were defined and a vegetation map was created using a Landsat TM satellite image. A multispectral classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm gave good results and enabled all 15 vegetation types to be distinguished on the map. 3. Two main spatial trends were detected in the vegetation. One was a large-scale decrease in the cover of bushland from the most intensively used parts of the ranch through more extensively used areas to the game reserve; this trend was attributed to differences in management history as well as to climatic and topographic factors. A second trend was a radial vegetation pattern associated with the enclosures where cattle were herded at night. High amounts of three bushland types [dominated by (i) Acacia zanzibarica, (ii) Dichrostachys cinerea, Acacia nilotica or Acacia mellifera and (iii) Terminalia spinosa] occurred in a zone between 300 and 2500 m from the paddocks, with a peak in bush density at about 900 m (mean value for 18 paddocks). In contrast, bushland dominated by Hyphaene compressa was scarce close to the paddocks and became more abundant with distance. There was also a radial trend in the grassland communities: close to the paddocks there was short grass vegetation containing many ruderals and invasive weedy species, while the tall grassland types with species such as Hyperthelia dissoluta and Cymbopogon caesius occurred further away in the areas less affected by cattle. 4. Synthesis and applications. The intensive modern livestock ranching as practised on Mkwaja Ranch proved to be unsustainable both economically and ecologically. In the end, the biggest problem faced by the ranch managers was not controlling disease, as had originally been feared, but preventing the spread of bush on pasture land. The results of our study demonstrate just how severe the problem of bush encroachment was, especially in areas close to paddocks. An important lesson for management is that grazing patterns need to be taken into consideration when determining the sustainable stocking rate for an area. To reduce the risk of bush encroachment in grazing systems with focal points such as paddocks or watering points, stocking rates need to be lower than in systems with a more uniform grazing distribution.

TI  - Study On Meteorological Disaster Monitoring Of Field Fruit Industry By Remote Sensing Data
AB  - Meteorological disasters have brought a great negative impact on people's lives. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the detection technology of meteorological disasters has been continuously improved. At present, satellite remote sensing detection technology has made gratifying achievements, and it has a good application in meteorological disaster prediction. In this paper, the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the process of meteorological disaster monitoring is discussed in depth. In traditional work, the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring is the key and difficult point of meteorological disaster prevention. Using satellite telemetry to monitor meteorological disasters can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring, provide reasonable solutions and decision-making basis for meteorological disaster prevention, and achieve the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper introduces the basic principle, technical system, and important role of satellite remote sensing technology, expounds on the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the monitoring of agricultural meteorological disasters such as water, drought, freezing, and hail, and provides a scientific reference for farmers, agricultural sustainability, and agricultural decision-making. The continuous development of our country's modern social economy has put forward higher requirements for agricultural production. Traditional monitoring technology can no longer meet the needs of agricultural meteorological disaster monitoring. The scientific application of remote sensing monitoring technology has important value, which can effectively improve the detection level and make it have higher accuracy and real-time performance, thereby promoting modern agricultural production in China. Based on the analysis of the application value of remote sensing monitoring technology, this paper comprehensively discusses the specific conditions of different disasters monitored by remote sensing monitoring technology in agricultural production. © 2022 Gao Bei et al.

TI  - Vegetation Trends And Ecological Effects On The Loess Plateau, China In The Last Forty Years
AB  - Since 1999, China has implemented the Grain for Green Project(GFGP), which has significantly changed the vegetation coverage status and land use structure of the Loess Plateau. As a result, vegetation coverage and ecological quality have been greatly improved. However, the spatio-temporal trend of the vegetation coverage is very uncertain, while the comprehensive assessment of its ecological effects has been relatively weak. To this end, two vegetation indices, including normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI)and fractional vegetation cover(FVC), were analyzed, and the changes in vegetation coverage and distribution on the Loess Plateau before and after the implementation of GFGP in the past forty years were reviewed. The results show that ① comparing five common data sets that record the dynamic changes of vegetation coverage, it is found that the data sources affect the authenticity of the eco-environmental benefits' evaluation results to a certain extent; ② the overall vegetation coverage of the Loess Plateau has been increasing in a fluctuating manner over the years, whose growth rate has surged due to the implementation of the project; its spatial distribution decreases from southeast to northwest, and is influenced by the ecosystem pattern, land use type, climate change, etc.; ③ with a rise of vegetation coverage, the water and soil conservation, and carbon sequestration capacity of the Loess Plateau ecosystem also gradually make a build-up, both of which are highly coupled with vegetation changes. According to the current situation of eco-environment management and food production level, it is recommended to strengthen the construction of high-standard farmland to alleviate the problem of arable land shortage caused by GFGP. Meanwhile, it is necessary to accelerate the promotion of ecological value transformation and eco-compensation, so that the lucid water and lush mountains can truly become invaluable assets. © 2023 Chang'an University

TI  - Using Neural Networks And Remote Sensing For Spatio-Temporal Prediction Of Air Pollution During The Covid-19 Pandemic
AB  - The study aims to monitor air pollution in Iranian metropolises using remote sensing, specifically focusing on pollutants such as O3, CH4, NO2, CO2, SO2, CO, and suspended particles (aerosols) in 2001 and 2019. Sentinel 5 satellite images are utilized to prepare maps of each pollutant. The relationship between these pollutants and land surface temperature (LST) is determined using linear regression analysis. Additionally, the study estimates air pollution levels in 2040 using Markov and Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov chains. Furthermore, three neural network models, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are employed for predicting contamination levels. The results of the research indicate an increase in pollution levels from 2010 to 2019. It is observed that temperature has a strong correlation with contamination levels (R2 = 0.87). The neural network models, particularly RBF and LSTM, demonstrate higher accuracy in predicting pollution with an R2 value of 0.90. The findings highlight the significance of managing industrial towns to minimize pollution, as these areas exhibit both high pollution levels and temperatures. So, the study emphasizes the importance of monitoring air pollution and its correlation with temperature. Remote sensing techniques and advanced prediction models can provide valuable insights for effective pollution management and decision-making processes. © 2023.

TI  - Quantitative Estimation For The Impact Of Mining Activities On Vegetation Phenology And Identifying Its Controlling Factors From Sentinel-2 Time Series
AB  - Quantitative assessment of the negative environmental effects of mining is vital for the eco-environmental restoration and management of mining areas. However, it remains unclear about the spatial dimension of the influence on the environment that comes from mining. Here, we constructed a new method to quantify the vegetation impact of mining activity using Sentinel-2 time series and Pareto principle, and applied it to the Liaoning Nanfen iron mining area (LNMA), the Inner Mongolia Sanheming iron mining area (IMMA), and the Sichuan Hongge iron mining area (SCMA) in China. Based on the unequal relationship of 80\% of the consequences determined by 20\% of the causes, the influence of mining activities on vegetation was quantified by the maximum phenological difference, the decay rate, the asymptotic value of exponential trend and the distance from the mine. Results showed that the impact of mining activities on vegetation phenology decayed exponentially along with the increase of the distance to the mines. The influence distance of mining activities on vegetation were 1566.95 m, 1959.67 m, and 1809.61 m for LNMA, IMMA and SCMA, respectively. Compared to areas 5 km away from the mining activity, the start of the growing season for vegetation surrounding the mining activity was delayed by 1.1 +/- 0.4 days, 6.1 +/- 1.9 days, and 1.5 +/- 0.7 days for LNMA, IMMA and SCMA, respectively, while the length of the growing season was successively shortened by 1.0 +/- 0.6 days, 5.4 +/- 2.5 days, and 5.1 +/- 3.9 days, respectively. Our investigation found that the dust pollution, decreases in groundwater levels, and waterborne pollution were the main factors that directly caused phenological changes around the mining area, and the distance and degree of their impact on phenology were closely related to drought and topography. This finding could provide a reference for the environmental restoration and management of mining areas and help to add insights on the assessment for the long-term impacts of mining activities on vegetation.

TI  - Bushfire Smoke: An Exemplar Of Coupled Human And Natural Systems
AB  - Carbon-based microscopic particles have provided a crucial line of evidence in understanding the coupling between humans and fires. Through the sedimentary record, they have informed our understandings of the patterns of climate and humans on fire activity through time. The extent of contemporary atmospheric biomass burning emissions has become apparent through satellite monitoring, motivated by concerns about the effect on the climate system. Sophisticated monitoring techniques designed to monitor industrial pollution have provided a data stream useful to determine the impacts on human health of wildfire smoke: we review this rapidly expanding field. The key findings are that biomass smoke is quantitatively and qualitatively different from urban air pollution and that there is no 'safe' level of biomass smoke exposure. Managing fires and smoke impacts will become increasingly challenging as the climate continues to warm and demands understanding the trade-off between wildfire and planned burns. The health impacts from severe smoke events are substantial when large populations are affected resulting in measurable increases in illness, hospital admissions, and deaths. The health impacts are not evenly distributed, and large segments of the population fall into higher risk groups. People in these categories are also likely to be adversely affected by the comparatively minor episodes of pollution generated by smaller planned burns. Planned burns thus need active programmes of public communication and air quality monitoring to ensure that the overall public health benefits of the intervention can be achieved with the minimum possible adverse impacts on higher risk individuals. © 2013 Institute of Australian Geographers.

TI  - Estimation Of Evapotranspiration Using The Crop Canopy Temperature At Field To Regional Scales In Large Irrigation District
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the hydrologic cycle, and its accurate estimation is essential in water resource management. In this study, field experiments were performed from 2015 to 2016 in the Jiefangzha Irrigation Area, Inner Mongolia, in China. To estimate the daily crop ET (ETd) using the midday canopy and air temperature difference (T-c-T-a) and net radiation (Rn-d), the S-I model (Seguin and Itier, 1983) was calibrated and validated based on observations from maize and sunflower fields. The canopy temperature and meteorological factors were monitored continuously and synchronously from June to August with a Canopy Temperature and Meteorology Monitoring System (CTMS). Parameters a and b in the S-I model were fitted at 10:00 to 16:00 by linear regression analysis between (ETd - Rn-d) and (T-c-T-a), from June to August 2015. Based on the values of a and b, the daily ET can be estimated using the S-I model (named ETM) from 10:00 to 16:00 in 2016, which provided good results for all the statistical parameters. The S-I model has performed reasonably well in predicting the ETd during the maize and sunflower growth period at the field scale. The Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) was employed to produce and fuse daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) (30 m) data by integrating high-spatial Landsat data and high-temporal MODIS images during the primary growing period of maize and sunflowers from June to August in 2015 and 2016. The fused LSTs exhibited good performance compared with the canopy temperature observed using the CTMS system in situ. Afterwards, the daily scale-field ET (30 m) was estimated by using the validated S-I model during the primary growing periods for maize and sunflowers at 11:00 in 2015 and 2016. The results showed that the estimated values of ET from the S-I model were consistent with the results for the regional water balance, with average relative error (RE) values of 7.0\%, 5.0\%, 9.4\% and 7.3\% (absolute value) in two years, in the Huangji, Qinghui, Wula and Yangjiahe sections of the Jiefangzha Irrigation Area, respectively. This finding indicates that as a relatively simple and convenient method, the S-I model could be applied to estimate the ET at a regional scale.

TI  - Benefits Of China's Efforts In Gaseous Pollutant Control Indicated By The Bottom-Up Emissions And Satellite Observations 2000-2014
AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of national air pollution control policies, the emissions of SO2, NOX, CO and CO2 in China are estimated using bottom-up methods for the most recent 15-year period (2000-2014). Vertical column densities (VCDs) from satellite observations are used to test the temporal and spatial patterns of emissions and to explore the ambient levels of gaseous pollutants across the country. The inter-annual trends in emissions and VCDs match well except for SO2. Such comparison is improved with an optimistic assumption in emission estimation that the emission standards for given industrial sources issued after 2010 have been fully enforced. Underestimation of emission abatement and enhanced atmospheric oxidization likely contribute to the discrepancy between SO2 emissions and VCDs. As suggested by VCDs and emissions estimated under the assumption of full implementation of emission standards, the control of SO2 in the 12th Five-Year Plan period (12th FYP, 2011-2015) is estimated to be more effective than that in the 11th FYP period (2006-2010), attributed to improved use of flue gas desulfurization in the power sector and implementation of new emission standards in key industrial sources. The opposite was true for CO, as energy efficiency improved more significantly from 2005 to 2010 due to closures of small industrial plants. Iron & steel production is estimated to have had particularly strong influence on temporal and spatial patterns of CO. In contrast to fast growth before 2011 driven by increased coal consumption and limited controls, NOX emissions decreased from 2011 to 2014 due to the penetration of selective catalytic/non-catalytic reduction systems in the power sector. This led to reduced NO2 VCDs, particularly in relatively highly polluted areas such as the eastern China and Pearl River Delta regions. In developed areas, transportation is playing an increasingly important role in air pollution, as suggested by the increased ratio of NO2 to SO2 VCDs. For air quality in mega cities, the inter-annual trends in emissions and VCDs indicate that surrounding areas are more influential in NO2 level for Beijing than those for Shanghai. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimating The Spatial Distribution Of Possible Livestock Production Level Using A Mathematical Model And The Smap Soil Moisture Data: The Case Of Botswana
AB  - In a traditional livestock farming, the livelihood of animals depends highly on existing plant biomass, which is affected by the level and intensity of temperature, rainfall, humidity and other meteorological variables. Understanding the interaction of such meteorological factors and agricultural production in general is an important aspect in planning at the macro and micro levels. Particularly livestock agriculture is heavily affected by the changing climate, and hence the variation in major meteorological variables. However, there is still limited research regarding the impacts of meteorological variables on livestock production in each particular region. Soil moisture is one of the main factors in agricultural production and hydrological cycles with better memory of previous weather conditions. It also involves complex structural characteristics and meteorological factors. In this study, a soil moisture dependent mathematical model for the interaction of plants and herbivores is developed and analysed. The Soil Moisture Active Passive level 4 satellite soil moisture data is used in the model to simulate the possible spatial distribution of plants and the corresponding potential livestock production level for Botswana. A global dynamic sensitivity analysis is employed to study the sensitivity of the solution of the model with a variation in the involved parameter values. The results of the simulations of the model show that estimated livestock harvest in wet regions is more than triple as compared to what is estimated for dry regions. If some important parameters are properly estimated and the soil moisture data is available for each region, it is possible to estimate the livestock production level for each spatial region with better accuracy using the proposed model. © 2022 the author(s).

TI  - Spatial Distribution Dependency Of Soil Organic Carbon Content To Important Environmental Variables
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) has a vital role in the physical, chemical and biological behavior of the soil, and therefore prediction of the amount and mapping spatial distribution of SOC is necessary for sustainable soil management. However, the relationship between SOC and remotely sensed and easily accessible variables have been rarely reported. The main objective of the present study is, therefore, to estimate SOC using the remote sensing of satellite images as well as some field variables for the Shazand Watershed, Iran. Towards that, 140 soil samples were taken from the top 30-cm of the soil from homogeneous units representing an area >1 km2 to measure SOC. The potential relationship between SOC and some remote sensing-based indices including Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Difference vegetation index (DVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Coloration Index (CI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and some topographical and soil texture factors viz. elevation, slope, aspect, Topographical Wetness Index (TWI), clay and silt content of soil were assessed for the Shazand Watershed. In this regard, the relationships between SOC and environmental variables were analyzed using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Random Forest (RF) analyses. The results showed that none of the models indicated a good predictive performance due to low R2. However, CI was found as a better predictor (R2 = 0.258 for GWR and R2 = 0.040 for OLS; p-value <0.05) for SOC in comparison with other indices. Accordingly, it was concluded that the remote sensing-based and environmental indices did not have enough potential for estimating SOC to generate managerial plans for the study watershed. The low SOC content (0.63 ± 0.29%) and low variation across the Shazand Watershed were found as determinant factors on the low fitness of the study relationships. Further studies are therefore needed to find out reliable predictive models for SOC for the conditions under considerations. © 2020

TI  - Leadership Principles For Developing A Statewide Public Health And Clinical Laboratory System
AB  - In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation established the national Laboratory Response Network (LRN) for bioterrorism readiness. A more broad application of the LRN is the National Laboratory System (NLS), an effort to promote the 10 Essential Public Health Services and the Core Functions and Capabilities of State Public Health Laboratories (hereafter, Core Functions). State public health laboratories (PHLs) are responsible for leading the development of both the LRN and the NLS in their jurisdictions. Based on the experience of creating a laboratory network in Wisconsin, leadership principles are provided for developing and strengthening statewide laboratory networks of PHLs and clinical laboratories, which can also include point-of-care testing sites. Each state PHL, in the context of these Core Functions and leadership principles, sets its priorities, budgets, and strategic plans. For a limited investment of personnel and funds that will yield a large benefit to public health, a robust state laboratory system can be established. ©2010 Association of Schools of Public Health.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring Of Long Time Series Of Ecological Quality In Urban Agglomerations Using Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing: A Case Study Of The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
AB  - The impact of human activities on the ecological environment is becoming more intense, and timely dynamic monitoring of the ecological status and change information is of great significance to urban ecological management, protection and sustainable development. The remote sensing-based ecological index (i.e. RSEI) is an objective, fast and simple ecological quality monitoring and evaluation method and has been widely applied in the field of ecological studies. But it often faces the problems of cloud occlusion and difficulty in mosaic when conducting large-scale and long-term monitoring. Thus, in this study, we collected 3530 Landsat images from 1988 to 2018 over the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and removed their clouds on Google Earth Engine(GEE) platform. The median value composite was adopted to calculate remote sensing indicators such as greenness, wetness, dryness and heat year by year and the RSEI was constructed using principal component analysis to evaluate the temporal and spatial changes of ecological quality in the region over the past 30 years. The method ameliorates RSEI in terms of the problems of data missing and image mosaic for large-scale and long-term monitoring, and increases the comparability of time series. The results show that: (1) the RSEI can better characterize the ecological quality of the GBA, in which greenness and wetness indicators have a positive correlation with RSEI, while dryness and heat indicators are negatively correlated with it. (2) In perspective of time, the ecological quality of GBA has shown a fluctuating downward trend of “up-down-up-down” in the past 30 years. In perspective of space, the ecological quality has presented obviously spatial heterogeneity, mainly showing the state of high in the northwest and northeast and low in the middle. The severe and moderately degraded areas are mainly concentrated in the central area, and the overall improvement areas are mainly located in the west and northeast. The unchanging areas mainly include the northern area and the Hong Kong, and the lightly degraded areas are scattered. (3) When using the RSEI, image processing of median composite based on the GEE cloud computing can better improve the problems of remote sensing image data missing, chromatic aberration and time inconsistency, greatly improve the efficiency of image processing, and extend the remote sensing ecological index in a large-scale and long-term sequence of ecology monitoring application. The research results can provide a reference for improving the scope and accuracy of the RSEI, and provide a theoretical basis for ecological protection and land management in the context of rapid urbanization. © 2020 Science Press.

TI  - Small Satellite Constellations: National Security Implications
AB  - There are both positive and negative national security implications associated with the deployment of small satellite constellations, particularly those destined to be mega-constellations. This chapter attempts to discuss both sides, benefits, and risks, aimed to enable the reader to decide whether they are optimistic or pessimistic, or indeed cautiously ambivalent about small satellite constellations. In this context, this chapter first provides definitions for national security (taking into account personal and financial security), small satellites, and constellations. Its subsequent two sections deliberate about various potential positive and negative implications for national security of small satellite constellations in more detail. On the positive side, the analytical focus is on the capability enabling functions of small satellites, their antisatellite (ASAT) capability, as well as their ability to upgrade, enhance resilience of and reconstitute space system functionality. On the negative side, the chapter examines such national security-related risks as increased orbital congestion, frequency overcrowding, and the danger to people, property, and environment. The penultimate section deals with the issue of managing the risks, with particular consideration of the concept of responsible use, considering observability, maneuverability, communication and controllability, the ability of small satellites to operate safely, regulation, legality and ethical constraints, as well as liability. The chapter concludes with a brief summary and the authors’ view on how progress might be made in a way that embraces small satellite constellations responsibly, to optimize their benefits, while protecting global security concerns. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics Evaluation Of Pixel-Level Gross Domestic Product, Electric Power Consumption, And Carbon Emissions In Countries Along The Belt And Road
AB  - The ambiguous relationship between the international economy, energy, and carbon emissions has become a significant factor restricting sustainable development. This study attempts to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics and interrelationships of gross domestic product (GDP), electric power consumption (EPC), and carbon emissions (CE) in the Belt and Road (B&R) regions using Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) remote sensing data. Annual nighttime light (ANL) images were synthesized, and the accuracy of the ANL data was improved using the multiperiod mask denoising method. Then, the GDP, EPC, and CE at 0.5 km resolution were modelled. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of regional development were comprehensively analysed at multiple scales. The results reveal that the development in the eastern and western parts of the B&R regions has significant differences. China, India, and some countries in Southeast Asia have developed rapidly and in a relatively balanced manner, whereas the development of Central and Eastern Europe and western Russia has been relatively slow and uncoordinated. The geographical centre of the overall development of the B&R continued to migrate to the southeast. This study provides more detailed and comprehensive insights into GDP, EPC, and CE in the B&R regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Crop Model- And Satellite Imagery-Based Recommendation Tool For Variable Rate N Fertilizer Application For The Us Corn System
AB  - Precision nitrogen (N) management for corn has gained popularity due to both economic and environmental considerations. There is sufficient evidence demonstrating that N fertilizer efficiency can be improved by implementing sidedress and variable rate fertilization. In this paper, a crop model- and satellite imagery-based decision-support tool for recommending variable rate N fertilization at a high resolution of 5 m x 5 m is introduced. The sub-field management zones were delineated by overlapping the soil survey geographic (SSURGO) soil map units with wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI)-derived relative productivity zones. The calibrated Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) was used to simulate a range of soil N processes, corn growth and N uptake by assimilating real-time weather data from the National Climate Data Center (NCDC). Sidedress N rates were estimated based on the target rate, N loss via leaching and denitrification, plant uptake and leftover N in the soil. The tool was tested on a 66 ha corn field in Illinois, USA for the growing season of 2015. Results showed that N-Prescription was able to give reasonable management zone delineation and sidedress N recommendation. The recommended sidedress N ranged from 60 to over 120 kg ha(-1). Corn yield was greater in areas with higher sidedress recommendation, but the benefit from sidedress decreased with the increasing rate and plateaued above 110 kg ha(-1). Sensitivity analysis suggested that soil hydraulic properties and soil organic matter content were critical to the sidedress accounting. Corn growth, and hence the cumulative N uptake, can be well simulated by calibrating the WDRVI derived leaf area index. This tool could serve as a good foundation for further development in precision N management.

TI  - Emission Monitoring Mobile Experiment (Emme): An Overview And First Results Of The St. Petersburg Megacity Campaign 2019
AB  - Global climate change is one of the most important scientific, societal and economic contemporary challenges. Fundamental understanding of the major processes driving climate change is the key problem which is to be solved not only on a global but also on a regional scale. The accuracy of regional climate modelling depends on a number of factors. One of these factors is the adequate and comprehensive information on the anthropogenic impact which is highest in industrial regions and areas with dense population - modern megacities. Megacities are not only "heat islands", but also significant sources of emissions of various substances into the atmosphere, including greenhouse and reactive gases. In 2019, the mobile experiment EMME (Emission Monitoring Mobile Experiment) was conducted within the St. Petersburg agglomeration (Russia) aiming to estimate the emission intensity of greenhouse (CO2, CH4) and reactive (CO, NOx) gases for St. Petersburg, which is the largest northern megacity. St. Petersburg State University (Russia), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany) and the University of Bremen (Germany) jointly ran this experiment. The core instruments of the campaign were two portable Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers which were used for ground-based remote sensing measurements of the total column amount of CO2, CH4 and CO at upwind and downwind locations on opposite sides of the city. The NO2 tropospheric column amount was observed along a circular highway around the city by continuous mobile measurements of scattered solar visible radiation with an OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. Simultaneously, air samples were collected in air bags for subsequent laboratory analysis. The air samples were taken at the locations of FTIR observations at the ground level and also at altitudes of about 100 m when air bags were lifted by a kite (in case of suitable landscape and favourable wind conditions). The entire campaign consisted of 11 mostly cloudless days of measurements in March-April 2019. Planning of measurements for each day included the determination of optimal location for FTIR spectrometers based on weather forecasts, combined with the numerical modelling of the pollution transport in the megacity area. The real-time corrections of the FTIR operation sites were performed depending on the actual evolution of the megacity NOx plume as detected by the mobile DOAS observations. The estimates of the St. Petersburg emission intensities for the considered greenhouse and reactive gases were obtained by coupling a box model and the results of the EMME observational campaign using the mass balance approach. The CO2 emission flux for St. Petersburg as an area source was estimated to be 89 +/- 28 kt km(-2) yr(-1), which is 2 times higher than the corresponding value in the EDGAR database. The experiment revealed the CH4 emission flux of 135 +/- 68 tkm(-2) yr(-1), which is about 1 order of magnitude greater than the value reported by the official inventories of St. Petersburg emissions (similar to 25 t km(-2) yr(-1) for 2017). At the same time, for the urban territory of St. Petersburg, both the EM ME experiment and the official inventories for 2017 give similar results for the CO anthropogenic flux (251 +/- 104 t km(-2) yr(-1) vs. 410 tkm(-2) yr(-1)) and for the NOx anthropogenic flux (66 +/- 28 tkm(-2) yr(-1) vs. 69 tkm(-2) yr(-1)).

TI  - High-Resolution Emission Inventory Of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds For Rapidly Urbanizing Areas: A Case Of Shenzhen Megacity, China
AB  - The effects of volatile organic compounds on urban air quality and the ozone have been widely acknowledged, and the contributions of relevant biogenic sources are currently receiving rising attentions. However, inventories of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are in fact limited for the environmental management of megacities. In this study, we provided an estimation of BVOC emissions and their spatial characteristics in a typical urbanized area, Shenzhen megacity, China, based on an in-depth vegetation investigation and using remote sensing data. The total BVOC emission in Shenzhen in 2019 was estimated to be 3.84 x 109 g C, of which isoprene contributed to about 24.4\%, monoterpenes about 44.4\%, sesquiterpenes about 1.9\%, and other VOCs (OVOCs) about 29.3\%. Metropolitan BVOC emissions exhibited a seasonal pattern with a peak in July and a decline in January. They were mainly derived from the less built-up areas (88.9\% of BVOC emissions). Estimated BVOCs comprised around 5.2\% of the total municipal VOC emissions in 2019. This percentage may increase as more green spaces emerge and anthropogenic emissions decrease in built-up areas. Furthermore, synergistic effects existed between BVOC emissions and relevant vegetation-based ecosystem services (e.g., air purification, carbon fixation). Greening during urban sprawl should be based on a trade-off between BVOC emissions and ecosystem benefits of urban green spaces. The results suggested that urban greening in Shenzhen, and like other cities as well, need to account for BVOC contributions to ozone. Meanwhile, greening cites should adopt proactive environmental management by using plant species with low BVOC emissions to maintain urban ecosystem services while avoid further degradation to ozone pollution.

TI  - Adaptive Eco-Economic Regionalization Model And Its Application
AB  - Achieving sustainable urban development during rapid urbanization is one of the important issues worldwide. Eco-economic regionalization (EER) is a complex regionalization method for dividing urban regions into different eco-economic functional zones by considering a wide range of local environmental (water-heat condition, biodiversity, vegetation coverage rate, etc.) and socio-economic (gross domestic product (GDP), population density, human activity pressure, road network density, etc.) factors. Urban and regional planning based on EER might be beneficial for local environmental protection, as well as sustainable economic growth. Previous studies have investigated the principles, methods, and index system for EER application. However, improving the accuracy and dynamic adaptability of EER is essential in order to ensure its application to small urban regions. In this study, the EER approach was modified by simulating population density in urban areas of Zengcheng District, Guangzhou, and an adaptive regionalization model was developed using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Improving the accuracy of raw input data for calculating the indices is important to ensure the accuracy of the EER results. Previously, population density was aggregated on an administrative regional basis, whereas, in this study, we estimated population density grid by grid within the built-up area of Zengcheng District by linear modeling of the gray value in each pixel from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System nighttime light data. According to the linear model, the total number aggregated from all these pixels was equal to the statistical population in each administrative region by assuming that nobody lives outside the built-up area. Further, an Adaptive Eco-economic Regionalization model (AEER) was developed for Zengcheng District in order to enhance the dynamic adaptability of the EER approach. In our AEER model, the study area was first divided into four zones-ecological conservation zone, ecological priority zone, development optimization zone, and key development zone-allowing the comparison of EER results across various case study areas. Next, the area and location of each of the four zones were determined by introducing six parameters into the AEER model so that the results could be more adaptive to local management objectives. Further, two scenarios were developed for the application of this AEER model in Zengcheng District. Our results indicated that the AEER model yields highly accurate zoning results that are more adaptive to the local context. Therefore, this model might be a powerful tool for urban and regional EER applications in other city areas. Further, three perspectives have been proposed on improving the current EER model:(1) Producing spatially explicit input data for index estimation (such as GDP and available resources, both of which are normally aggregated on administrative regional basis) is the key to improving the accuracy of the zoning results. (2) The results from the EER model are only useful when the zoning process is more adaptive to local management objectives. (3) The zoning results should be presented for each administrative region in order to obtain strong policy implications; further, they should be presented grid by grid so that the vital ecological processes can be better preserved based on this EER approach. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - The Role Of Off-Farm Employment In Tropical Forest Conservation: Labor, Migration, And Smallholder Attitudes Toward Land In Western Uganda
AB  - The potential for off-farm employment (OFE) to contribute significantly to forest conservation in the tropics is a widely held logic among donors, governments, and social scientists. While an aggregate level examination of OFE cases can support this logic, there is disagreement as to the operative aspects of specific linkages and assumptions. This study examines the case of the tea industry in western Uganda, and uses a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing to pursue a more nuanced examination of the role of migration and non-monetary aspects of OFE on forest conservation in both a national park and unprotected forest contexts. Results indicate that the tea industry does serve as an off-farm employer to a limited number of local smallholders but these benefits are offset by the industry's overwhelming dependence on migrant labor which sees OFE as temporary, then seeks to settle locally. There is also evidence that the tea industry is contributing to conservation efforts of Kibale National Park by unintentionally serving as a physical buffer zone, which inhibits both human encroachment on the park and wildlife encroachment on smallholder crops. The latter represents a site-specific phenomenon that holds much potential for future management plans of the area and exemplifies the importance of considering the site-specific circumstances associated with OFE development.

TI  - Managing Multi-Center Recruitment In The Plco Cancer Screening Trial
AB  - There were significant recruitment challenges specific to the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. Large numbers of participants were to be randomized from ten catchment areas nationwide within time and budgetary constraints. The eligible population was elderly and had to meet health and behavioral thresholds. Informed consent was required to participate and be randomized to screening for three cancers at periodic clinic visits or to a usual care arm that included no clinical visits. Consenting required special efforts to fully explain the trial and its potential scientific benefit to future patients with potentially no benefits but possible harms to PLCO participants. Participation would include continued follow-up for at least 13 years after randomization. Strong collaborative investments were required by the NCI and screening centers (SCs) to assure timely recruitment and appropriate racial participation. A trial-wide pilot phase tested recruitment and protocol follow through at SCs and produced a vanguard population of 11,406 participants. NCI announced the trial nationally in advance of the pilot and followed with an even more intense collaborative role with SCs for the main phase to facilitate trial-wide efficient and timely recruitment. Special efforts to enhance recruitment in the main phase included centralized and local monitoring of progress, cross-linking SCs to share experiences in problem solving, centralized training, substantial additional funding dedicated to recruitment and retention, including specialized programs for minority recruitment, obtaining national endorsement by the American Cancer Society, launching satellite recruitment and screening centers, including minority focused satellites, and adding a new SC dedicated to minority recruitment. © 2015, Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Urban Green And Blue Space Changes: A Spatiotemporal Evaluation Of Impacts On Ecosystem Service Value In Bangladesh
AB  - The rapid decline in urban green (UGS) and blue space (UBS) in developing countries has led to a widespread degradation of available ecosystem services (ES). However, impacts of UGS and UBS changes on ES tend to vary over space and time, and to date these impacts have not been studied in sufficient detail in emerging economies. By comparing UGS and UBS change patterns with multitemporal Landsat data recorded during the past 30 years (1991-2021), this study has examined the impact of several factors on ES in some of the world's climate hotspots. Although obtaining relevant and accurate information on ES is difficult in many parts of the developing world, this work has developed baseline data suitable for assessing ES loss over five densely populated cities in Bangladesh - Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet. ES loss was quantified in monetary terms using adjusted value coefficients. The topographic and anthropogenic factors driving spatial differences in ES degradation in these cities were analyzed with a geographical detector. The results indicated that the cities experienced a combined monetary loss of USD 628.58 million as a result of specific ES degradation, primarily due to the decline of UGS and UBS. The value of ES loss was notably higher in Dhaka and Chattogram than in the other cities due to marked differences in anthropogenic activities. Population growth, extensive urban sprawl, and the development of dense road networks were identified as the major causes of urban green and blue space loss and consequent reduction of ES. The findings of this study provide important insights which can be used to support the formulation of public policies and management plans aimed at restoring and maintaining sustainable urban ecosystems.

TI  - High Spectral And Spatial Resolution Hyperspectral Imagery For Quantifying Russian Wheat Aphid Infestation In Wheat Using The Constrained Energy Minimization Classifier
AB  - The effects of insect infestation in agricultural crops are of major ecological and economic interest because of reduced yield, increased cost of pest control and increased risk of environmental contamination from insecticide application. The Russian wheat aphid (RWA, Diuraphis noxia) is an insect pest that causes damage to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We proposed that concentrated RWA feeding areas, referred to as "hotspots," could be identified and isolated from uninfested areas within a field for site specific aphid management using remotely sensed data. Our objectives were to ( 1) investigate the reflectance characteristics of infested and uninfested wheat by RWA and (2) evaluate utility of airborne hyperspectral imagery with 1-m spatial resolution for detecting, quantifying, and mapping RWA infested areas in commercial winter wheat fields using the constrained energy minimization classifier. Percent surface reflectance from uninfested wheat was lower in the visible and higher in the near infrared portions of the spectrum when compared with RWA-infested wheat. The overall classification accuracies of > 89\% for damage detection were achieved. These results indicate that hyperspectral imagery can be effectively used for accurate detection and quantification of RWA infestation in wheat for site-specific aphid management. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Detection Of The Filling Phases Of The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Using Sentinel-1 Sar Data
AB  - The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is regarded as one of the most critical water issues in downstream countries. While the GERD offers hopeful development chances for Ethiopia, the reduced flow of the Nile would exacerbate Egypt's current water shortage. Many stress factors are of particular interest for Egypt include population growth, global warming, economic expansion, and groundwater depletion. These factors represent significant challenges in the use and management of the primary water resource of the Nile Basin. The purpose of this study was to monitor the two phases of filling the GERD reservoir using VV polarized SAR data and ALOS global DEM. To achieve this aim, 14 scenes of Sentinel-1A imagery were processed using SNAP Toolbox. To automatically extract water bodies, a histogram of backscatter values (dB) in the VV band was developed to determine the optimal threshold value that separates water from non-water features. From our analysis, we observed that the pixels of backscatter values (dB) in the VV band lower than-18 dB were classified as water pixels. Also, the results showed that the volume of water at the GERD reservoir increased by approximately 4.12 billion m(3) during the period from August 2, 2020, to July 28, 2021. Our findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy for Sentinel-1 SAR data was 97\% and the kappa coefficient was 0.94. This study confirmed the efficiency of using SAR data to monitor the changes in the water volume during the filling process of the GERD reservoir and its impacts on downstream countries.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing \& Space Science.

TI  - Simultaneous Multi-Crop Land Suitability Prediction From Remote Sensing Data Using Semi-Supervised Learning
AB  - Land suitability models for Canada are currently based on single-crop inventories and expert opinion. We present a data-driven multi-layer perceptron that simultaneously predicts the land suitability of several crops in Canada, including barley, peas, spring wheat, canola, oats, and soy. Available crop yields from 2013–2020 are downscaled to the farm level by masking the district level crop yield data to focus only on areas where crops are cultivated and leveraging soil-climate-landscape variables obtained from Google Earth Engine for crop yield prediction. This new semi-supervised learning approach can accommodate data from different spatial resolutions and enables training with unlabelled data. The incorporation of a crop indicator function further allows for the training of a multi-crop model that can capture the interdependences and correlations between various crops, thereby leading to more accurate predictions. Through k-fold cross-validation, we show that compared to the single crop models, our multi-crop model could produce up to a 2.82 fold reduction in mean absolute error for any particular crop. We found that barley, oats, and mixed grains were more tolerant to soil-climate-landscape variations and could be grown in many regions of Canada, while non-grain crops were more sensitive to environmental factors. Predicted crop suitability was associated with a region’s growing season length, which supports climate change projections that regions of northern Canada will become more suitable for agricultural use. The proposed multi-crop model could facilitate assessment of the suitability of northern lands for crop cultivation and be incorporated into cost-benefit analyses. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Identification Of Soil Erosion-Susceptible Areas Using Fuzzy Logic And Analytical Hierarchy Process Modeling In An Agricultural Watershed Of Burdwan District, India
AB  - Soil erosion is a natural process; it adversely impacts natural resources, agricultural activities, ecological systems, and environmental quality as it degrades landscapes and water quality, disrupts ecosystems, and intensifies hazards. Management strategies are needed that protect soil erosion in agricultural watersheds to achieve the sustainable land-use planning. This study maps soil erosion susceptibility using two GIS-based machine-learning approaches-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy logic modeling in the Kunur River Basin, West Bengal, India. Fifteen soil erosion conditioning variables were integrated with the modeling methods, remote sensing data, and GIS analysis. The relative importance of the conditioning variables was assessed for their capacities to predict susceptibility of locations to soil erosion. The soil erosion susceptibility maps generated from the two models used 70\% of surveyed soil erosion sites. These models' maps were validated with the characteristics of the remaining 30\% of the soil erosion sites to produce a receiver operating characteristics curve. The results indicated that the fuzzy logic model has the higher prediction accuracy; the area under the curve (AUC) value was 91.4\%. The AUC value of the AHP model was 89.7\%. Both models indicated that study area contains regions of high to severe soil erosion susceptibility. Logistic regression was used to discern the variables' importance in the assessment. Relief, NDVI, distance from a river, rainfall erosivity, and soil types were the most important variables. TWI, SPI, aspect, and a sediment transportation index were of least importance. Fuzzy-logic-generated SESMs can be effective tools to guide protective actions and land managers' measures during the primary stages of soil erosion to control the development of soil degradation.

TI  - Actual And Standard Crop Coefficients For Semi-Natural And Planted Grasslands And Grasses: A Review Aimed At Supporting Water Management To Improve Production And Ecosystem Services
AB  - Natural and planted grasslands play a very important role in agriculture as source of various ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and are responsible for a large fraction of agricultural water use in rainfed and irrigated fields. It is, therefore, relevant to precisely know their water use and vegetation requirements with consideration of relevant climate, from extremely cold, dry, with long winter seasons, to tropical humid and hot climates, thus with a large variability of vegetation. Semi-natural grasslands are basically used for grazing and mainly refer to highland pastures and meadows, steppes, savannas, pampas, and mixed forest systems. The FAO method to compute crop (vegetation) evapotranspiration (ETc) through the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) by the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is adopted. The selected papers were those where actual ETc (ETc act) was derived from field observations and ETo was computed with the FAO56 definition, or with another method that could be referred to the former. Field derived ETc act methods included soil water balance, Bowen ratio and eddy covariance measurements, as well as remote sensing vegetation indices or surface energy balance models, thus reviewed Kc act (ETc act/ETo) values were obtained from field data. These Kc act refer to initial, mid-season and end season (Kc act ini, Kc act mid, Kc act end) when reported values were daily or monthly; otherwise, only average values (Kc act avg) were collected. For cases relative to cold or freezing winters, data refer to the warm season only. For grasses cut for hay, Kc act ini, Kc act mid, and Kc act end refer to a cut cycle. Kc act values rarely exceeded 1.25, thus indicating that field measurements reported did respect the available energy for evaporation. Overall, Kc act mid for semi-natural grasslands in cold climates were lower than those in hot climates except when available water was high, with Kc act mid for meadows and mountain pastures generally high. Steppes have Kc act mid values lower than savannas. Grasses commonly planted for hay and for landscape generally showed high Kc act mid values, while a larger variability was observed with grasses for grazing. The collected Kc act values were used to define standard Kc values for all grassland and grasses. Nevertheless, the tabulated Kc act are indicative values of Kc to be used for actual water management purposes and/or irrigation scheduling of planted grasslands. It is expected that a better knowledge of the standard and/or indicative Kc values for a wide variety of grasslands and grasses will support better management aimed to improve grass productivity and ecosystem services, including biodiversity and carbon sequestration. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Impact Of Land Use On Atmospheric Particulate Matter Concentrations: A Case Study Of The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China
AB  - The increasing frequency of human activities has accelerated changes in land use types and consequently affected the atmospheric environment. In this manuscript, we analyze the relationships between the particulate matter concentration and land use changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China, from 2015 to 2018. The experimental results indicate that (1) an improved sine function model can suitably fit the periodic changes in the particulate matter concentration, with the average R-2 value increasing to 0.65 from the traditional model value of 0.49, while each model coefficient effectively estimates the change characteristics of each stage. (2) Among all land use types, the particulate matter concentrations in construction land and farmland are high, with a large annual difference between high and low values. The concentration decreases slowly in spring and summer but increases rapidly in autumn and winter. The concentrations in forestland and grassland are the lowest; the difference between high and low values is small for these land use types, and the concentration fluctuation pattern is relatively uniform. Natural sources greatly influence the concentration fluctuations, among which frequent dusty weather conditions in spring impose a greater influence on forestland and grassland than on the other land use types. (3) The landscape pattern of land use exerts a significant influence on the particulate matter concentration. Generally, the lower the aggregation degree of patches is, the higher the fragmentation degree is, the more complex the shape is, the higher the landscape abundance is, and the lower the particulate matter concentration is. The higher the construction land concentration is, the more easily emission sources can be aggregated to increase the particulate matter concentration. However, when forestland areas are suitably connected, this land use type can play a notable role in inhibiting particulate matter concentration aggravation. This conclusion is of great relevance to urban land use planning and sustainable development.

TI  - Assessment Of The Environmental Impacts Of Gold Mining Activities At Gankombol (Adamawa-Cameroon) Using Leopold Matrix, Fecteau Grid And Remote Sensing Approach
AB  - In the present study, the environmental impacts of gold mining activities at Gankombol (Adamawa Cameroon) are assessed over four-year period. The Leopold matrix and the Fecteau grid are used to identify the environmental impacts and to determine their absolute importance. The spatio-temporal variation of spectral indices and land degradation are assessed using remote sensing analysis. The approach adopted is based on the calculation of spectral indices and spatio-temporal analysis. For this purpose, from Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the brightness index (BRI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the bare soil index (BSI) and the dry bare soil index (DBSI) are computed during four years (2016, 2019, 2020 and 2021). The environmental degradation maps are generated by using supervised Random Forests (RF) algorithm and field observations. Finally, the confusion matrix and the kappa coefficient are used to check the performance and the accuracy of the classification maps. The environmental impact assessment by the Leopold matrix and the Fecteau grid reveal that the environmental impacts of mining activities are mainly negative and manifested by deforestation, degradation of water and soil quality, and high risks to human health. These impacts have a major absolute importance. The analysis of the spectral indices suggest a clear difference between the values obtained for each year due to the evolution of the mining activity over time. The environmental degradation maps which made it possible to discriminate water bodies, exploited area, vegetation and barren soils show that the values of water bodies decrease from 16.33 to 11.69 km2 between 2016 and 2020, then increase to 13.46 km2 in 2021. The exploited area increases from 0.00 to 13.75 km2 between 2016 and 2021. Vegetation cover decreases from 24.49 to 15.25 km2 between 2016 and 2021, while barren soils increase from 19.65 to 21.53 km2 between 2019 and 2021. These results reveal significant environmental degradation in the study area due to mining activities.

TI  - Remote Sensing For The Analysis Of Anthropogenic Geomorphology: Potential Responses To Sediment Dynamics In The Agricultural Landscapes
AB  - Agricultural modern land transformations are usually undertaken with minimal landscape planning, and soil conservation practices are largely ignored during the construction phase. As a consequence, changes to terrain morphology induce dramatic geomorphological effects that can endure well beyond any single farming cycle and over many human generations. Thus, agricultural activities that may not be obvious to the observers of contemporary landscapes can continue to influence surface processes and landforms strongly; these effects are even more critical in the current situation of climate change and rainfall event intensification. An understanding and successful prediction of pathways of runoff and associated soil erosion due to terracing are, therefore, of considerable societal relevance. Such predictions would allow improvements to the protection of the environment by the reduction of impacts of the agricultural activities or by a correct restoration of abandoned agricultural land (especially terraces). Using two examples from northern Spain and northern Italy, this chapter shows how new remote sensing technologies (i.e., airborne lidar), available to the public, can provide a better understanding of the interaction between anthropogenic elements, potential erosion, and the associated sediment delivery. During the planning and management phase, the farmers and authorities in charge of monitoring both the subsidy process and land management should consider an approach similar to that presented in this research, together with a holistic view of the processes in the areas, specifically related to climate and soil. It is currently possible to forecast how agricultural practices could affect sediment fluxes in the future, and thus to have a better understanding of the human-landscape interactions. This type of integrated analysis is a cost-effective strategy for the management, restoration, or development of terraced lands, especially in areas with high economic value for agricultural productions and tourism. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Exploring The Spatial Patterns Of Vegetation Fragmentation Using Local Spatial Autocorrelation Indices
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of urban vegetation obtained from discrete land cover classes is sensitive to classification errors and can result in a substantial loss of information, due to the degradation of continuous quantitative information. Although there is an increasing ecological need to use continuous methods to understand spatial heterogeneity and vegetation fragmentation, they remain unexplored. Since local indicators of spatial association (LISA) can capture important spatial patterns of clustering and dispersion at a local scale, it can capture important ecological patterns and process of vegetation fragmentation. This work examines the utility of LISA which allows exploration of local patterns in spatial data in identifying high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) spatial clusters of vegetation patches and fragmentation patterns in Harare metropolitan city in Zimbabwe. The LISA indices of Getis-Ord Gi∗ and local Moran's I are computed both on continuous normalized difference vegetation index and discrete land cover data of vegetation and nonvegetation of Sentinel 2016 and 2018. Local spatial clustering patterns are identified with Z-score values that indicate the significance of each statistic. High positive Z-scores are located in the large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation. Negative Z-scores are located in more dispersed and highly fragmented vegetation. The results suggest that there is a strong tendency for large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation patches to be spatially clustered and for small, isolated and sparse vegetation patches to be dispersed. The highly fragmented vegetation patches are located in the heavily urbanized part of the city. Overall, findings of this study underscore the relevance of the spatially explicit method of LISA as a valuable source of spatial information for the assessment of local spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. This can be used to develop policies that support effective conservation and restoration strategies. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Performance Assessment Of The Seviri Evapotranspiration Operational Product: Results Over Diverse Mediterranean Ecosystems
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important variable in weather systems and hydrometeorological modeling. In this paper, an extensive validation was carried out on the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) ET operational product, evaluating its accuracy at selected European sites. Validation was performed through comparisons with in-situ eddy covariance measurements belonging to the CarboEurope IP network. Comparisons were performed for selected cloud-free days with a satisfactory energy balance ratio in 2011. A total of nine sites covering six land covers were used in validating the ET retrieval accuracy from the operational product. A series of statistical metrics was computed to evaluate the agreement, which also included explored the variability of site characteristics and influence of land cover on ET performances. Overall, a good agreement was reported between the satellite-derived ET estimates and the ground measurements (d-index = 0.755, root mean square deviation (RMSD) = 0.107 mm h(-1)). A minor negative bias of -0.015 mm h(-1) suggested only slight underestimation of the in-situ data. In terms of land cover, the highest agreement in ET was reported for the olive orchards and open shrubland sites (d-index = 0.893/0.867, RMSD = 0.041/0.050 mm h(-1)). A systematic ET underestimation by SEVIRI was found for all land cover types. Results of this study are largely in agreement to previous analogous validation studies of the product. Our findings support the potential value of the SEVIRI ET product for regional to mesoscale studies and practical applications. The latter is of particular importance for water limiting environments such as those found in the Mediterranean basin, as accurate information on ET rates can provide tremendous support in sustainable water resource management as well as policy and decision making.

TI  - Remote Sensing Based Drought Monitoring In Zimbabwe
AB  - Purpose - Drought monitoring is an important process for national agricultural and environmental planning. Droughts are normal recurring climatic phenomena that affect people and landscapes. They occur at different scales (locally, regionally, and nationally), and for periods of time ranging from weeks to decades. In Zimbabwe drought is increasingly becoming an annual phenomenon, with varying parts of the country being affected. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the spatial variations in the seasonal occurrences of drought in Zimbabwe over a period of five years. Design/methodology/approach - The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which shows how close the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of the current time is to the minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index calculated from the long-term record for that given time, was used to monitor drought occurrence in Zimbabwe. A time series of dekadal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, calculated from SPOT images, was used to compute seasonal VCI maps from 2005 to 2010. The VCI maps were then classified into three drought severity classes (severe, moderate, and mild) based on the relative changes in the vegetation condition from extremely bad to optimal. Findings - The results showed that droughts occur annually in Zimbabwe though, on average, the droughts are mostly mild. The occurrence and the spatial distribution of drought in Zimbabwe was also found to be random affecting different places from season to season thus the authors conclude that most parts of the country are drought prone. Originality/value - Remote sensing technologies utilising such indices as the VCI can be used for drought monitoring in Zimbabwe.

TI  - Identifying Predictable Foraging Habitats For A Wide-Ranging Marine Predator Using Ensemble Ecological Niche Models
AB  - Aim Ecological niche modelling can provide valuable insight into species' environmental preferences and aid the identification of key habitats for populations of conservation concern. Here, we integrate biologging, satellite remote-sensing and ensemble ecological niche models (EENMs) to identify predictable foraging habitats for a globally important population of the grey-headed albatross (GHA) Thalassarche chrysostoma Location Bird Island, South Georgia; Southern Atlantic Ocean. Methods GPS and geolocation-immersion loggers were used to track at-sea movements and activity patterns of GHA over two breeding seasons (n = 55; brood-guard). Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years. Results Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic (<500 m), shelf break and oceanic waters, coinciding with a set of persistent biophysical conditions characterized by particular thermal ranges (3-8 degrees C, 12-13 degrees C), elevated primary productivity (chl-a > 0.5 mg m(-3)) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance. Main conclusions EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions. Our analysis highlights the value of EENM for use with movement data in identifying at-sea habitats of wide-ranging marine predators, with clear implications for conservation and management.

TI  - Mapping Urban Sprawl And Impervious Surfaces In The Northeast United States For The Past Four Decades
AB  - Mapping urban expansion and impervious surfaces (IS) has become a useful tool for supporting watershed assessments. The lack of large-area time-series maps created the need to develop an approach and products that can easily be scaled. In this research application, 81 Landsat 1, 2, and 5 scenes for the epochs of 1975, 1985, and 1996 were used to map urban land use/land cover across New England, USA. A Classification And Regression Tree (CART) using random forest classified the landscape into a scheme matching the 2011 National Land Cover Database scheme, which was then aggregated to urban versus nonurban land cover. Regression models between Tasseled Cap brightness and greenness indices and IS values were developed. The CART and IS models were applied to modern imagery and backcast to selected archived imagery to generate maps of urban and IS across New England for the past four decades. The aggregated urban versus nonurban maps had an overall accuracy of 95\% and the IS model had an R-2 of 0.89. Multiscale spatiotemporal analyses show the highest urban expansion in watersheds along the coasts in southeastern New England and along highway corridors. Imperviousness intensity increase of urban existing in 1975 was highest for the coastal northeast between 1975 and 2011. The products will be used to support lake risk management and help identify potential stressors to lake health in the northeast.

TI  - Integrating Land Cover Structure And Functioning To Predict Biodiversity Patterns: A Hierarchical Modelling Framework Designed For Ecosystem Management
AB  - Context: Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) dynamics is one of the main drivers of global environmental change. In the last years, aerial and satellite imagery have been increasingly used to monitor the spatial extent of changes in LU/LC, deriving relevant biophysical parameters (i.e. primary productivity, climate and habitat structure) that have clear implications in determining spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity, landscape composition and ecosystem services. Objectives: An innovative hierarchical modelling framework was developed in order to address the influence of nested attributes of LU/LC on community-based ecological indicators. Methods: Founded in the principles of the spatially explicit stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM), the proposed methodological advances are supported by the added value of integrating bottom-up interactions between multi-scaled drivers. Results: The dynamics of biophysical multi-attributes of fine-scale subsystem properties are incorporated to inform dynamic patterns at upper hierarchical levels. Since the most relevant trends associated with LU/LC changes are explicitly modelled within the StDM framework, the ecological indicators’ response can be predicted under different social-economic scenarios and site-specific management actions. A demonstrative application is described to illustrate the framework methodological steps, supporting the theoretic principles previously presented. Conclusions: We outline the proposed multi-model framework as a promising tool to integrate relevant biophysical information to support ecosystem management and decision-making. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Educational Strategies Of First-Year Students Under The Conditions Of Individual Learning Pathways At The University
AB  - The most significant innovations in the field of higher education that need to be comprehended by the scientific community include the transition of a number of Russian universities to personalized learning along individual educational trajectories, which radically changes agents' everyday practices within the educational space. Based on an empirical study conducted at the University of Tyumen in December 2022 (N = 1000), the educational strategies of first-year students in the context of individual educational trajectories have been considered in the article. Regarding studying at a university as a stage of the educational trajectory, which is part of the entire life path of a student, we use the temporal and value properties of the student's life world, their dynamics in the process of moving along an individual educational trajectory within the institutional space of the university as the basis for the typology of educational strategies. Factor analysis included the following components: 1) the meaning of past events (" Factors of the experience of studying at school"); 2) the value of relevant learning practices (" Factors of readiness for studying at a university (competence factors)" and " Factors of the principles importance of training within the individual educational trajectory"); 3) anticipation of the future - plans, goals, possible personal trajectories of life ("Factors of expectations from studying at a university" and " Professional prospects factors"). These groups of factors have been considered as independent empirical indicators and used as classification features for the subsequent differentiation of respondents into clusters. The result of the factor and cluster analysis is the typology of educational strategies of first-year students in the context of the implementation of the new educational model: "conformists", "excellent students", "activists", "nihilists"; each of them has its own educational strategy at the university. Conclusions are drawn about the expediency of building such a typology at the beginning of the student's educational trajectory, as this allows making timely management decisions on the development of educational strategies desirable for the university and the labor market and the correction of tundesirable ones, as well as the possibility of further monitoring measurements.

TI  - Modelling Of Greek Lakes Water Quality Using Earth Observation In The Framework Of The Water Framework Directive (Wfd)
AB  - Given the great importance of lakes in Earth’s environment and human life, continuous water quality (WQ) monitoring within the frame of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the most crucial aspect for lake management. In this study, Earth Observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors have been combined with co-orbital in situ measurements from 50 lakes located in Greece with the main objective of delivering robust WQ assessment models. Correlation analysis among in situ co-orbital WQ data (Chlorophylla, Secchi depths, Total phosphorus-TP-) contributed to distinguishing their inter-relationships and improving the WQ models’ accuracy. Subsequently, stepwise multiple regression analysis (MLR) of the available TP and Secchi depth datasets was implemented to explore the potential to establish optimal quantitative models regardless of lake characteristics. Then, further MLR analysis concerning whether the lakes are natural or artificial was conducted with the basic aim of generating different remote sensing derived models for different types of lakes, while their combination was further utilized to assess their trophic status. Correlation matrix results showed a high and positive relationship between TP and Chlorophyll-a (0.85), whereas high negative relationships were found between Secchi depth with TP (-0.84) and Chlorophyll-a (-0.83). MLRs among Landsat data and Secchi depths resulted in 3 optimal models concerning the assessment of Secchi depth of all lakes (Secchigeneral; R = 0.78; RMSE = 0.24 m), natural (Secchinatural; R = 0.95; RMSE = 0.14 m) and artificial (Secchiartificial; R = 0.62; RMSE = 0.1 m), with reliable accuracy. Study findings showed that TP-related MLR analyses failed to deliver a statistically acceptable model for the reservoirs; nevertheless, they delivered a robust TPgeneral (R = 0.71; RMSE = 1.41 mg/L) and TPnatural model (R = 0.93; RMSE = 1.43 mg/L). Subsequently, trophic status classification was conducted herein, calculating Carlson’s Trophic State Index (TSI) initially throughout all lakes and then oriented toward natural-only and artificial-only lakes. Those three types of TSI (general, natural, artificial) were calculated based on previously published satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) assessment models and the hereby specially designed WQ models (Secchi depth, TP). The higher deviation of satellite-derived TSI values in relation to in situ ones was detected in reservoirs and shallower lakes (mean depth < 5 m), indicating noticeable divergences among natural and artificial lakes. All in all, the study findings provide important support toward the perpetual WQ monitoring and trophic status prediction of Greek lakes and, by extension, their sustainable management, particularly in cases when ground truth data is limited. © 2022 by the authors.

The development of the urban areas affected the increase of socio-economic development and peri-urban demographics but often took over land or green open spaces. It is an unavoidable possibility of air pollution due to the imbalance between oxygen producers and existing oxygen users. It is necessary to calculate the prediction of green open space requirements using the Gerarkis Method, which predicts green open spaces based on oxygen demand by using the number of residents, motor vehicles, livestock, industrial factories, and hotels. With the Gerarkis Method, the prediction of the need for green open space in Surabaya City for 2010–2020 is 22,088.89 hectares to 31,950.84 with the increased majority value in the area, except in 2015 and 2020, due to decreased users. This method proves that the need for oxygen produced from plants is increasing, making Surabaya City needs more green open space to make Surabaya City livable. © 2023, Pusat Penelitian Lingkungan Hidup - Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat Institut Pertanian Bogor (PPLH-LPPM IPB).

TI  - Identification Of Key Patches For Biodiversity Conservation Based On Possibility Of Connectivity Method
AB  - Abstract: The optimization of landscape structure will benefit for biodiversity conservation by analysing the best landscape layout as the habitat patches have been rapidly lost. Based on the possibility of connectivity (PC) method have been proposed for the assessment of biodiversity value that considered both habitat size and spatial connectivity, which regards the index of PC as its primary parameter. Miyun County, Beijing is studied as a case area to evaluate the biodiversity value by both the popular method and the proposed method. It is concluded that the total biodiversity value of each concerned land use types based on 2010 data are: grazing land 3.69×106 Yuan•ha-1•year-1, forest land 132.39×106 Yuan•ha-1•year-1, cropland 5.65×106 Yuan•ha-1•year-1, water area 18.94×106 Yuan•ha-1•year-1, built-up land 0, and unused land 0.11×106 Yuan•ha-1•year-1. Secondly, for the identification of key patches, there are three kinds of key patches: (1) the patches with larger habitat size; (2) the satellite patches around the large patches as the undertaken area for biological migration; (3) the stepping stone patches. It is found that biodiversity value is not evenly distributed with patch area because of the difference of connectivity. Larger patches and the patches locate in the connecting position are important for maintaining connectivity. The results of this paper will provide technology and data references for environmental protection in the near future. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Red-Edge Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi705) From Sentinel-2 Imagery To Assess Post-Fire Regeneration
AB  - Obtaining post-fire information from a burnt region is of paramount importance in applications such as examining the disturbance of natural ecosystems and in providing crucial information to local authorities that have control on policymaking. This study uses freely available data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite to create a Red-Edge Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI705) and combines the resulting layer with 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to assess topographical parameters (ie. slope steepness and aspect) which may have influenced the revegetation process. Additionally, weather data is combined with the aforementioned datasets to study the revegetation dynamics. A fire event which occurred in June 2016 in Evrychou, Cyprus, was chosen, as it was one of the largest fire events in the island and happened when the Sentinel-2 was already operational, hence a period of time spanning 14 months has been studied. The results have indicated an inconsistent NDVI705 change throughout the period. However, a significant improvement in NDVI705 values was observed in the months of spring 2017. The improvement in vegetation health was mostly observed on north-facing and less-steep slopes, something which corresponds with previous studies in northern-hemisphere Mediterranean climates. The results have also highlighted the ability to conduct a rapid and cost-effective post-fire assessment which can be scaled up or down depending on the fire size and which can be applied to any other environment where post-fire management is required.

TI  - Catchment-Based Water Monitoring Using A Hierarchy Of Sensor Types
AB  - The design of optimal monitoring networks at catchment level is both a challenge and an opportunity in the smart city era. New knowledge, information and services can be built by integrating diverse multimodal data streams, at scales appropriate to inform effective decision making. To this end a comprehensive, integrated hierarchical platform is ultimately required for fusing, gathering and analysing large volumes of data. Such workflows could include hydrological and geospatial data, land-use and activity data, remote data from aerial and space-borne platforms and in-situ data from both fixed and mobile platforms. In this context, this chapter aims to provide insight into how the future catchment monitoring platforms might look like and to synthesize and review recent technological progress. Emphasis is placed on the realisation of fit-for-purpose cost effective catchment monitoring programmes with immediate opportunity for implementation and state-of-the art emerging technologies are discussed in this context. In the first part, commercially available in-situ sensor technologies are reviewed to provide a starting point for users in the critical sensor selection process. A classification is provided based on operation principle while drawbacks and benefits are presented. Practical considerations, relating to monitoring requirements, deployment strategy, and cost are discussed to aid practitioners in the design of water quality monitoring networks. In the second part, aerial and satellite remote sensing platform are reviewed and constrains and technological limitations are presented. Examples of successful use of combined monitoring approaches are discussed with an emphasis on early warning and forecasting of pollution events. Technological gaps that should be filled to achieve an ideal catchment observation system are identified. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Agroecology And Radical Grassroots Movements' Evolving Moral Economies
AB  - I focus on the role of agroecology in rural proletarian social movements in this article. First, I highlight these movements' conception of agroecology as an important element of their political ideology. Second, I explore the value of agroecology in helping maintain the permanence of the peasantry. Third, I show that rural proletarian movements emphasize agroecology because it is key to attaining sovereignty I draw upon the geographic lenses of territory, the production of space, and autonomous geographies in positing these arguments. Throughout the article, I draw upon a case study of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement, one of the most vocal agroecological social movements, to illustrate these arguments.

TI  - Soil Erosion Risk In Korean Watersheds, Assessed Using The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation
AB  - Soil erosion reduces crop productivity and water storage capacity, and, both directly and indirectly, causes water pollution. Loss of soil has become a problem worldwide, and as concerns about the environment grow, active research has begun regarding soil erosion and soil-preservation policies. This study analyzed the amount of soil loss in South Korea over a recent 20-year period and estimated future soil loss in 2020 using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). Digital elevation (DEM) data, detailed soil maps, and land cover maps were used as primary data, and geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques were applied to produce thematic maps, based on RUSLE factors. Using the frequency ratio (FR), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and logistic regression (LR) approaches, land suitability index (LSI) maps were developed for 2020, considering the already established Environmental Conservation Value Assessment Map (ECVAM) for Korea. Assuming a similar urban growth trend and 10-, 50-, and 100-year rainfall frequencies, soil loss in 2020 was predicted by analyzing changes in the cover-management factor and rainfall-runoff erosivity factor. In the period 1985-2005, soil loss showed an increasing trend, from 17.1 Mg/ha in 1985 to 17.4 Mg/ha in 1995, and to 20.0 Mg/ha in 2005; the 2005 value represents a 2.8 Mg/ha (16.6\%) increase, compared with 1985 and is attributable to the increased area of grassland and bare land. In 2020, the estimated soil loss, considering the ECVAM, was 19.2-19.3 Mg/ha for the 10-year rainfall frequency, 36.4-36.6 Mg/ha for the 50-year rainfall frequency, and 45.7-46.0 Mg/ha for the 100-year rainfall frequency. Without considering the ECVAM, the amount of soil loss was about 0.4-1.6 Mg/ha larger than estimates that did consider the ECVAM; specifically, the values were 19.6-19.9 Mg/ha for the 10-year rainfall frequency, 37.1-37.8 Mg/ha for the 50-year frequency, and 46.7-47.5 Mg/ha for the 100-year frequency. In 2010, without considering the ECVAM, the soil loss was 0.3-1.8 Mg/ha more than that estimated when considering the ECVAM. These results indicate that if urban areas are developed such that they damage areas of high value, as defined environmentally and legislatively, the amount of soil loss will increase, whereas if such areas are preserved, erosion will decrease slightly. Thus, when planning urban development, the environmental and legislative value of preservation should be considered to minimize erosion and allow for more sustainable development.

TI  - Fruit Availability And Human Disturbance Influence Forest Elephant Group Size
AB  - Social living provides benefits to group members, but these benefits come at a cost. In fissionefusion societies, individuals or small groups leave and join different groups as ecological constraints on group size fluctuate. Little research has been conducted on how human disturbance influences fission efusion groups after accounting for ecological conditions. As a large, wide-ranging species with large resource needs facing increasing human disturbance (e.g. poaching and habitat loss), African forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis, provide unique insight into how environmental, social and anthropogenic factors influence group size. We reconstructed forest elephant social groups using noninvasive genetic samples extracted from elephant dung collected while tracking GPS-collared forest elephants. Through a novel application of hierarchical markerecapture models, we estimated group size and the anthropogenic, demographic and environmental factors associated with fluctuations in group size. We found that high fruit availability was associated with a decrease in group size and that human disturbance (measured as an index of the global human footprint) was associated with an increase in group size, but to a lesser degree. Understanding social group dynamics is important for ensuring effective population management of forest elephants, both for tracking when large groups might be at risk from poaching and preventing the negative health associations of suboptimal group sizes such as increased stress and decreased reproduction. Additionally, our integration of genotyping, satellite remote sensing and statistical methods can inform the study of forest elephants and other cryptic species into the future.

TI  - Satellite Et-Based Irrigation Performance: Strategies To Increase Rainfed Crops Production In The Lower Baro Watershed, Ethiopia
AB  - Satellite-based irrigation performance is a valuable tool for improving yields in irrigated areas across the world and requires adequate land for long-term development. This study aimed to increase irrigation performance and yield gap variation of rainfed crops using the database of FAO’s Water Productivity Open Access Portal (WaPOR) and the Global Yield Gap Atlas. The evapotranspiration (ET) performance of irrigation is expressed in equity (CV of ET), reliability, adequacy (CV of ET), and water productivity (kg∙m–3). The rainfed crops are interpreted in terms of metric tonnes/ha. Specifically, 20,325 km2 of suitable pastoral land across eight sub-classes was converted to rainfed rice, sugarcane, maize, and vegetable crops. Results showed that the R2 value was 0.97 at Baro Itang and –0.99 at Sor Metu, with the Baro Gambella sub-catchment having the largest yield gap of 4.435.2, 8.870.4, and 10.080∙106 kg when the yield increased by 1/3, 2/3, and 3/4. On the other hand, Gumero Gore had the smallest yield gap of 10,690, 29,700, and 33,750 kg, respectively. The management regime was 2.87, 0.87, and 0.35 kg∙m–3 for growers in the estate, farmer association, and individual, respectively. The study concludes that no single irrigation technique can be considered the best, and a thorough analysis of spatiotemporal variation of the irrigation performance indicators and the yield gap in the water-scarce lower Baro watershed is required. © 2023.

TI  - Risk Of Acute Respiratory Infection From Crop Burning In India: Estimating Disease Burden And Economic Welfare From Satellite And National Health Survey Data For 250 000 Persons
AB  - Background: Respiratory infections are among the leading causes of death and disability globally. Respirable aerosol particles released by agricultural crop-residue burning (ACRB), practised by farmers in all global regions, are potentially harmful to human health. Our objective was to estimate the health and economic costs of ACRB in northern India. Methods: The primary outcome was acute respiratory infection (ARI) from India's fourth District Level Health Survey (DLHS-4). DLHS-4 data were merged with Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data on fire occurrence. Mutually adjusted generalized linear models were used to generate risk ratios for risk factors of ARI. Overall disease burden due to ACRB was estimated in terms of disability-adjusted life years. Results: Seeking medical treatment for ARI in the previous 2 weeks was reported by 5050 (2%) of 252 539 persons. Living in a district with intense ACRB - the top quintile of fires per day - was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of ARI (mutually adjusted risk ratio 2.99, 95% confidence interval 2.77 to 3.23) after adjustment for socio-demographic and household factors. Children under 5 years of age were particularly susceptible (3.65, 3.06 to 4.34 in this subgroup). Additional ARI risk factors included motor-vehicle congestion (1.96, 1.72 to 2.23), open drainage (1.91, 1.73 to 2.11), cooking with biomass (1.73, 1.58 to 1.90) and living in urban areas (1.35, 1.26 to 1.44). Eliminating ACRB would avert 14.9 million disability-adjusted life years lost per year, valued at US$152.9 billion over 5 years. Conclusions: Investments to stop crop burning and offer farmers alternative crop-residue disposal solutions are likely to improve population-level respiratory health and yield major economic returns. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Soil Moisture From Fusion Of Scatterometer And Sar: Closing The Scale Gap With Temporal Filtering
AB  - Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to e.g., farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. We fuse surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates from spatio-temporally complementary radar sensors through temporal filtering of their joint signal and obtain a kilometre-scale, daily soil water content product named SCATSAR-SWI. With 25 km Metop ASCAT SSM and 1 km Sentinel-1 SSM serving as input, the SCATSAR-SWI is globally applicable and achieves daily full coverage over operated areas. We employ a near-real-time-capable SCATSAR-SWI algorithm on a fused 3 year ASCAT-Sentinel-1-SSM data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of a therefrom generated SCATSAR-SWI dataset, involving a 1 km Soil Water Balance Model (SWBM) over Umbria, yields comprehensively high agreement with the reference data (median R = 0.61 vs. in situ; 0.71 vs. model; 0.83 vs. ASCAT SSM). While the Sentinel-1 signal is attenuated to some extent, the ASCAT's signal dynamics are fully transferred to the SCATSAR-SWI and benefit from the Sentinel-1 parametrisation. Using the SM2RAIN approach, the SCATSAR-SWI shows excellent capability to reproduce 5 day-accumulated rainfall over Italy, with R = 0.89 against observed rainfall. The SCATSAR-SWI is currently in preparation towards operational product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS).

TI  - Torrents Risk In Aswan Governorate, Egypt
AB  - Identification of areas vulnerable to torrent hazard is the basis of decision-making to take necessary management plan and mitigate the risk the effects of flood risk to reduce losses as possible. Historical records indicate that Aswan Governorate was and continues to be exposed to the geomorphological torrents hazards. The present study aims to identify stream networks and the drainage patterns in Aswan Governorate by the integration between remote sensing and GIS data for determining the directions of running water and the probable sites for storing it. Slope was extracted from Digital Elevation Model (DEM-30 m) data and stream network is established by hydrological model. The results investigated that the lowest elevation is more risky than the highest, where Eastern Nile basins in the area between Edfu and Aswan cities are very risky, particularly in the area of Kom Ombo and East of Aswan city. Results also show that the streams that flow into Lake Nasser represent the minimum risk of torrents as there are no urban communities. This study provides basic information for preliminary results of risk torrent assessments and hazard mapping. The results recommended that avoiding the risks of torrents and benefit from them. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Coherent Satellite Monitoring Of The Water Cycle Over The Amazon. Part 1: Methodology And Initial Evaluation
AB  - Monitoring coherently the Amazon Water Cycle (WC) using satellite observations is crucial for climate and water resources studies. The SAtellite Water Cycle (SAWC) integration methodology is introduced to optimize the satellite datasets. In this paper, the WC budget is balanced simultaneously over 10 sub-basins by constraining the horizontal water exchanges between them. Compared to an actual assimilation analysis, SAWC benefits from the use of water storage observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. SAWC corrects the satellite evapotranspiration datasets that tend to under-estimate the water-limited evaporation over the central Amazon and to over-estimate the energy-limited evaporation over the northern Amazon. The SAWC precipitation estimates are evaluated against gauge measurements and show good overall results with a correlation varying from 0.94 to 0.99 and root-mean-square deviation between 16 and 41 mm/month (similar or equal to 10\% of precipitation estimate).

TI  - Synoptic Assessment Of Water Resource Variability In Reservoirs By Remote Sensing: General Approach And Application To The Runoff Harvesting Systems Of South India
AB  - This paper presents a methodological procedure based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques designed to map and quantify water stocks in small irrigation reservoirs over vast, user-defined regions. Because the method is based on unsupervised pixel classification schemes, it is analytically transparent and entirely replicable and can therefore be used in most settings as a tool for integrated water resource management, planning, or policy making, with benefits to irrigation, land use, agriculture, and water-related social issues. Satellite images of semiarid south India are used here to quantify fluctuating water volumes in similar to 2500 reservoirs. In this pilot study, the detection of temporal trends and spatial discontinuities in land use at successive dates within reservoir beds is a proxy for assessing the performance of reservoirs and for formulating hypotheses on the environmental, socioeconomic, or anthropological reasons behind the inferred levels of infrastructural maintenance or disuse. The synoptic approach paves the way for future efforts as better ground truth data become available.

TI  - Methane Emissions From A Californian Landfill, Determined From Airborne Remote Sensing And In Situ Measurements
AB  - Fugitive emissions from waste disposal sites are important anthropogenic sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). As a result of the growing world population and the recognition of the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, this anthropogenic source of CH4 has received much recent attention. However, the accurate assessment of the CH4 emissions from landfills by modeling and existing measurement techniques is challenging. This is because of inaccurate knowledge of the model parameters and the extent of and limited accessibility to landfill sites. This results in a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the emissions of CH4 from landfills and waste management. In this study, we present results derived from data collected during the research campaign COMEX (CO2 and MEthane eXperiment) in late summer 2014 in the Los Angeles (LA) Basin. One objective of COMEX, which comprised aircraft observations of methane by the remote sensing Methane Airborne MAPper (MAMAP) instrument and a Picarro greenhouse gas in situ analyzer, was the quantitative investigation of CH4 emissions. Enhanced CH4 concentrations or "CH4 plumes" were detected downwind of landfills by remote sensing aircraft surveys. Subsequent to each remote sensing survey, the detected plume was sampled within the atmospheric boundary layer by in situ measurements of atmospheric parameters such as wind information and dry gas mixing ratios of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the same aircraft. This was undertaken to facilitate the independent estimation of the surface fluxes for the validation of the remote sensing estimates. During the COMEX campaign, four landfills in the LA Basin were surveyed. One landfill repeatedly showed a clear emission plume. This landfill, the Olinda Alpha Landfill, was investigated on 4 days during the last week of August and first days of September 2014. Emissions were estimated for all days using a mass balance approach. The derived emissions vary between 11.6 and 17.8 ktCH(4) yr 1 with related uncertainties in the range of 14 to 45 \%. The comparison of the remote sensing and in situ based CH4 emission rate estimates reveals good agreement within the error bars with an average of the absolute differences of around 2.4 ktCH(4) yr 1 (+/- 2.8 kt CH4 yr(-1)). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported inventory value is 11.5 ktCH(4) yr(-1) for 2014, on average 2.8 ktCH(4) yr(-1) (+/- 1.6 ktCH(4) yr(-1)) lower than our estimates acquired in the afternoon in late summer 2014. This difference may in part be explained by a possible leak located on the southwestern slope of the landfill, which we identified in the observations of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) instrument, flown contemporaneously aboard a second aircraft on 1 day.

TI  - Trusted Autonomous Operations Of Distributed Satellite Systems Using Optical Sensors
AB  - Recent developments in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS) have undoubtedly increased mission value due to the ability to reconfigure the spacecraft cluster/formation and incrementally add new or update older satellites in the formation. These features provide inherent benefits, such as increased mission effectiveness, multi-mission capabilities, design flexibility, and so on. Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operation (TASO) are possible owing to the predictive and reactive integrity features offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), including both on-board satellites and in the ground control segments. To effectively monitor and manage time-critical events such as disaster relief missions, the DSS must be able to reconfigure autonomously. To achieve TASO, the DSS should have reconfiguration capability within the architecture and spacecraft should communicate with each other through an Inter-Satellite Link (ISL). Recent advances in AI, sensing, and computing technologies have resulted in the development of new promising concepts for the safe and efficient operation of the DSS. The combination of these technologies enables trusted autonomy in intelligent DSS (iDSS) operations, allowing for a more responsive and resilient approach to Space Mission Management (SMM) in terms of data collection and processing, especially when using state-of-the-art optical sensors. This research looks into the potential applications of iDSS by proposing a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for near-real-time wildfire management. For spacecraft to continuously monitor Areas of Interest (AOI) in a dynamically changing environment, satellite missions must have extensive coverage, revisit intervals, and reconfiguration capability that iDSS can offer. Our recent work demonstrated the feasibility of AI-based data processing using state-of-the-art on-board astrionics hardware accelerators. Based on these initial results, AI-based software has been successively developed for wildfire detection on-board iDSS satellites. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed iDSS architecture, simulation case studies are performed considering different geographic locations.

TI  - Planted Seedling Survival In A Post-Wildfire Landscape: From Experimental Planting To Predictive Probabilistic Surfaces
AB  - Across the southwestern United States, high-severity wildfire is causing increasingly large areas of tree mortality and removing the seed sources required for the natural regeneration of these formerly conifer-dominated landscapes. Planting tree seedlings can accelerate reforestation, but in the semi-arid southwestern US, the sur-vival of planted conifer seedlings is typically low. Our research examined how post-fire planting success is influenced by climate, topographic, biotic, and microclimate factors. We present data on a seedling planting experiment within the footprint of the 2011 Las Conchas Fire in northern New Mexico. We planted 768 tree seedlings of four species: ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), pin similar to on (P. edulis), southwestern white pine (P. strobiformis), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in an area burned at high-severity and densely populated by New Mexico locust (Robinia neomexicana) and other shrub species. We established experimental plots strat-ified by aspect, either northerly or southerly, and cover, either planted under New Mexico locust or in the open, and collected topographical and microclimate measurements over three years. Mean survival over the 3-year period for all species in all treatments was 20\%. Using microclimate variables and site-level topographical indices in a piecewise exponential model, we first determined how these factors influenced seedling survival of four conifer tree species, finding that topographical indices describing incoming solar radiation, variables related to vapor pressure deficit, i.e., seasonal maximums, and presence of New Mexico locust increased hazard for all species while variables related to shade, moisture availability, and slope reduced hazard. Following our planting experiment, an additional 1145 ponderosa pine seedlings, planted by USFS, were surveyed for survival and the topographical indices at their locations were recorded. Adding these seedlings' survival data to our experi-mentally planted ponderosa pine seedlings, we used boosted regression tree models to determine survival probability for ponderosa pine as a product of topographical indices, then extrapolated these findings to the wider landscape, producing a spatial projection of probabilistic seedling survival as a function of readily available topographical data, with a mean AUC value of 0.63. Both sets of analyses highlight the importance of landscape heterogeneity in shaping microclimatic environments and affecting seedling survival in a predictable manner, with areas receiving less solar radiation and more moisture promoting seedling survival. Our results demonstrate that by using fine-scale microtopography that shapes microclimatic environments, future plantings can increase conifer tree seedling survival in high-severity post-wildfire landscapes.

TI  - Privacy-Preserving Telecardiology Sensor Networks: Toward A Low-Cost Portable Wireless Hardware/Software Codesign
AB  - Recently, a remote-sensing platform based on wireless interconnection of tiny ECG sensors called Telecardiology Sensor Networks (TSN) provided a promising approach to perform low-cost real-time cardiac patient monitoring at any time in community areas (such as elder nursing homes or hospitals). The contribution of this research is the design of a practical TSN hardware/software platform for a typical U.S. healthcare community scenario (such as large nursing homes with many elder patients) to perform real-time healthcare data collections. On the other hand, due to the radio broadcasting nature of MANET, a TSN has the risk of losing the privacy of patients' data. Medical privacy has been highly emphasized by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This research also designs a medical security scheme with low communication overhead to achieve confidential electrocardiogram data transmission in wireless medium. © 2007 IEEE.

TI  - Value Generation Through Public Procurement Of Innovative Earth Observation Applications: Service-Dominant Logic Perspective
AB  - This article investigates how the implementation of a national space strategy in partnership with supranational organizations affects the development of service ecosystems of Earth Observation (EO) applications. The subject is studied through the lens of a service-dominant logic perspective, a meta-theory that seeks to explain how economic value is cocreated in business-to-business markets. Qualitative empirical research was conducted in three emerging space countries-Slovakia, Latvia, and Estonia-to understand how value-creating resource integration processes involving space downstream companies and their potential end-users are affected by adding the European Space Agency (ESA) to the ecosystem. The study's findings showed that the catalytic procurement of prototypes of new EO applications through ESA is connected to multilevel institutional changes in relevant service ecosystems. ESA's involvement facilitates more intensive interaction between EO companies and their targeted customers in dyadic relationships. Value cocreation processes are influenced by micro-, meso-, and macrolevel institutions. The study highlights the linkages between ESA's involvement and the purposeful entrepreneurial efforts of EO companies to change prevailing institutional arrangements. This institutional work is aimed at reconfiguring institutional arrangement at the mesolevel to make it more supportive to value-creating resource integration activities between actors in a service ecosystem.</p>

TI  - The Covid-19 And Influenza “Twindemic”: Barriers To Influenza Vaccination And Potential Acceptance Of Sars-Cov2 Vaccination In African Americans
AB  - Influenza is a contagious respiratory virus that causes a significant annual health burden in the United States (US). In spite of effective yearly vaccinations to protect individuals against influenza-related health complications, especially with certain chronic co-morbid illnesses, persistent racial/ethnic disparities exist in influenza immunization. African Americans continue to experience low vaccination uptake, stemming, at least in part, from years of bias in and mistrust of orthodox medicine, safety concerns, and environmental barriers to vaccine access. The novel respiratory coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, causes COVID-19, leading to a pandemic that in the U.S. has exerted severe physical, psychological, and economic tolls on the African Americans and other disadvantaged communities. These two respiratory-borne virus’ cause disparate effects in the black community, unmasking persistent disparities in healthcare. Unfortunately, suboptimal influenza immunization acceptance exacerbates flu-related adverse health outcomes, similar to difficulties from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In consideration of the impending influenza-COVID-19 “twindemic”, robust educational campaigns, policy initiatives, and novel approaches to influenza immunization must be considered for the African American community to build trust in the health benefits of the influenza vaccination and, ultimately, to trust in the health benefits of potential SARS-CoV2 vaccines, when available for the general public. © 2020 National Medical Association

TI  - Toward An Integrated Monitoring Framework To Assess The Effects Of Tropical Forest Degradation And Recovery On Carbon Stocks And Biodiversity
AB  - Tropical forests harbor a significant portion of global biodiversity and are a critical component of the climate system. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation contributes to global climate-change mitigation efforts, yet emissions and removals from forest dynamics are still poorly quantified. We reviewed the main challenges to estimate changes in carbon stocks and biodiversity due to degradation and recovery of tropical forests, focusing on three main areas: (1) the combination of field surveys and remote sensing; (2) evaluation of biodiversity and carbon values under a unified strategy; and (3) research efforts needed to understand and quantify forest degradation and recovery. The improvement of models and estimates of changes of forest carbon can foster process-oriented monitoring of forest dynamics, including different variables and using spatially explicit algorithms that account for regional and local differences, such as variation in climate, soil, nutrient content, topography, biodiversity, disturbance history, recovery pathways, and socioeconomic factors. Generating the data for these models requires affordable large-scale remote-sensing tools associated with a robust network of field plots that can generate spatially explicit information on a range of variables through time. By combining ecosystem models, multiscale remote sensing, and networks of field plots, we will be able to evaluate forest degradation and recovery and their interactions with biodiversity and carbon cycling. Improving monitoring strategies will allow a better understanding of the role of forest dynamics in climate-change mitigation, adaptation, and carbon cycle feedbacks, thereby reducing uncertainties in models of the key processes in the carbon cycle, including their impacts on biodiversity, which are fundamental to support forest governance policies, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.

TI  - Factors Influencing The Pattern Of Fire Severities In A Large Wildfire Under Extreme Meteorological Conditions In The Mediterranean Basin
AB  - In Mediterranean ecosystems, large fires frequently burn under extreme meteorological conditions, but they are usually characterized by a spatial heterogeneity of burn severities. The way in which such mixed-severity fires are a result of fuels, topography and weather remains poorly understood. We computed fire severity of a large wildfire that occurred in Catalonia, Spain, as the difference between the post- and pre-fire Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values obtained through Landsat images. Fuel and topographic variables were derived from remote sensing, and fire behavior variables were obtained from an exhaustive reconstruction of the fire. Results showed that fire severity had a negative relationship with percentage of canopy cover, i.e. green surviving plots were mainly those with more forested conditions. Of the topographic variables, only aspect had a significant effect on fire severity, with higher values in southern than in northern slopes. Fire severity was higher in head than in flank and back fires. The interaction of these two variables was significant, with differences between southern and northern aspects being small for head fires, but increasing in flank and back fires. The role of these variables in determining the pattern of fire severities is of primary importance for interpreting the current landscapes and for establishing effective fire prevention and extinction policies. © IAWF 2009.

TI  - Chikungunya Resurgence In The Maldives And Risk For Importation Via Tourists To Europe In 2019–2020: A Geosentinel Case Series
AB  - Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus mainly transmitted in tropical areas by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. It has been responsible for small-to-large outbreaks in temperate areas including southern Europe and North America. Past outbreaks in 2006 on the islands of Maldives, as well as on other islands in the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia, demonstrated for the first time the capacity of CHIKV to disseminate through travel and transcontinental commerce, and revealed the major socio-economic impact of CHIKV epidemics. Recently, CHIKV has been circulating in highly touristic areas including the Maldives, where 1736 cases were notified by the Health Protection Agency during 2019. Case series: Among EuroTravNet/GeoSentinel patient records, eight CHIKV-confirmed cases imported the Maldives to France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and Spain were identified between February 2019 and February 2020; exceeding the total number of CHIKV infections travel-acquired in Maldives reported to this surveillance network during the previous 10 years. Conclusions: The prevention and control of CHIKV introduction into naïve areas colonised by competent vectors is crucial. CHIKV outbreaks must be detected and reported in a timely manner. This must lead to adapted health information for international travellers and to prompt management of suspected imported cases. Conversely, travellers make for excellent sentinels and increased reports of imported cases might reflect a change in the level of endemicity or even herald an outbreak. Feedback to the local health authorities and matching this with local epidemiological surveillance data may lead to health benefits for the local population. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - How Community Forest Management Performs When Redd+ Payments Fail
AB  - The reduced emissions in deforestation and degradation (REDD+) initiative uses payments for ecosystem services as incentives for developing countries to manage and protect their forests. REDD+ initiatives also prioritize social (and environmental) co-benefits aimed at improving the livelihoods of communities that are dependent on forests. Despite the incorporation of co-benefits into REDD+ goals, carbon sequestration remains the primary metric for which countries can receive payments from REDD+, but after more than 10 years of REDD+, many site-specific programs have failed to complete the carbon verification process. Here, we examine whether the REDD+ social co-benefits alone are sufficient to have slowed deforestation in the absence of carbon payments on Pemba, Tanzania. Using satellite imagery (Landsat archive), we quantified forest cover change for the period before (2001-2010) and after (2010-2018) the launch in 2010-2011 of Pemba island's REDD+ readiness project. We then compared rates of forest cover change between shehia (administrative units) that were part of REDD+ readiness intervention and those that were not, adjusting for confounding variables and the non-random selection of REDD+ shehia with a statistical matching procedure. Despite considerable variation in forest outcomes among shehia, the associated co-benefits with the Pemba REDD+ project had no discernible effect on forest cover change. Likewise, we did not detect an effect of socioecological covariates on forest cover change across all shehia, though island-wide human population growth since 2012 may have played a role. These findings are unsurprising given the failure to secure carbon payments on Pemba and indicate that co-benefits alone are insufficient to reduce deforestation. We conclude that better oversight of all-involved parties is needed to ensure that REDD+ interventions satisfactorily conclude the process of securing a mechanism for carbon payments, if slowing deforestation is to be achieved. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessment Of Grassland Use Intensity By Remote Sensing To Support Conservation Schemes
AB  - Grassland is a land cover in the area of conflict between agriculture and conservation, where intensification of land use is a major threat to grassland biodiversity. Grassland use intensity is a key factor for the conservation value of grassland, and detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed to improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A new remote sensing-based approach using multi-temporal high resolution RapidEye satellite data was developed in the present study that makes a large-scale assessment of grassland use intensity possible. RapidEye is a constellation of five satellites with 6.5 m spatial resolution, which allows frequent and timely image acquisition targeted at specific growing seasons. Semi-natural grassland, extensively used grassland, intensively used grassland and tilled grassland could be reliably differentiated at the management plot level in a study area in southern Germany. Various combinations of images from different observation dates have been tested as classification input and their overall classification accuracies were validated by field data. Best results were achieved using a combination of five multi-temporal scenes with an overall accuracy of 85.7\%. A three-scene combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 82.2\%. The analysis showed that seasonal aspects are very important when selecting adequate observation dates. Grassland use intensity was also assessed on peatlands using a peat soil map, since land use intensity significantly affects greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. The results demonstrate the potential of targeted multi-spectral, high spatial resolution remote sensing for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic habitats, which is of vital importance to support various environmental conservation schemes through improved monitoring and reporting capabilities.

TI  - Environmental Pollution And Biodiversity: Light Pollution And Sea Turtles In The Caribbean
AB  - We examine the impact of pollution on biodiversity by studying the effect of coastal light pollution on the sea turtle population in the Caribbean. To this end we assemble a panel data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite-derived measures of nighttime light. Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to $288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately $2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - On The Accuracy Of Official Chinese Crop Production Data: Evidence From Biophysical Indexes Of Net
AB  - With rapid economic growth and urbanization, self-sufficiency in crop production has become central to China's agriculture policy. Accurate crop production statistics are essential for research, monitoring, and planning. Although researchers agree that China's statistical authority has considerably modernized over time, China's economic statistics have still been viewed as unreliable and often overstated to meet growth targets at different administrative levels. Recent increases in crop production reported by national statistics have also come under increasing scrutiny. This paper investigates crop production data quality from a planetary boundary perspective-comparing net primary production (NPP) harvested obtained from national statistics with satellite-driven NPP estimates that are supported by detailed observation of land cover, combined with observations on physical factors that limit plant growth. This approach provides a powerful means to check the plausibility of China's grain production statistics at different administrative levels that can generate insights about their discrepancies and can contribute to improved crop production measurements. We find some evidence of potential misreporting problems from the lower administration level where the risk of manipulation of statistics is higher. We also find problems from provincial-level major grain producers. These values can also affect the national totals. Although the numbers are affected by large uncertainties, we find that improving the spatial resolution of key agricultural parameters can greatly improve the reliability of the indicator that in turn can help improve data quality. More reliable production data will be vital for relevant research and provide better insights into food security problems, the carbon cycle, and sustainable development.

TI  - Temporal And Spatial Variations Of Net Primary Productivity And Its Response To Groundwater Of A Typical Oasis In The Tarim Basin, China
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) of the vegetation in an oasis can reflect the productivity capacity of a plant community under natural environmental conditions. Owing to the extreme arid climate conditions and scarce precipitation in the arid oasis regions, groundwater plays a key role in restricting the development of the vegetation. The Qira Oasis is located on the southern margin of the Taklimakan Desert (Tarim Basin, China) that is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding vegetation growth and water scarcity in the world. Based on remote sensing images of the Qira Oasis and daily meteorological data measured by the ground stations during the period 2006-2019, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of NPP in the oasis as well as its relation with the variation of groundwater depth using a modified Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model. At the spatial scale, NPP of the vegetation decreased from the interior of the Qira Oasis to the margin; at the temporal scale, NPP of the vegetation in the oasis fluctuated significantly (ranging from 29.80 to 50.07 g C/(m(2)center dot month)) but generally showed an increasing trend, with the average increase rate of 0.07 g C/(m(2)center dot month). The regions with decreasing NPP occupied 64\% of the total area of the oasis. During the study period, NPP of both farmland and grassland showed an increasing trend, while that of forest showed a decreasing trend. The depth of groundwater was deep in the south of the oasis and shallow in the north, showing a gradual increasing trend from south to north. Groundwater, as one of the key factors in the surface change and evolution of the arid oasis, determines the succession direction of the vegetation in the Qira Oasis. With the increase of groundwater depth, grassland coverage and vegetation NPP decreased. During the period 2008-2015, with the recovery of groundwater level, NPP values of all types of vegetation with different coverages increased. This study will provide a scientific basis for the rational utilization and sustainable management of groundwater resources in the oasis.

TI  - Distributed Models 7: A Cis Approach
AB  - A rainfall and run‐off model has been developed which is based on a rectangular grid cell network. the run‐off in each cell is estimated empirically and is routed through the network to the principal drainage lines. Information on the land cover in each 50 × 50 m cell is interpreted from remotely sensed data, gathered by an orbiting satellite. Values of topographic parameters for each cell are derived from a digital model of the terrain. Other more conventional data are acquired by digitizing maps. the large amounts of data required in this approach are handled by a geographical information system (GIS), which is a management system specially designed for data with spatial characteristics. a GIS has functions which allow the user to combine the many layers of data within the GIS arithmetically or logically to provide fresh information. At the current stage of development the GIS provides estimates of the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service curve number for estimating the run‐off in each cell. an analysis of the digital terrain model defines the pathway taken by run‐off from each cell and the run‐off is routed from cell to cell as far as the principal drainage lines, where a conventional hydraulic analysis is used. the model benefits from a simple and robust approach to run‐off estimation distributed on a very fine grid. an important feature of the model is its ability to use historical satellite images to estimate changes in the catchment's response over a period of time. Future changes in land use May, also be easily incorporated into the GIS. the model is being tested on data from the Tywi catchment in West Wales, UK, which had undergone large changes in land cover due to forestation.

TI  - Culture, Religion And Economy In The American Southwest: Zuni Pueblo And Laguna Pueblo
AB  - Despite glittering casinos, supermarkets, pick-up trucks, trailer homes, satellite dishes, and all the other influences of the dominant Euro-American mainstream society which can be seen everywhere in the American Indian Pueblos of the Southwest, everyday life continues to be strongly characterized by specific Pueblo values, standards of behavior and ideals which are not necessarily in line with those of their Euro-American environment-and sometimes stand in sharp contrast to them. The juxtaposition of poverty and success raises many questions about the relationship between culture, place and economy, and the prospects for sustainable futures in American Indian communities of the Southwest. This paper considers the ways in which social and cultural values in Zuni and Laguna Pueblos influence economic behavior of individuals and community institutions and the implications for governance and development in the region.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Assessment In The Blue Nile River Catchment, Ethiopia, Using Geospatial And Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Techniques
AB  - Groundwater supplies have been exploited because of global water shortage. Therefore, effective management of water resources is crucial. Identifying potential groundwater regions in arid and mountainous terrains is challenging for many developing nations because of a lack of financial and human resources. An integrated strategy using remote sensing, geographic information systems, and multi-criteria decision analysis of the hierarchical analytical process was used to identify potential zones for groundwater in the Gulufa Watershed, Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia, which covers 1700 km2. Nine groundwater-influencing thematic layers were produced from conventional and satellite data, including lineament density, lithology, slope, geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, drainage density, rainfall, and elevation. Satty scale values for the thematic layers and their classes were determined based on experts' opinions and literature. Thematic maps were integrated based on their weights and rates to produce a potential zone map using ArcGIS weighted overlay spatial function tool. According to the results, the prospect zone map consists of 383 km2 of very high, 865 km2 of high, 350 km2 of moderate, 58 km2 of low, and 0.3 km2 of poor zones. Validation of the potential zone map using existing boreholes yielded a close agreement, demonstrating the method's accuracy. According to the map removal sensitivity analysis results, the potential zone was more sensitive to lithology than other thematic layers. The map created in the research region can be an essential reference for identifying potential locations for additional groundwater resource exploration, planning, and management.

TI  - Radar And Optical Remote Sensing For Near Real-Time Assessments Of Cyclone Impacts On Coastal Ecosystems
AB  - Rapid impact assessment of cyclones on coastal ecosystems is critical for timely rescue and rehabilitation operations in highly human-dominated landscapes. Such assessments should also include damage assessments of vegetation for restoration planning in impacted natural landscapes. Our objective is to develop a remote sensing-based approach combining satellite data derived from optical (Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1), and LiDAR (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) platforms for rapid assessment of post-cyclone inundation in non-forested areas and vegetation damage in a primarily forested ecosystem. We apply this multi-scalar approach for assessing damages caused by the cyclone Amphan that hit coastal India and Bangladesh in May 2020, severely flooding several districts in the two countries, and causing destruction to the Sundarban mangrove forests. Our analysis shows that at least 6821 sq. km. land across the 39 study districts was inundated even after 10 days after the cyclone. We further calculated the change in forest greenness as the difference in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pre- and post-cyclone. Our findings indicate a <0.2 unit decline in NDVI in 3.45 sq. km. of the forest. Rapid assessment of post-cyclone damage in mangroves is challenging due to limited navigability of waterways, but critical for planning of mitigation and recovery measures. We demonstrate the utility of Otsu method, an automated statistical approach of the Google Earth Engine platform to identify inundated areas within days after a cyclone. Our radar-based inundation analysis advances current practices because it requires minimal user inputs, and is effective in the presence of high cloud cover. Such rapid assessment, when complemented with detailed information on species and vegetation composition, can inform appropriate restoration efforts in severely impacted regions and help decision makers efficiently manage resources for recovery and aid relief. We provide the datasets from this study on an open platform to aid in future research and planning endeavors.

TI  - Application Of Remote Sensing Indices To Digital Soil Salt Composition And Ionic Strength Mapping In The East Shore Of Urmia Lake, Iran
AB  - The aim of this study was to apply fifteen remote sensing indices extracted by Landsat 8 OLI imagery for predicting and spatially mapping of soil salt composition, major electrolytes and ionic strength (IST) as difficult-to-measure soil chemical properties and parameters. For this, an area with extension of 22300 ha was selected from the east shore of Urmia Lake, Iran with extremely saline and sodic soils. This article also focuses on the importance of data mining techniques in advanced digital soil mapping (DSM). In addition to routine chemical analysis, the Visual MINTEQ software was utilized for computing the saturation index of salt composition as well as ionic strength. The positive values of saturation indices were only identified for calcite, dolomite and gypsum in the study area. For mapping the aforementioned properties, Random Forests, Cubist and decision tree were the three candidate modeling approaches. The bootstrapping technique according to the calculated prediction intervals was then used to inspect the associated uncertainty of all created digital maps. Regarding optimality, the Cubist model was identified as the most efficient model for our data set and environmental covariates. The prediction of monovalent (i.e. Na+, K+ and Cl) ion concentrations, but not divalent (i.e. Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42) ion concentrations, was generally quite good with calibration and validation dataset. The most important finding of this paper was the successful prediction of spatial distribution of IST using solely remotely-sensed indices. The outcomes of this study are of great importance for the remote sensing society, by means of applying the respective remote sensing indices and identifying the most effective techniques.

TI  - Using Biomarkers To Address The Impacts Of Pollution On Limpets (Patella Depressa) And Their Mechanisms To Cope With Stress
AB  - Contaminant discharges, derived from human activities, are major concerns as they exert a continuous ecological pressure on aquatic systems, causing in fact cascading community effects. Although with associated ecological and fitness costs, physiological and biochemical defense mechanisms may restore the organism's internal balance. Several studies have pointed biomarkers as tools to assess contamination levels, and also to understand potential mechanisms to cope with stress. In the present study, the fitness costs of limpets Patella depressa located in two different contaminated sites and when transplanted into a different common environment – with no known historical contamination – were assessed through the measurement of oxidative stress, energy metabolism responses, and fatty acid profile changes. Integrated biomarker response index (IBR) revealed differences in responses between organisms of the different origin sites, with greater antioxidant and detoxification activities in the site with the higher contamination life-history (higher IBR index). Moreover, different abilities of this species to deal with the new environmental condition were also observed. After the transplant, and despite the differences in the initial profiles, response patterns became similar between both populations (similar IBR index), with organisms from the less contaminated site suffering a higher impact with a demarked increase in their detoxification and antioxidant defenses, as well as higher changes on fatty acid abundance/composition. Through an integrated biomarker profile analysis in a transplant context, this work provides a distinct insight on the mechanisms of response and tolerance to environmental stress, and fitness costs of this potential sentinel marine species in the context of environmental contamination changes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The Linkage Between Renewable Energy Potential And Sustainable Development: Understanding Solar Energy Variability And Photovoltaic Power Potential In Tibet, China
AB  - The accurate pattern of systematic assessment of regional-level solar energy resource potential including seasonal variability and annual trends is essential during renewable solar energy project development. Understanding the linkage between solar energy potential and photovoltaic (PV) development is of particular interest to developers and financers. However, a dearth of long-term, high-resolution solar radiation data makes these patterns and linkages challenging, and thus techniques to improve these characterizations are of great value. To improve knowledge of the renewable energy potential and sustainable development, we assessed high-resolution global surface solar radiation (SSR) dataset derived from remote sensing, and explicitly linked spatio-temporal pattern of solar energy potential across different timescales and PV development in Tibet using geographical statistics methods. With the framework, we provided an intuitive SSR mapping and more than 330 kWh/m2 of PV power potential was predicted in most areas of Tibet. We found spatio-temporal heterogeneity of solar energy seasonal variability: The SSR variation is less than 26% in most areas of Tibet in spring and summer, greater than 30% for autumn and winter; while the middle reaches of Yarlung Zangbo River remains at a low level. We also found PV power was not affected by SSR annual trends in most areas of Tibet during 2000–2016, ranging from −2 to 2 kWh/m2 per year. Additionally, we identified the mismatch between solar energy potential and PV development, characterized by a low average PV installed capacity with affluent solar energy potential, unstable power generation and a high light abandonment rate for PV. The main challenges facing long-term strategic development plans for solar PV was also assessed. Framework and findings herein provide a helpful guide to those responsible for making better decisions in some of the key stages of solar energy development at local and regional scale. © 2021

TI  - Evaluation Of Six Land Surface Evapotranspiration Products Over The Tibetan Plateau
AB  - Uncertainties in the evapotranspiration (ET) products used in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) region were determined based on the data from satellite remote sensing and observations having different spatial and temporal resolutions, limiting their utility for hydrometeorological and climate assessment. Six ET (PML, EB-ET_V2, GLEAM, GLDAS, ERA5_Land, and MOD16) products were evaluated based on eddy observations, and the differences between the products were compared. Moreover, the uncertainties in ET products in the TP region were analyzed. The results of the analysis are as follows: (1) A good correlation and consistency exist in the mean state and seasonal cycle between the observed and ET values of the corresponding pixel. Moreover, GLEAM product exhibits a high degree of agreement with the observed values and has applicability, and MOD16 product exhibits poor performance at most sites. (2) In terms of seasonal changes, ERA5_Land product values are highly consistent with the observed changes during spring, GLEAM product values are nearly consistent with the observed changes during summer and winter, and EB-ET_V2 product values are highly consistent with observed values during autumn. (3) Spatially, GLEAM product has higher correlation (the correlation coefficient R＞ 0.88) and consistency (index of agreement IOA＞ 0.89) compared to those of EB-ET_V2 product and GLDAS product. Substantial differences exist in the temporal and spatial distribution of various products during different seasons, especially during spring. Compared with other products, MOD16 product is underestimated in summer and overestimated in winter in most regions. (4) The annual average ET for each product except for MOD16 product is considerably different. The annual average ET values of the remaining five products over multiple years arranged in descending order are as follows: ERA5_Land product (401.46 mm a−1)＞ PML product (334.37 mm a−1)＞GLEAM product (298.46 mm a−1)＞EB-ET_V2 product (271.39 mm a−1)＞GLDAS product (249.67 mm a−1). The total annual evaporation in the TP region is 330.59 mm a−1. The assessment results provide a detailed understanding of the quality and dynamics of ET products in the TP region, which can serve as reference data for regional water management and water resource assessment in the TP region. © 2023 Science Press.

TI  - Use Of Earth Observation Satellite Data To Guide The Implementation Of Integrated Pest And Pollinator Management (Ippm) Technologies In An Avocado Production System
AB  - Insect pollinators provide an important ecosystem service by improving agricultural productivity. However, their populations have been declining in recent years due to excessive use of synthetic pesticides, climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Climate and LULC changes have resulted in land fragmentation and consequently pollinator habitat loss. To conserve pollinators, there is a need for sustainable agricultural practices such as integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM), which is a holistic landscape management approach that minimizes pesticides use while conserving pollinator abundance and diversity. This study aimed to use earth observation (EO) data to characterize landscape dynamics in terms of vegetation productivity to guide the implementation of IPPM interventions in an avocado production system in Murang'a (Kenya). Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-2 (S-2)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity to assess IPPM implementation sites. The NDVI was calculated using multi-date S-2 data acquired during the dry and wet seasons and categorized into three vegetation productivity classes - low, medium, and high - using a K-means unsupervised clustering method. We also collected socio-economic baseline data from 410 farmers with a focus on their perception to implement one of four avocado pest management and pollination options: (1) IPPM, (2) integrated pest management (IPM), (3) pollinator supplementation (P), and (4) no intervention (control). The three landscape vegetation productivity classes were then linked with the four farmer preferences with regards to the implementation options. Criteria based on the distances among the sites for implementing the different four options were set for farmer selection and the experiment was replicated three times in each vegetation productivity class (i.e. in total 12 farmers in each class). The results showed that the Kmeans method was successful in characterizing the landscape vegetation productivity with an overall accuracy of 86.2\%. One the other hand, we successfully selected the 36 (12 in each of the 3 vegetation productivity classes) out of 410 farmers who met our distance-based criteria and participated in the implementation of one of the four technology options (i.e. IPPM, IPM, P, and control). In conclusion, NDVI proved to be a vital proxy for assessing the landscape dynamics as it provided a robust view of vegetation productivity patterns, which enabled a wellrepresentative distribution of the four pest management and pollination options across the landscape. Overall, the study shows the utility of integrating EO and socio-economic data in selecting sites for implementing agrotechnologies at a landscape scale.

TI  - Development Of A New Index For Mapping Urban Areas In Türkiye Using Sentinel-2 Images
AB  - Population growth and urbanization have been increasing simultaneously and rapidly in recent years. Urban growth causes changes in land use/cover. Monitoring and mapping these changes are important for issues such as disaster management, biodiversity and city and environmental planning and management. Images obtained by remote sensing methods provide data for mapping urban land use areas. Over the years, many approaches have been developed to accurately analyse these images. However, urban area mapping is still a problem due to its complex structure, the many different materials used in urban areas, artificial and natural green areas, roads and industrial zones. In this study, a new approach is proposed to accurately map urban areas. Band values of Sentinel-2 images are analysed in regions (Eskişehir, İnegöl area from Bursa and Sincan area from Ankara) belonging to various land classes in urban areas. Based on the results, a new index (Urban Area Index) was proposed. The performance of the index was evaluated by separability analyses (Bhattacharyya-distance, Jeffries-Matusita distance and Mahalanobis-distance). Besides the created index was classified with the Random Forests algorithm and an accuracy assessment was performed with the overall accuracy, producers’ and users’ accuracy and F1 score. Results obtained by classification using this index are compared to 17 indexes presented in the literature. The proposed index achieved an overall accuracy rate of over 82% for all study areas. This rate is higher than the overall accuracies obtained with other indices and raw Sentinel-2 bands. This result indicates that the proposed method successfully maps urban areas more effectively than existing methods. © 2023 COSPAR

TI  - Identifying Optimal Locations For Artificial Groundwater Recharge By Rainfall In The Kingdom Of Bahrain
AB  - The Kingdom of Bahrain has extremely poor endowment of water resources. In the last four decades, the kingdom has experienced fast-paced socio-economic development and rapid population growth which has been associated with dramatic increase in water demands. To meet these water requirements, heavy reliance on groundwater was made, leading to its over-exploitation and resulting in a significant decline in groundwater levels and serious degradation in its quality due to saltwater intrusion. To rehabilitate groundwater, authorities need to pursue two management approaches: (1) lowering groundwater abstraction to its safe yield through implementing demand management and conservation policies; and (2) augmenting groundwater storage by managed aquifer recharge (MAR). In the latter case, recharge can be made during rainfall extreme events, where relatively large amounts of water become available in a relatively short time and accumulates at surface depressions. These waters can be stored in groundwater by enhancing their infiltration through gravity injection wells. In this research, the optimal locations for MAR in Bahrain are identified by employing a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology using geographic information system (GIS). The weighted overlay method (WOA) was implemented to identify optimal MAR locations using eight parameters: geology, geomorphology, soil type, land use/land cover, slope, curvature, drainage density, and distance from lineaments. The highest scores (ranked excellent to very good), indicating the most suitable locations for both rainwater harvesting and MAR, were identified at a number of locations. Then, these locations were validated by actual MAR field projects conducted in Bahrain by the water authorities and the majority of these locations were found in agreement. As next steps, it is recommended to conduct an in-depth investigation at the identified locations using a higher-resolution satellite images with utilities infrastructure maps, and include the depth to groundwater as a criteria for the optimum selection of the sites, to be followed by MAR pilot field investigation, monitoring, and modeling for the highest potential locations. © 2020, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Reef Cover, A Coral Reef Classification For Global Habitat Mapping From Remote Sensing
AB  - Coral reef management and conservation stand to benefit from improved high-resolution global mapping. Yet classifications underpinning large-scale reef mapping to date are typically poorly defined, not shared or region-specific, limiting end-users' ability to interpret outputs. Here we present Reef Cover, a coral reef geomorphic zone classification, developed to support both producers and end-users of global-scale coral reef habitat maps, in a transparent and version-based framework. Scalable classes were created by focusing on attributes that can be observed remotely, but whose membership rules also reflect deep knowledge of reef form and functioning. Bridging the divide between earth observation data and geo-ecological knowledge of reefs, Reef Cover maximises the trade-off between applicability at global scales, and relevance and accuracy at local scales. Two case studies demonstrate application of the Reef Cover classification scheme and its scientific and conservation benefits: 1) detailed mapping of the Cairns Management Region of the Great Barrier Reef to support management and 2) mapping of the Caroline and Mariana Island chains in the Pacific for conservation purposes.

TI  - Environmental And Human Controls Of Ecosystem Functional Diversity In Temperate South America
AB  - The regional controls of biodiversity patterns have been traditionally evaluated using structural and compositional components at the species level, but evaluation of the functional component at the ecosystem level is still scarce. During the last decades, the role of ecosystem functioning in management and conservation has increased. Our aim was to use satellite-derived Ecosystem Functional Types (EFTs, patches of the land-surface with similar carbon gain dynamics) to characterize the regional patterns of ecosystem functional diversity and to evaluate the environmental and human controls that determine EFT richness across natural and human-modified systems in temperate South America. The EFT identification was based on three descriptors of carbon gain dynamics derived from seasonal curves of the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI): annual mean (surrogate of primary production), seasonal coefficient of variation (indicator of seasonality) and date of maximum EVI (descriptor of phenology). As observed for species richness in the southern hemisphere, water availability, not energy, emerged as the main climatic driver of EFT richness in natural areas of temperate South America. In anthropogenic areas, the role of both water and energy decreased and increasing human intervention increased richness at low levels of human influence, but decreased richness at high levels of human influence.

TI  - Seasonal Variations Of Urban Surface Net Radiation And Its Relationship To Land Cover Pattern
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to land cover pattern changes which alter the surface net radiation and eventually influence surface energy balance. This process has been accompanied by a series of ecological and environmental problems, one of which is the urban heat island effect. Therefore, research on the seasonal variations of urban surface net radiation and its relationship to land cover pattern can provide important insights for exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. Taking Xiamen city as a study area, this research retrieved surface net radiation using Landsat-5 TM remote sensing images and meteorological data of the four seasons. Then the seasonal variation characteristics of surface net radiation were further analyzed. Landscape metrics were used to characterize and describe the spatial composition and allocation of land cover pattern. The correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, stepwise regression analysis and variance partitioning were applied to explore the relationship between surface net radiation and land cover pattern from multi- seasonal perspective. The results suggest that: (1) the highest mean value of surface net radiation was found in summer, followed by spring, fall and winter. Surface net radiation is higher for the land cover types of water and forestland, while lower for built-up land and bare land. (2) The spatial allocation of land cover pattern has no significant influence on surface net radiation. (3) The spatial composition of land cover pattern shows significant influence on surface net radiation. The proportions of bare land and the proportion of forest land are effective and important factors which affect the changes of surface net radiation all the year round. And the proportion of forest land is the most important and continuously effective factor which affects and explains the cross- seasonal differences of surface net radiation. This research expands our scientific understanding of the effects of land cover pattern on surface net radiation. And it is helpful in exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. In addition, it may provide theoretical hints and realistic guidance for urban planning and sustainable development. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Towards Precision Forestry: Drought Response From Remote Sensing-Based Disturbance Monitoring And Fine-Scale Soil Information In Central Europe
AB  - Prolonged drought and susceptibility to biotic stressors induced an extensive calamity in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and widespread crown defoliation in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Central Europe. For future management decisions, it is crucial to link changes in canopy cover to site conditions. However, current knowledge on the role of soil properties for drought-induced forest disturbance is limited due to the scarcity and low spatial resolution of soil information. We present a fine-scale assessment on the role of soil properties for forest disturbance in Norway spruce and European beech derived from optical remote sensing. A forest disturbance modeling framework based on Sentinel-2 time series was applied on 340 km2 in low mountain ranges of Central Germany. Spatio-temporal information on forest disturbance was calculated at 10 m spatial resolution in the period 2019–2021 and intersected with high-resolution soil information (1:10,000) based on roughly 2850 soil profiles. We found distinct differences in disturbed area, depending on soil type, texture, stoniness, effective rooting depth and available water capacity (AWC). For spruce, we found a polynomial relationship between AWC (R2 = 0.7) and disturbance, with highest disturbed area (65 %) for AWC between 90 and 160 mm. Interestingly, we found no evidence for generally higher disturbance on shallow soils, although stands on the deepest soils were significantly less affected. Noteworthy, sites affected first did not necessarily exhibit highest proportions of disturbed area post-drought, indicating recovery or adaptation. We conclude that site- and species-specific understanding of drought impacts benefits from a combination of remote sensing and fine-scale soil information. Since our approach revealed which sites were affected first and most, it qualifies for prioritizing in situ monitoring activities to most vulnerable stands in acute drought conditions as well as for developing long-term strategies for reforestation and site-specific risk assessment for precision forestry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Forest Fire Susceptibility Assessment Using Google Earth Engine In Gangwon-Do, Republic Of Korea
AB  - Forest fires are one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards, causing substantial economic loss and destruction of forest cover. As the Gangwon-do region in Korea has abundant forest resources and ecological diversity as Korea's largest forest area, spatial data on forest fire susceptibility of the region are urgently required. In this study, a forest fire susceptibility map (FFSM) of Gangwon-do was constructed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and three machine learning algorithms: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). The factors related to climate, topography, hydrology, and human activity were constructed. To verify the accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used. The AUC values were 0.846 (BRT), 0.835 (RF), 0.751 (CART). Factor importance analysis was performed to identify the important factors of the occurrence of forest fires in Gangwon-do. The results show that the most important factor in the Gangwon-do region is slope. A slope of approximately 17 degrees (moderately steep) has a considerable impact on the occurrence of forest fires. Human activity and interference are the other important factors that affect forest fires. The established FFSM can support future efforts on forest resource protection and environmental management planning in Gangwon-do.

TI  - Insights Into The Environmental Conditions Contributing To Variability In The Larval Recruitment Of The Tropical Sardine Sardinella Lemuru
AB  - The small pelagic fishery in the southern Philippines is one of the largest contributors to fisheries production in the country, and is dominated by the Bali sardine Sardinella lemuru. This species is a year-round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the northeast monsoon (NEM) months of November to February. However, there is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species' survival during its early life history stages. Here, we attempt to discern the importance of temperature, prey density and advection on sardine larvae. The larvae were represented as passive particles that were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal. The conditions the larvae experienced, namely, temperature and estimated prey density based on satellite chlorophyll-a values were recorded at each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days. The temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed that sardines spawned during the NEM months experienced higher chlorophyll-a, lower (more optimal) sea surface temperature, albeit higher advective loss, than sardines spawned during other months. Comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch years, sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher retention nearshore. Our results emphasize that sardine stock management efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently in catches.

TI  - Evaluating Street View Exposure Measures Of Visible Green Space For Health Research
AB  - Urban green space, or natural environments, are associated with multiple physical and mental health outcomes. Several proposed pathways of action for these benefits (e.g., stress reduction and attention restoration) require visual perception of green space; however, existing green space exposure measures commonly used in epidemiological studies do not capture street-scale exposures. We downloaded 254 Google Street View (GSV) panorama images from Portland, Oregon and calculated percent of green in each image, called Green View Index (GVI). For these locations we also calculated satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), % tree cover, % green space, % street tree buffering, distance to parks, and several neighborhood socio-economic variables. Correlations between the GVI and other green space measures were low (−0.02 to 0.50), suggesting GSV-based measures captured unique information about green space exposures. We further developed a GVI:NDVI ratio, which was associated with the amount of vertical green space in an image. The GVI and GVI:NDVI ratio were weakly related to neighborhood socioeconomic status and are therefore less susceptible to confounding in health studies compared to other green space measures. GSV measures captured unique characteristics of the green space environment and offer a new approach to examine green space and health associations in epidemiological research. © 2018, Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Nutrients In Saltmarsh Soils Are Weakly Related To Those In Adjacent Coastal Waters
AB  - Saltmarshes provide a broad range of high-value ecosystem services and can be sensitive to eutrophication, but elucidating such impacts at broad spatial scales demands a better understanding of the underlying nutrient linkages between saltmarsh soil and tidal waters. We used existing water quality data and field surveys of 15 saltmarshes across a broad trophic gradient of coastal waters, but similar biogeographic setting (in Ireland) to investigate if phosphorus and nitrogen pools in saltmarsh soils are related to those in tidal water across saltmarshes. We also investigated if the strength of such relationships is inversely related to ground elevation, which approximates the degree of tidal inundation. Plant-available phosphorus and nitrogen pools in soil were related to water nutrients, albeit only weakly. We did not find any support for the moderating influence of elevation, indicating that it may be obscured by internal cycling and external sources. We also found evidence for effect of birds on the saltmarsh nutrient pool. Saltmarsh soils are unlikely to serve as general sentinels of nutrient conditions in their corresponding water bodies and may need separate assessment criteria and management tools, which in turn require disentangling localised and whole-saltmarsh sources of variation in nutrient concentrations. © 2018, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

TI  - Habitat Selection Following Recent Disturbance: Model Transferability With Implications For Management And Conservation Of Moose (Alces Alces)
AB  - Site-specific variation in relative habitat abundance and disturbance regimes may produce differences in habitat preferences of associated populations. An evaluation of the predictive power of habitat selection models across space would benefit our understanding of the reliability of models of selection and space use in predicting animal occurrence. We used presence-absence data from winter surveys of moose (Alces alces (L., 1758)) to estimate resource selection functions (RSFs) across two study sites using Far North Land Cover updated with recent disturbance from fire and timber harvest. Moose selected foraging habitat (e.g., deciduous land cover) and for increasing deciduous foliage cover (Delta NDVI, i.e., the difference in the normalized difference vegetation index). Snow depth negatively influenced habitat selection, likely due to increased predation risk and reduced movement and foraging efficiency. Models lost little predictive power when applied to another site based on comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our results corroborated the current body of knowledge concerning moose habitat selection, i.e., moose preferentially use forest stands dominated by deciduous species, but suggested that moose strongly avoided very recently disturbed areas. Minimal site-specific variation and ROC comparison suggests that RSFs may be extended into novel systems, given adequate consideration for habitat quality and abundance, thereby simplifying management needs of this important species.

TI  - Validating And Linking The Gimms Leaf Area Index (Lai3g) With Environmental Controls In Tropical Africa
AB  - The recent Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) LAI3g product provides a 30-year global times-series of remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), an essential variable in models of ecosystem process and productivity. In this study, we use a new dataset of field-based LAI(True) to indirectly validate the GIMMS LAI3g product, LAI(avhrr), in East Africa, comparing the distribution properties of LAI(avhrr) across biomes and environmental gradients with those properties derived for LAI(True). We show that the increase in LAI with vegetation height in natural biomes is captured by both LAI(avhrr) and LAI(True), but that LAI(avhrr) overestimates LAI for all biomes except shrubland and cropland. Non-linear responses of LAI to precipitation and moisture indices, whereby leaf area peaks at intermediate values and declines thereafter, are apparent in both LAI(True) and LAI(avhrr), although LAI(True) reaches its maximum at lower values of the respective environmental driver. Socio-economic variables such as governance (protected areas) and population affect both LAI responses, although cause and effect are not always obvious: a positive relationship with human population pressure was detected, but shown to be an artefact of both LAI and human settlement covarying with precipitation. Despite these complexities, targeted field measurements, stratified according to both environmental and socio-economic gradients, could provide crucial data for improving satellite-derived LAI estimates, especially in the human-modified landscapes of tropical Africa.

TI  - Sectioning Remote Imagery For Characterization Of Avena Sterilis Infestations. Part B: Efficiency And Economics Of Control
AB  - Avena sterilis weed pressure categories can be discriminated in wheat through remote images taken at late stages of wheat senescence. Site-specific image processing was achieved with SARI ®, an add-on software program for ENVI ® developed to implement precision agriculture. Using the SARI software and crop-weed competition and economic models, the precision yield losses for each micro-plot can be estimated and herbicide prescription maps obtained. Simulation studies on control indicators and herbicide use efficiency were undertaken using real-time ground data and remote images of two wheat plots infested with Avena sterilis at LaFloridaII and Navajas (Southern Spain). The simulation indicated that precision application of herbicides would produce higher overall herbicide savings (OHS) compared to broadcast applications but would vary depending on the level of weed infestation, the decision making criteria (DMC) of applying herbicide above a weed infestation level and the size of the spray grid considered. For example, for areas with low levels of infestation (around 15%), the OHS was 20, 44, 81 and 90% for a DMC of 0, 10, 20 and 30%, respectively. SARI ® also estimates the overall herbicide application efficiency (OHAE), a key agro-environmental index to estimate the efficiency of herbicide applications in weedy areas and the lack of herbicide applications in weed-free areas. Ideally, the OHAE is equal to 1 if weed control is complete and herbicide applications in weed-free areas are not necessary. The OHAE index is influenced by the size of the micro-plot and decision-making herbicide application criteria (DMC). The OHAE values increased as the size of the micro-plot decreased, regardless of the intensity of the weed infestation. For example, micro-plots of 20 × 6 m, 5 × 3 m and 1.2 × 1.5 m had OHAE values of 0.27, 0.57 and 0.76, for areas of low infestation, when averaged over the DMC. Generally, the OHAE values increased as the size of the micro-plot decreased regardless of the intensity of weed infestation. Based on actual weed abundance data, competition models and production costs, SARI ® estimated wheat yield losses and economic net return for each micro-plot and herbicide application strategy. In both locations, weed infestation varied spatially from virtually weed-free micro-plots to 15 and 24% winter wheat yield loss in Navajas and LaFloridaII, respectively. Preliminary calculations indicate that net returns were slightly higher for areas with site-specific adjusted-rate applications than for the overall standard label rate application strategy. Both of these strategies provided considerably higher net returns compared to non-treated areas. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Multi-Scale Estimation Of Land Use Efficiency (Sdg 11.3.1) Across 25 Years Using Global Open And Free Data
AB  - Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aspires to "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable", and the introduction of an explicit urban goal testifies to the importance of urbanisation. The understanding of the process of urbanisation and the capacity to monitor the SDGs require a wealth of open, reliable, locally yet globally comparable data, and a fully-fledged data revolution. In this framework, the European Commission-Joint Research Centre has developed a suite of (open and free) data and tools named Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) which maps the human presence on Earth (built-up areas, population distribution and settlement typologies) between 1975 and 2015. The GHSL supplies information on the progressive expansion of built-up areas on Earth and population dynamics in human settlements, with both sources of information serving as baseline data to quantify land use efficiency (LUE), listed as a Tier II indicator for SDG 11 (11.3.1). In this paper, we present the profile of the LUE across several territorial scales between 1990 and 2015, highlighting diverse development trajectories and the land take efficiency of different human settlements. Our results show that (i) the GHSL framework allows us to estimate LUE for the entire planet at several territorial scales, opening the opportunity of lifting the LUE indicator from its Tier II classification; (ii) the current formulation of the LUE is substantially subject to path dependency; and (iii) it requires additional spatially-explicit metrics for its interpretation. We propose the Achieved Population Density in Expansion Areas and the Marginal Land Consumption per New Inhabitant metrics for this purpose. The study is planetary and multi-temporal in coverage, demonstrating the value of well-designed, open and free, fine-scale geospatial information on human settlements in supporting policy and monitoring progress made towards meeting the SDGs.

TI  - Environmental Impact Assessment Of Attenda Abattoir, Ogbomoso Southwestern Nigeria On Surface And Groundwater Quality Using Geo-Electrical Imaging And Microbiological Analysis
AB  - The impact of Attenda abattoir, Ogbomoso southwestern Nigeria on four water sources was investigated using geoelectrical imaging and microbiological analysis. 2D electrical resistivity imaging indicated groundwater contamination by leachate from the abattoir. Electrical resistivity values measured by the traverse run directly on the waste dump and other areas impacted by the waste from the abattoir are generally very low (6.68-16.7 Ωm) in comparison to other positions (135-288 Ωm). The total viable bacteria count of the water samples ranged from 0.49×106 to 2.85×108 cfu/ml and all samples are contaminated with coliforms with the most probable number (MPN)/100 ml ranging from 110 to ≥1,600 MPN/100 ml. Among bacteria isolated from the study site (n=95), resistance to eight antibiotics ranged from 35.8% to 94%. In addition, 85% of Streptococcus agalactiae (n=31) and Staph-ylococci (n=9) showed haemolytic activity while 92% of all isolates showed β-lactamase activity. These results suggest that operations of the abattoir may impact negatively on surrounding aquatic ecosystem and endanger the health of surrounding residents who use water from the wells for domestic purposes. Furthermore, such aquatic ecosystems may serve as reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

TI  - Sustainable Development Under Population Pressure: Lessons From Developed Land Consumption In The Conterminous Us
AB  - Population growth will result in a significant anthropogenic environmental change worldwide through increases in developed land (DL) consumption. DL consumption is an important environmental and socioeconomic process affecting humans and ecosystems. Attention has been given to DL modeling inside highly populated cities. However, modeling DL consumption should expand to non-metropolitan areas where arguably the environmental consequences are more significant. Here, we study all counties within the conterminous U.S. and based on satellite-derived product (National Land Cover Dataset 2001) we calculate the associated DL for each county. By using county population data from the 2000 census we present a comparative study on DL consumption and we propose a model linking population with expected DL consumption. Results indicate distinct geographic patterns of comparatively low and high consuming counties moving from east to west. We also demonstrate that the relationship of DL consumption with population is mostly linear, altering the notion that expected population growth will have lower DL consumption if added in counties with larger population. Added DL consumption is independent of a county's starting population and only dependent on whether the county belongs to a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). In the overlapping MSA and non-MSA population range there is also a constant DL efficiency gain of approximately 20km(2) for a given population for MSA counties which suggests that transitioning from rural to urban counties has significantly higher benefits in lower populations. In addition, we analyze the socioeconomic composition of counties with extremely high or low DL consumption. High DL consumption counties have statistically lower Black/African American population, higher poverty rate and lower income per capita than average in both NMSA and MSA counties. Our analysis offers a baseline to investigate further land consumption strategies in anticipation of growing population pressures.

TI  - Neighborhood Greenness Attenuates The Adverse Effect Of Pm2.5 On Cardiovascular Mortality In Neighborhoods Of Lower Socioeconomic Status
AB  - Features of the environment may modify the effect of particulate matter ≤2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) on health. Therefore, we investigated how neighborhood sociodemographic and land-use characteristics may modify the association between PM2.5 and cardiovascular mortality. We obtained residence-level geocoded cardiovascular mortality cases from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (n = 179,986), and PM2.5 predictions from a satellite-based model (2001–2011). We appended census block group-level information on sociodemographic factors and walkability, and calculated neighborhood greenness within a 250 m buffer surrounding each residence. We found a 2.54% (1.34%; 3.74%) increase in cardiovascular mortality associated with a 10 µg/m3 increase in two-day average PM2.5. Walkability or greenness did not modify the association. However, when stratifying by neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics, smaller PM2.5 effects were observed in greener areas only among cases who resided in neighborhoods with a higher population density and lower percentages of white residents or residents with a high school diploma. In conclusion, the PM2.5 effects on cardiovascular mortality were attenuated by higher greenness only in areas with sociodemographic features that are highly correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Previous evidence suggests health benefits linked to neighborhood greenness may be stronger among lower socioeconomic groups. Attenuation of the PM2.5–mortality relationship due to greenness may explain some of this evidence. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Relationships Between Reef Fish Communities And Remotely Sensed Rugosity Measurements In Biscayne National Park, Florida, Usa
AB  - The realization that coral reef ecosystem management must occur across multiple spatial scales and habitat types has led scientists and resource managers to seek variables that are easily measured over large areas and correlate well with reef resources. Here we investigate the utility of new technology in airborne laser surveying (NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL)) in assessing topographical complexity (rugosity) to predict reef fish community structure on shallow (< 10 m deep) patch reefs. Marine portions of Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, were surveyed remotely using the EAARL, and reef fish populations were visually surveyed on 10 patch reefs at independent, randomly selected stations (n = 10-13 per reef). Rugosity at each station was assessed in situ by divers using the traditional chain-transect method (10-m scale), and remotely using the EAARL submarine topography data at multiple spatial scales (2, 5, and 10 m). The rugosity and biological datasets were analyzed together to elucidate the predictive power of EAARL rugosity in describing the variance in reef fish community variables and to assess the correlation between chain-transect and EAARL rugosity. EAARL rugosity was not well correlated with chain-transect rugosity, or with species richness of fishes (although statistically significant, the amount of variance explained by the model was very low). Variance in reef fish community attributes was better explained in reef-by-reef variability than by physical variables. However, once the reef-by-reef variability was taken into account in a two-way analysis of variance, the importance of rugosity could be seen on individual reefs. Fish species richness and abundance were statistically higher at high rugosity stations compared to medium and low rugosity stations, as predicted by prior ecological research. The EAARL shows promise as an important mapping tool for reef resource managers as they strive to inventory and protect coral reef resources.

TI  - A Hyper-Temporal Remote Sensing Protocol For High-Resolution Mapping Of Ecological Sites
AB  - Ecological site classification has emerged as a highly effective land management framework, but its utility at a regional scale has been limited due to the spatial ambiguity of ecological site locations in the U. S. or the absence of ecological site maps in other regions of the world. In response to these shortcomings, this study evaluated the use of hyper-temporal remote sensing (i. e., hundreds of images) for high spatial resolution mapping of ecological sites. We posit that hyper-temporal remote sensing can provide novel insights into the spatial variability of ecological sites by quantifying the temporal response of land surface spectral properties. This temporal response provides a spectral 'fingerprint' of the soil-vegetation- climate relationship which is central to the concept of ecological sites. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of ecological sites in a semi-arid rangeland using a 28-year time series of normalized difference vegetation index from Landsat TM 5 data and modeled using support vector machine classification. Results from this study show that support vector machine classification using hyper-temporal remote sensing imagery was effective in modeling ecological site classes, with a 62\% correct classification. These results were compared to Gridded Soil Survey Geographic database and expert delineated maps of ecological sites which had a 51 and 89\% correct classification, respectively. An analysis of the effects of ecological state on ecological site misclassifications revealed that sites in degraded states (e. g., shrub-dominated/shrubland and bare/annuals) had a higher rate of misclassification due to their close spectral similarity with other ecological sites. This study identified three important factors that need to be addressed to improve future model predictions: 1) sampling designs need to fully represent the range of both within class (i. e., states) and between class (i. e., ecological sites) spectral variability through time, 2) field sampling protocols that accurately characterize key soil properties (e. g., texture, depth) need to be adopted, and 3) additional environmental covariates (e. g. terrain attributes) need to be evaluated that may help further differentiate sites with similar spectral signals. Finally, the proposed hyper-temporal remote sensing framework may provide a standardized approach to evaluate and test our ecological site concepts through examining differences in vegetation dynamics in response to climatic variability and other drivers of land-use change. Results from this study demonstrate the efficacy of the hyper-temporal remote sensing approach for high resolution mapping of ecological sites, (a)nd highlights its utility in terms of reduced cost and time investment relative to traditional manual mapping approaches.

TI  - The Ecological Status Of Grasslands On Lowland Farmlands In Western Ireland And Implications For Grassland Classification And Nature Value Assessment
AB  - The identification and protection of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is an objective of the European Rural Development policy which has yet to be met by Member States. Remote sensing and models based on farm statistics are commonly used to identify HNV farmland. Use of datasets such as Corine Landcover Classes is widespread but it has been acknowledged that such datasets can significantly overlook fine-scale biodiversity features. In countries where farmland is predominantly grass-based, there is an added difficulty in distinguishing between grassland types without undertaking field-scale survey work. This study was conducted to improve our knowledge of grassland biodiversity on lowland farms with a view to helping assess their potential conservation value in a High Nature Value farmland context. We analysed the grassland species composition of 603 fields on 32 lowland farms and investigated their relationship to management, ecological and spatial descriptors. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) analyses of the grasslands and their ecology on these farms revealed a continuum between semi-natural and improved agricultural grasslands, including an intermediate Semi-Improved Grassland type. This gradation from improved to semi-natural grassland highlights the biodiversity variation that occurs on farms that are frequently considered to be of low nature value. Statistical analyses showed that management practices, and especially soil fertility, were most strongly associated with grassland type. The detailed description of the grasslands that occur on these lowland farms has the potential to provide a better assessment of the overall nature value of a farm, potentially aiding the identification of Type 2 High Nature Value farmland. Before this can be achieved, however, there is a need to amend the grassland classification system used in Ireland in order that intermediate semi-natural grassland assemblages can be identified at the field level. Field surveys are necessary for this level of detail. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Scenario Planning And Multispecies Occupancy Models Reveal Positive Avian Responses To Restoration Of Afforested Woodlands
AB  - Scenario planning is a powerful approach for assessing restoration outcomes under alternative futures. However, developing plausible scenarios remains daunting in complex systems like ecological communities. Here, we used Bayesian multispecies occupancy modeling to develop scenarios to assess woodland restoration outcomes in afforested communities in seven wildlife management areas in Arkansas, U.S.A. Our objectives were (1) to define plausible woodland restoration and afforestation scenarios by quantifying historic ranges of variation in mean tree cover and tree cover heterogeneity from 1986 to 2021 and (2) to predict changes in bird species richness and occupancy patterns for six species of greatest conservation need under two future scenarios: complete afforestation (100% tree cover) and woodland restoration (based on remotely sensed historic tree cover). Using 35 years of remotely sensed tree cover data and 6 years of bird monitoring data, we developed multispecies occupancy models to predict future bird species richness and occupancy under the complete afforestation and woodland restoration scenarios. Between 1986 and 2021, tree cover increased in all study areas—with one increasing 70%. Under the woodland restoration scenario, avian species richness increased up to 20%, and four of six species of greatest conservation need exhibited gains in occupancy probability. The complete afforestation scenario had negligible effects on richness and occupancy. Overall, we found decreasing tree cover to historic levels prior to widespread afforestation would provide community-level benefits and would do little harm even to forest-dependent species of conservation concern. Applying multispecies occupancy modeling within a scenario planning framework allows for comparing multiscale trade-offs between plausible futures. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

TI  - Characterizing Over Four Decades Of Forest Disturbance In Minnesota, Usa
AB  - Spatial information about disturbance driven patterns of forest structure and ages across landscapes provide a valuable resource for all land management efforts including cross-ownership collaborative forest treatments and restoration. While disturbance events in general are known to impact stand characteristics, the agent of change may also influence recovery and the supply of ecosystem services. Our study utilizes the full extent of the Landsat archive to identify the timing, extent, magnitude, and agent, of the most recent fast disturbance event for all forested lands within Minnesota, USA. To account for the differences in the Landsat sensors through time, specifically the coarser spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolutions of the early MSS sensors, we employed a two-step approach, first harmonizing spectral indices across the Landsat sensors, then applying a segmentation algorithm to fit temporal trends to the time series to identify abrupt forest disturbance events. We further incorporated spectral, topographic, and land protection information in our classification of the agent of change for all disturbance patches. After allowing two years for the time series to stabilize, we were able to identify the most recent fast disturbance events across Minnesota from 1974-2018 with a change versus no-change validation accuracy of 97.2% ± 1.9%, and higher omission (14.9% 9.3%) than commission errors (1.6% ± 1.9%) for the identification of change patches. Our classification of the agent of change exhibited an overall accuracy of 96.5% ± 1.9% with classes including non-disturbed forest, land conversion, fire, flooding, harvest, wind/weather, and other rare natural events. Individual class errors varied, but all class user and producer accuracies were above 78%. The unmatched nature of the Landsat archive for providing comparable forest attribute and change information across more than four decades highlights the value of the totality of the Landsat program to the larger geospatial, ecological research, and forest management communities. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Changes In Natural Vegetation Growth And Groundwater Depth And Their Relationship In The Minqin Oasis In The Shiyang River Basin
AB  - The Minqin Basin is short of water resources and has a weak ecological environment. Understanding the relationship between groundwater table depth and growth of natural ecological vegetation is an important theoretical basis for precisely controlling groundwater exploitation and targeted protecting ecological environment. Previous studies lack correlation analyses, especially determination of ecological groundwater levels in the shallow buried area. In this study, we analyzes the spatial and temporal variation in the NDVI of the natural ecological vegetation and groundwater depth and the relationship, based on the LANDSAT remote sensing data and the measured data at 85 wells during 2000 - 2017. The results show that (1) NDVI was generally low in the study area, with the annual mean value of 0. 1, and the value of NDVI became greater after 2012, reflecting the significant effect of the measurs of artificial afforestation and the like; (2) ground water depth showed an increasing trend during 2000 - 2017, but the increase slowed down after 2008, and the groundwater table depth was greater than 20 m in the western part, but less than 20 m in the eastern and northern parts; (3) the groundwater depth suitable for vegetation growth is about 2. 5 ~ 3. 9 m, the NDVI is highly negative correlated with groundwater depth when the groundwater depth is less than 4 m, and the correlation coefficient between them was generally less than -0.8; (4) there was no obvious correlation between them when the groundwater depth was greater than 4 m. In this paper, the relationship between the growth state of natural vegetation and groundwater table depth in the Minqin oasis area was studied synthetically in the long time series and on the basin spatial scale, and the ecological groundwater level in the shallow buried area was obtained, and the key target area of ecological governance was preliminarily delineated. © 2020 Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology.

TI  - Impact Of Urban Morphology And Landscape Characteristics On Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity Of Land Surface Temperature
AB  - Urban microclimates have undergone extreme changes against the current backdrop of global warming and rapid urbanization. Although several studies on the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of land surface temperatures (LSTs) have been reported, only a few of them describe the key factors and specific spatial relationships that affect LSTs from time series. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the spatial heterogeneity of LST from multiple time series and analyze its relationship with various influencing factors. A case study of the Ganjingzi District (GJZ) of Dalian City, China, was performed, with multi-source data and spatial analysis methods being jointly used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of multi temporal LSTs. The results indicate the following: (i) the GJZ LSTs gradually increased, with the average increase being 0.55 degrees C; (ii) there was a strong and positive correlation among the spatial distribution of LSTs, and the Moran's I value for global spatial autocorrelation exceeded 0.85; and (iii) the fitting degree between the LST and various factors (Adjust-R-2) for the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was better than that for the ordinary least squares approach. NDBI and LST are highly correlated and have good spatial stability. From the spatial distribution of Local-R-2, it can be seen that with the expansion of urban space, the influence of urban areas on LSTs increases. Therefore, reasonable planning of urban land is of great significance for mitigating heat islands.

TI  - Grassland Canopy Parameters And Their Relationships To Remotely Sensed Vegetation Indices In The Nebraska Sand Hills
AB  - Relationships among spectral vegetation indices and grassland biophysical parameters including the effects of varying levels of standing dead vegetation, range sites, and range plant communities were examined. Range plant communities consisting of northern mixed grass prairie and a smooth brome field as well as range sites and management in a Sand Hills bluestem prairie were sampled with a ground radiometer and for LAI, biomass, chlorophy]] and nitrogen amounts. Live above ground (herbaceous and shrub leaf) biomass quadrat estimates in early June, 1994, ranged from a mean value of 35,9 g/m2 in the burned area to 128.0 g/m2 in the mixed grass prairie. Shrubs, when present, had a stronger effect on the ground radiometer NDVI and MSAVI relationships with live biomass than either standing dead vegetation or plant community composition. Predictive relationships for live biomass from ground radiometer spectral data allowed rapid nondestructive estimation of live biomass for eleven 30 m by 30 m plots. Strong (r2 - 0.81 to 0.87) predictive relationships for live biomass and SPOT vegetation indices at the 30 m by 30 m scale were developed and applied to estimate live biomass for entire site areas. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Biological Threats From A 'One Health' Perspective
AB  - Biological threats are a prime example of an issue that needs the 'One Health' approach. Such an approach would facilitate the prevention and mitigation of these threats. 'One Health' is defined as any added value in terms of the health of humans and animals, financial savings or environmental services achievable through the cooperation of human and veterinary medicines when compared to the two disciplines working separately. This principle also applies to the involvement of other disciplines from the natural sciences and humanities. This paper is not an exhaustive survey of integrated approaches but discusses concepts and methods and provides key examples of the benefits of a 'One Health' approach when applied to biological threats. Zoonoses and vector-borne diseases (i.e. diseases transmitted between animals and humans and by insect or acarian vectors) remain central biological threats in highly dynamic social and environmental conditions. Such diseases are not always directly transmitted. Contaminated food, water, air and soil represent important sources of transmission for foodborne and environmentally related diseases. Therefore, this paper treats environmental sanitation separately because of the importance of the excreta management of humans and animals. Integrated syndromic surveillance and antimicrobial resistance surveillance link the above aspects and are showcases for a 'One Health' approach to biological threat reduction. Biological threats are not only related to natural conditions but may also be exacerbated by large development projects such as dams, mining and infrastructure. Consequently, it is recommended that the health impact assessment (HIA) approach be implemented as early as the planning stage of any large infrastructure project located in a complex socioecological system. This paper extends the HIA approach to an integrated 'One Health' impact assessment approach.

TI  - Ammonia Measurements And Emissions From A California Dairy Using Point And Remote Sensors
AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is an important trace gas species in the atmosphere that can have negative impacts on human, animal, and ecosystem health. Agriculture has been identified as the largest source of NH3, specifically livestock operations. NH3 emissions from a commercial dairy in California were investigated during June 2008. Cattle were held in open-lot pens, except for young calves in hutches with shelters. Solid manure was stored in the open-lot pens. Liquid manure from feed lanes was passed through a solids settling basin and stored in a holding pond. Passive sensors and openpath Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (OP-FTIR) were deployed around the facility to measure NH3 concentrations. Emissions from pens and the liquid manure system (LMS) were estimated using inverse modeling. Mean emission factors (EFs) for the entire facility were 140.5 42.5 g d-1 animal-1 from the passive sampler data and 199.2 22.0 g d-1 animal-1 from the OP-FTIR data, resulting in the facility's summer emissions calculated at 265.2 80.2 kg d-1 and 375.4 27.1 kg d-1, respectively. These EFs are within the range of values reported in the literature. Both concentrations and emissions exhibited a strong diurnal cycle, peaking in the late afternoon. Total facility emissions exhibited significant positive correlations with temperature and wind speed. The findings of this study show that NH3 emissions from a commercial dairy can vary by a factor of 10 or more throughout the day, and EFs can vary by two orders of magnitude when compared to other U.S. dairies, based on literature values.© 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers ISSN 2151-0032.

TI  - Estimation Of Stem Biomass Of Individual Abies Faxoniana Through Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing
AB  - Fast and accurate quantification of biophysical parameters of trees is essential for forest management, assessment of carbon sequestration and evaluation of regional ecosystem services value. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising tool to estimate biomass of individual trees due to its extremely high resolution. In this study, we used self-developed UAV to obtain shadow-free remote sensing images, taking Abies faxoniana in Wanglang Nature Reserve of Sichuan Province as an example. There were two plots, one for model training and the other for model validation. Crown area (CA) of individual trees was delineated through man-computer interpretation. Meanwhile, the field inventory was conducted to record the diameter at breast height (DBH) of individual trees, and to establish CA-DBH regression model. Based on the validity of CA-DBH model, the stem biomass (SB) of individual A. faxoniana trees in plot 2 was derived according to the existing empirical DBH-SB equation. There was a strong nonlinear correlation between CA extracted from the UAV remote sensing images and DBH documented in the field visit, with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.752 (P < 0.001, n = 94). Then prediction of DBH using the model in plot 2 was conducted, followed by a T-test. Verification results showed that the difference was not significant between the predicted DBH and observed DBH in the field (P > 0.05), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.879. This study indicates that it is practically feasible to estimate SB of individual trees through the CA extracted from UAV remote sensing images. © 2016, Beijing Forestry University.

TI  - Ecoregion-Wide, Multi-Sensor Biomass Mapping Highlights A Major Underestimation Of Dry Forests Carbon Stocks
AB  - Tropical dry forests harbor major carbon stocks but are disappearing rapidly across the globe as agriculture expands into them. Unfortunately, carbon emissions from deforestation in dry forests remain poorly understood as high spatial-temporal and vertical heterogeneity complicate biomass mapping. Here, we use a novel Gradient Boosted Regression framework to test the relative gains of combining optical (MODIS) and radar (Sentinel 1) time series, as well as lidar-based (GEDI) canopy-height information, to map biomass in tropical dry forests. We apply our approach across the entire Dry Chaco ecoregion (about 800,000 km2), using an extensive ground dataset of forest inventory plots for training and validation, to map above-ground biomass (AGB) for the year 2019. Our best AGB model had an r2 of 0.89 (RMSE = 15.1 t/ha) with an estimated AGB in remaining natural vegetation of 4.65 Gt (+/- 0.9 Gt). Seasonal metrics from EVI time-series, combined with seasonal Sentinel 1 metrics, had the highest predictive power, while adding GEDI-based canopy height did not improve models. Our resulting AGB maps had a much higher level of agreement with independent ground-data than global AGB products (agreements between r2 = 0.07-0.41), which all suffer from a huge, up to 14-fold, underestimation of AGB in the Chaco. Most of the remaining AGB stored in Chaco woodlands is found in Argentina (2.4 Gt AGB), followed by Paraguay (1.13 Gt AGB) and Bolivia (1.11 Gt AGB). Our results also highlight that 71\% of the remaining AGB is located outside protected areas, and around half of the remaining AGB occurs on land utilized by traditional communities. Together, our analyses reveal substantial risk of continued high carbon emissions should agricultural expansion progress. Considerable co-benefits appear to exist between protecting traditional livelihoods and carbon stocks. Our map, the most accurate and fine-scale AGB map for this global deforestation hotspot, can serve as a basis for land-use and conservation planning aimed at leveraging such co-benefits. More broadly, our analyses reveal the considerable potential of combining time series of optical and radar data for a more reliable mapping of above-ground biomass in tropical dry forests and savannas.

TI  - Mission To Planet Earth
AB  - On July 20, 1989, the President of the United States presented his vision of NASA's future: the Earth, Moon, and Mars beckon as targets for understanding and future exploration. The goals have been set, but much remains to be done in setting priorities, budgets, and timetables. There are many demands on every Federal dollar, and tough choices will have to be made. The key to a dynamic space program is maintaining balance between today's concerns and tomorrow's dividends-a balance between budgetary limitations and the inherent human quest to move on, to grow, and to learn. There are advocates for manned and unmanned programs, exploration, and commercialization. The challenge is not to pick among them, but rather to construct a comprehensive long-term plan, and to devise missions contributing to a balanced program. A mission can serve several goals, and NASA's strength is enhanced by pursuing a variety of objectives. Supporting Earth science research is an intrinsic part of NASA's mandate, and is established within the Agency's authorizing legislation. That legislation directs NASA to carry out a broad range of environmental observations and scientific investigations to learn the physics, chemistry, and biology of this planet. The Administration's objectives for NASA include advancing Earth science research as one of the three fundamental goals of the U.S. Space Program, as stated below: 1. (1) To advance U.S. scientific leadership and the world's scientific knowledge of the solar system and the universe. 2. (2) To advance the role of man in space and preserve U.S. preeminence in critical aspects of manned space flight. 3. (3) To advance scientific knowledge of the Earth and its environment so as to understand and eventually predict both natural and human-induced global change and, thus, provide continuing benefits to humanity. Milestones include 4. Establishing a set of observing platforms of various sizes and capabilities to study the Earth system from space on a global scale and on a continuing basis. 5. Developing plans and options, in coordination with other appropriate Federal agency members of the Committee on Earth Sciences, to implement..."Mission to Planet Earth". Mission to Planet Earth will produce the understanding needed to predict changes in the Earth's environment. NASA and its interagency and international partners will place satellites carrying advanced sensors in strategic Earth orbits to gather multidisciplinary data. A sophisticated data system will process and archive an unprecedented amount of information about the Earth and how it works as a system. Increased understanding of the Earth system is a basic human responsibility, a prerequisite to informed management of the planet's resources and to the preservation of the global environment. The resulting technology and science will contribute to future solar system exploration as well. © 1991.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimation For An Oasis Area In The Heihe River Basin Using Landsat-8 Images And The Metric Model
AB  - The Heihe River Basin is the second largest inland river basin in arid northwestern China. Accurate estimation of regional evapotranspiration (ET) and its spatial distribution in the oasis area plays an important role for water resource management in the whole basin. The objective of this study was to estimate the temporal and spatial variations of ET for different land cover types in the oasis. To estimate ET values in the growing season of 2013, 14 Landsat-8 images of the study area were processed using the Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. A new approach selected hot extreme pixels separately for the desert and oasis sub-areas due to large differences in soil thermal characteristics. Results indicated large temporal-spatial variations in ET in the oasis. The largest ET values occurred over water bodies, followed by arable land, low-lying land and forest. The desert-oasis transition zones (shrubland, sparse forest, medium- and low-coverage grassland) had lower ET values, while the lowest ET values occurred in unused lands (salt meadows, sandy and Gobi deserts). Monthly ET values of all land cover types increased from April, peaked in July, before decreasing until October. Overall, METRIC can provide reasonable ET estimates in a heterogeneous land use types under advective environmental conditions with the selection of appropriate extreme pixels.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Mangroves And Estuarine Communities In Central Queensland, Australia
AB  - Great Barrier Reef catchments are under pressure from the effects of climate change, landscape modifications, and hydrology alterations. With the use of remote sensing datasets covering large areas, conventional methods of change detection can expose broad transitions, whereas workflows that excerpt data for time-series trends divulge more subtle transformations of land cover modification. Here, we combine both these approaches to investigate change and trends in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, that encompasses a national park and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. Nine information classes were compiled in a maximum likelihood post classification change analysis in 2004-2017. Mangroves decreased (1146 hectares), as was the case with estuarine wetland (1495 hectares), and saltmarsh grass (1546 hectares). The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2017 land cover maps were 85\%, 88\%, 88\%, 89\%, 81\%, and 92\%, respectively. The cumulative area of open forest, estuarine wetland, and saltmarsh grass (1628 hectares) was converted to pasture in a thematic change analysis showing the "from-to" change. We generated linear regression relationships to examine trends in pixel values across the time series. Our findings from a trend analysis showed a decreasing trend (p value range = 0.001-0.099) in the vegetation extent of open forest, fringing mangroves, estuarine wetlands, saltmarsh grass, and grazing areas, but this was inconsistent across the study site. Similar to reports from tropical regions elsewhere, saltmarsh grass is poorly represented in the national park. A severe tropical cyclone preceding the capture of the 2017 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image was likely the main driver for reduced areas of shoreline and stream vegetation. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on coastal ecosystem dynamics to enable planning to achieve more effective conservation outcomes.

TI  - Evaluating The Effects Of Limited Irrigation On Crop Water Productivity And Reducing Deep Groundwater Exploitation In The North China Plain Using An Agro-Hydrological Model: I. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis, Calibration And Model Validation
AB  - The agro-hydrological Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro-hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales. The reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors, as well as parameter calibration and model validation. In this study, we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the North China Plain (NCP). First, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the SWAP-WOFOST model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area. On this basis, the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values for soil water content, soil salt concentration, winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), winter wheat aboveground biomass, winter wheat yield, summer maize LAI, summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14.93\%, 27.20\%, 24.60\%, 25.27\%, 23.12\%, 24.55\%, 21.33\% and 17.94\%, respectively, during the calibration period; and the corresponding NRMSE values were 16.26\%, 29.36\%, 24.20\%, 22.75\%, 21.77\%, 22.03\%, 24.38\% and 18.62\%, respectively, during the validation period. The model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables. Furthermore, a distributed SWAP-WOFOST model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology, soil, crops, land use, water resources and administrative divisions, yielding 2809 simulation units. Finally, the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions. The results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values, and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision. In summary, the distributed SWAP-WOFOST model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Analysis Of The Mitigating Effects Of Industrial Relocation On The Surface Urban Heat Island Over China
AB  - Urbanization is typically accompanied by the relocation and reconstruction of industrial areas due to limited space and environmental requirements, particularly in the case of a capital city. Shougang Group, one of the largest steel mill operators in China, was relocated from Beijing to Hebei Province. To study the thermal environmental changes at the Shougang industrial site before and after relocation, four Landsat images (from 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016) were used to calculate the land surface temperature (LST). Using the urban heat island ratio index (URI), we compared the LST values for the four images of the investigated area. Following the relocation of Shougang Group, the URI values decreased from 0.55 in 2005 to 0.21 in 2016, indicating that the surface urban heat island effect in the area was greatly mitigated; we infer that this effect was related to steel production. This study shows that the use of Landsat images to assess industrial thermal pollution is feasible. Accurate and rapid extraction of thermal pollution data by remote sensing offers great potential for the management of industrial pollution sources and distribution, and for technical support in urban planning departments.

TI  - Shotgun Metagenomes From Productive Lakes In An Urban Region Of Sweden
AB  - Urban lakes provide multiple benefits to society while influencing life quality. Moreover, lakes and their microbiomes are sentinels of anthropogenic impact and can be used for natural resource management and planning. Here, we release original metagenomic data from several well-characterized and anthropogenically impacted eutrophic lakes in the vicinity of Stockholm (Sweden). Our goal was to collect representative microbial community samples and use shotgun sequencing to provide a broad view on microbial diversity of productive urban lakes. Our dataset has an emphasis on Lake Mälaren as a major drinking water reservoir under anthropogenic impact. This dataset includes short-read sequence data and metagenome assemblies from each of 17 samples collected from eutrophic lakes near the greater Stockholm area. We used genome-resolved metagenomics and obtained 2378 metagenome assembled genomes that de-replicated into 514 species representative genomes. This dataset adds new datapoints to previously sequenced lakes and it includes the first sequenced set of metagenomes from Lake Mälaren. Our dataset serves as a baseline for future monitoring of drinking water reservoirs and urban lakes. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Evaluation Of The Swat Model For The Simulation Of Flow And Water Balance Based On Orbital Data In A Poorly Monitored Basin In The Brazilian Amazon
AB  - The Amazon basin, the world’s largest river basin, is a key global climate regulator. Due to the lack of an extensive network of gauging stations, this basin remains poorly monitored, hindering the management of its water resources. Due to the vast extension of the Amazon basin, hydrological modeling is the only viable approach to monitor its current status. Here, we used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a process-based and time-continuous eco-hydrological model, to simulate streamflow and hydrologic water balance in an Amazonian watershed where only a few gauging stations (the Jari River Basin) are available. SWAT inputs consisted of reanalysis data based on orbital remote sensing. The calibration and validation of the SWAT model indicated a good agreement according to Nash-Sutcliffe (NS, 0.85 and 0.89), Standard Deviation Ratio (RSR, 0.39 and 0.33), and Percent Bias (PBIAS, −9.5 and −0.6) values. Overall, the model satisfactorily simulated water flow and balance characteristics, such as evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and groundwater. The SWAT model is suitable for tropical river basin management and scenario simulations of environmental changes. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - How Well Do Gridded Precipitation And Actual Evapotranspiration Products Represent The Key Water Balance Components In The Nile Basin?
AB  - Study region: Nile Basin, Africa. Study focus: The accurate representation of precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) patterns is crucial for water resources management, yet there remains a high spatial and temporal variability among gridded products, particularly over data-scarce regions. We evaluated the performance of eleven state-of-the-art P products and seven ETa products over the Nile Basin using a four-step procedure: (i) P products were evaluated at the monthly scale through a point-to-pixel approach; (ii) streamflow was modelled using the Random Forest machine learning technique, and simulated for well-performing catchments for 2009-2018 (to correspond with ETa product availability); (iii) ETa products were evaluated at the multiannual scale using the water balance method; and (iv) the ability of the best-performing P and ETa products to represent monthly variations in terrestrial water storage (Delta TWS) was assessed through a comparison with GRACE Level-3 data. New hydrological insights for the region: CHIRPSv2 was the best-performing P product (median monthly KGE' of 0.80) and PMLv2 and WaPORv2.1 the best-performing ETa products over the majority of the evaluated catchments. The application of the water balance using these best-performing products captures the seasonality of Delta TWS well over the White Nile Basin, but overestimates seasonality over the Blue Nile Basin. Our study demonstrates how gridded P and ETa products can be evaluated over extremely data-scarce conditions using an easily transferable methodology.

TI  - Xco2 Temporal Variability Above Brazilian Agroecosystems: A Remote Sensing Approach
AB  - Agriculture and soil management practices are closely related to CO2 emissions in crop fields. These practices directly interfere on the carbon dynamics between the land and atmosphere. In this study, we investigated the temporal variability of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric CO2 (xCO2), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in areas with the main agroecosystems in southern-central Brazil as a way to understand if and how crops cycle and agricultural management could be associated with the temporal variability of NDVI, SIF and xCO2. The study was carried out in areas corresponding to the three agroecosystems’: sugarcane (Pradópolis, State of São Paulo, Brazil), cropland with soybean-corn succession (Santo Antônio do Paraíso, State of Paraná, Brazil), and grassland (Águas Claras, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil). Air temperature, precipitation, NDVI, and SIF and xCO2 were retrieved from NASA-POWER, NASA-GIOVANNI, SATVeg-EMBRAPA, and OCO-2, respectively, during a two-year study. Trends were removed from the NDVI, SIF, and xCO2 time series applying the regression method. A negative correlation between SIF and xCO2 was found in sugarcane and cropland areas, but in grasslands, no correlation showed up. Higher SIF values were observed in grassland (2.24 W m−2 sr−1 μm−1), and lower xCO2 values were observed above grains, which varied from 396.8 to 404.2 ppm. Both xCO2 and SIF followed more a seasonal pattern in sugarcane and annual crops, but over pasture this presented an unusual pattern related to higher precipitation events. Our results indicate a potential use of SIF and xCO2 which could help identifying potential sources and sinks of the main additional greenhouse gas over agricultural areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Application Of Remotely Sensed Sea Surface Temperature For Assessment Of Recurrent Coral Bleaching (2014-2019) Impact On A Marginal Coral Ecosystem
AB  - The 2014-2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused a prolonged marine heatwave that led to widespread coral bleaching and mortality across the Indo-pacific coral reefs. Prediction of coral bleaching and assessment of bleaching impact on corals is vital for reef ecosystem functioning, services and management. Wherein, advanced satellite remote sensing approach to determine and quantify the thermal stress on corals can assist as an alternative and convenient tool for reef monitoring programs. The present study examines the impact of consecutive coral bleaching episodes on shallow-water marginalized patch reef ecosystems on the Eastern Arabian Sea. Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch's (NOAA-CRW) platform, known as CoralTemp, were used to analyze the thermal stress on the coral reefs. Coral bleaching indices like Bleaching Threshold (BT), Positive Anomaly (PA), and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) were calculated. Ground-truthing revealed that detected thermal stress from satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data over this region well corroborate with the mass coral bleaching events, and found reliable for detecting coral bleaching episodes in the marginalized turbid coral habitats. This study signifies the potential benefit of incorporating remote sensed SST data in coral bleaching monitoring program, which may guide to undertake targeted coral surveys and aid in decision-making and conservation of the vulnerable coral reef ecosystems.

TI  - The Estimation Of Building Carbon Emission Using Nighttime Light Images: A Comparative Study At Various Spatial Scales
AB  - As one of the fundamental sectors to measure the carbon emission levels in a certain region, building carbon emission plays an important role in determining low-carbon development plans. Most of the carbon emission estimation research mainly focuses on the establishment of bottom-up GHG inventory and the implication of policy-driven approaches, there are still many theoretical gaps in the usage of remote sensing data to predict building carbon emission. This paper presents a comprehensive study to discuss the performance of different regression models using various open nighttime light (NTL) data sources. The Noord Brabant province was employed as a case study to verify the feasibility of using different estimation models at various spatial scales (city-level, district-level, and neighborhood-level). Among all regression models, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been proven to better reflect the relationship between building carbon emissions and the NTL index. For practical applications, the carbon intensity (CI) and annual nighttime light index (ANLI) are a pair of optimal sets to establish a reliable estimation model. It exhibits higher utility value at the city-level due to the fewer interferences caused by non-building lighting sources. The results of this comparative study provide a new reference to support the establishment of carbon inventory. By illustrating the differences among various estimation models, the applicable scope of using open remote sensing data to estimate building carbon emissions can be further defined. The conclusion may provide more detailed instructions during the process of developing low-carbon cities. © 2023

TI  - Tree Invasions: Patterns, Processes, Challenges And Opportunities
AB  - Tree invasions have escalated in importance in the last few decades (more species, greater area invaded, more types of impacts, increasing complexity of management challenges), and are increasingly studied from many perspectives. This research spans many disciplines, including ecology, population biology, genetics, remote sensing, ecological modelling, risk analysis, resource economics and, increasingly, the humanities. There has been substantial progress in understanding patterns and processes, but many unanswered questions remain. Only a few invasive trees have been well studied, many of them in only a small part of their invasive range. Invasive trees often have substantial impacts, especially when they invade formerly treeless vegetation. Trees have several features that make them useful for understanding key aspects of biological invasions (the determinants of invasiveness and invasibility), but also the full spectrum of human perceptions and values that frames biological invasions as an environmental problem. This editorial provides background and summarizes the main outputs from a workshop held in Argentina in September 2012 that set out to summarize current knowledge on key topics and to determine the most important challenges facing researchers and managers. The sixteen papers in the special issue of Biological Invasions span disciplines, geographic regions and taxa and provide novel insights on pathways and historical perspectives, detection and monitoring, determinants of invasiveness, function and impact, and the many challenges that face managers.

TI  - Mapping Aquaculture Ponds For The Coastal Zone Of Asia With Sentinel-1 And Sentinel-2 Time Series
AB  - Asia dominates the world's aquaculture sector, generating almost 90 percent of its total annual global production. Fish, shrimp, and mollusks are mainly farmed in land-based pond aquaculture systems and serve as a primary protein source for millions of people. The total production and area occupied for pond aquaculture has expanded rapidly in coastal regions in Asia since the early 1990s. The growth of aquaculture was mainly boosted by an increasing demand for fish and seafood from a growing world population. The aquaculture sector generates income and employment, contributes to food security, and has become a billion-dollar industry with high socio-economic value, but has also led to severe environmental degradation. In this regard, geospatial information on aquaculture can support the management of this growing food sector for the sustainable development of coastal ecosystems, resources, and human health. With free and open access to the rapidly growing volume of data from the Copernicus Sentinel missions as well as machine learning algorithms and cloud computing services, we extracted coastal aquaculture at a continental scale. We present a multi-sensor approach that utilizes Earth observation time series data for the mapping of pond aquaculture within the entire Asian coastal zone, defined as the onshore area up to 200 km from the coastline. In this research, we developed an object-based framework to detect and extract aquaculture at a single-pond level based on temporal features derived from high-spatial-resolution SAR and optical satellite data acquired from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. In a second step, we performed spatial and statistical data analyses of the Earth-observation-derived aquaculture dataset to investigate spatial distribution and identify production hotspots at various administrative units at regional, national, and sub-national scale.

TI  - The Management Of The World, Nature And Society: Vision Of The Environmental Conflict From The Conception And Management Of The Natural Environment Of A Colombian Indigenous Community
AB  - With the objective to generate an approach to the management of the indigenous world of a community from the Colombian Amazon trapeze and the environmental conflict generated by the interaction of Western territorial logics and indigenous logics when it comes to the management and use of natural resources of the area, an environmental characterization of the territory from inter-subjective processes of achieved consensus, environmental maps, social actors and soils obtained from an ethnographic methodology through social mapping analysis was conducted. As a result, seven maps were obtained with GPS (Garmin 62sc with submetric precision) through 685 geo-referenced points in an area of 3,410 hectares which were verified with satellite images obtained from Google Earth, as well as with the coordinate system MAGNA SIRGAS and ellipsoidal coordinates WGS 84 with flat coordinates GAUSS-KRUGER whose cartographic plans were digitized in closed polygons in ArcGIS. Likewise, a matrix of social actors along with maps to form an approach to the different areas of the community that represent values of use (edible, medicinal and commercial), and to the generation of possible strategies for sustainable conservation outside unsustainable preservationist frames for indigenous communities was obtained. It is concluded that, to discuss about environmental sustainability, the territory must be viewed as an essential support for the reproduction of culture. In this sense, the territory and the natural resources demonstrate the need to generate meeting spaces for environmental entities and indigenous communities by knowing the resources and identifying areas to characterize the sustainability of the territory and trends of the community development. © 2017 Universidad de Caldas.

TI  - Agro In Uruguay: Ground Rent, Labor Income, And Profit
AB  - Since 2002, the agriculture and livestock sector in Uruguay has undergone an intense transformation in the context of high commodities prices and rising foreign investment. This research studied an as-of-yet unaddressed dimension of these changes concerning their impact on income distribution to contribute to the recent literature on these matters. The distribution of income by source of remuneration (labor income, profit, and ground rent) and social class, including the State, in the period 2000-2015, was analyzed. The results show that landholders were the group whose appropriation of value increased the most. The total wage bill grew slightly, and state participation held steady in both the value of agriculture and livestock and ground rent. © 2017 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones Económicas

TI  - The Effect Of Habitat Degradation On The Long Term Survival Of The Critically Endangered Madagascar Spider Tortoise (Pyxis Arachnoides)
AB  - Pyxis arachnoides inhabits the dry, coastal forests of southwest Madagascar; a biologically unique ecoregion severely threatened by unsustainable small scale agricultural practices. Using remotely sensed data we established vegetation loss remains unabated within our study area at 1.2\% year(-1); consistent with ecoregion wide vegetation loss between 1990 and 2000. We monitored tortoise population density on four occasions over 8 years and developed a stage class projection matrix to model the finite growth rate, matrix sensitivities and elasticities of the population. Monitoring revealed an actual mean population decline of 10.8\% between 2003 and 2011. Our projection matrix model suggested the finite rate of growth to be lambda = 0.986, indicative of 1.4\% year(-1) decline for the duration of the existence of the population, with adult survival as the most sensitive parameter to overall survival of the population. Projection modeling suggests that the population would possibly become functionally non viable in approximately 170 years. As our study was heavily reliant on the use of surrogate data, more information is needed on pre-adult survival and wild reproductive rates. Our study site currently represents a population of exceptional density, therefore, other less dense populations, subjected to the further stresses of poaching will likely become functionally non viable much sooner. This study highlights the utility of population projection matrices in determining the vulnerability of chelonians; a globally threatened taxon. In the case of the spider tortoise, well coordinated development programs and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers forcing this species closer to extinction.

TI  - Effects Of Urbanization On Vegetation Degradation In The Yangtze River Delta Of China: Assessment Based On Spot-Vgt Ndvi
AB  - Rapid urbanization has generated great pressure on natural resources. This research paper illustrates the utility of linking socioeconomic and remotely sensed imagery in order to investigate the interaction between ecological and socioeconomic processes within the context of urban growth. The approach focuses on the vegetation degradation index (VDI) developed from time series SPOT-VGT NDVI, the nommlized difference vegetation index based on vegetation data provided by the vegetation sensor onboard the SPOT satellites. The VDI value of each square kilometer pixel has been calculated to depict spatial pattern of vegetation degradation, which are then aggregated into the city level. In terms of urbanization, 13 factors have been chosen and valued from statistics books and vector digital maps. With the sample set of 50 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region of China, spearman correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis have been adopted to investigate the causal relationships between urbanization and vegetation degradation. The findings are as follows: First, three hot-spot areas in vegetation degradation have been identified, which are spatially correlated with urban land expansion. The composite index of VDI has been manifested as an effective tool for assessing vegetation degradation. Second, economic and demographic variables, rather than the urban land expansion variables, have been verified to be the determinant factors for vegetation degradation. The rise of GDP growth rate, population growth or GDP per capita has significantly deepened regional vegetation degradation. Third and finally, the distinctively local findings that incomplete urbanization and idling cropland have probably increased vegetation degradation rates are worth noting. Although further studies are required for probing into detailed mechanisms and universality, the specific findings may provide a reference to similar studies, and should be quite useful for policy makers.

TI  - Image Classification And Land Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Imagery: Optimization Of Svm Parameters
AB  - Land use/cover (LU/LC) classification provides proxies of the natural and social processes related to urban development, providing stakeholders with crucial information. Remotely sensed images combined with supervised classification are common to define land use, but high-performance classifiers remain difficult to achieve, due to the presence of model hyperparameters. Conventional approaches rely on manual adjustment, which is time consuming and often unsatisfying. Therefore, the goal of this study has been to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for the generation of land use/cover maps from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in selected humid and arid (three study sites each) climatic regions of Iran. For supervised SVM classification, we optimized two important parameters (gamma in kernel function and penalty parameter) of the LU/LC classification. Using the radial basis function (RBF) of the SVM classification method, we examined seven values for both parameters ranging from 0.001 to 1000. For both climate types, the penalty parameters (PP) showed a direct relationship with overall accuracy (OA). Statistical results confirmed that in humid study regions, LU/LC maps produced with a penalty parameter >100 were more accurate. However, for regions with arid climates, LU/LC maps with a penalty parameter >0.1 were more accurate. Mapping accuracy for both climate types was sensitive to the penalty parameter. In contrast, variations of the gamma values in the kernel function had no effect on the accuracy of the LU/LC maps in either of the climate zones. These new findings on SVM image classification are directly applicable to LU/LC for planning and environmental and natural resource management.

TI  - Earth Observation-Based Approach For Delineating Geomorphology-Guided Geoenvironmental Zones And Its Utility In Regional Planning: An Analysis In Parts Of Bengal Basin, West Bengal, India
AB  - In this paper, we have analysed active and passive earth observation data for identifying the different geomorphic sub-provinces associated with coastal and fluvial geomorphic processes in the south-western part of Bengal Basin. For this purpose, variations in the spectral response of these sub-provinces in IRS P6 LISS III data are enhanced using principal component (PC) and independent component (IC) methods to spatially delineate the geomorphic sub-provinces and associated Quaternary sediments. It has been observed that the false colour composite derived using IC (first, second and third ICs) are effective in enhancing fluvial sub-provinces, while IC band 4, band 3 and band 2 are suitable to delineate coastal sub-provinces. On the other hand, PC composite derived using band 4, band 3 and band 1 are suitable to delineate different Quaternary sediments deposited within the spatial extent of geomorphic sub-provinces. Fused image enhanced products of IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite) LISS III band and ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) polarisation bands are used to supplement and complement the variations observed for each geomorphic province in optical data as radar interactions are sensitive to variation in moisture and surface cover. Although there is a strong synergy between the spatial extent of geomorphic sub-provinces and the Quaternary units in terms of spatial disposition, different Quaternary units are also found within the same geomorphic province. Therefore, we have segmented each geomorphic sub-provinces based on the spatial extent of the different Quaternary deposits to identify few geoenvironmental (termed here as geomorpho-environmental) zones. In this regard, eleven zones are identified. Each zone has been characterised based on geomorphic stability, potentiality for agriculture practice, scope for urban development and reclamation. These geoenvironmental zones may provide important input to planners.

TI  - Seasonal Variations Of Daytime Land Surface Temperature And Their Underlying Drivers Over Wuhan, China
AB  - Rapid urbanization greatly alters land surface vegetation cover and heat distribution, leading to the development of the urban heat island (UHI) effect and seriously affecting the healthy development of cities and the comfort of living. As an indicator of urban health and livability, monitoring the distribution of land surface temperature (LST) and discovering its main impacting factors are receiving increasing attention in the effort to develop cities more sustainably. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution patterns of LST of the city of Wuhan, China, from 2013 to 2019. We detected hot and cold poles in four seasons through clustering and outlier analysis (based on Anselin local Moran's I) of LST. Furthermore, we introduced the geographical detector model to quantify the impact of six physical and socio-economic factors, including the digital elevation model (DEM), index-based built-up index (IBI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the LST distribution of Wuhan. Finally, to identify the influence of land cover on temperature, the LST of croplands, woodlands, grasslands, and built-up areas was analyzed. The results showed that low temperatures are mainly distributed over water and woodland areas, followed by grasslands; high temperatures are mainly concentrated over built-up areas. The maximum temperature difference between land covers occurs in spring and summer, while this difference can be ignored in winter. MNDWI, IBI, and NDVI are the key driving factors of the thermal values change in Wuhan, especially of their interaction. We found that the temperature of water area and urban green space (woodlands and grasslands) tends to be 5.4 degrees C and 2.6 degrees C lower than that of built-up areas. Our research results can contribute to the urban planning and urban greening of Wuhan and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the city.

TI  - Dynamics Of Total Suspended Solid Concentrations In The Lower Raidak River (Himalayan Foreland Basin), India
AB  - Accurate assessment of total suspended solids (TSS) is one of the most important parameters for the management of health of aquatic ecosystem. Due to the limitation of traditional TSS measurement methods, recently developed remote sensing based algorithm (Wen algorithm) has been used to measure the TSS concentration in a Himalayan foothill river like Raidak. Additionally, to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of total suspended solids (TSS), total three consecutive years (2019, 2020 and 2021) along with different seasons have been selected. The Nechad algorithm has been used to validate the recalibrated algorithm. The result also indicates that Wen algorithm is also highly consistent with the Nechad algorithm (R2 value is greater than 0.90). It is also estimated that the concentration of TSS becomes very high particularly in monsoon months (242 mg/l, 270 mg/l and 246 mg/l for the year 2019, 2020 and 2021). The Raidak river catchment is located in the foothill zone of the lofty Himalayan range and the region is totally influenced by Indian summer monsoon. In the Raidak river course, the seasonal sediment flux is highly correlated with rainfall, stream flow, cross sectional area and high anthropogenic stress. The NDTI (Normalize Difference Turbidity Index) value (Turbidity) is greater in monsoon season than pre and post monsoonal periods (0.035, 0.0851 and 0.0201 for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively). ANOVA result shows a significant difference among the TSS values in different years (p=<0.05). (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Of Extremes In Conus With Radar Data
AB  - Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale, long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern United States. Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event, such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term, high-resolution precipitation data set.

TI  - Effect Of Satellite Based Rainfall Products On River Basin Responses Of Runoff Simulation On Flood Event
AB  - Physically-based distributed hydrological modelling, Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model is used to evaluate runoff accuracy by using six satellite based rainfall products such as GPM, GSMaP, TRMM 3B42V7, CMORPH, and PERSIANN. These products input to drive the model on the Nan River basin, Thailand that is the watershed of 13,000 km(2). The performance of the precipitation products, rainfall depth and runoff, was evaluated from storm event on 2014 by using statistical approach, Volume bias, Peak bias, RMSE, Correlation, and Mean bias, to compare with observation data. Overall of the satellite based products, the CMORPH and GPM performed the best that was provided by the statistical values, comparing with average observed rainfall data. For the runoff estimated from GPM closed to the observed data and was better than other five products, satellite and rain gauge, to provide the high correlation and small RMSE value. This study presents the uncertainty of satellites that have a potential for runoff estimation to apply for water resources management.

TI  - Ecological Vulnerability Assessment Of A China's Representative Mining City Based On Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
AB  - Mining cities are clusters of communities that specialized in mining and extractive industries. The extensive mining activities in these cities have stimulated widespread and substantial ecological stresses to the surrounding environment, that significantly jeopardize the health condition of vegetation and human. Given the recent recognition of remote sensing in monitoring large-scale environmental change, we incorporated Ziyuan \#1-02D, a recently released hyperspectral remote sensing data, into the ecological vulnerability assessment framework, using Panzhihua city as a case study, which is recognized as one of the most representative mining cities in China. The multi-spectral imaging data was widely applied in previous research. However, with the wide bands, multi-spectral imaging data cannot depict detailed characteristics of spectral targeted. As a result, we introduce indexes from the hyperspectral imaging to ecological vulnerability assessment proposed in this study, which can depict and monitor the growth and restoration of vegetation more accurately. We used the optimum index factor method to select bands from the satellite-based Ziyuan \#1-02D data for quantifying vegetation indexes and red edge. Besides, we obtained inventory data, land-use, soil type, and typography of Panzhihua city to reconstruct its ecological vulnerability index (EVI) for 2020 and 2021. Comparing to the multi-spectral data, the ecological vulnerability results from hyperspectral imaging performed better in precision and concentration in EVI values, reaching the conclusions more directly. Specifically, the mining area and the relevant hazard types and impact areas were delineated through intensive fieldwork. Results suggested that the east and west districts, and north of Renhe district suffer great ecological stress, in which we observed intensive coal and metal-related mining in-dustry. The central region, which occupies vanadium titanomagnetite mines, also shows substantial ecological issues, while the other mining industries, such as granite ore did not significantly influence the local environ-ment. Although the newly released satellite-based data only have two-year periods, we still observed improving ecological conditions, with the southeast and west regions showing much lower ecological vulnerability values. The spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested that the high-high clustering region of EVI is located in the east, west, and Renhe districts, primarily due to the mining industries of variations scales. We also found that the clustering of low ecological vulnerable regions, mostly surrounds the vanadium titanomagnetite excavation industry, thanks to the local restoration projects.

TI  - A Comparative Evaluation Of Arid Inflow-Dependent Vegetation Maps Derived From Landsat Top-Of-Atmosphere And Surface Reflectances
AB  - In remote sensing, it is commonly accepted that land remote-sensing satellite (LANDSAT) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance is less accurate than atmospheric correction (AC) reflectance, as the former is not calibrated for possible modifications in the electromagnetic radiation signals due to atmospheric scattering and absorption. This article investigates whether LANDSAT data calibrated for TOA reflectance are an appropriate information source for delineating inflow-dependent vegetation (IDV) in regions with an arid and desert climate, such as the Pilbara region in Western Australia. Knowledge of where IDVs are in the landscape underpins planning their protection and define the baseline for their monitoring when water resource management options are considered. The appropriateness of TOA calibration for the delineation of IDV in the Pilbara was assessed through its comparison with IDV maps derived from AC reflectance. Both radiometric calibration methods (TOA and AC) were applied to a multi-date LANDSAT 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) dataset of 10 images acquired in 2009 and 2010. Two methods based on the application of remote-sensing techniques to identify the extent of temporally invariant vegetation were applied for IDV delineation in the study area. The first method, groundwater-dependent ecosystems mapping (GEM), employs a two-date normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset for identifying 'no-change' clusters of land cover and detecting those related to IDV. The second method applies principal component analysis (PCA) to a multi-date NDVI dataset. The first principal component (PC1) typically contains features that remain unchanged over time. This includes vegetation with continuous or frequent access to surface and/or groundwater, such as IDV. To delineate the extent of IDV, a thresholding technique was further employed. Spatial similarity between IDV maps produced from TOA and AC reflectance was quantitatively evaluated by the Kappa coefficient. The results showed that TOA and AC IDV maps are in 'almost perfect' agreement with the Kappa values above 0.83. This suggests that TOA reflectance is equally appropriate to AC reflectance for mapping in arid and desert climate such as in Pilbara. When the GEM- and PCA-based methods are applied in other study areas with arid or desert climate, the accuracy of the delineated IDV extent may vary. Therefore, the results need to be validated using ground-truth information about known IDV occurrences in the area of interest.

TI  - Irrigation And Agrometeorology: Innovative Remote Sensing Applications In Crop Monitoring
AB  - A major part of the developed global water resources is used for food production. Irrigation is an obvious option to increase and stabilize crop production. Major investments were made in irrigation during the latter half of the 20th century by diverting the surface water and extracting groundwater. Under irrigated farming, irrigation can be planned using data regarding the consecutive periods of rainfall to satisfy the demands for critical phenological stages. With water resources becoming scarce, waters of inferior quality are increasingly used. Defining strategies in planning and management of available water resources in the agricultural sector have become a national and global priority. Equally significant is the agrometeorological information, which plays a major role in evolving strategies for improving the water use efficiency. Weather/climate data should be adopted for crop monitoring in order to maintain the arms’ profitability and sustainability. A short-range weather forecast (up to a lead time of 5days) would be of significant value to farmers, particularly in surface irrigation. This value comes from advantages, such as better ability to manage waterlogging, particularly in surface irrigation; better ability to manage soil moisture and plant stress; better time management of sprays for disease and pest control; water use savings and the associated cost savings. Remote sensing applications in crop monitoring are presented, whic include image processing methodology, study areas and databases, estimation of irrigation requirements, followed by analysis and discussion of results. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Saeid Eslamian and Faezeh Eslamian; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - Adequacy Of Satellite-Derived Precipitation Estimate For Hydrological Modeling In Vietnam Basins
AB  - This study evaluates eight Satellite-derived Precipitation Estimate (SPE) datasets, which include uncorrected SPE and gauge-corrected SPE products from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP), and Precipitation Estimation form Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN). These datasets are utilized with six representative river basins, corresponding to six sub-climate zones in Vietnam, during the period 2002–2017. The evaluations were carried out in two parts: 1) inter-comparison of the SPE products with rain gauges, for the six basins; 2) comparison of streamflow simulations, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) forced by precipitation from rain gauge and SPE products. The results indicated that the gauge-corrected SPE datasets exhibited slightly better over the uncorrected datasets in comparison with rain gauges, but showed much higher performances as inputs in hydrological simulations. The GPM Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final run version 06B (GPM IMERGF-V6) exhibited the best overall performances among SPE products, in comparison with the rain gauges for the simulation of streamflow. This study is the first of its kind to validate GPM IMERG products in Vietnam, indicating the strong capability of the new IMERG retrieval algorithms. The CHIRP with stations (CHIRPS) dataset demonstrates a relatively low bias, could benefit long-term water resources planning for droughts. In monthly streamflow simulations, the SPE-driven simulations outperformed rain gauge-driven simulations in a larger basin (North West Region), which has low rain-gauge density. The results of this study could be a guide to determine the suitability of different SPE products for hydrological simulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Inversion Of Lake Bathymetry Through Integrating Multi-Temporal Landsat And Icesat Imagery
AB  - Lake bathymetry provides valuable information for lake basin planning and treatment, lake watershed erosion and siltation management, water resource planning, and environmental protection. Lake bathymetry has been surveyed with sounding techniques, including single-beam and multi-beam sonar sounding, and unmanned ship sounding. Although these techniques have high accuracy, most of them require long survey cycles and entail a high degree of difficulty. On the contrary, optical remote sensing inversion methods are easy to implement, but tend to provide less accurate bathymetry measures, especially when applied to turbid waters. The present study, therefore, aims to improve the accuracy of bathymetry measurements through integrating Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite's Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) data, and water level data measured at hydrological stations. First, the boundaries of a lake at multiple dates were derived using water extraction, initial boundary extraction, and Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) strip removal processing techniques. Second, ICESat/GLAS data were introduced to obtain additional topographic information of a lake. The striped topography of a lake's area was then obtained through eliminating and correcting erroneous points and interpolating the values of unknown points. Third, the entire bathymetry of the lake was obtained through interpolating water level values of lake boundary points in various dates. Experiments show that accurate bathymetry (+/- 1 m) can be successfully derived.

TI  - Measuring The Involvement Of Companies In Prevention: Setting A Conceptual Framework
AB  - The European Survey of Enterprises on New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) has shown that preventive action in the workplace is often perceived as a regulatory constraint. The economic and health benefits of prevention are poorly documented and leave the way open for a dominant negative perception of efforts to be devoted to health and well-being at work as leading to unproductive expenditure. The aim of this article is to characterize as best as possible the degree of involvement of enterprises in prevention. The methodology used is based both on a literature review of available tools and a qualitative study conducted in 2018 in France. This study was carried out through semi-directive telephone interviews with 5 occupational physicians, 5 human resources managers and 5 staff representatives. The results of the interviews made it possible to identify the main dimensions to be documented in a quantitative questionnaire which, in the long term, would serve as a basis for constructing a prevention involvement score. These dimensions cover compliance with legal obligations, the quality of social dialogue, the place of occupational health in the management of the company, and the existence of resources dedicated to prevention. © 2021 The Authors; L'Enquête européenne des entreprises sur les risques nouveaux et émergents (ESENER) a montré que les actions préventives sur le lieu de travail sont souvent perçues comme une contrainte réglementaire. Les avantages économiques et sanitaires de la prévention sont mal documentés et laissent la voie libre à une perception négative dominante des efforts à consacrer à la santé et au bien-être au travail comme entraînant des dépenses improductives. L'objectif de cet article est de caractériser au mieux le degré d'implication des entreprises en prévention. La méthodologie utilisée repose à la fois sur une revue de littérature des outils disponibles et d'une étude qualitative conduite en 2018 en France. Cette étude a été réalisée grâce à des entretiens téléphoniques semi-directifs auprès de 5 médecins du travail, 5 DRH et 5 représentants du personnel. Les résultats des entretiens ont permis d'identifier les principales dimensions à documenter dans un questionnaire quantitatif qui, à terme servirait de base de construction d'un score d'implication en prévention. Ces dimensions recouvrent le respect des obligations légales, la qualité du dialogue social, la place de la santé au travail dans la gestion de l'entreprise, et l'existence de moyens dédiés à la prévention. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Modelling And Mapping The Intra-Urban Spatial Distribution Of Plasmodium Falciparum Parasite Rate Using Very-High-Resolution Satellite Derived Indicators
AB  - Background: The rapid and often uncontrolled rural-urban migration in Sub-Saharan Africa is transforming urban landscapes expected to provide shelter for more than 50% of Africa's population by 2030. Consequently, the burden of malaria is increasingly affecting the urban population, while socio-economic inequalities within the urban settings are intensified. Few studies, relying mostly on moderate to high resolution datasets and standard predictive variables such as building and vegetation density, have tackled the topic of modeling intra-urban malaria at the city extent. In this research, we investigate the contribution of very-high-resolution satellite-derived land-use, land-cover and population information for modeling the spatial distribution of urban malaria prevalence across large spatial extents. As case studies, we apply our methods to two Sub-Saharan African cities, Kampala and Dar es Salaam. Methods: Openly accessible land-cover, land-use, population and OpenStreetMap data were employed to spatially model Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate standardized to the age group 2-10 years (PfPR2-10) in the two cities through the use of a Random Forest (RF) regressor. The RF models integrated physical and socio-economic information to predict PfPR2-10 across the urban landscape. Intra-urban population distribution maps were used to adjust the estimates according to the underlying population. Results: The results suggest that the spatial distribution of PfPR2-10 in both cities is diverse and highly variable across the urban fabric. Dense informal settlements exhibit a positive relationship with PfPR2-10 and hotspots of malaria prevalence were found near suitable vector breeding sites such as wetlands, marshes and riparian vegetation. In both cities, there is a clear separation of higher risk in informal settlements and lower risk in the more affluent neighborhoods. Additionally, areas associated with urban agriculture exhibit higher malaria prevalence values. Conclusions: The outcome of this research highlights that populations living in informal settlements show higher malaria prevalence compared to those in planned residential neighborhoods. This is due to (i) increased human exposure to vectors, (ii) increased vector density and (iii) a reduced capacity to cope with malaria burden. Since informal settlements are rapidly expanding every year and often house large parts of the urban population, this emphasizes the need for systematic and consistent malaria surveys in such areas. Finally, this study demonstrates the importance of remote sensing as an epidemiological tool for mapping urban malaria variations at large spatial extents, and for promoting evidence-based policy making and control efforts. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Differentiation Characteristics Of Land Ecological Quality And Its Obstacle Factors In The Typical Compound Area Of Mine Agriculture Urban
AB  - Mining activity combines industrialization, urbanization, and urban-rural integration in the compound area of mine agriculture urban. The land ecological environment has become a major hidden problem, restricting the sustainable development and ecological security of the region. It is imminent to understand the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of land ecological quality and its obstacle factors to scientifically carry out land ecological restoration. Here, the Macun coal area in Jiaozuo City, Central China, was selected for the case study, and an evaluation index system including four criteria layers of ecological foundation, structure, benefit, and stress was established. The multiperiod evaluation index data were acquired by utilizing remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technology. Based on the multi-objective comprehensive evaluation method, a comprehensive evaluation of land ecological quality was conducted, and the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of land ecological quality were explored. Moreover, an obstacle factor diagnosis model was constructed to confirm the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of obstacle factors affecting the change of the land ecological quality in the study zone. The results showed the following: (1) From 1980 to 2020, the land ecological quality index in the study zone showed a downward trend, and the proportion of the regional area with general and poor land ecological quality increased from 6.55\% to 35.02\%. (2) The areas with lower land ecological quality in each period of the study zone were mainly distributed in the mining areas with long mining history in the west and the areas with continuous urbanization and industrialization in the south. In contrast, the compound area of mine agriculture urban with short mining history in the east and southeast had higher land ecological quality. The aggregation of the land ecological quality index also showed similar spatial distribution characteristics. (3) The diagnosis results of obstacle factors showed that, due to the poor land ecological foundation and interference of mining activities, the land ecological quality of the mountain area in the north and west of the study area has been low. It is suggested that the land ecological quality of the area should be improved through measures such as terrain regulation, soil reconstruction, afforestation, and forest land conservation. Under the influence of mining activities and the continuous promotion of urbanization in the south of the study area, the regional ecological quality has been reduced. It is suggested that the regional land ecological quality should be improved by building ecological agriculture and ecological communities. The northeast of the study area is still in the mining area, and the ecological quality of the land tends to deteriorate. The ecological restoration in this area should be conducted by the combination of pre-mining planning, while-mining control, and post-mining restoration. The methodology of this study can provide reference for the identification and restoration of land ecological problems in the compound area of mine agriculture urban.

TI  - Establishment Of Sea-Land Vertical Datum Transformation For Hydrography Combining With Geoid, Sea Surface Topography And Numerical Simulation Of Tidal Wave Motion In The Yangtze Estuarine Waters
AB  - Objectives: The research on topography and landform of the Yangtze estuarine waters is of great significance to human social and economic activities such as river management, river construction and water transportation. Establishing an accurate and seamless chart datum and its transformation model with other vertical datums will directly affect the acquisition of high-precision topographic and geomorphic data at the water⁃land junctions and the unified comprehensive management and analysis. Thus, this paper studies the establishment of seamless chart datum and its transformation model with other vertical datums for estuarine waters, combining with geoid, sea surface topography and three-dimensional numerical simulation of tidal wave motion. Methods: Firstly, the unstructured⁃grid, finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) was used to simulate tidal level and calculate the tidal range at each grid node with the underwater topographic data and the open boundary water level forcing data. According to the correlation between tidal range and chart datum, the chart datum value of each grid node was deduced using tidal range ratios from tide gauge stations with known datums, and a regional seamless chart datum was then established. Secondly, the mean sea surface topography corresponding to a long time scale at each grid node was calculated with the daily sea surface topography product provided by the Copernicus marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS). The mean sea surface topography model was further established by the minimum curvature interpolation. Meanwhile, the geoid in the corresponding area was calculated by the global ultra-high-order gravity field model Earth gravitational model 2008 (EGM2008) with a spatial resolution of 5' × 5'. Thirdly, the geoid model was established through bi-quadratic interpolation. Finally, according to these three constructed models and the geometric relationship of three kinds of vertical datums in space, unification to a consistent spatial resolution was performed and the separation value between chart datum and the ellipsoid reference datum at each grid node was calculated. The vertical datum transformation model between the seamless chart datum and ellipsoid reference datum was established by the minimum curvature interpolation. Results: Using this method, we carried out the experiment at the typical estuarine waters, south branch of the Yangtze Estuary, and established the seamless chart datum and its vertical datum transformation model. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) leveling data from three long-term tide gauge stations were used for verification and accuracy evaluation of the model. The results show that the absolute errors of the vertical datum transformation model at these three long-term tide gauge stations were-19.8 cm, -25.8 cm and-27.0 cm respectively, which were all higher than the evaluated error (12.4 cm) of the model. The main reason is that the Yangtze estuarine waters have complicated tidal wave characteristics and they are nearshore waters, which leads to poor accuracy of the mean sea surface topography model in this region, thus further reducing the accuracy of the transformation model as a whole. Despite this, the accuracy of the transformation model still meets the requirements of International Hydrographic Organization standards for hydrographic surveys.Conclusions: Therefore, the research method of this paper are feasible and reliable, especially in far-sea areas. When the accuracy of satellite altimetry is further improved in the nearshore areas, the proposed method in this paper can be extended to nearshore and inland waters. © 2022, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

TI  - Estimating Malaria Burden Among Pregnant Women Using Data From Antenatal Care Centres In Tanzania: A Population-Based Study
AB  - Background: More timely estimates of malaria prevalence are needed to inform optimal control strategies and measure progress. Since 2014, Tanzania has implemented nationwide malaria screening for all pregnant women within the antenatal care system. We aimed to compare malaria test results during antenatal care to two population-based prevalence surveys in Tanzanian children aged 6–59 months to examine their potential in measuring malaria trends and progress towards elimination. Methods: Malaria test results from pregnant women screened at their first antenatal care visits at health-care facilities (private and public) in all 184 districts of Tanzania between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017, were collected from the Health Management Information Systems and District Health Information System 2. We excluded facilities with no recorded antenatal care attendees during the time period. We standardised results to account for testing uptake and weighted them by the timing of two population-based surveys of childhood malaria prevalence done in 2015–16 (Demographic and Health Survey) and 2017 (Malaria Indicator Survey). We assessed regional-level correlation using Spearman's coefficient and assessed the consistency of monthly district-level prevalence ranking using Kendall's correlation coefficient. Findings: Correlation between malaria prevalence at antenatal care and among children younger than 5 years was high (r≥0·83 for both surveys), although declines in prevalence at antenatal care were generally smaller than among children. Consistent heterogeneity (p<0·05) in antenatal care prevalence at the district level was evident in all but one region (Kilimanjaro). Data from antenatal care showed declining prevalence in three regions (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara) where surveys estimated zero prevalence. Interpretation: Routine antenatal care-based screening can be used to assess heterogeneity in transmission at finer resolution than population-based surveys, and provides sample sizes powered to detect changes, notably in areas of low transmission where surveys lack power. Declines in prevalence at antenatal care might lag behind those among children, highlighting the value of monitoring burden and continuing prevention efforts among pregnant women as transmission declines. The pregnancy-specific benefits and cost-effectiveness of antenatal care-based screening remain to be assessed. Funding: None. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Exploring Groundwater Quality Assessment: A Geostatistical And Integrated Water Quality Indices Perspective
AB  - Groundwater is an important source of freshwater. At the same time, anthropogenic activities, in particular, industrialization, urbanization, population growth, and excessive application of fertilizers, are some of the major reasons for groundwater quality deterioration. Therefore, the present study is conducted to evaluate groundwater quality by using integrated water quality indices and a geospatial approach to identify the different water quality zones and propose management strategies for the improvement of groundwater quality. Groundwater quality was evaluated through the physicochemical parameters (pH, chloride (Cl−), fluoride(F−), iron (Fe−2), nitrate (NO3−1), nitrite (NO2), arsenic (As), total hardness, bicarbonate (HCO3−), calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), color, taste, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS)) and microbiological parameters including total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli of samples collected from the water and sanitation agency (WASA) and urban units. Irrigation parameters crucial to the assessment, including (electrical conductivity (EC), residual sodium carbonates (RSC), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)), were also collected at more than 1100 sites within the study area of upper and central Punjab. After collecting the data of physicochemical parameters, the analysis of data was initiated to compute the water quality index for groundwater quality, a four-step protocol in which the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine the weights of selected parameters by generating a pairwise matrix, on the relative importance of parameters using the Satty scale. The index was then classified into five classes for quality assessment of drinking water (excellent, good, medium, bad, and very bad) and four classes for irrigation water quality assessment (excellent, good, permissible, and unsuitable). After computing the index values for drinking as well as irrigation purposes, the values were interpolated, and various maps were developed to identify the status of groundwater quality in different zones of the study area. Mitigation strategies for water pollution involve source control, such as monitoring industrial discharge points and managing waste properly. Additionally, treating wastewater through primary, secondary, or tertiary stages significantly improves water quality, reducing contaminants like heavy metals, microbiological agents, and chemical ions, safeguarding water resources. The findings highlight significant regional variations in water quality issues, with heavy metal concerns concentrated notably in Lahore and widespread emerging microbiological contamination across all studied divisions. This suggests a systemic problem linked to untreated industrial effluents and poorly managed sewerage systems. The computed indices for the Lahore, Sargodha, and Rawalpindi divisions indicate water quality ranging from marginal to unfit, underscoring the urgency for remediation. Conversely, other divisions fall within a medium class, potentially suitable for drinking purposes. Notably, microbiological contamination at 27% poses a major challenge for water supply agencies, emphasizing the critical need for pre-disposal primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments. These treatments could potentially rehabilitate 9%, 35%, and 41% of the study area, respectively, pointing toward tangible, scalable solutions critical for safeguarding broader water resources and public health. With the current pace of water quality deterioration, access to drinking water is a major problem for the public. The government should prioritize implementing strict monitoring mechanisms for industrial effluent discharge, emphasizing proper waste management to curb groundwater contamination. Establishing comprehensive pre-disposal treatments, especially primary, secondary, and tertiary stages, is imperative to address the prevalent heavy metal and microbiological issues, potentially rehabilitating up to 41% of affected areas. Additionally, creating proactive policies and allocating resources or sustainable groundwater management are crucial steps for ensuring broader water resource security and public health in the face of deteriorating water quality. Therefore, urgent regional action is needed to address escalating anthropogenic threats to groundwater, emphasizing the crucial need for proactive measures to safeguard public health and ensure sustainable water resources. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Toward An Integrated Assessment Of The Impacts Of Extreme Wind Events On Barrow, Alaska
AB  - Warming of the arctic climate is having a substantial impact on the Alaskan North Slope coastal region. The warming is associated with increasing amounts of open water in the arctic seas, rising sea level, and thawing permafrost Coastal geography and increasing development along the coastline are contributing to increased vulnerability of infrastructure, utilities, and supplies of food and gasoline to storms, flooding, and coastal erosion. Secondary impacts of coastal flooding may include harm to animals and their land or sea habitats, if pollutants are released. Further, Inupiat subsistence harvesting of marine sources of food, offshore resource extraction, and marine transportation may be affected. This paper describes a project to understand, support, and enhance the local decision-making process on the North Slope of Alaska on socioeconomic issues that are influenced by warming, climate variability, and extreme weather events.

TI  - Landscape Transformation Through The Use Of Ecological And Socioeconomic Indicators In Xishuangbanna, Southwest China, Mekong Region
AB  - Rapid land-use transformations are occurring throughout the Mekong Region, and especially in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province in southwest China. Most of this is due to the spread of monoculture rubber plantations. Using a new map derived from Landsat and RapidEye imagery tracking the spread of rubber from 1992 to 2010 in combination with a literature review and interviews with key local experts and officials, we performed a general overview of the extent, causes and consequences of landscape transformation in Xishuangbanna. We discovered that structural and functional biodiversity has been reduced, habitat fragmentation has increased,,carbon sequestration in natural forests has been reduced, and hydrological systems altered. For humans, while incomes have risen, food insecurity has also grown. The drivers of these changes are regional economic integration, government policy, and conservation vs development value systems. To improve land-use management, we surveyed the availability of ecological and socioeconomic indicators that may better track such changes. We found that combining both types of indicators within a multi-scale conservation planning framework would help to inform policy making in the region. As yet, however, there is little integrative research using indicators to track changes in ecosystems and human livelihoods in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Approach For Gis-Based Statistical Landslide Susceptibility Zonation - With A Case Study In The Himalayas
AB  - Landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) is necessary for disaster management and planning development activities in mountainous regions. A number of methods, viz. landslide distribution, qualitative, statistical and distribution-free analyses have been used for the LSZ studies and they are again briefly reviewed here. In this work, two methods, the Information Value (InfoVal) and the Landslide Nominal Susceptibility Factor (LNSF) methods that are based on bivariate statistical analysis have been applied for LSZ mapping in a part of the Himalayas. Relevant thematic maps representing various factors (e.g., slope, aspect, relative relief, lithology, buffer zones along thrusts, faults and lineaments, drainage density and landcover) that are related to landslide activity, have been generated using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The LSZ derived from the LNSF method, has been compared with that produced from the InfoVal method and the result shows a more realistic LSZ map from the LNSF method which appears to conform to the heterogeneity of the terrain.

TI  - Unseen Sentinels: Local Monitoring And Control In Conservation’s Blind Spots
AB  - Although official on-the-ground environmental monitoring is absent over much of the world, many people living in these regions observe, manage, and protect their environment. The autonomous monitoring processes associated with these activities are seldom documented and appear poorly recognized by conservation professionals. We identified monitoring activities in three villages in the Mamberamo-Foja region (Mamberamo Regency) of Papua (Indonesian New Guinea). In each village we found evidence that local monitoring contributes to effective protection and deters unregulated exploitation. Although everyone gathers observations and shares information, there are also specific roles. For example, the Ijabait hereditary guardians live at strategic sites where they control access to resource-rich lakes and tributaries along the Tariku River. Often, monitoring is combined with and thus influences other activities: for example, hunting regularly includes areas judged vulnerable to incursions by neighboring communities. We identified various examples of community members intervening to prevent and deter outsiders from exploiting resources within their territories. Enforcement of rules and assessment of resource status also help prevent local overexploitation within the communities. Clearly, local people are effective in protecting large areas in a relatively natural state. We discuss the value of these autonomous monitoring and protection processes, their neglect, and the need for explicit recognition by those concerned about these people and their environments, as well as about conservation. We highlight a potential “tragedy of the unseen sentinels” when effective local protection is undermined not because these local systems are invisible, but because no one recognizes what they see. © 2015 by the author(s).

TI  - Oceanographic Anomalies And Sea-Level Rise Drive Mangroves Inland In The Pacific Coast Of Mexico
AB  - Question: Although mangrove forests are generally regarded as highly threatened, some studies have shown that mangrove canopies in the Pacific coast of Mexico have been increasing in recent decades. We investigated the possible causes driving this reported mangrove expansion. Location: The mangrove lagoons of Magdalena Bay in Baja California, Mexico. Methods: We used 50-year-old aerial photographs and 24-year-old satellite images to compare long-term vegetation change, surveyed a coastal vegetation transect to analyse flooding levels, compiled six decades of tidal and oceanographic information, as well as hurricane data to analyse changes in storm frequency or sea-level conditions, and used isotopic analysis to date the age of trees along the gradient. Results: A significant increase in mangrove cover has occurred in backwaters of the lagoons during the last 40 years, and especially during the El Nino anomalies of the 1980s and 1990s, while at the same time the mangrove fringe has been receding. Conclusions: The observed change can be attributed to the combined action of the warm surface waters of El Nino events and sea-level rise. Jointly, these two effects are sufficient to flood large areas of previously non-flooded salt flats, dispersing mangrove seedlings inland. The inland expansion of mangroves, however, does not ease conservation concerns, as it is the seaward fringes, and not the inland margins, that provide the most valuable environmental services for fisheries and coastal protection.

TI  - Assessment Of Land Surface Temperature Variations And Implications Of Land Use/Land Cover Changes: A Case Of Malappuram Urban Agglomeration Region, Kerala, India
AB  - Urbanization is taking place faster, and urban air temperatures are gradually rising in all cities across the world. Uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization leads to constant environmental threats and can alter local and regional climates. According to the survey published by Economist Intelligence Unit, in India, Keralas Malappuram district ranks first among the fastest-growing urban areas globally, with a 44.05\% growth rate. Hence, the present study aims to identify the hotspot regions of extreme heat within the Malappuram urban agglomeration region and suggest strategies for its improvement. The split-window algorithm retrieved land surface temperature (LST) for 1991, 1998, 2014, and 2020 using Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 satellite imageries. A rising trend in LST has been detected in the last 30 years, and the mean value has increased by 1.70 \& DEG;C within the region. Among the selected hotspots, an LST increase of 1.84 \& DEG;C was observed for those areas with the highest increase in urban density with decreased vegetation. The increasing impact of urbanization and the subsequent change in land use patterns at the cost of greenery have caused a substantial effect on the local climate. Accordingly, planning and policy directions are proposed for the local government that can help provide awareness to the people through the effective implementation of mitigation measures.

TI  - Post-Tsunami Land Degradation On A South Asian Island: Implications For Conservation Priorities
AB  - In recent decades, land degradation has accelerated due to an increase in unsustainable human activities. In a case-study of the Andaman Islands, located in the South Asian region, changes in land degradation types, soil erosion, and the effect of conservation measures for pre- (2000) and post-2004 tsunami periods (2006, 2019) were recorded using temporal remote sensing data (LANDSAT, RESOURCESAT, CARTOSAT), field observations and a GIS-based revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The results showed that erosion, leaching, acidification, salinization, and drainage congestion were the major land degradation processes that could be traced to post-tsunami human activities (R-2 = 0.634). The study revealed significant forest cover loss during 2006-2019 (3.76\%) compared to 2000-2006 (0.61\%), while it revealed increased areas under settlement (14 km(2)) and mining (22 km(2)). The annual crop area exhibited a 0.42\% loss, whereas the plantation crop area increased by 0.46\%, indicating the abandonment of annual crops that resulted in an increased fallow area (21 km(2)) during the post-tsunami period. As a consequence, degraded land increased by 2.5\% of the total geographical area which was affaected by water erosion (2.3\%) and chemical degradation (0.25\%). The average erosion rate varied from 0.7 to 108 t ha(-1)yr(-1) in 2000 but increased by 47\% during the post-tsunami period due to mining, settlement, and vegetable cultivation on slopes, as indicated by high cover management, support practice, and slope length factors. Practicing suitable conservation measures can provide a conservation benefit of 105,560 t yr(-1) and a reduction in other forms of degradation without compromising the food production area.

TI  - A Place-Oriented, Mixed-Level Regionalization Method For Constructing Geographic Areas In Health Data Dissemination And Analysis
AB  - Similar geographic areas often have great variations in population size. In health data management and analysis, it is desirable to obtain regions of comparable population by decomposing areas of large population (to gain more spatial variability) and merging areas of small population (to mask privacy of data). Based on the Peano curve algorithm and modified scale-space clustering, this research proposes a mixed-level regionalization (MLR) method to construct geographic areas with comparable population. The method accounts for spatial connectivity and compactness, attributive homogeneity, and exogenous criteria such as minimum (and approximately equal) population or disease counts. A case study using Louisiana cancer data illustrates the MLR method and its strengths and limitations. A major benefit of the method is that most upper level geographic boundaries can be preserved to increase familiarity of constructed areas. Therefore, the MLR method is more human-oriented and place-based than computer-oriented and space-based.

TI  - Investigation On Water Productivity Of Winter Wheat Based On Modis And Sebal In The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain
AB  - Understanding how the crop water productivity can be increased is widely accepted to be a high priority where water resources are currently scarce and/or over-exploited in China. As the primary data source, MODIS remote sensing, statistics, meteorological data, crop growth period data and ground truth-data from Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2012 were used in actual evapotranspiration estimation, yields rasterizing, and water productivity calculation for winter wheat in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain(3H Plain). The statistical data for wheat yield was synthesized to calculate district-state-level land productivity, which is then further extrapolated to pixel-level values using a MODIS NDVI image, based on a crop dominance map. Spatial variation of crop water productivity was investigated in order to reveal the key factors of crop water productivity. In addition, the relationship between water productivity and actual evapotranspiration and in subsequence yield for winter wheat was discussed in 3H Plain. The main results indicated that the SEBAL is suitable for estimating evapotranspiration in winter wheat based on the comparison with the evapotranspiration measured by Yucheng (in Shandong province). The regional average value of water productivity for winter wheat was detected to be 1. 21kgm-3, with the higher value in Beijing, Tianjin, north part of Shandong province and south part of Hebei province. The pronounced relationship of spatial correlation of the yield and water productivity for winter wheat indicated that the increasing yield governed the increment of water productivity for winter wheat in the coastal land-farming-fishing area (zone1), low plain-hydropenia irrigable land and dry land zone (zone2) and basin-irrigable land and dry land (zone5). Whereas, the increasing water productivity for winter wheat was recognized to be controlled by rather the increment of yield than the reduction of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for winter wheat in the piedmont plain-irrigable land (zone2). Furthermore, the pronounced relationship of negative correlation of water productivity and ETa for winter wheat described that only the reduction of ETa was responsible for the increment of water productivity for winter wheat in hill-wet hot paddy-paddy field (zone6). The results is expected to provide a basis information for agricultural water management, improvements of crop water productivity and choice of adaptive mechanism under climate change in Huang-Huai-Hai plain. © 2016 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

TI  - A Reliable Gis-Based Fahp-Ftopsis Model To Prioritize Urban Water Supply Management Scenarios: A Case Study In Semi-Arid Climate
AB  - The growing problem of urban water shortage and its sustainable management methods is one of today's critical research needs globally. This paper applies an integration of the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) with the help of triangular fuzzy sets to manage urban water supply priorities in a semi-arid region. Hence, a group decision-making approach was proposed by combining the Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) and the Fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) models based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. Therefore, a hierarchical model-based GIS and AHP was developed to classify the effective criteria and determine the Importance Weights (IWs) of criteria according to the experts’ opinions and using data layers based on spatial criteria. The priority ranking of scenarios was obtained using the FTOPSIS method. Different criteria such as environmental, geographical, geological, economic, climatic, and social conditions were considered in this study. Furthermore, to assess the water supply scenarios under the essential water demands of the basin cities and suburbs, a hydrologic model utilizing WEAP software was designed. Among the considered criteria, total expense, climatic conditions, and geographic conditions with the IWs values of 0.9, 0.85, and 0.83 were determined as the most effective criteria for evaluating the scenarios' ranking, respectively. © 2022

TI  - Ecological Drivers Of Selection For Remnant Forest Habitats By An Insectivorous Bat In A Tropical, Human-Modified Landscape
AB  - Biodiversity conservation outside protected areas reduces the impacts of anthropogenic activity and improves the benefits of ecosystem services. However, conservation also requires identification and preservation of habitats used by organisms in human-modified landscapes. Since such landscapes are heterogeneous, with fragmented habitats, space use decisions of species are expected to be non-random and dependent on resource distribution. We examined habitat selection by an insectivorous bat, Megaderma spasma in a human-modified landscape, and tested whether insect resources in the habitat drive its selection. Using high-resolution satellite imagery, we classified a 36 km2 area of a biodiversity hotspot in Western Ghats, India, into three major habitat categories: forest, plantation, and open habitat. We then tracked 18 bats across an average of 7.33 ± 3 days using radio telemetry and sampled insect resources in forests and plantations. Compositional analysis suggested that Megaderma spasma showed selection for forest habitats. Mixed-effects conditional logistic regression showed that the odds of bats using forest habitats was on average 5.87 times higher than open habitats. Apportionment analysis of insects trapped in forests and plantations showed that habitat type contributed only 0.4% of the difference in diversity at the insect order level, suggesting that insect resources did not differ between the two habitats. However, the relative abundance of one of the bat's prey (katydids of the genus Mecopoda) was significantly higher in forest habitats than in plantations, suggesting that prey abundance in forests may drive the bat's habitat selection. Remnant forest habitats are important resources for insectivorous bats and need to be preserved for maintaining ecosystem functions in human-modified landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Carbon Biomass Estimation Using Vegetation Indices In Agriculture-Pasture Mosaics In The Brazilian Caatinga Dry Tropical Forest
AB  - Remote sensing is valuable for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) stocks. However, its application in agricultural and pasture areas is limited compared with forest areas. This study quantifies AGB in agriculture-pasture mosaics within Brazil's Campo Maior Complex (CMC). The methodology employs remote sensing cloud processing and utilizes an estimator to incorporate vegetation indices. The results reveal significant changes in biomass values among land use and land cover classes over the past ten years, with notable variations observed in forest plantation, pasture, sugar cane, and soybean areas. The estimated AGB values range from 0 to 20 Mg.ha-1 (minimum), 53 to 419 Mg.ha-1 (maximum), and 19 to 57 Mg.ha-1 (mean). In Forest formation areas, AGB values range from approximately 0 to 278 Mg.ha-1, with an average annual value of 56.44 Mg.ha-1. This study provides valuable insights for rural landowners and government officials in managing the semiarid territory and environment. It aids in decision making regarding agricultural management, irrigation and fertilization practices, agricultural productivity, land use and land cover changes, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, conservation strategies, the identification of priority areas for environmental restoration, and the optimization of resource utilization.

TI  - Assessment Of Climate Change Impacts On Sea Surface Temperatures And Sea Level Rise-The Arabian Gulf
AB  - The Arabian Gulf is one of the regions in the world experiencing major changes due to increased economic growth rates and development practices. As a shallow water body within a hot desert, the Gulf is exposed to obvious warming in the sea surface temperatures (SST). Remotely sensed SST data were utilized to estimate decadal change in SST with a focus on coral reef locations. There is a positive trend in monthly time series SSTs, with a maximum value of about 0.7 degrees C/decade for the western side of the Gulf. This high trend of SST is associated with significant coral reef bleaching and it coincides with major climate/ocean interactions. Most of the Arabian countries along the Gulf have coastal developments at low-land areas of high vulnerability to sea level rise. Digital elevation models showed that there are more than 3100 km(2) of coastal areas that occur at 1 m level along the Arabian countries of the Gulf. Coastal protection and conservation measures are crucial to protect low-lying coasts of urban use.

TI  - The Role Of Remote Sensing During A Global Disaster: Covid-19 Pandemic As Case Study
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery is used as a tool to aid decision makers and scientists in a variety of fields. A recent world event in which satellite imagery was extensively relied on by a variety of stakeholders was the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article we aim to give an overview of the types of information offered through remote sensing (RS) to help address different issues related to the pandemic. We also discuss about the stakeholders that benefited from the data, and the value added by its availability. The content is presented under four sub-sections; namely (1) the use of RS in real-time decision-making and strategic planning during the pandemic; how RS revealed the (2) environmental changes and (3) social and economic impacts caused by the pandemic. And (4) how RS informed our understanding of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for the pandemic. High resolution optical imagery offered updated on-the-ground data for e. g., humanitarian aid organizations, and informed operational decision making of shipping companies. Change in the intensity of air and water pollution after reduced anthropogenic activities around the world were captured by remote sensing - supplying concrete evidence that can help inform improved environmental policy. Several economic indicators were measured from satellite imagery, showing the spatiotemporal component of economic impacts caused by the global pandemic. Finally, satellite based meteorological data supported epidemiological studies of environmental disease determinants. The varied use of remote sensing during the COVID-19 pandemic affirms the value of this technology to society, especially in times of large-scale disasters.

TI  - Current Issues Of Agriculture Digitalization In The Russian Federation
AB  - The Chapter states that the information digital technology of the twenty-first century conceals an enormous potential of economic growth due to the automation and optimization of production processes, improvement of monitoring and control that enhance the manageability of both individual production and the entire economy. The implementation of digital projects in agriculture becomes an increasingly common trend in the whole world, including Russia. Digitalization includes such phenomena and technologies as big data, the Internet of Things, robotics, sensors, 3D printing, system integration, artificial intelligence, blockchains, etc., improving the quantity and quality of agricultural products and the logistics of their sale as well as increasing the social support of rural residents, reducing and easing their workload due to the production robotization. A range of foreign countries have created the necessary legal framework and launched the process of introducing digital technologies in agriculture, which has made it possible to achieve considerable success on this way also with regard to a significant increase in labor productivity. Digital systems in these countries have become important tools for managing risks in agriculture, helped to assess and eliminate them, and reduced the risks of production, weather, market, or climate variability. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation actively works in this area, having developed the departmental project “Digital Agriculture”. Its main goal is the digital transformation of agriculture by introducing digital technology and platform solutions to ensure a technological breakthrough in the agro-industrial complex and achieve the growth of productivity in “digital” agricultural enterprises. The implementation of the program of digital agriculture will lead to the achievement of the following results: automation of agricultural machinery, reduction of costs and demand for manual labor, remote satellite data and sensors will improve the accuracy and reduce the costs of the monitoring of crop growth and land and water quality. Tracking technologies and digital logistics services will optimize agricultural food supply chains and provide reliable information for consumers. However, to achieve the set goals, it is necessary to make amendments to the Federal Law “On Agriculture Development” specifying the incentives and benefits for developers and consumers of digital technology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Glo-Slam: A Slam System Optimally Combining Gps And Lidar Odometry
AB  - Purpose: Large-scale and precise three-dimensional (3D) map play an important role in autonomous driving and robot positioning. However, it is difficult to get accurate poses for mapping. On one hand, the global positioning system (GPS) data are not always reliable owing to multipath effect and poor satellite visibility in many urban environments. In another hand, the LiDAR-based odometry has accumulative errors. This paper aims to propose a novel simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system to obtain large-scale and precise 3D map. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed SLAM system optimally integrates the GPS data and a LiDAR odometry. In this system, two core algorithms are developed. To effectively verify reliability of the GPS data, VGL (the abbreviation of Verify GPS data with LiDAR data) algorithm is proposed and the points from LiDAR are used by the algorithm. To obtain accurate poses in GPS-denied areas, this paper proposes EG-LOAM algorithm, a LiDAR odometry with local optimization strategy to eliminate the accumulative errors by means of reliable GPS data. Findings: On the KITTI data set and the customized outdoor data set, the system is able to generate high-precision 3D map in both GPS-denied areas and areas covered by GPS. Meanwhile, the VGL algorithm is proved to be able to verify reliability of the GPS data with confidence and the EG-LOAM outperform the state-of-the-art baselines. Originality/value: A novel SLAM system is proposed to obtain large-scale and precise 3D map. To improve the robustness of the system, the VGL algorithm and the EG-LOAM are designed. The whole system as well as the two algorithms have a satisfactory performance in experiments. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Preferences Of Wyoming Residents For Siting Of Energy And Residential Development
AB  - Many communities are challenged with balancing growing demands for energy and residential development with the protection of places having cultural or biological importance. Incorporating the preferences and values of local residents early in decision-making processes through public participation GIS (PPGIS) data may help to limit land use conflicts. We used a PPGIS dataset from three counties in Wyoming to determine 1) if there are spatial relationships among mapped cultural or biological values and preferences for new energy or residential development that indicate compatibility or conflict and 2) if there is evidence of geographic discounting or a not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) pattern associated with development preferences. We found strong overlap, or compatibility, between mapped cultural and biological values and little or no overlap among mapped biological or cultural values and energy development siting preferences. These relationships could identify opportunities for conservation initiatives and inform siting of new developments. Where people live influenced their mapping patterns. Participants mapped perceived positive environmental conditions closer to home than negative conditions, demonstrating geographic discounting. We observed NIMBYism for wind development, as participants mapped wind preferences further from their homes than where development is anticipated. We also observed NIMBYism for residential development, but at a reduced spatial discounting rate compared to wind development. Participants mapped their preferences for oil and gas development further from home than existing or anticipated wells but tended to place them near a large oil and gas field, which may reflect a preference for concentrated development, rather than NIMBYism. We noted distinct preferences for contrasting values in different locations, and this consistency among participants shows that PPGIS datasets have potential to communicate a useful collective vision to inform development siting. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Cauchy Graph Embedding Optimization For Built-Up Areas Detection From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
AB  - Automatic built-up areas detection from remote sensing images has attracted considerable research interest, due to its crucial roles in various applications. As far as built-up areas detection, the corner density map to predict the presence of the built-up areas has been widely adopted, but the calculation is generally time-consuming. In addition, the density map is just segmented by a statistical threshold, resulting in that the accurate boundaries of the built-up areas are unachievable. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a novel built-up areas detection approach. Instead of pixel units, our approach takes the superpixel-based image partitions as the primary calculation units, which benefits to improve the computational efficiency and visual organization performance. Based on the superpixel-based units, this paper first proposes a sparse corner voting method for accelerating the production of corner density map. Then, Cauchy graph embedding optimization is presented to cope with the problem of segmenting the density map, which can preserve the well-defined boundaries of built-up areas. A diverse and representative test set including 2.1-m resolution ZY3 imagery, 2.0-m resolution GF1 imagery, 1.0-m resolution IKONOS imagery, and 0.61-m resolution QUICKBIRD imagery is collected. Experimental results on these test images show that our proposed approach is robust to sensor and resolution variation, and can outperform state-of-the-art approaches remarkably. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - An Image Contrast Enhancement Algorithm For Grayscale Images Using Particle Swarm Optimization
AB  - This paper addresses a contrast enhancement technique that combines classical contrast enhancement with an evolutionary approach. The central goal of this work is to increase the information content and enhance the details of an image using an adaptive gamma correction technique aided by particle swarm optimization. Gamma correction is a well established technique that preserves the mean brightness of an image that produces natural looking images by the choice of an optimal gamma value. Here, Swarm intelligence based particle swarm optimization is employed to estimate an optimal gamma value. In the proposed method, the edge and information content (entropy) are the parameters used to formulate the fitness function. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art of techniques in terms of Weighted Average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (WPSNR), Contrast, Homogeneity, Contrast Noise Ratio (CNR), and Measure of Enhancement (EME). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed particle swarm optimization based contrast enhancement method improves the overall image contrast and enriches the information present in the image. In comparison to other contrast enhancement techniques, the proposed method brings out the hidden details of an image and is more suitable for applications in satellite imaging and night vision. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Morphometric Analysis Of The Rawandoz River Basin, Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq
AB  - In this research detailed morphometric investigation of the Rawanduz river basin in the northeastern part of Erbil, Iraq has been made. The study area covers an approximately 977.68 km2. Digital Elevation Model data (DEM 12.5 m), Remote sensing and GIS methods were used for studying basin morphometric parameter such as linear, aerial, and relief aspects, as well as to delineate lineaments in the study area.The results reveal that there is an opposite correlation between stream order, stream number, and length of streams in the research region basin by R2 values (R2 = 0.77 and 0.73) which is good value depending on statistical analysis. Streams were also ordered, with a total of 6376 streams totaling 2376.4 km in length. The basin's elongation ratio (0.54), circulation ratio (0.45), and form factor (0.23) data suggested that it was semi-elongated to elongated in nature, with poor permeability material, high relief, steep slopes, and main drainage pattern types affected by lineaments and fracture traces. In the research region, the stream frequency value is 5.6 km2 which is a high value suggesting impermeable lithology and enhanced surface runoff in the basin area. The drainage density in the investigated area is 2.43 km-1. The Rawanduz river basin's high drainage density value (2.43 km-1) reveals a fine drainage texture value (38.77 km-3). This study will help decision-makers and local residents to benefit from the resources for the sustainable development of the basin area. © 2022, Union of Iraqi Geologists. All rights reserved.

TI  - How To Accurately Assess The Spatial Distribution Of Energy Co2 Emissions? Based On Poi And Npp-Viirs Comparison
AB  - Timely and accurately estimating the spatial distribution of CO2 emissions is crucial for formulating energy conservation and emission reduction policies. Although nighttime light data has been proved to be effective in estimating the spatial distribution of CO2 emissions, it cannot estimate the spatial distribution of different types of CO2 emissions (commercial CO2 emissions, residential CO2 emissions, light industry CO2 emissions, heavy industry CO2 emissions, and agricultural CO2 emissions). Based on the local adaptive method, this study com-pares the potential of POI data and NPP-VIIRS data for modeling different types of carbon emissions in China to analyze the spatial structure of carbon emissions within cities. The results showed that: (1) POI data is much more powerful and reliable than NPP-VIIRS data regarding monitoring ability at the suburbs and mountainous areas. (2) From the point of view of the estimation ability of different types of carbon emissions, in the com-mercial CO2 emissions and residential CO2 emissions, although the correlation coefficient between the estimation results of POI data and statistical data is not significantly improved compared with that of NPP-VIIRS data, the accuracy of the estimation results is significantly improved in terms of the spatial distribution; POI data has a significantly stronger ability to estimate industrial carbon emissions than nighttime light data. (3) From the spatial distribution structure of urban carbon emission, urban carbon emission presents a "V"-shaped distribu-tion, with two high-value areas located in the central urban area and the industrial zone in the suburbs. This study confirms that POI data is a potential and promising data source for accurately modeling different types of carbon emissions and will help support low-carbon city management and energy allocation optimization.

TI  - Becoming Homo Sapiens Sapiens: Mapping The Psycho-Cultural Transformation In The Anthropocene
AB  - If it is true that humans are about to leave behind the environmental conditions we have known for the 150,000–200,000 years of our species’ existence, then we are now changing the context in which we have evolved to date. This means Homo sapiens will have to co-evolve further with the climatic and environmental conditions it is creating through its planetary impact in the Anthropocene. Given the rapidity of the changes humans have set in motion, however, this next evolutionary phase may be cultural rather than biological, reflected in behaviors, practices, artifacts, institutions and underlying values and worldviews, and, therefore, psychological. Such a psycho-cultural transformation is frequently called for, but rarely explored in detail. This paper presents a model of psychological transformation from the fields of depth psychology and anthropology known as an archetypal death-rebirth process. Applied to a cultural transformation, the model offers a frame to interpret this time of unprecedented environmental and cultural endings. It gives purpose and meaning to the suffering involved in transformations and, crucially, offers hope through the vision of renewal. Its tripartite progression of severance, threshold, and reincorporation provides a map for navigating the terra quasi-incognita of this transformation that tells us what to expect and therefore how to respond. Finally, it offers an explication of how a transformation far more profound than changes in actions and policies may allow us to become the truly wise humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, our species’ name denotes we could be. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessment Of Surface Ozone Production In Qinghai, China With Satellite-Constrained Vocs And Nox Emissions
AB  - The implementation of the western development strategy of China and the migration of air pollutants from eastern China might lead to a rapid increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentrations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and an amplified role of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in ozone (O3) pollution. Qinghai province, situated on the northeast of the QTP, had fewer human activities compared to eastern China, while ozone pollution worsened over the years. To better capture recent emission trends and improve the accuracy of O3 simulation in Qinghai, this study proposed a top-down method, which combined the air quality modeling system RAMS-CMAQ, with formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns derived from TROPOMI as the constraints to improve the emission estimates of VOCs and NOx in July 2020, respectively. Through a series of sensitivity experiments, better quantified emission estimates of VOCs and NOx were obtained to be 1.33 and 0.34 Tg/yr, 2.5 and 2.1 times larger than the bottom-up ones. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the top-down method and satellite observations constraints in improving VOCs and NOx emission estimates, resulting in a reduction in the differences between the observed and modeled HCHO and NO2 columns to 0.7 and 0.2 × 1015 molec/cm2, respectively. As a result, the simulated maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations increased from 58.9 to 81.6 μg/m3, which were closer to observations (85.4 μg/m3), the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean error (NME) values of hourly O3 concentrations changed from −24.7 % to −2.9 % and from 29.9 % to 22.3 %, respectively. This study showed the potential of top-down estimates to aide in the development of emission scenarios, which were critical for accurately simulating the O3 pollution and pollution control policy studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Independent Component Analysis And Landsat 8 For Delineating Maximum Extent Of The 2013 Colorado Front Range Flood
AB  - Maximum flood extent-a key data need for disaster response and mitigation-is rarely quantified due to storm-related cloud cover and the low temporal resolution of optical sensors. While change detection approaches can circumvent these issues through the identification of inundated land and soil from post-flood imagery, their accuracy can suffer in the narrow and complex channels of increasingly developed and heterogeneous floodplains. This study explored the utility of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for addressing these challenges in the unprecedented 2013 Flood along the Colorado Front Range, USA. Pre- and post-flood images were composited and transformed with an ICA to identify change classes. Flooded pixels were extracted using image segmentation, and the resulting flood layer was refined with cloud and irrigated agricultural masks derived from the ICA. Visual assessment against aerial orthophotography showed close agreement with high water marks and scoured riverbanks, and a pixel-to-pixel validation with WorldView-2 imagery captured near peak flow yielded an overall accuracy of 87\% and Kappa of 0.73. Additional tests showed a twofold increase in flood class accuracy over the commonly used modified normalized water index. The approach was able to simultaneously distinguish flood-related water and soil moisture from pre-existing water bodies and other spectrally similar classes within the narrow and braided channels of the study site. This was accomplished without the use of post-processing smoothing operations, enabling the important preservation of nuanced inundation patterns. Although flooding beneath moderate and sparse riparian vegetation canopy was captured, dense vegetation cover and paved regions of the floodplain were main sources of omission error, and commission errors occurred primarily in pixels of mixed land use and along the flood edge. Nevertheless, the unsupervised nature of ICA, in conjunction with the global availability of Landsat imagery, offers a straightforward, robust, and flexible approach to flood mapping that requires no ancillary data for rapid implementation. Finally, the spatial layer of flood extent and a summary of impacts were provided for use in the region's ongoing hydrologic research and mitigation planning.

TI  - Living Under Ecosystem Degradation: Evidence From The Mangrove–Fishery Linkage In Indonesia
AB  - This study examines the impacts of ecosystem degradation on social welfare, focusing on the mangrove–fishery linkage in Indonesia. Using nationally representative household data combined with satellite information on spatiotemporal mangrove loss, the study finds that fishery households experienced a decline in annual income ranging from 5.3% to 9.8% in response to a 1% increase in mangrove loss in the region. Under the income shock, fishery households increased their labor input and decreased their non-food consumption; however, they continued being part of the fishery industry. Furthermore, according to a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the potential economic value of mangrove conservation, estimated in terms of fishery production reached 22,861 US$/hectare/year. This makes conservation substantially more cost-effective than alternative land uses, such as aquaculture and oil palm plantations. These findings highlight the need to support mangrove forest conservation to achieve sustainable development and ecosystem conservation. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - A Weighted Surveillance Approach For Detecting Chronic Wasting Disease Foci
AB  - A key component of wildlife disease surveillance is determining the spread and geographic extent of pathogens by monitoring for infected individuals in regions where cases have not been previously detected. A practical challenge of such surveillance is developing reliable, yet cost-effective, approaches that remain sustainable when monitoring needs are prolonged or continuous, or when resources to support these efforts are limited. In order to improve the efficiency of chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance in Colorado, United States, we developed a weighted surveillance system exploiting observed differences in CWD prevalence across demographic strata within infected mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations. We used field data to estimate sampling weights for individuals from eight demographic strata distinguished by differences in apparent health, sex, and age. In this system, individuals from a sample source with high prevalence and low inclusion probability (e.g., clinical CWD "suspects") received 2:10.3 times more weight than those from a source with low prevalence and high inclusion probability (e.g., apparently healthy, hunter-harvested individuals). We simulated use of this alternative surveillance system for a deer management unit in Colorado and evaluated the potential effects of using biased weights on the probability of failing to detect CWD and on relative surveillance costs. We found that this system should be transparent, cost-effective, and reasonably robust to the inadvertent use of biased weights. By implementing this, or a similar, weighted surveillance system, wildlife agencies should be able to maintain or improve current surveillance standards while, perhaps, collecting and examining fewer samples, thereby increasing the efficiency and costeffectiveness of ongoing CWD surveillance programs. © Wildlife Disease Association 2010.

TI  - Bamboo Forest Mapping In China Using The Dense Landsat 8 Image Archive And Google Earth Engine
AB  - It is of great significance to understand the extent and distribution of bamboo for its valuable ecological services and economic benefits. However, it is challenging to map bamboo using remote sensing images over a large area because of the similarity between bamboo and other vegetation types, the availability of clear optical images, huge workload of image processing, and sample collection. In this study, we use the Landsat 8 times series images archive to map bamboo forests in China via the Google Earth engine. Several spectral indices were calculated and used as classification features, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) and textural features of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). We found that the bamboo forest covered an area of 709.92 x 10(4) hectares, with the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang containing the largest area concentrations. The bamboo forest map was accurate and reliable with an average producer's accuracy of 89.97\%, user's accuracy of 78.45\% and kappa coefficient of 0.7789. In addition, bamboo was mainly distributed in forests with an elevation of 300-1200 m above sea level, average annual precipitation of 1200-1500 mm and average day land surface temperature of 19-25 degrees C. The NDMI is particularly useful in differentiating bamboo from other vegetation because of the clear difference in canopy moisture content, whilst NDVI and elevation are also helpful to improve the bamboo classification accuracy. The bamboo forest map will be helpful for bamboo forest industry planning and could be used for evaluating the ecological service of the bamboo forest.

TI  - Mineral Sector Technologies: Policy Implications For Developing Countries
AB  - Over the past 20 years the mining industry has been a leader in the conception and application of advanced technologies. New thinking about earth tectonics as well as advances in geophysics, geochemistry, remote sensing, data processing and communications permit more effective and accurate geological exploration. Mechanization, more durable materials and more powerful explosives, as well as computer aided mine design and management have led to substantial gains in productivity. Minerals processing has similarly seen significant technological advances including solvent extraction, electro‐winning of metal ores, bath smelting techniques, cyanide leach to produce gold, and bioleaching of sulphide and refractory ores. New technologies have dramatically improved mine health and safety as well as making possible control of water and air pollution. Improved communication and transport have stimulated competition and fostered the internationalization of mineral commodity prices. As these technologies are essentially market driven, developing countries should continue current efforts towards economic liberalization. Promoting investment in mining entails lifting many of the restrictions and taxes that can hinder efficient exploration and development. We examine some developments that have greatly increased the efficiency of exploration, mining and marketing. To obtain maximum benefit from many of these technologies requires governments to adopt a wide range of new policies which are examined in some detail. 1992 United Nations

TI  - Environmental Reporting And Accounting In Australia: Progress, Prospects And Research Priorities
AB  - Despite strong demand for information to support the sustainable use of Australia's natural resources and conserve environmental values and despite considerable effort and investment, nation-wide environmental data collection and analysis remains a substantially unmet challenge. We review progress in producing national environmental reports and accounts, identify challenges and opportunities, and analyse the potential role of research in addressing these. Australia's low and concentrated population density and the short history since European settlement contribute to the lack of environmental data. There are additional factors: highly diverse data requirements and standards, disagreement on information priorities, poorly measurable management objectives, lack of coordination, over-reliance on researchers and businesses for data collection, lack of business engagement, and short-term, project-based activities. New opportunities have arisen to overcome some of these challenges: enhanced monitoring networks, standardisation, data management and modelling, greater commitment to share and integrate data, community monitoring, increasing acceptance of environmental and sustainability indicators, and progress in environmental accounting practices. Successes in generating climate, water and greenhouse gas information appear to be attributable to an unambiguous data requirement, considerable investment, and legislative instruments that enhance data sharing and create a clearly defined role for operational agencies. Based on the analysis presented, we suggest six priorities for research: (1) common definitions and standards for information that address management objectives, (2) ecological measures that are scalable from local to national level, (3) promotion of long-term data collection and reporting by researchers, (4) efficient satellite and sensor network technologies and data analysis methods, (5) environmental modelling approaches that can reconcile multiple data sources, and (6) experimental accounting to pursue consistent, credible and relevant information structures and to identify new data requirements. Opportunities exist to make progress in each of these areas and help secure a more sustainable future. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - China’s Poverty Assessment And Analysis Under The Framework Of The Un Sdgs Based On Multisource Remote Sensing Data
AB  - Poverty has always been a global concern that has restricted human development. The first goal (SDG 1) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to eliminate all forms of poverty all over the world. The establishment of a scientific and effective localized SDG 1 evaluation and monitoring method is the key to achieving SDG 1. This paper proposes SDG 1 China district and county-level localization evaluation method based on multi-source remote sensing data for the United Nations Sustainable Development Framework. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of China’s poverty areas and their SDG 1 evaluation values in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 have been analyzed. Based on the SDGs global indicator framework, this paper first constructed SDG 1 China’s district and county localization indicator system and then extracted multidimensional feature factors from nighttime light images, land cover data, and digital elevation model data. Secondly, we establish SDG 1 China’s localized partial least squares estimation model and SDG 1 China’s localized machine learning estimation model. Finally, we analyze and verify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of China’s poverty areas and counties and their SDG 1 evaluation values. The results show that SDG 1 China’s district and county localization indicator system proposed in this study and SDG 1 China’s localized partial least squares estimation model can better reflect the poverty level of China’s districts and counties. The estimated model R 2 is 0.65, which can identify 72.77% of China’s national poverty counties. From 2012 to 2018, the spatial distribution pattern of SDG evaluation values in China’s districts and counties is that the SDG evaluation values gradually increase from western China to eastern China. In addition, the average SDG 1 evaluation value of China’s districts and counties increased by 23% from 2012 to 2018. This paper is oriented to the United Nations SDGs framework, explores the SDG 1 localized evaluation method of China’s districts and counties based on multisource remote sensing data, and provides a scientific and rapid regional poverty monitoring and evaluation program for the implementation of the 2030 agenda poverty alleviation goals. © 2022 Wuhan University.

TI  - Vegetation Indices In The Nutritional Diagnosis Of Hybrid Stands Of Eucalyptus Urophylla S. T. Blake
AB  - Remote sensing through band ratio techniques for nutritional monitoring of clonal eucalyptus plantations is essential to guarantee health and productivity, reducing costs of forestry enterprises. The objective was to apply vegetation indices from high resolution satellite images in the nutritional diagnosis of macronutrients in plantations of clonal hybrids of Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake. The study was carried out in 62 areas of six municipalities in the state of Bahia under cultivation of homogeneous eucalyptus plantations, aged between 1.3 and 1.8 years. The design was completely randomized with six treatments constituted by the rainfall regime (1000 to 1300 mm year-1 and 1300 to 1600 mm year-1) and soil types (class and texture). The nutritional diagnosis of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulfur (S) was performed from leaf analysis and determination of vegetation indices: normalized difference vegetation (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The evaluated areas have high vigor (NDVI > 0.70) and the highest values were observed in the rainy regions (1300 to 1600 mm year-1) (mean of 0.78). The NDWI index presents the highest correlation for the average levels of Ca and Mg. The NDVI, NDWI and SAVI indexes present a strong correlation with each other (-0.97 to 1.00) and can help in mapping vigor and consequently in eucalyptus productivity.

TI  - Deforestation And Forest Degradation As Measures Of Popa Mountain Park (Myanmar) Effectiveness
AB  - The effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) has often been measured by comparing deforestation or land cover loss before and after PA establishment or within and outside the PA. Such evaluations ignore forest degradation or the decline in quality of the ecological values of the forest. Landsat image processing and geographical information systems were used to study forest cover changes in and around Popa Mountain Park (central Myanmar). Deforestation inside the Park was lower than outside the Park, but forest degradation, namely the net area that changed from dense forest to open forest, within the Park had grown at rates exceeding those outside the Park. The effectiveness of the PA was overestimated by adopting deforestation as the only indicator of conservation effectiveness. Forest degradation studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2010.

TI  - Prairie Or Planted? Using Time-Series Ndvi To Determine Grassland Characteristics In Montana
AB  - Temperate grasslands are a highly threatened global biome. Complicating management and conservation strategy development, modern grasslands can be difficult to characterize across landscapes since they range from native and semi-native to completely non-native species compositions such as those found in heavily managed pastures. Similar to methods used to differentiate C3 and C4 grasses, we investigate the ability of using temporal variations in growth characteristics as an alternative pathway to predicting native versus introduced species composition across grassland landscapes. To do this, we conducted an exploratory analysis using a time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values as a measure of vegetation greenness with Landsat 5 TM imagery across a growing season and performed an unsupervised classification. Results from the classification were compared with field observation to determine if we can differentiate between native and introduced grassland types in the Northwest Glaciated Plains subecoregion of northeastern Montana. Our results indicated that we predicted grassland cover with 81\% accuracy within our 200 km(2) study area and 71\% accuracy in our 5000 km(2) secondary study area. Further extrapolation of our methodology, combined with the refinement of vegetation indices of time-series imagery, classification algorithms and the availability of data from planned Landsat and Sentinel missions, may provide the spatial detail necessary to improve grassland monitoring and rangeland management over large areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data To Support The Structural Monitoring Of Rc Buildings Affected By Ground Instability Phenomena
AB  - The building stock around the world is exposed to different types of natural actions such as earthquakes or landslides. Italy is one of the countries worldwide most affected by landslides. Mitigation of landslide risk is a topic of great interest with specific focusing on the assessment and management of their consequences. The periodical monitoring of ground instability phenomena and the field surveys for recognizing and identifying the landslide-induced damage on structures and infrastructures, require high costs due to the large amounts of exposed elements. As known from literature, slow-moving landslides can lead to a progressive damage over time. With respect to the Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures, these actions can affect primary structural elements, but more frequently damage occurs on the most vulnerable elements of the structure, such as infills. The aim of this work is to assess the potential utility of the data derived from a remote sensing technique, known as Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR), in order to support the structural health monitoring of RC buildings affected by slow-moving landslides. The paper shows the assessment of the structural behaviour of a RC infilled building through the years and with the progression of the damage, within a landslide affected area and monitored by using DInSAR data. The evidence of a visual survey made in 2015 was available, showing a significant damage pattern in some infill panels. A good agreement has been found between the analytical previsions and the existing damage pattern for the infills of which a visual survey existed, showing the potential use of the remote sensing technique data in order to make a structural assessment. Moreover, an overall analytical assessment of all infills' state of health has been presented, in order to have a complete picture of the damage situation.

TI  - Monin-Obukhov Length As A Cornerstone Of The Sebal Calculations Of Evapotranspiration
AB  - The paper looks at the pivotal role that the Monin-Obukhov length (L) can play within the sensible heat balance method for calculating evapotranspiration from remotely sensed multispectral data. It focuses on the possibility of using L as a cornerstone parameter for calculations of sensible heat flux from the pixel data. The paper shows that L can be separated from the other unknowns and can be found either by means of any general one-dimensional root finding method, or iteratively, starting with L similar or equal to -infinity. A simple algorithm is suggested to reduce the number of iterations. The paper goes on to show that all other output parameters can be calculated directly from the value of L that is established, and an analytical expression for the evaporative fraction found. A novel approach is proposed that allows a close approximation of the evaporative fraction to be derived directly without the need for time-consuming iterations within the main calculation step. Estimates of evapotranspiration from cotton in Southern Kazakhstan showed that the approximation performed well when compared with estimates of ETcrop made using an iterative approach. An experimental approach for calculating E-24 is described for use in areas with minimal. cloud cover. Comparison of SEBAL estimated Et-c with calculated Et-o for the short season cotton crop in Southern Kazakhstan indicated that for the actively transpiring cotton crop the crop factors were the same as those determined experimentally for low short season cotton in Kansas by Hunsaker {[}Hunsaker, D.J., 1999.

TI  - Impact And Prediction Of Pollutant On Mangrove And Carbon Stocks: A Machine Learning Study Based On Urban Remote Sensing Data
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have important ecological and economic values, especially their ability to store carbon. However, in recent years, human disturbance has accelerated mangrove degradation. Among them, the emission of pollutants cannot be ignored. It is of great significance for carbon emission reduction and ecological protection to study the impacts of different pollutants on mangroves and their carbon stocks. Based on the remote sensing data of coastal areas south of the Yangtze River in mainland China, this paper builds the ensemble learning model Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) to empirically analyse the relationship between industrial wastewater, industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2), PM2.5 and mangrove forests. The results show that the pollutant concentration of meteorological normalisation is more stable. The importance of pollutants presents regional heterogeneity. The area of mangroves in different cities and the corresponding total carbon stocks show different trends with the increase or decrease of pollutants, and there is a dynamic balance between urban pollutant discharge and mangrove growth in some cities. The research in this paper provides an analysis and explanation from the perspective of machine learning to explore the relationship between mangroves and pollutants and at the same time, provides scientific suggestions for the formulation of future pollutant emission policies in different cities. © 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University

TI  - Can We Improve Parametric Cyclonic Wind Fields Using Recent Satellite Remote Sensing Data?
AB  - Parametric cyclonic wind fields are widely used worldwide for insurance risk underwriting, coastal planning, and storm surge forecasts. They support high-stakes financial, development and emergency decisions. Yet, there is still no consensus on a potentially best parametric approach, nor guidance to choose among the great variety of published models. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that recent progress in estimating extreme surface wind speeds from satellite remote sensing now makes it possible to assess the performance of existing parametric models, and select a relevant one with greater objectivity. In particular, we show that the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission of NASA, along with the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), are able to capture a substantial part of the tropical cyclone structure, and to aid in characterizing the strengths and weaknesses of a number of parametric models. Our results suggest that none of the traditional empirical approaches are the best option in all cases. Rather, the choice of a parametric model depends on several criteria, such as cyclone intensity and the availability of wind radii information. The benefit of using satellite remote sensing data to select a relevant parametric model for a specific case study is tested here by simulating hurricane Maria (2017). The significant wave heights computed by a wave-current hydrodynamic coupled model are found to be in good agreement with the predictions given by the remote sensing data. The results and approach presented in this study should shed new light on how to handle parametric cyclonic wind models, and help the scientific community conduct better wind, wave, and surge analyses for tropical cyclones.

TI  - Ecological Suitability Of Island Development Based On Ecosystem Services Value, Biocapacity And Ecological Footprint: A Case Study Of Pingtan Island, Fujian, China
AB  - The ecological environment and resource endowment of an island are more vulnerable compared to the mainland, and special assessment and measurement of the ecological suitability for development are significant. Pingtan Island (Fujian, China) was taken as a case study. Changes in ecosystem services value and the profit-and-loss balance between ecological footprint and biocapacity were assessed using land use/cover changes based on remote-sensing images taken in 2009, 2014 and 2017, and the ecological suitability of development was measured. Results show that island development led to a decrease in the ecosystem services value and an increase in ecological footprint and biocapacity. The key ecological factors restricting the scale of island development are topography, vegetation with special functions and freshwater. Biocapacity of islands can increase not only by changing from lower-yield land types to higher-yield construction land types but also by external investment. A new measurement framework was proposed that simply and clearly reveals the ecological suitability of island development and the underlying key constraints. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Icesat-2 Atmospheric Channel Description, Data Processing And First Results
AB  - The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) was launched aboard the Ice Cloud and land-Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) satellite in September 2018. ATLAS is a single wavelength (532 nm) lidar system designed to acquire high resolution measurements of the earth's surface while also obtaining atmospheric backscatter from molecules, clouds, and aerosols. Because ATLAS is optimized for altimetry, the atmospheric data acquired is unique in many respects and requires non-standard analysis techniques. For example, the high repetition rate laser limits the vertical extent of the profiles to just 14 km and causes atmospheric scattering from above 15 km to be added to the scattering in the lower 0–14 km profile. In addition, the limited vertical range of the acquired profiles renders it difficult to compute the magnitude of the solar background and hinders the application of standard calibration techniques. Despite these limitations, methods have been developed to successfully produce data products that have value to the atmospheric community for cloud and aerosol research and are currently available at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). In this paper we describe the ICESat-2 atmospheric channel and the methods used to process the ATLAS raw photon count data to obtain calibrated backscatter and higher level products such as layer heights and type, blowing snow, column optical depth and apparent surface reflectance. © 2021.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Industrial Impact On Arctic Vegetation Around Noril'sk, Northern Siberia: Preliminary Results
AB  - This study applies remote sensing techniques for monitoring non-ferrous metal smelting impacts in the extreme environment of northern Siberia. Ground and at-satellite reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values for different vegetation types have been compared and a hybrid supervised-unsupervised classification of Landsat TM data performed, based on field and ancillary data. This has allowed us to distinguish several degrees of vegetation damage in tundra and forests. However, it was difficult to differentiate between some significant classes, such as damaged grass tundra and sparse dead larch forests with a grass understorey. We suggest possible refinement of our results, including the combination of images taken at different phenological stages and from different sensors. However, it should be noted that the north-Siberian environment presents unusually severe limitations of optical-infrared satellite observation possibilities and problems in imagery interpretation. Standard indicators of vegetation vigour, such as NDVI, widely applied at lower latitudes, become less informative in highly variable tundra and pre-tundra ecosystems. © 1999 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

TI  - Retrieved Actual Et Using Sebs Model From Landsat-5 Tm Data For Irrigation Area Of Australia
AB  - The idea of ground-based evapotranspiration (ET) is of the most interesting for land-atmosphere interactions, such as water-saving irrigation, the performance of irrigation systems, crop water deficit, drought mitigation strategies and accurate initialization of climate prediction models especially in arid and semiarid catchments where water shortage is a critical problem. The recent year's drought in Australia and concerns about climate change has prominent the need to manage water resources more sustainably especially in the Murrumbidgee catchment which utilizes bulk water for food security and production.This paper discusses the application of a Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model based on Landsat-5 TM data and field observations has been used and tested for deriving ET over Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA), located in the southwest of NSW, Australia. 16 Landsat-5 TM scenes were selected covering the time period of 2009, 2010 and 2011 for estimating the actual ET in CIA. To do the validation the used methodology, the ground-measured ET was compared to the Landsat-5 TM retrieved actual ET results for CIA. The derived ET value over CIA is much closer to the field measurement. From the remote sensing results and observations, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.74 and the mean APD is 7.5%. The derived satellite remote sensing values belong to reasonable range. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Creation Of Wildfire Susceptibility Maps In The Mediterranean Region (Turkey) Using Convolutional Neural Networks And Multilayer Perceptron Techniques
AB  - Considering the natural disasters that have developed in the world in recent years, it is known that there is an increase in wildfire disasters with the effects of climate change. In this study, wildfire susceptible areas were determined in the provinces of Mugla, Antalya, Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye, and Hatay in the Mediterranean re-gion (Turkey). Within the scope of this purpose, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) methods, the most widely used deep learning techniques in the literature in recent years, were preferred to create Wildfire susceptibility models. Seventeen environmental variables were used in the analyses, and these variables were grouped as topographic factors, anthropological and environmental factors, climatic factors, and vegetation factors. In addition, the number of fire inventory data has been balanced with the help of the Syn-thetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) used to increase the model result performance of the scarce inventory data. In the maps obtained by CNN and MLP methods, 17\% and 28\% of the study area were deter-mined as high and very high susceptible areas, respectively. The results demonstrated that the CNN model had superior performance in Wildfire susceptibility assessment with accuracy (\%85.8), precision (\%98.7), sensitivity (\%85.5), F-Score (\%91.6), and ROC curve (\%78.6). This model was followed by the MLP model with slightly lower accuracy values, which indicates that the CNN models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the MLP models. Finally, the wildfire susceptibility maps produced by deep learning methods could aid decision-makers and government organizations in the Mediterranean region in preventing future natural disasters.

TI  - Natural Green Spaces, Sensitization To Allergens, And The Role Of Gut Microbiota During Infancy
AB  - The environment plays an instrumental role in the developmental origins of health and disease. Protective features of the environment in the development of asthma and atopy have been insufficiently studied. We used data from the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study to examine relationships between living near natural green spaces in early infancy in Edmonton, AB, Canada and the development of atopic sensitization at 1 year and 3 years of age in a cohort of 699 infants, and whether these associations were mediated by infant gut microbiota (measured using 16s V4 amplicon sequencing) at 4 months. The Urban Planning Land Vegetation Index (uPLVI) map of the City of Edmonton was used to assess infants' exposure to natural spaces based on their home postal codes, and atopic sensitization was assessed using skin prink testing (SPTs) for common food and inhalant allergens. Our findings suggest there is a protective effect of natural green space proximity on the development of multiple inhalant atopic sensitizations at 3 years (odds ratio = 0.28 {[}95\% CI 0.09, 0.90]). This relationship was mediated by changes to Actinobacteria diversity in infant fecal samples taken at 4 months. We also found a positive association between nature proximity and sensitization to at least one food or inhaled allergen; this association was not mediated by gut microbiota. Together, these findings underscore the importance of promoting natural urban greenspace preservation to improve child health by reducing atopic disease susceptibility.IMPORTANCE Our findings highlight the importance of preserving natural green space in urban settings to prevent sensitization to environmental allergens and promote early-life gut microbiota pathways to this health benefit. These findings support a mediating role of gut microbiome compositions in health and disease susceptibility. This study used unique, accurate, and comprehensive methodology to classify natural space exposure via a high-resolution topographical map of foliage subtypes within the City of Edmonton limits. These methods are improvements from other methods previously used to classify natural space exposure, such as the normalized density vegetation index from satellite imagery, which is not able to distinguish anthropogenic from green space. The use of these methods and the associations found between natural green space exposure and atopic sensitization outcomes support their use in future studies. Our findings also provide many avenues for future research including longer term follow up of this cohort and investigation of a causal role of reduced Actinobacteria diversity on atopic sensitization development. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving natural green space in urban settings to prevent sensitization to environmental allergens and promote early-life gut microbiota pathways to this health benefit. These findings support a mediating role of gut microbiome compositions in health and disease susceptibility.

TI  - Tamarix And Diorhabda Leaf Beetle Interactions: Implications For Tamarix Water Use And Riparian Habitat
AB  - Tamarix leaf beetles (Diorhabda carinulata) have been widely released on western United States rivers to control introduced shrubs in the genus Tamarix, with the goals of saving water through removal of an assumed high water-use plant, and of improving habitat value by removing a competitor of native riparian trees. We review recent studies addressing three questions: (1) to what extent are Tamarix weakened or killed by recurrent cycles of defoliation; (2) can significant water salvage be expected from defoliation; and (3) what are the effects of defoliation on riparian ecology, particularly on avian habit? Defoliation has been patchy at many sites, and shrubs at some sites recover each year even after multiple years of defoliation. Tamarix evapotranspiration (ET) is much lower than originally assumed in estimates of potential water savings, and are the same or lower than possible replacement plants. There is concern that the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax trailli extimus) will be negatively affected by defoliation because the birds build nests early in the season when Tamarix is still green, but are still on their nests during the period of summer defoliation. Affected river systems will require continued monitoring and development of adaptive management practices to maintain or enhance riparian habitat values. Multiplatform remote sensing methods are playing an essential role in monitoring defoliation and rates of ET on affected river systems. © 2013 American Water Resources Association.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Landscape-Level Coastal Environmental Indicators
AB  - Advances in technology and decreases in cost are making remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) practical and attractive for use in coastal resource management. They are also allowing researchers and managers to take a broader view of ecological patterns and processes. Landscape-level environmental indicators that can be detected by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and other remote sensors are available to provide quantitative estimates of coastal and estuarine habitat conditions and trends. Such indicators include watershed land cover, riparian buffers, shoreline and wetland changes, among others. With the launch of Landsat 7, the cost of TM imagery has dropped by nearly a factor of 10, decreasing the cost of monitoring large coastal areas and estuaries. New satellites, carrying sensors with much finer spatial (1-5 m) and spectral (200 narrow bands) resolutions are being launched, providing a capability to more accurately detect changes in coastal habitat and wetland health. Advances in the application of GIS help incorporate ancillary data layers to improve the accuracy of satellite land-cover classification. When these techniques for generating, organizing, storing, and analyzing spatial information are combined with mathematical models, coastal planners and managers have a means for assessing the impacts of alternative management practices.; Advances in technology and decreases in cost are making remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) practical and attractive for use in coastal resource management.

TI  - Spatial Analysis Of The Sustainability Of Small Communities: A Case Study On The Island Of Ilovik, Croatia
AB  - This paper outlines the primary research conducted on the small island of Ilovik, Croatia and the following spatial statistical analysis performed with a central goal of examining current sustainability of the village and providing future planning recommendations. For two weeks in mid-June of 2011, residents were interviewed about their current socio-economic status and perceptions of tourism, the natural environment, and government. Their responses were assigned numeric values with dummy variables excluding the least common response, and were entered as attributes of building footprint polygons digitized in a GIS to allow for spatial statistical analysis. Tests included Local and Global Getis Ord G, Ordinary Least Squares, and Geographically Weighted Regression. Clear hot and cold spots were found, showing where additional water sources are needed or where water quality should be addressed and that a coastal vs. inland divide exists. Weak correlations existed between income and all other attributes, but from the results one could suggest a focus on increasing tourism and decreasing the supply of houses for sale.

TI  - Robust Relationship Between Air Quality And Infant Mortality In Africa
AB  - Poor air quality is thought to be an important mortality risk factor globally 1-3, but there is little direct evidence from the developing world on how mortality risk varies with changing exposure to ambient particulate matter. Current global estimates apply exposure-response relationships that have been derived mostly from wealthy, mid-latitude countries to spatial population data 4, and these estimates remain unvalidated across large portions of the globe. Here we combine household survey-based information on the location and timing of nearly 1 million births across sub-Saharan Africa with satellite-based estimates 5 of exposure to ambient respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) to estimate the impact of air quality on mortality rates among infants in Africa. We find that a 10 μg m-3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with a 9% (95% confidence interval, 4-14%) rise in infant mortality across the dataset. This effect has not declined over the last 15 years and does not diminish with higher levels of household wealth. Our estimates suggest that PM2.5 concentrations above minimum exposure levels were responsible for 22% (95% confidence interval, 9-35%) of infant deaths in our 30 study countries and led to 449,000 (95% confidence interval, 194,000-709,000) additional deaths of infants in 2015, an estimate that is more than three times higher than existing estimates that attribute death of infants to poor air quality for these countries 2,6 . Upward revision of disease-burden estimates in the studied countries in Africa alone would result in a doubling of current estimates of global deaths of infants that are associated with air pollution, and modest reductions in African PM2.5 exposures are predicted to have health benefits to infants that are larger than most known health interventions. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Assessment Of Dryland Condition Using Spatial Anomalies Of Vegetation Index Values
AB  - A landscape's long-term capacity to retain, utilize and recycle local resources is an objective basis for assessing its ecological functionality or condition. In subtropical and tropical drylands, where plant growth is moisture-limited for much of the time, land condition is reflected in the local water balance. The ratio of long-term actual evapotranspiration and precipitation (Ea/P) is proposed as an objective indicator of dryland condition. A spatial modelling framework is developed for the quantification of Ea/P over large areas using remotely sensed vegetation density patterns. Model parameters are defined by two particular situations: (i) non-vegetated sites, where Ea/P depends on the long-term runoff coefficient of bare soil surfaces (RCbs), and (ii) non-degraded sites with a vegetation density close to the potential value for which Ea/ P≅1.0. Specht's evaporative coefficient is used as an independent variable for the prediction of the potential vegetation density, whereas RCbs is estimated with the curve number method. The performance of the method was evaluated in a 900 km2 area in south-east Spain, where predicted land condition was found to be in good agreement with qualitative field observations on the nature and intensity of land degradation processes. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Temporal Matching Of Occurrence Localities And Forest Cover Data Helps Improve Range Estimates And Predict Climate Change Vulnerabilities
AB  - Improved quantification of species' ranges is needed to provide more accurate estimates of extinction risks for conservation planning. Highland tropical biodiversity may be particularly vulnerable to the anthropogenic changes in land cover and climate and is subject to overestimation of geographic range size in IUCN assessments. Here, we demonstrate a novel and practical approach for quantifying inferred range reductions based upon temporal matching of recent species occurrence localities and vegetation data. As an illustration pertinent to montane forest-associated species with limited distribution data, we use Gymnuromys roberti, an endemic Malagasy rodent with a Least Concern conservation status. We estimated climatic suitability and climate change vulnerability using species distribution modeling (SDM). We then determined deforestation tolerance thresholds for the species by temporally matching recent occurrence localities with percent forest cover values from MODIS forest cover layers. Finally, we applied these thresholds in postprocessing SDM-based range estimates. These estimates demonstrate that the lack of sufficient forest cover substantially reduces the species' current estimated range compared with the IUCN range map. Projections to 2050 suggest that there will be a loss of climatic suitability over three quarters of the currently suitable habitat along with increased fragmentation, highlighting the need to include climate change vulnerability assessments as an integral part of conservation planning. Broader application of SDMs could assist practitioners at various stages of conservation planning, stressing the need for improved accessibility of methodologically complex SDM approaches.

TI  - The Analysis Of The Impact Of Land-Use Changes On Flood Exposure Of Wuhan In Yangtze River Basin, China
AB  - This paper characterizes the land-use changes of Wuhan in Yangtze River Basin between 1954 and 2020, and its impact on flood exposure. Using Landsat TM images, the study draws four land-use maps which refer to the years 1954, 1982, 2000 and 2020, to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of land-use changes, particularly concerning the distribution of urban areas near the Yangtze River Basin. This was followed by an analysis of the land-use changes during the 4 study periods, and a set of four levels of flood exposure are used to analyze the flood exposure of urban areas of Wuhan. The result shows that the extensive land-use changes have a negative impact on the flood exposure of Wuhan during the last two decades. Finally, this paper provides a quantitative analysis of the correlation between flood exposure and flood damage (using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). The analysis indicates that there is an significant positive correlation between flood exposure and flood damage (or economic losses caused by floods), but the correlations between flood exposure and the number of people affected is different with previous assumptions. This paper is an initial effort to quantitatively analyze the impact of land-use changes on flood exposure of Wuhan in Yangtze River Basin, which can be used by stakeholders of the developing countries to develop contingency land-use plans to reduce the urban flood exposure and to address and prevent the damage and casualties caused by flood disasters. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Ground Level Pm2.5 Estimates Over China Using Satellite-Based Geographically Weighted Regression (Gwr) Models Are Improved By Including No2 And Enhanced Vegetation Index (Evi)
AB  - Highly accurate data on the spatial distribution of ambient fine particulate matter (<2.5 mu m: PM2.5) is currently quite limited in China. By introducing NO2 and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) into the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, a newly developed GWR model combined with a fused Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product and meteorological parameters could explain approximately 87\% of the variability in the corresponding PM2.5 mass concentrations. There existed obvious increase in the estimation accuracy against the original GWR model without NO2 and EVI, where cross-validation R-2 increased from 0.77 to 0.87. Both models tended to overestimate when measurement is low and underestimate when high, where the exact boundary value depended greatly on the dependent variable. There was still severe PM2.5 pollution in many residential areas until 2015; however, policy-driven energy conservation and emission reduction not only reduced the severity of PM2.5 pollution but also its spatial range, to a certain extent, from 2014 to 2015. The accuracy of satellite-derived PM2.5 still has limitations for regions with insufficient ground monitoring stations and desert areas. Generally, the use of NO2 and EVI in GWR models could more effectively estimate PM2.5 at the national scale than previous GWR models. The results in this study could provide a reasonable reference for assessing health impacts, and could be used to examine the effectiveness of emission control strategies under implementation in China.

TI  - Remote Sensing Assessment Of The Impact Of Land Use And Land Cover Change On The Environment Of Barddhaman District, West Bengal, India
AB  - Land transformation is caused by natural as well as anthropogenic driving forces and its impact on the regional environment is a key issue in understanding the relationship between society and the environment. Here, we investigate Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change over four decades, based on Landsat satellite imagery for 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017, for the Barddhaman district of West Bengal, India. In total, six land use and land cover types have been identified. Over the period in question, there are notable increases in the area under built-up land, plantations and water bodies, whereas there has been a marked decrease in forest cover, agricultural land, and in bare land. The diverse effects of land transformation on the natural environment have been assessed using Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Effective Roughness Length (ERL), and Surface Albedo (SA). Overall, mean annual LST increased by 2.91 degrees C during the study period, while there were reduced values for vegetation indices and an increase in the water index over the period 1987-2017. LAI and ERL both exhibit notable decreases, although the pattern was not uniform across the study area. For example, LAI values increased over time in the Kalna, Memari, Jamalpur, Ausgram, and Kanksa regions. In Faridpur-Durgapur, Raniganj, Asansol, and Raina, increases in surface albedo and ERL were more marked than in other regions. Negative correlations are found between LST-NDVI and NDVI-NDWI, while there is no correlation between LST and NDWI. During the period 1987-2017, NDVI values have declined, although the NDWI shows no clear trend. LULC change is shown to have had a series of negative impacts on the environment of the Barddhaman district. In response, technological, economic, policy, or legislation measures are needed to restore degraded ecosystem services in the district as well as other areas where similar impacts are experienced.

TI  - Construction Of Tree Species Composition Map Of Estonia Using Multispectral Satellite Images, Soil Map And A Random Forest Algorithm
AB  - Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images from years 2015 and 2016, a 1:10,000 digital soil map and a large number of reference samples were used with a random forest machine learning implementation in GRASS GIS to construct a tree species map for the entire territory of Estonia (42,755 km 2 ). Class probabilities for seven main tree species, an extra class for other species and probability of the forest cover not conforming to the forest definition were assigned for each pixel. Validation of dominant species distribution by area showed very strong correlation at county level both in state forests (R 2 = 0.98) and in private forests (R 2 = 0.93). Validation of tree species composition using harvester measurement data from 2,045 regeneration felling areas showed also very strong correlation (R 2 = 0.75) with the measured values of the proportion of coniferous trees. There was some tendency to underestimate the proportion of more common species and overestimation was found for the species with smaller proportion in the mixture. The accuracy for the proportion of deciduous species that were present in a smaller number of reference observations was substantially smaller. Validation of the results by using data from 659 large sample plots from the database of the Estonian Network of Forest Research Plots and 3,002 small sample plots from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) data base confirmed the findings based on harvester data. The NFI data revealed also a decrease of estimation error with the increase of forest age. Cohen's kappa index of agreement for main species for NFI sample plots with main species proportion equal to or greater than 75% decreased from 0.69 to 0.66 when observations with forests younger than 20 years were included in the comparison. Overall, the constructed map provides valuable data about tree species composition for the forests where no up to date inventory data are available or for the projects that require continuous cover of tree species data of known quality over the entire Estonia. © 2018 Mait Lang et al.

TI  - Mapping And Assessing The Seasonal Dynamics Of Surface Urban Heat Intensity Using Landsat-8 Oli/Tirs Images
AB  - Increased heat intensity in urban climate has serious implications on human health, contributing to urban liveability and vitality. As a way of mitigating the effect of excessive heat temperature in the urban area, it is imperative to examine the level of surface temperature in urban areas over time so that the urban heat intensity and its attendant consequences can be put into consideration when undertaking sustainable urban planning. This study examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface urban heat intensity in Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State using remotely sensed images. Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS images of the year 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021 for both dry and wet seasons were used to determine the study area’s Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), surface emissivity, land surface temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), using ArcGIS 10.8 software. The result showed that a rise in built-up density, surface emissivity, and a decrease in vegetation density yields an increase in LST, while vegetation density proved to be of little effect in dry season when compared to the rainy season because most vegetation experiences draught at this time of the year. The result also showed that LST is higher in rainy season than it was in dry season because the wind, which decreases the effect of LST, is weak at this season of the year. The least value for surface emissivity in dry season was recorded to be 0.98605 while that of rainy is 0.98698, which implies that the emissivity of materials in the study area was observed to be higher in the rainy season than dry season. Furthermore, the result affirmed that a rise in urbanization gives rise to LST, likewise an increase in vegetation density of an area will lead to a decrease in the area’s urban heat intensity. The results also proved that wet periods can be hotter than dry periods of the year due to the presence of weak winds. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Integrating Coarse-Resolution Images And Agricultural Statistics To Generate Sub-Pixel Crop Type Maps And Reconciled Area Estimates
AB  - Reliable crop type maps are vital for agricultural monitoring, ensuring food security, and environmental sustainability assessments. Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellite-derived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The sub-pixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Future Land Use Land Cover Changes In El-Fayoum Governorate: A Simulation Study Using Satellite Data And Ca-Markov Model
AB  - This study aims to monitor the changes in land use land cover (LULC) in El-Fayoum governorate over time (past, present, and future) to provide current information for stakeholders involved in land use planning. The study utilized Landsat satellite images and applied the Support Vector Machine algorithm using ArcGIS Pro 2.8.3 to classify the images into four major LULC classes: water, desert, built-up, and agricultural. To evaluate the accuracy of the LULC maps, the study used kappa statistical parameters, which ranged from 0.91 to 0.94, indicating acceptable results for further analysis. To predict spatio-temporal LULC changes, the study considered biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as distance to canals, distance to roads, distance to urban areas, a digital elevation model, and slope. A combination of Multi-Criteria Evaluation, a Fuzzy Membership Function, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process were employed to develop a land cover suitability map. The Hybrid CA-Markov model of the IDRISI-TerrSet software was used to simulate LULC changes, and the accuracy of the simulation was validated using 2020 imagery data. The values gained from the kappa indices for agreement (standard) = 0.9006, kappa for lack of information (no) = 0.916, and kappa for location at grid cell level (location) = 0.9572 demonstrate that the results of the simulation of the LULC changes were deemed satisfactory. The future scenarios modeled in LULC indicate a significant change in the LULC classes over time, specifically for 2030. The change rates of agriculture, desert, built-up, and water areas in El-Fayoum in 2030 compared to 2020 are estimated to be 9.68\%, - 17.58\%, 133.62\%, and 6.06\%, respectively. These findings establish both past and future LULC trends and provide crucial data useful for planning and sustainable land use management.

TI  - Land Use And Land Cover Change In Arctic Russia: Ecological And Social Implications Of Industrial Development
AB  - Sizable areas in northwestern arctic Russia have undergone fundamental change in recent decades as the exploration of vast hydrocarbon deposits has intensified. We undertook two case studies on the influence of oil and gas activities within neighbouring federal districts in the tundra zone. Employing a strongly interdisciplinary approach, we studied the ecological, spatial and social dimensions of the visible and perceived changes in land use and land cover. Our data are derived from field sampling, remote sensing and intensive participant observation with indigenous Nenets reindeer herders and non-indigenous workers. Important trends include the rapid expansion of infrastructure, a large influx of workers who compete for freshwater fish, and extensive transformation from shrub- to grass- and sedge-dominated tundra. The latter represents an alternative ecosystem state that is likely to persist indefinitely. On terrain disturbed by off-road vehicle traffic, reindeer pastures' vegetation regenerates with fewer species among which grasses and sedges dominate, thus reducing biodiversity. To have maximum forage value such pastures must be accessible and free of trash, petro-chemicals and feral dogs. We found that a wide range of direct and indirect impacts, both ecological and social, accumulate in space and time such that the combined influence is effectively regional rather than local, depending in part on the placement of facilities. While incoming workers commonly commit poaching, they also serve as exchange partners, making barter for goods possible in remote locations. In general, the same positive and negative impacts of the presence of industry were mentioned in each study region. Even using very high-resolution remote sensing data (Quickbird-2) it is not possible to determine fully the amount of degraded territory in modern oil and gas fields. With regard to policy, both biophysical and social impacts could be substantially reduced if information flow between herders and workers were to be optimized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Deploying Spatial Data For Coastal Community Resilience: A Review From The Managerial Perspective
AB  - The use of spatial data for coastal community resilience applications has diversified as a consequence of the increasing availability of data, and extensive development in data processing. However, the true value of spatial data is not fully exploited as a result of lacking scientific managerial models that incorporate spatial data into decision-making. This article synthesizes the cross-disciplinary literature review on deploying spatial data for coastal community resilience from the managerial perspective. It systematically reviews research addressing the topic of deploying spatial data for coastal resilience operations from the earliest available to 1999. The review uses 142 studies to address three research questions: (1) What kind of data can be obtained for coastal resilience situational awareness? (2) What outcomes have spatial data attributed to coastal resilience applications? and (3) What are the missing pieces (gaps) in connecting the spatial data with coastal resilience applications? In addressing these research questions, the authors review articles based on three dimensions including the availability of spatial data, the availability of applications, and limitations. Based on the findings of the analysis, the authors conclude that the managerial perspective of deploying spatial data in coastal hazards are understudies, and outline problem formulation, mission prioritization, and information salience as an agenda for future research.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution And Driving Mechanism Of Aerosol Optical Depth In The Ebinur Lake Basin
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the attenuation of light by aerosols and reflects the degree of regional air pollution to some extent. This study was based on the data from the long-term sequence MOD09A1 from 2000 to 2015 and the generation of a lookup table using the deep blue algorithm (DB) to perform AOD remote sensing estimation on the Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data from the Ebinur Lake Basin to analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of AOD in the Ebinur Lake Basin and to perform an AOD prediction and factor contribution ranking using the random forest model (RF) combined with environmental variables. The results showed that: ① AOD of Ebinur Lake Basin has significant seasonal variation characteristics, and the AOD values were spring (0.414)>summer (0.390)>autumn (0.287), with the largest variation in spring. ② The AOD average of the Ebinur Lake Basin was 0.374, and the interannual variation as a whole showed an upward trend. However, the AOD increased rapidly during 2010-2015, with an interannual increase of 32.32%, which indicated increasing air pollution in the basin over the past 15 years, especially the past five years. ③ The spatial distribution of AOD in the Ebinur Lake Basin was stepped up from the north to the south of Lake Ebinur. In this area, the pollution in Jinghe County was the most prominent, and the AOD value reached 0.483. ④ The RF model had a good predictive effect on AOD, R2=0.866, RMSE=0.042, and evapotranspiration had the most significant effect on AOD in the Ebinur Lake basin. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Response Of Ecosystem Service Value To Land Use/Cover Change In The Northern Slope Economic Belt Of The Tianshan Mountains, Xinjiang, China
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is becoming more and more frequent and extensive as a result of human activities, and is expected to have a major impact on human welfare by altering ecosystem service value (ESV). In this study, we utilized remote sensing images and statistical data to explore the spatial-temporal changes of land use/cover types and ESV in the northern slope economic belt of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China from 1975 to 2018. During the study period, LUCC in the study region varied significantly. Except grassland and unused land, all the other land use/cover types (cultivated land, forestland, waterbody, and construction land) increased in areas. From 1975 to 2018, the spatial-temporal variations in ESV were also pronounced. The total ESV decreased by 4.00×108 CNY, which was primarily due to the reductions in the areas of grassland and unused land. Waterbody had a much higher ESV than the other land use/cover types. Ultimately, understanding the impact of LUCC on ESV and the interactions among ESV of different land use/cover types will help improve existing land use policies and provide scientific basis for developing new conservation strategies for ecologically fragile areas. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Mining And Environmental Change In Sierra Leone, West Africa: A Remote Sensing And Hydrogeomorphological Study
AB  - This paper evaluates the environmental changes in southwestern Sierra Leone, West Africa from rutile (titanium dioxide) between 1967 and 1995. Mining in peripheral parts of the world economy is a consequence of larger global economic interests. Historically, long-distance trade and export production of minerals and other natural resources primarily for the benefit of core countries are responsible for transforming the natural environment and landscapes of peripheral sectors of the world economy. Tracking environmental change in developing countries such as Sierra Leone is challenging because of financial and infrastructural constraints on the use of ground methods of evaluation and monitoring. Remote sensing data are invaluable in assessing the human dimensions of Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) with implications for political ecology. Using available multi-date infrared Landsat images supplemented with field hydrological and biophysical data, we monitored the rapid temporal and spatial dynamic characteristic of mining areas in the study area with a focus on physical changes to the landscape. Reservoir construction for mining has caused flooding of alluvial lowlands, deforestation, and the creation of tailings and stockpiles over mined-out portions of the lease. Although the study was conducted at a local scale, it represents the broad, regional, past-to-present manner by which global economic interests exploit natural resources and impact the environment in distant places. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of Nitrogen Dioxide Pollution And Urban Development: Satellite Observations Over China, 2005–2016
AB  - China experienced rapid urbanization and industrialization in recent years, which resulted in large increases of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particularly in urban areas. We analyze the spatiotemporal variations of the vertical column densities (VCDs) of tropospheric NO2 with the level of urban development across China during the period 2005–2016. Nighttime light (NTL) data are applied as a proxy for urban development to investigate the relationship between NO2 pollution and urban development. Both NO2 column data and NTL data are observed by satellite measurements. The annual mean of NO2 VCDs is presented on a grid basis. The average annual variations of NO2 VCDs and NTL value are detected for all 341 prefectural cities. Two-thirds of the cities reached their peak NO2 pollution level around 2010–2012, and decreased afterward. About 10% of the western cities kept on increasing their NO2 levels until 2016. All cities are classified into four categories with respect to the average annual variations of NO2 /NTL in 2005–2010, and 2011–2016. Approximately 62% of the cities turned the average annual variations of NO2 /NTL from positive to negative. 19% of the cities are in the positive-positive category and 11% of the cities are in the negative-negative category. The remaining 8% of the cities changed their ratios from negative to positive. We summarize the national air pollution regulations, and our results show the effectiveness of the regulations for most eastern China cities. This work can help to design more efficient regional emission reduction policies with sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Climate Change Impacts On Selected Global Rangeland Ecosystem Services
AB  - Rangelands are Earth's dominant land cover and are important providers of ecosystem services. Reliance on rangelands is projected to grow, thus understanding the sensitivity of rangelands to future climates is essential. We used a new ecosystem model of moderate complexity that allows, for the first time, to quantify global changes expected in rangelands under future climates. The mean global annual net primary production (NPP) may decline by 10 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2050 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, but herbaceous NPP is projected to increase slightly (i.e., average of 3 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Responses vary substantially from place-to-place, with large increases in annual productivity projected in northern regions (e.g., a 21\% increase in productivity in the US and Canada) and large declines in western Africa (-46\% in sub-Saharan western Africa) and Australia (-17\%). Soil organic carbon is projected to increase in Australia (9\%), the Middle East (14\%), and central Asia (16\%) and decline in many African savannas (e.g., -18\% in sub-Saharan western Africa). Livestock are projected to decline 7.5 to 9.6\%, an economic loss of from \$9.7 to \$12.6 billion. Our results suggest that forage production in Africa is sensitive to changes in climate, which will have substantial impacts on the livelihoods of the more than 180 million people who raise livestock on those rangelands. Our approach and the simulation tool presented here offer considerable potential for forecasting future conditions, highlight regions of concern, and support analyses where costs and benefits of adaptations and policies may be quantified. Otherwise, the technical options and policy and enabling environment that are needed to facilitate widespread adaptation may be very difficult to elucidate.

TI  - Interpolation-Based Fusion Of Sentinel-5p, Srtm, And Regulatory-Grade Ground Stations Data For Producing Spatially Continuous Maps Of Pm2.5 Concentrations Nationwide Over Thailand
AB  - Atmospheric pollution has recently drawn significant attention due to its proven adverse effects on public health and the environment. This concern has been aggravated specifically in Southeast Asia due to increasing vehicular use, industrial activity, and agricultural burning practices. Consequently, elevated PM2.5 concentrations have become a matter of intervention for national authorities who have addressed the needs of monitoring air pollution by operating ground stations. However, their spatial coverage is limited and the installation and maintenance are costly. Therefore, alternative approaches are necessary at national and regional scales. In the current paper, we investigated interpolation models to fuse PM2.5 measurements from ground stations and satellite data in an attempt to produce spatially continuous maps of PM2.5 nationwide over Thailand. Four approaches are compared, namely the inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), random forest (RF), and random forest combined with OK (RFK) leveraging on the NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, AI, and O3 products from the Sentinel-5P satellite, regulatory-grade ground PM2.5 measurements, and topographic parameters. The results suggest that RFK is the most robust, especially when the pollution levels are moderate or extreme, achieving an RMSE value of 7.11 μg/m3 and an R2 value of 0.77 during a 10-day long period in February, and an RMSE of 10.77 μg/m3 and R2 and 0.91 during the entire month of March. The proposed approach can be adopted operationally and expanded by leveraging regulatory-grade stations, low-cost sensors, as well as upcoming satellite missions such as the GEMS and the Sentinel-5. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Aerial Photography To Detect Nitrogen Stress In Corn
AB  - Economic and environmental benefits can result from improved nitrogen (N) management in corn (Zea mays L.) production. This research project was conducted to determine the utility of aerial photographs to detect N deficiency in a crop canopy caused by natural soil variability and variable fertilizer N application rates. Chlorophyll meter readings and digitized aerial photograph data were compared to corn grain yield and stalk nitrate concentrations from a 60-ha field in Central Nebraska. In addition to natural field variability, 30.4-m long treatments were imposed through the center of the field by applying fertilizer at: rates of 0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg N ha(-1). Grain yield, chlorophyll meter readings,;photographic brightness and stalk nitrate samples were collected. Despite a significant effect from fertilizer treatments, chlorophyll meter readings did not correlate well with grain yields. The brightness of the red component in a digitized color photograph showed a significant inverse relationship (r(2) = 0.42) with grain yield. Stalk nitrate concentrations at harvest, when compared to red brightness from the digitized photograph, provided a better confirmation of N status than grain yield. Aerial photographs appear to be capable of detecting management induced variability as well as reduced yield portions of a field that result from natural variability.

TI  - Risk Assessment And Sustainable Development Countermeasures Of Agricultural Typhoon Disaster For Hainan Island Of China
AB  - Typhoons can generally bring the terrible damage for the agricultural production, particularly in Hainan Island with the frequent occurrence. It is a high demand for the accurate and rapid risk assessment on agricultural typhoon disaster, in order to optimize the layout of agricultural planting for the damage prevention and mitigation. Taking the Hainan Island of south China as the study area, this research aims to construct the assessment index system of agricultural typhoon disaster for the sustainable development countermeasures. Some influencing factors were also selected in the natural disaster system, including the rainfall, wind speed, typhoon occurrence time, digital elevation model data, rivers and watersheds, ratio vegetation index, agricultural population, agricultural output value, cultivated land area, and land area during the occurrence of typhoons over many years. Some considerations were then posed on the risk of disaster-causing factors, the exposure of hazard-formative environments, and the vulnerability of hazard-affected bodies. Eight indicators were illustrated for the risk comprehensive assessment model of agricultural typhoon disaster, including the maximum wind speed accumulation, rainfall accumulation, influence index of terrain factor, river network density, vegetation exposure, agricultural population density, output value per unit area of agricultural land, and the proportion of cultivated land in the land area. The relative importance of each index was scored by 15 experienced experts that engaged in the meteorology, agriculture, hydrology, and geography using analytic hierarchy process. Then, the weight was calculated to evaluate the contribution degree of eight indexes for each Criteria layer and index layer, according to the matrix judgment and consistency. As such, the agricultural typhoon disaster risk was determined from the typhoon occurrence data from 2001 to 2020. The agricultural typhoon disaster risks of cities and counties were divided into five levels: level I, II, III, IV, and V. The results showed that: The high risk of agricultural typhoon disaster was found in the study area, where the risk index was between 0.40 and 0.80, with an average of 0.61. The area of agricultural typhoon disaster risk level III and above were accounted for 74.8%. Spatially, the risk of typhoon disaster in the northern and coastal areas was much higher than that in the central mountainous area. Among them, Qionghai and Haikou cities presented the highest risk, with the disaster risk integrated index of 0.712 and 0.689, respectively. The lowest disaster risk was observed in Baoting, Baisha, Wuzhishan, and Qiongzhong cities, with the integrated index of disaster risk all lower than 0.540. The risk of disaster-causing factors and the exposure of hazard-formative environment for the agricultural typhoon were retained at a high level in northern areas (such as Haikou, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai), and coastal areas (such as Qionghai, and Danzhou), whereas a low level was found in the central areas (such as Baisha, Qiongzhong, and Wuzhishan). The vulnerability of hazard-affected bodies remained at a high level in Qionghai, Lingshui and Sanya, whereas, a low level in Baisha and Qiongzhong. Three countermeasures were also proposed for the prevention and reduction of agricultural typhoon disaster during sustainable development. Specifically, the layout of agricultural planting can be rationally adjusted for the risk monitoring and early warning, according to the typhoon characteristics and the risk distribution of agricultural typhoon disasters. The investment can be expected to strengthen in agricultural policy insurance. The specific measures included: 1) priority should be given to the typhoon-resistant crops, winter melon, and vegetable planting in the Qiongdong region; 2) an intelligent monitoring and perception network can be established using space-sky-terrestrial integration for the agricultural typhoon disaster risk in remote mountainous areas, while the new remote sensing can be introduced n the areas with developed agricultural activities; 3) to innovate the agricultural insurance underwriting and claim settlement mode. The finding can offer the strong support to the disaster prevention and emergency decision-making for the regions with different disaster risk levels. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - A Climate-Sensitive Approach For Determining The Urban Growth Boundaries: Towards A Spatial Exploration For Bursa, Türkiye
AB  - Population growth is inevitable in urban areas responsible for climate crises worldwide, and urban development is affected by processes fed by many dynamics. Predicting and planning the growth limits of the city effectively is a critical issue for achieving sustainable urban growth and managing climate risks. The study used the cellular automata-Markov chain method to define development areas regarding natural structure and land use/land cover. It aimed to present a method that can be applied to different urban areas by focusing on effective urban growth management with a climate-sensitive approach. It offered a climate-sensitive approach to determining growth limits according to scenarios. The boundaries of 2030 have been determined for the city of Bursa, which exhibited an increased average summer value of the land surface temperature from 24 degrees C to 45 degrees C between 2012 and 2021, stands out with its natural riches, and shows a rapid urban growth trend. The proposed method modeled the limits of urban growth with a climate-sensitive approach, and the model's suitability was demonstrated by Kappa statistics (Klocation = 0.8884). The determined urban boundary will reduce the rate of the urban built-up area from 86\% to 70\% by 2030. While the climate crisis threatens all life, urban activities, urban growth, and sprawl continue to increase rapidly. However, the growth of urban areas within certain limits is a critical need for engineering and urban planning. For decision makers, spatially determining the limits of human intervention in nature is an important guideline. Extreme weather events and disasters such as floods, tsunamis, and changes in water levels brought about by climate change can potentially cause chaotic crises. Loss of life and economic crises may occur in possible processes. Therefore, measures must be taken on behalf of humanity and life to adapt to climate effects and keep the level of impact under control. Spatial models based on a wide range of temporal contexts have a structure that broadens our perspective. The study provides an approach that can be implemented in various fields with models produced based on scenarios.

TI  - An Improved Method For Mapping Tidal Flats Based On Remote Sensing Waterlines: A Case Study In The Bohai Rim, China
AB  - Tidal flats form boundaries between marine and terrestrial environments, and reported rapid decreases in their extent require improved measures of their status. Current methods for delineating tidal flats have low accuracy because of the limited precision of available imagery, and they cannot identify zones within tidal flats. Three zones within tidal flats are ecologically distinct due to their varied inundation. These include the supratidal, intertidal, and subtidal zones. In this study, we present a more precise method for mapping tidal flats. We used Chinese HJ-1A/B satellite images with a semiautomatic extraction method to generate a sufficient number of waterline estimates taken at various tide heights to delineate the full extent of tidal flats. Then, the full set of waterline estimates is analyzed with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) using Jenks Natural Breaks to identify three zones within tidal flats. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by mapping tidal flats of the Bohai Rim, China. In 2014, the estimate of available tidal flats in the region was 3093 km(2), among which the area of supratidal, intertidal, and subtidal zones accounted for 5.0\%, 84.3\%, and 10.7\%, respectively. A confusion matrix for accuracy assessment revealed a 93.8\% overall accuracy for the resulting tidal flat map. Our method enables tidal flats to be mapped and monitored precisely and comprehensively, providing baseline data on the extent of this disappearing ecosystem that can be used to inform coastal planning and sustainable development.

TI  - Focus: Marine Geomorphology As A Determinant For Essential Life Habitat And Marine Protected Area Design Marine Geomorphology In The Design Of Marine Reserve Networks
AB  - Marine environments, key life-support systems for the earth, are under severe threat. Issues associated with managing these common property resources are complex and interrelated. Networks of marine reserves can be valuable for mitigating threats to marine systems, yet the successful design and implementation of such networks has been limited. Efficient ways to conserve marine environments are urgently needed. This Focus Section of The Professional Geographer explores the development of marine reserve networks based on geomorphology, fish biology, ecological connectivity, and appropriate governance. The articles in this Focus Section offer examples of the following: (1) distinctive reef geomorphology dictating the spawning locations of reef fishes, which in turn serve as critical source sites for the replenishment of distant reefs by means of larval transport; (2) an example of a simplified oceanographic model that predicts larval transport from fish breeding sites to important nursery areas; and (3) a case study of the development of a marine reserve network that illustrates key elements of a successful strategy. In sum, this Focus Section offers case studies that show the value of marine geomorphology, oceanographic connectivity, and stakeholder involvement as key elements of multidisciplinary geographic studies applied to the design of marine reserve networks. Geographers can further contribute to the conservation and management of coastal and marine ecosystems in many ways that involve subdisciplines of remote sensing and geographic information systems, political and economic geography, political ecology, and ethnography. © 2011 by Association of American Geographers.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Wildfire Susceptibility Mapping Using Remotely Sensed Fire Data And Gis: A Case Study Of Adana And Mersin Provinces, Turkey
AB  - In recent years, the number of wildfires has increased all over the world. Therefore, mapping wildfire susceptibility is crucial for prevention, early detection, and supporting wildfire management decisions. This study aims to generate Machine Learning (ML) based wildfire susceptibility maps for Adana and Mersin provinces, which are located in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. To generate a wildfire inventory, this study uses active fire pixels derived from MODIS monthly MCD14ML composites. Furthermore, as a sub aim, the performance of seven ML approaches, namely, stand-alone Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and AdaBoost (AB), was evaluated based on wildfire susceptibility mapping. The capabilities of the corresponding ML methods were assessed using thirteen wildfire conditioning factors, which can be grouped into four main categories: topographical, meteorological, vegetation, and anthropogenic factors. The Information Gain (IG) approach was used to assess their importance scores. A multicollinearity analysis was also performed to assess the relationship between conditioning factors. To compare the predictive performances of ML algorithms, five performance metrics, namely average accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve, were used. To test the significance of the generated wildfire susceptibility maps and to detect similarities and differences among the output of these ML algorithms, McNemar's test was implemented. In the end, the ML-based models were locally interpreted using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique. The AUC values of seven methods varied from 0.817 to 0.879, and the accuracy scores ranged between 0.734 and 0.812. The results showed that the RF model provided the best results considering all performance metrics. The accuracy score and AUC values of the RF model were equal to 0.812 and 0.879, respectively. On the other hand, stand-alone algorithms (LDA, SVM, and LR) represented lower performance than tree-based ensemble methods. Both the IG and SHAP analyses showed that elevation, temperature, and slope factors were the most contributing factors. The RF model classifier found that 7.20\% of the study area has very high wildfire susceptibility, and the majority of the wildfire samples (68.84\%) correspond to the very high susceptible areas in the RF model. The outcomes of this study are likely to provide decision-makers with a better understanding of wildfires in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey.

TI  - A Geographic Information System (Gis) Based Approach For Drainage And Morphometric Characterization Of Beki River Basin, India
AB  - . Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing have proved to be effective tools in delineation to find the drainage pattern and different geometric methodologies of geomorphologic watershed management. Even GIS has been widely used in several flood management, and environmental applications. The river Beki with an area of 19,354.35 sq. km2 originates at the Himalayan glacier (Kula Kangri glacier in Bhutan) at 26.18 \& DEG;N latitudes and 90.53 \& DEG;E longitudes and flows through the plains of Assam and finally to the mighty Brahmaputra at 26.48 \& DEG;N latitudes and 91.02 \& DEG;E longitudes have been selected for a detail analysis morphometric parameters. Morphometric parameters via; Circularity ratio, Elongation ratio, Compactness ratio, etc. were measured for prioritization and compound parameter values were calculated. The local people from this study will be able to utilize the resources in the right manner for a sustainable water resource development of the basin area. Moreover, the study can also be referred to as a benchmark for studies on temporal change in geomorphology resulting from climate change. Various Morphometric analyses explain the physical properties of the watershed, which are important for land use planning, soil conservation, terrain elevation, and soil erosion.

TI  - Dynamics Of Urbanization And Its Impact On Urban Ecosystem Services (Uess): A Study Of A Medium Size Town Of West Bengal, Eastern India
AB  - The continuous urban expansion changes the urban ecological landscape pattern and urban ecosystem functions that possess serious challenge before urban environmental and ecological management. In this context, assessing the relationship between rapid urban expansion and ecosystem services play an important role for the urban sustainability and development related to planning and policies. This study mainly focuses on the assessment of the dynamic nature of urbanization and its impact on urban ecosystem services through land use and land cover (LULC) changes of Old Malda Municipal town, Eastern India. The ecosystem service values (ESVt) are analyzed using Remote Sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global Value Coefficient (VC) for four-time periods (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESV,) and individual ecosystem service function change. Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS) is also applied to test the reliability of the estimated VC used as proxies for each LULC categories. The result of the study landscape reveals that the ecosystem service values (ESVs) decreased by 25\% from US\$ 1.33 million to US\$ 1.07 million because of losing cropland and vegetation cover by 34\% and 35\% respectively during 1990-2017. In case of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased by 12\% since 1990-2017 with highest contributing services of water regulation (57\%), water supply (22\%) and waste treatment (8\%) respectively while maximum decline is recorded in soil formation (33.33\%) followed by climatic regulation (31.82\%) and nutrient cycling (31.25\%). The decline in total and some individual ESV in the study landscape requires for urgent measures to be taken to enhance the urban ecosystem sustainability through effective planning and policies.

TI  - Real Evapotranspiration Of The Dwarf Cavendish Banana Determined By The Metric Algorithm In The Semiarid Region Of Ceara
AB  - The present work aimed to estimate the daily real evapotranspiration (ETr) through the application of the METRIC (Mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration) algorithm by means of remote sensing techniques, in an irrigated area cultivated with dwarf cavendish banana in the municipality of Barbalha, CE and to compare the ETr with the one calculated by the Penman-Monteith method. Landsat-8 OLI / TIRS satellite images and meteorological data obtained in an automatic meteorological station were used. After processing the images, the daily estimated ETr’s were determined from the latent heat flux density (LE), obtained as a result of the energy balance equation. The daily evapotranspiration’s in the studied area presented values estimated by the METRIC algorithmic between 5.0 and 6.8 mm day-1, which of them corroborate with the results.found in the bibliography. Comparing the values of ETr estimated by the METRIC in relation to the Penman-Monteith method, low differences were observed, less than 6.0%, which fits as satisfactory and acceptable level of precision, so this is a good tool for the determination of the crop water requirements and in the decisions-making regarding to the use of water resources. © 2021, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

TI  - Topographically Determined Water Availability Shapes Functional Patterns Of Plant Communities Within And Across Habitat Types
AB  - Plant-environment relationships can be assessed through functional traits, but we have little understanding of how they vary on larger scales due to limited sampling. Using a fine-grained digital elevation model and vegetation survey data from a national monitoring program, we now have the chance to investigate the importance of topographically determined water availability in shaping the functional structure of vegetation of different habitat types across Denmark. Plant community responses to hydrology were detected through community-weighted Ellenberg F values and six community-weighted functional traits. We used mixed-effect models to account for the variability related to unknown site-specific factors such as management regime and regional species pool. Additionally, we evaluated whether we can trust a remote-sensing-based topographically determined water availability index (TWI) that calculates how water accumulates on the surface of the landscape to represent actual hydrology. Remote-sensing-based topographically determined water availability represented actual local water availability as indicated by a positive correlation with community-weighted Ellenberg F values (P < 0.001), showing that this is an effective method of measuring water availability at large scale. The strength and direction of vegetation-TWI relationships differed between habitat types. Functional responses were also habitat dependent and to a certain degree explained by non-considered site-specific factors which presumably include historical land use and current management. This study contributes to the understanding of plant-water relationships which is highly relevant, as the hydrological regime might change rapidly in the near future with potential prevalence of extremes in the hydrological environment.

TI  - Disordered Conversion Of Vegetation Committees Connectivity Between Forest Fragments In The Brazilian Legal Amazon
AB  - y Accelerated and disordered conversion of forests into the agricultural frontier areas of the Brazilian Legal Amazon in the last four decades resulted in a fragmented landscape. Connectivity and maintenance of biodiversity in the remaining forest fragments are compromised. In this work, we evaluated landscape connectivity between the municipalities of Sorriso with a predominantly developed agricultural sector and the municipality of Alta Floresta with well-developed livestock farming. Both municipalities are located in the northern region of Mato Grosso state. We used scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite OLI (Operational Land Imager) of the year 2017 to quantify the amount of forest fragments. Six forest distances were stipulated in five size classes. Connectivity metrics of the forest fragments and landscape structure were calculated. The study area comprised 8,964 forest fragments, of which 6,149 fragments were devoted to livestock and 2,815 - to agriculture. The study results indicate that connectivity is based on long distances, which are unfavorable to mobility of the organisms. The best obtained connectivity values were 10,000m in the areas of agriculture and 5,000m for the livestock, respectively. The best areas for agricultural connectivity were represented by large, practically isolated fragments. In livestock areas, large fragments also had the highest connectivity values. However, smaller fragments in these areas also contributed to increased connectivity, unlike smaller fragments in agricultural areas. This research evidences the need to include environmental planning, that takes into account the forest remnants connectivity, in light of future legalized deforestation and as a way of maintaining biodiversity.

TI  - Coastal Vulnerability Assessment Of Gujarat Coast To Sea Level Rise Using Gis Techniques: A Preliminary Study
AB  - Assessing the preparedness of the coastal region to the anticipated sea level rise is a major task among the coastal management authority, where identification of relative vulnerable of coast is a prime concern. The present research work has utilized Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for assessing vulnerability of the Gujarat coast due to predicted sea level rise. Synergetic use of satellite remote sensing, numerical simulations and filed observations has been done to generate coastal thematic information followed by validation. Coastal vulnerability assessment of the entire Gujarat coast on 1:50,000 scale were carried out considering five physical parameters. They are; coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, shoreline change rate, mean spring tidal range, and significant wave height. The rank values of all the five physical variables are integrated through additive method to compute a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) where the relative ranking is assigned to various coastal segments based on the vulnerability level. The CVI values categorize Gujarat coast into four risk level classes. The results show that 785 km (45.67 %) of the Gujarat coast is under high to very high risk category and 934 km (54.33 %) of the Gujarat coast is under Moderate to Low risk category due to an anticipated rise in sea level. The coastal regions under very high risk category are along northwestern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat, the northernmost parts of the Gulf of Kachchh and western parts of the Kachchh coast. The southern parts of the Saurashtra coast and southwestern parts of the Kachchh coast is under the low risk category along with isolated segments along the eastern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat. The approach developed for assessing vulnerability of the coast to predicted sea level rise using remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used effectively by coastal management authorities and decision makers to devise better coastal zone management plans as well as to ensure efficient mitigation measures to minimize the losses due to possible impact of predicted sea level rise through which appropriate measures to protect life, property and environment can be timely planned. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Characterizing Global Satellite-Based Indicators For Coastal Vulnerability To Erosion Management As Exemplified By A Regional Level Analysis From Northeast Brazil
AB  - The detection of coastal vulnerability to erosion is crucial for decision-making regarding the economy, ecology, health, security, among other issues. Most of the studies gather a large data set about physical and anthropogenic interfer-ence's on the vulnerability of coastal erosion regions around the world. However, for developing nations like Brazil, with extensive shoreline, it is challenging to develop and maintain an in situ infrastructure to offer a systematical scientific data set. In this context, several methods like Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) for monitoring the dynamic behavior of coastal systems require in situ collected data. Therefore, this contribution explores the use of global open source satellite-based indicators to assess coastal vulnerability to erosion at a regional level adopting an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, the data set covers many spheres of the environ-ment like biophysical and social factors, adopting the Pernambuco State's coast, Brazil, as a case study. The results showed the direct relationship between a high level of urbanization and low vegetation with the high coastal vulnera-bility to erosion. PC1 revealed built-up and surface temperature vary inversely to the soil organic carbon and vegetation cover along about 20 km (approximate to 10\% of the shoreline extension). The hotspots were in the urban cluster (Paulista, Olinda, Recife, and Jaboatao dos Guararapes), combined with high shoreline change around -2 m/yr. PC2 showed the natural action of wind on wave heights combined with sediment removal and the backshore settlement along 10 km of extension (approximate to 5.5\% of the shoreline), with the highly vulnerable sites concentrated in Itamaraca Island and C. S. Agostinho. This approach benefits from the multi-satellite and multi-resolution data sets integration to unravel the statistical influence of each variable able to guide stakeholders.

TI  - Landsat Time Series Reveal Forest Loss And Woody Encroachment In The Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania
AB  - The Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) of Tanzania, is globally significant for biodiversity conservation due to the presence of iconic fauna, and, since 1959 has been managed as a unique multiple land-use areas to mutually benefit wildlife and indigenous residents. Understating vegetation dynamics and ongoing land cover change processes in protected areas is important to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable development. However, land cover changes in savannahs are especially difficult, as changes are often long-term and subtle. Here, we demonstrate a Landsat-based monitoring strategy incorporating (i) regression-based unmixing for the accurate mapping of the fraction of the different land cover types, and (ii) a combination of linear regression and the BFAST trend break analysis technique for mapping and quantifying land cover changes. Using Google Earth Pro and the EnMap-Box software, the fractional cover of the main land cover types of the NCA were accurately mapped for the first time, namely bareland, bushland, cropland, forest, grassland, montane heath, shrubland, water and woodland. Our results show that the main changes occurring in the NCA are the degradation of upland forests into bushland: we exemplify this with a case study in the Lerai Forest; and found declines in grassland and co-incident increases in shrubland in the Serengeti Plains, suggesting woody encroachment. These changes threaten the wellbeing of livestock, the livelihoods of resident pastoralists and of the wildlife dependent on these grazing areas. Some of the land cover changes may be occurring naturally and caused by herbivory, rainfall patterns and vegetation succession, but many are linked to human activity, specifically, management policies, tourism development and the increase in human population and livestock. Our study provides for the first time much needed and highly accurate information on long-term land cover changes in the NCA that can support the sustainable management and conservation of this unique UNESCO World Heritage Site.

TI  - A Basin-Level Analysis Of Flood Risk In Urban And Periurban Areas: A Case Study In The Metropolitan Region Of Buenos Aires, Argentina
AB  - Flooding in urban and periurban areas is a complex phenomenon that results from the interplay between urban expansion and the dynamics of the hydrological system. Understanding both processes is essential to manage flood risk. This study aimed to analyze the flood risk in urban and periurban areas of the upper and middle basin of the Lujan River (Metropolitan Region of Buenos Aires, Argentina) between 1985 and 2015. We assessed the factors that affect flood frequency by analyzing the precipitation variations obtained from meteorological data and applying hydrological models. We also used supervised classification of remote sensing imagery to detect increases in impervious surface areas that could enhance flooding. Furthermore, we combined both analyses to identify flood risk situations in the region. Our results indicated that maximum precipitation and hydrometric values remained stable during the study period, with a marked interannual variability due to the presence of dry and wet phases. During the dry phase (2011-2015), when flooding events were infrequent, there was a steady urban sprawl in the floodplain area and, as a result, more people would have subsequently become exposed to flood risk. Our results evidence the lack of regional policies to regulate the urban sprawl in flood risk regions.

TI  - Satellite Data And Geographic Information Systems For Fire And Resource Management In The Canadian Arctic
AB  - A method of analyzing remotely sensed data, a geographic information system, and an intelligent fire management system have been developed to provide integrated resource data for fire and other resources management. Natural and cultural features were digitized from 1:50,000 topographic maps using a geographic information system (GIS) to cover the 29 communities below the tree line in the western Canadian Arctic. Landsat Thematic Mapper data covering the same area were classified into land cover or fuel types. Detailed information on each fire such as location, area burned, date of discovery, fire number, fire zone, fire class and source of ignition was obtained and added to each map sheet as attribute data. A generalized vegetation cover map using NOAA AVHRR data was also obtained. The Intelligent Fire Management Information System (IFMIS) integrates relational data bases, geographic information display, and expert systems. It also has a spatial analysis procedure for forest fire preparedness planning. Linking the weather to the forest fuels through the Fire Weather Index system (FWI) and the Fire Behaviour Prediction System (FBPS), fire danger and fire behaviour are calculated and displayed, cell-by-cell. Values-at-risk and fire suppression resources are used in the dispatching and planning component of the system. The planning component allows the user to evaluate the coverage of fire suppression resources under the prevalent forecast fire behaviour conditions. Through the integration of data from the above systems, a set of maps were created which were used to analyze fire behaviour potential, identify fire hazards, and provide a basis for settlement protection strategies within the context of other land use activities such as wildlife harvesting and recreational activities. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Driving Factors Of Land Surface Temperature In Urban Agglomerations: A Case Study In The Pearl River Delta, China
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) in urban agglomerations plays an important role for policymakers in urban planning. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the regions with the highest urban densities in the world. This study aims to explore the spatial patterns and the dominant drivers of LST in the PRD. MODIS LST (MYD11A2) data from 2005 and 2015 were used in this study. First, spatial analysis methods were applied in order to determine the spatial patterns of LST and to identity the hotspot areas (HSAs). Second, the hotspot ratio index (HRI), as a metric of thermal heterogeneity, was developed in order to identify the features of thermal environment across the nine cities in the PRD. Finally, the geo-detector (GD) metric was employed to explore the dominant drivers of LST, which included elevation, land use/land cover (LUCC), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), impervious surface distribution density (ISDD), gross domestic product (GDP), population density (POP), and nighttime light index (NLI). The GD metric has the advantages of detecting the dominant drivers without assuming linear relationships and measuring the combined effects of the drivers. The results of Moran's Index showed that the daytime and nighttime LST were close to the cluster pattern. Therefore, this process led to the identification of HSAs. The HSAs were concentrated in the central PRD and were distributed around the Pearl River estuary. The results of the HRI indicated that the spatial distribution of the HSAs was highly heterogeneous among the cities for both daytime and nighttime. The highest HRI values were recorded in the cities of Dongguan and Shenzhen during the daytime. The HRI values in the cities of Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Huizhou were relatively lower in both daytime and nighttime. The dominant drivers of LST varied from city to city. The influence of land cover and socio-economic factors on daytime LST was higher in the highly urbanized cities than in the cities with low urbanization rates. For the cities of Zhaoqing, Huizhou, and Jiangmen, elevation was the dominant driver of daytime LST during the study period, and for the other cities in the PRD, the main driver changed from land cover in 2005 to NLI in 2015. This study is expected to provide useful guidance for planning of the thermal environment in urban agglomerations.

TI  - Assessing The Spatial Ecology And Resource Use Of A Mobile And Endangered Species In An Urbanized Landscape Using Satellite Telemetry And Dna Faecal Metabarcoding
AB  - The conservation of highly mobile species presents challenges to managers for assessment of threats to survival, given the difficulties in locating and observing such species. Here we evaluate satellite telemetry, DNA faecal metabarcoding and traditional field observations as three complementary techniques to acquire critical management information for an endangered species, Carnaby's Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus latirostris. Satellite telemetry of 23 birds resulted in 6026 location fixes accurate to within 500 m, and combined with extensive field observations and DNA faecal metabarcoding resulted in a more detailed understanding of how this species survives in an urbanized landscape. We identified 168 night roosts, 75\% of which were previously unknown, which will contribute towards a more accurate population size estimate based on annual counts of roosting birds. We also determined the scale of daily movements (morning 5.4 +/- 3.4 km from roost, afternoon 5.5 +/- 3.3 km to roost; maximum distance between consecutive roosts 69.7 km) and the size of foraging areas around roosts (range 17-276 km(2)), and identified dependence on a variety of native and exotic food sources. Field observations identified 11 food-plant families, but combined with DNA faecal metabarcoding this was extended to 21 food-plant families. The three techniques were compared to assess their individual and collective values. By combining spatial ecology information from satellite telemetry with ecological knowledge from field observation and DNA faecal analysis, we gained deeper insights into the ecology of the species than would have been possible from any one technique alone. This information will lead to more strategic conservation planning to allow this species to persist within a rapidly expanding urban environment.

TI  - Assessment Of Spatial Temporal Changes Of Ecological Environment Quality: A Case Study In Huaibei City, China
AB  - Under the short-term economic development goal, the excessive exploitation of natural resources and the destruction of the ecological environment make the ecological environment of Huaibei cities increasingly fragile. This study constructed the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) to evaluate the ecological environment change trend and its driving factors in Huaibei City from 2000 to 2020. The barycenter migration model was used to determine the RSEI spatial change trend, and the geographic detector was used to analyze the influencing factors of the RSEI value change. The results showed that: (1) the average RSEI value of Huaibei City generally fluctuates within the range of good and excellent grades. (2) The migration direction of the barycenter of RSEI is similar when the level of RSEI improves or decreases from 2000 to 2020, and the barycenter migration is most severe from 2005 to 2015. (3) The driving factors of RSEI change were population density (0.47) > land use (0.24) > slope (0.14) > precipitation (0.08) > temperature (0.04) > altitude (0.03). All the factors had interaction effects on the RSEI, mainly with nonlinear enhancement. (4) From 2000 to 2010, urban construction encroached on all kinds of land, which was the direct reason for the decline in ecological environment quality. From 2010 to 2020, the surge of water and meadow areas improved the ecological environment quality of Huaibei city. Therefore, reducing the expansion of artificial land, returning farmland to forests and meadows, wetland park construction, and other ecological protection measures are the keys to ensuring the sustainable development of regional social and economic development. This study can provide a reference and scientific basis for sustainable development strategy and ecological protection planning to improve the ecological environment quality of Huaibei City.

TI  - Pyeo: A Python Package For Near-Real-Time Forest Cover Change Detection From Earth Observation Using Machine Learning
AB  - Monitoring forest cover change from Earth observation data streams in near-real-time presents a challenge for automated change detection by way of a continuously updated big dataset. Even though deforestation is a significant global problem, forest cover changes in pairs of subsequent images happen relatively infrequently. Detecting a change can require the download and processing of tens, hundreds or even thousands of images. In geoscientific applications of Earth observation, machine learning algorithms are increasingly used. Once trained, a machine learning model can be applied to new images automatically. This paper introduces the open-access Python 3 package Pyeo - “Python for Earth Observation”. Pyeo provides a set of portable, extensible and modular Python functions for the automation of machine learning applications from Earth observation data streams, including automated search and download functionality, pre-processing and atmospheric correction, re-projection, creation of thematic base layers and machine learning classification or regression. Pyeo enables users to train their own machine learning models and then apply the models to newly downloaded imagery over their area of interest. This paper describes in detail how Pyeo works, its requirements, benefits, and a description of the libraries used. An application to the automated forest cover change detection in a region in Kenya is given. Pyeo can be used on cloud computing architectures such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Colab to provide scalable applications and processing solutions for the geosciences. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Throughfall, Stemflow, And Interception Characteristics Of Coniferous Forest Ecosystems In The Western Black Sea Region Of Turkey (Daday Example)
AB  - This study aims to identify precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, precipitation, and interception processes in pure black pine, pure Scots pine, and mixed black pine–Scots pine forest ecosystems and present the precipitation partitioning according to different stand types. Throughfall and stemflow measurements were performed using five standard precipitation gauges in a pilot area established to represent pure black pine, pure Scots pine, and mixed black pine–Scots pine stands in the Bezirgan Basin. The total precipitation was measured in an open field close to the study area. Throughfall values were calculated as the percentage of precipitation measured in an open field. According to the results of the study, the throughfall values were 69.8% in black pine, 73.9% in Scots pine, and 77.7% in the mixed black pine–Scots pine stands; the stemflow values were 2.6% in black pine, 5.9% in Scots pine, and 3.1% in the mixed black pine–Scots pine stands; the amounts of precipitation reaching the forest floor were 72.3% in black pine, 79.8% in Scots pine, and 80.7% in the mixed black pine–Scots pine stands; and the interception values were found to be 27.7% in black pine, 20.2% in Scots pine, and 19.2% in the mixed black pine–Scots pine stands. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Mppt Command Enhancement Based On An Ameliorated Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm For A Standalone Pv System
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) energy is a widely adopted renewable energy source renowned for its abundance, non-polluting attributes, and minimal maintenance requirements. Despite these benefits, it remains one of the l east efficient methods for converting sunlight to electricity. Moreover, PV cell efficiency substantially declines when they operate away from their maximum power point (MPP), which shifts based on varying environmental factors. Numerous strategies have been employed to track the MPP effectively. This research aims to enhance PV systems, especially those embedded in electric vehicles and satellites, by developing and refining a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm using the grey wolf optimization (GWO) method. This approach is designed to minimize oscillations around the global maximum power point tracker (GMPP) and reduce tracking time. The proposed technique has been corroborated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Results demonstrate that the advanced MPPT method significantly improves GMPP tracking by notably decreasing tracking time and diminishing power oscillations, thereby increasing the energy harnessed from mobile PV systems. This study markedly contributes to the enhancement of photovoltaic system efficiency and its more effective integration into portable devices. © 2023 I. Belaalia et al.

TI  - An Innovative Approach To Surface Deformation Estimation In Forest Road And Trail Networks Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Real-Time Kinematic-Derived Data For Monitoring And Maintenance
AB  - The significant increase in hiking, wood extraction, and transportation activities exerts a notable impact on the environmental balance along trails and forest roads in the form of soil degradation. The aim of this study was to develop a Deformation Classification Model for the surface of a multi-use trail, as well as to calculate sediment deposition and generate a flood hazard map in a partially forested region. The eBee X mapping Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with the senseFly S.O.D.A. 3D camera and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) technology flew over the study area of 149 ha in Northern Greece at an altitude of 120 m and achieved a high spatial resolution of 2.6 cm. The specific constellation of fixed-wing equipment makes the use of ground control points obsolete, compared to previous, in most cases polycopter-based, terrain deformation research. Employing the same methodology, two distinct classifications were applied, utilizing the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for analysis. The Geolocation Errors and Statistics for Bundle Block Adjustment exhibited a high level of accuracy in the model, with the mean values for each of the three directions (X, Y, Z) being 0.000023 m, −0.000044 m, and 0.000177 m, respectively. The standard deviation of the error in each direction was 0.022535 m, 0.019567 m, and 0.020261 m, respectively. In addition, the Root Mean Square (RMS) error was estimated to be 0.022535 m, 0.019567 m, and 0.020262 m, respectively. A total of 20 and 30 altitude categories were defined at a 4 cm spatial resolution, each assigned specific ranges of values, respectively. The area of each altitude category was quantified in square meters (m2), while the volume of each category was measured in cubic meters (m3). The development of a Deformation Classification Model for the deck of a trail or forest road, coupled with the computation of earthworks and the generation of a flood hazards map, represents an efficient approach that can provide valuable support to forest managers during the planning phase or maintenance activities of hiking trails and forest roads. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Rapid Conservation Assessment For Endangered Species Using Habitat Connectivity Models
AB  - To avoid extinction of rare species in regions of active environmental change, strategic approaches are needed to manage remaining habitat. When observations of dispersal or metapopulation information are not available, habitat connectivity simulations may offer a valuable alternative source of information to assess threats and evaluate conservation options. For the Critically Endangered San Martin titi monkey (Callicebus oenanthe) in north central Peru, an updated distribution model was generated and land cover in the heavily deforested northern range of the species was mapped. The value of remaining forest fragments was characterized and threats from future land use change were assessed using complementary connectivity models. It is estimated that the species range is less than 14 000 km(2). Remote sensing analysis reveals that at least 34\% of lowland forest in the northern range has been lost, while nearly 95\% of remaining habitat fragments are likely too small to support viable populations and less than 8\% of this habitat lies within conservation areas. Areas with the highest modelled connectivity comprise only10\% of the remaining forest in the northern range and small patches may contribute disproportionately to movement; these lands represent opportunities for conservation and reforestation to prevent potentially significant impacts from future mining and urban development. This study prioritized remaining suitable habitat patches using modelled connectivity and local knowledge to gain insight into the status of an understudied species. This approach offers a relatively rapid method to identify potential land use conflicts, and to further focus research and locally appropriate conservation.

TI  - New Israeli Civil Space Policy To Boost R&D And Commercial Space Industrial Base
AB  - Israel's space industry emerged from defense necessity, having its first launch in 1988. State budget was always low and mostly defense related, lately $76 million, of which only $3 million for the civil program administered by the Israeli Space Agency. The $3 million was highly leveraged, as 80% of the investment in space-related R&D in Israel so far came from foreign governments interested in cooperation and joint projects resulting in agreements with over 10 space agencies. Despite low budgets, achievements so far are remarkable: Israel was ranked number 1 in terms of publication per capita on aerospace engineering and has demonstrated capabilities and products in space infrastructure, products, and services, with leading optical equipment and small satellites. The space industrial base includes around 20 corporations employing 2,000-2,500 workers driving annual sales of $800 million, the eighth largest in the global space sector. Following a series of studies regarding the impact of the space industry on the Israeli economy, Israel adopted a new civil space policy, increasing civil budgets eightfold to a yearly $24 million. The goal is ambitious - with the new cash injection and capitalization on its lucrative defense, communications, and IT industries as a solid base, Israel plans on boosting its civil space industry, placing it among the top five leading nations in space, with yearly sales of $6-10 billion, representing 3-5% of the global space market. Success will make the space industry a driving force for economic growth. The lion's share of the budget will be allocated to international cooperation and projects. The two other major allocations are to industrial R&D and basic research. A key element launched by a directive promulgated in December 2012 is a targeted program by which state financial support will be provided to innovative commercial space R&D, considering mainly the novelty and uniqueness of the product/technology; their expected achievements and capacity to enhance and upgrade satellites' utility and performance; and their market. Support will amount to 50-85% of the project's budget, not exceeding $5.3 million, unless for ground-breaking projects. Considering past achievements with small budgets, this is a significant stimulus. Successful projects will pay the state royalties as a percentage from future income (3-6%), if (and only if) such is generated, until full repayment of the grant, thus having state bearing most of the project's risk. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Plant Communities And Landform Relationships Delineate The Components Of Soil Complexes Subject To Whole-Tree Harvest Restriction
AB  - Whole-tree harvesting practices are often restricted on soils with intrinsically low soil nutrients. Delineating restricted soil components from nonrestricted components presents a challenge for forest practitioners working with glaciofluvial parent materials. We investigated a suite of biological and edaphic factors to assess if restricted soil components are functionally distinct from nonrestricted soil components in partially restricted soil complexes across northern Wisconsin, USA. This study tested repeatable methods for soil delineation based on soil particle size, varying in spatial extent, and are independent of county boundaries or discrepancies across soil survey areas. Habitat type provided the most robust tool to distinguish the soil components and is the recommended approach. Habitat typing currently requires field data collection, since it does not exist as a geographic information system product in Wisconsin. Timber sale establishment often occurs during the off-season when habitat typing is not possible. In this case, an additional decision tree including habitat type and deviation from mean elevation (DEV) model is provided to estimate soil components remotely and verify the results when habitat typing is feasible. The 1,300-m radius DEV performed best with a 10-m digital elevation model, and reflects the differences between moraines and outwash plains landforms. These findings suggest that the utility of the DEV model and spatially explicit soil textural information in delineating restricted series from soil complexes has promise in light of improved remotely sensed information and geographic information system technologies that can be field-validated by habitat type. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Measuring Climate Action Readiness In Maintaining Ecological Resilience Using Satellite Imagery And Field Research In Garang Watershed, Central Java, Indonesia
AB  - The long-term viability of vegetation as a representation of land cover in a watershed is critical. However, more work is needed to develop vegetation management in the form of a climate action model that considers the existence of ecological and social values as a unified system, particularly in times of climate change. Moran's Index measurements and statistical correlation analysis were employed in this study to quantify geographical patterns. These measurements provide real-world judgment in developing aggressive climate response scenarios. Ecological values were derived from shifting vegetation trend indices due to mutual interaction between living beings that build a life cycle in harmony with the environment. Meanwhile, social values are determined by assessing individual internal factors such as attitudes, knowledge, and responses and external factors represented by local government institutions. The findings reveal that the distribution of residents and residential areas is dispersed. With a high confidence level, a linear index declines with R2 = 0.5872 for inhabitants and R2 = 0.9171 for residential areas. In the dry season, there is a significant relationship between the spatial pattern of vegetation indices and the inhabitant's index. The community's knowledge and attitudes considerably impact changes in vegetation indices, particularly during the rainy season, with R2 = 0.207 for SAVI and 0.232 for NDVI. Community readiness values, which elaborate on knowledge, attitudes, responses, and the role of external institutions, show that community readiness in the upstream area of the watershed, specifically in the Kendal District, is in the best position, with a value of 6.627976. On the contrary, the Semarang District, the upstream area, has the lowest value of 4.257092. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

TI  - Best Practices In Facial Nerve Monitoring
AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: Facial nerve monitoring (FNM) has evolved into a widely used adjunct for many surgical procedures along the course of the facial nerve. Even though majority opinion holds that FNM reduces the incidence of iatrogenic nerve injury, there are few if any studies yielding high-level evidence and no practice guidelines on which clinicians can rely. Instead, a review of the literature and medicolegal cases reveals significant variations in methodology, training, and clinical indications. Study Design: Literature review and expert opinion. Methods: Given the lack of standard references to serve as a resource for FNM, we assembled a multidisciplinary group of experts representing more than a century of combined monitoring experience to synthesize the literature and provide a rational basis to improve the quality of patient care during FNM. Results: Over the years, two models of monitoring have become well-established: 1) monitoring by the surgeon using a stand-alone device that provides auditory feedback of facial electromyography directly to the surgeon, and 2) a team, typically consisting of surgeon, technologist, and interpreting neurophysiologist. Regardless of the setting and the number of people involved, the reliability of monitoring depends on the integration of proper technical performance, accurate interpretation of responses, and their timely application to the surgical procedure. We describe critical steps in the technical set-up and provide a basis for context-appropriate interpretation and troubleshooting of recorded signals. Conclusions: We trust this initial attempt to describe best practices will serve as a basis for improving the quality of patient care while reducing inappropriate variations.

TI  - The Value Of Hydrologic Information For Watershed Management Programs: The Case Of Camboriu, Brazil
AB  - Investments in watershed services programs hold the promise to protect and restore ecosystems and water resources. The design and implementation of such programs is often accompanied by hydrologic modeling and monitoring, although the role of hydrologic information in meeting the needs of program managers remains undear. In the Camboriit watershed, Brazil, we explored the value of hydrologic modeling and monitoring with respect to two dimensions: scientific credibility and use of generated knowledge in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the watershed management program. We used a combination of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and hydrologic modeling under various levels of data availability to examine when improved models and data availability might build credibility and provide more useful information for decision makers. We found that hydrologic information was not actually used for the detailed design, but rather contributed to broad-scale support of the program by increasing scientific credibility. Model sophistication and data availability improved the credibility of hydrologic information but did not affect actual decisions related to program design. Hydrologic monitoring data were critical for model calibration, and high-resolution land use and land cover data, obtained via remote sensing, affected some model outputs which were not used to design the program. Our study suggests that identifying how hydrologic data will inform decision making should guide the level of effort used in hydrologic modeling and monitoring. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Analysis And Predictive Modeling Of The Coastal Zone Of The State Of Ceará
AB  - The coastal zone of the state of Ceará, Brazil, is a region characterized by its high population density and economic relevance. In recent decades, this region has presented several indicators of disequilibrium, with emphasis on increasingly intense erosive processes. This study performs a spatial-temporal analysis of the coastal zone of the state of Ceará for the last 35 years (1984– 2020), analyzing remote sensing data (LANDSAT) through the statistical variables present in the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. The net shoreline movement values show that 28% of the state coastline presents depositional tendencies, while 56% presents erosive tendencies. The linear regression rate and end point rate values indicate that 13% of the coastline is subject to depositional tendencies and 38% to erosive tendencies. The predicted values, using the Kalman Filter model, point to a percentage of 34% of the coast subject to depositional tendencies and 49% subject to erosive tendencies, until 2040. The results of this research point to the need for further studies of modeling and, especially, prediction of the coastline of the state of Ceará, to adequately support the coastal and marine planning of the state. © 2023, Universidade Estadual Paulista(UNESP).

TI  - The Post-Fire Stability Index; A New Approach To Monitoring Post-Fire Recovery By Satellite Imagery
AB  - Ecological resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following disturbance. With the frequency and severity of wildfire activity increasing due to warmer and drier global climate conditions, there are increasing reports of declines in ecological resilience and ecosystems at risk of collapse due to post-fire recovery failure. Observational monitoring of post-fire recovery at the landscape scale is important to understand drivers, identify vulnerable ecosystems and prioritize management intervention to support resilience. Defining a suitably representative baseline condition to compare post-fire recovery states against can be challenging, particularly in broad-scale remote sensing approaches. Here, we introduce a new approach to monitoring post-fire recovery by satellite imagery, the post-fire stability index. The method is based on the concept that a disturbed system state will be reflected by increasing or decreasing rates of system change, while undisturbed or recovered system states are characterised by near-zero rates of change. This reflects the typical pattern of diminishing rate of change in post-fire recovery trajectories. We demonstrate strong performance and suitability of the post-fire stability index in comparison to alternative approaches through time series analyses, and independent validation from post-fire vegetation surveys taken at one-year post-fire. The post-fire stability index was consistently the best performing model across all field measures of vegetative response following the fire event. In ecosystems which exhibit post -fire resprouting, higher values in the post-fire stability index were associated with higher levels of field-based measures of foliage projective cover and canopy cover (+/-resprouting), and with lower levels of basal and no resprouting. The post-fire stability index provides a relatively simple and practical solution for consistent broad-scale monitoring post-fire recovery with satellite imagery, which together with standardised fire severity mapping, provide extensive opportunities for further fire and landscape ecology research.

TI  - Estimation Of Pm2.5 Concentration In Sichuan Province Based On Improved Linear Mixed Effect Model And Geo-Intelligent Random Forest
AB  - High-resolution PM2.5 spatial distribution data is of great significance for the dynamic monitoring and control of PM2.5 pollution. Himawari-8 AOD data, ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data, DEM, land-use data, and luminous remote-sensing data were selected as estimating variables, using an improved resampling method for data matching and an improved linear mixed model (iLME) combined with a Geo-intelligent random forest model to build the combined model for estimating PM2.5 concentration. The results showed that: ① Among the estimated variables selected, AOD, SP, TEMP, RH, and BLH were important factors affecting the PM2.5 concentration of Sichuan Province in 2016, and their correlation coefficients were 0.65, 0.58, 0.55, 0.54, and 0.35, respectively. ② The prediction accuracy of the iLME+Geoi-RF model was greatly improved compared to that of other models. The model-fitted R2, RMSR, and MAE were 0.94, 5.72 μg•m-3, and 3.92 μg•m-3, and the cross-validated R2, RMSR, and MAE were 0.82, 10.20 μg•m-3, and 6.44 μg•m-3, respectively. The model can obtain more accurate spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in Sichuan Province and provide a more reasonable scientific reference for regional air quality assessment, human exposure risk assessment, and environmental pollution control. ③ There was a significant seasonal difference in PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province, with the highest concentration of PM2.5 in winter, followed by spring and autumn, with the concentration of PM2.5 in summer being the lowest. In 2016, the monthly average PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province showed a V shape that first decreased and then increased, with the minimum value in June, the maximum value in December, and slight fluctuations in August and November. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration in the eastern area of Sichuan Province was generally higher than that in the west, and the local pollution level was relatively high. The high-valued areas were mainly distributed in the eastern region, where the cities have been developing rapidly and the population was densely distributed, whereas the low-valued areas were mainly distributed in the western region, where it is sparsely populated with backward economic development. ④ Although the overall distribution of PM2.5 concentration estimated by the different models was essentially the same, the iLME+Geoi-RF model could more accurately and effectively estimate the spatial distribution of pollution in this study area. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Applications Of Uavs In Plantation Health And Area Management In Malaysia
AB  - The scope of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as "drone technology," is increasing, with various applications in the field of remote sensing and environment. UAVs not only provide high-resolution, real-time data, but also have different applications for end users. They have become an essential tool for land surveyors because traditional land survey methods are expensive and time-consuming, requiring trained professionals and many hours to measure a single plot of land. With the advancement of UAVs, we can significantly reduce the cost. In this study, we have collected UAV data in Malaysia to acquire information about the plantation management practices, as well as oil palm health assessment. Our results showed that multispectral data collected from a UAV-borne MicaSense RedEdge camera is useful for identifying physiological stress in mature oil palm plants, which clearly illustrates stunted tree crown with low value of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

TI  - Ethno-Meteorology And Scientific Weather Forecasting: Small Farmers And Scientists' Perspectives On Climate Variability In The Okavango Delta, Botswana
AB  - Recent trends in abrupt weather changes continue to pose a challenge to agricultural production most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper specifically addresses the questions on how local farmers read and predict the weather; and how they can collaborate with weather scientists in devising adaptation strategies for climate variability (CV) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Recent trends in agriculture-related weather variables available from country's climate services, as well as in freely available satellite rainfall products were analysed. The utility of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system for the study area in the context of supporting farmer's information needs were assessed. Through a multi-stage sampling procedure, a total of 592 households heads in 8 rural communities in the Okavango Delta were selected and interviewed using open and close-ended interview schedules. Also, 19 scientists were purposively selected and interviewed using questionnaires. Key informant interviews, focus group and knowledge validation workshops were used to generate qualitative information from both farmers and scientists. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in summarising the data. Analysis of satellite rainfall products indicated that there was a consistent increase in total annual rainfall throughout the region in the last 10 years, accompanied by an increase in number of rain days, and reduction of duration of dry spells. However, there is a progressive increase in the region's temperatures leading to increase in potential evaporation. Findings from social surveys show that farmers' age, education level, number of years engaged in farming, sources of weather information, knowledge of weather forecasting and decision on farming practices either had a significant relationship or correlation with their perceptions about the nature of both local {[}ethno-meteorological] and scientific weather knowledge. Nonetheless, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of farmers in relation to their perceptions and those of the climate scientists about the nature of both local and Western knowledge. As farmers are adept at judging seasonal patterns through long-standing ethno-meteorology, one major CV adaptation measure is their ability to anticipate changes in future weather conditions, which enables them to adjust their farming calendars and make decisions on crop type selection in any given season.

TI  - Surveillance Of Foodborne Disease .1. Purposes And Types Of Surveillance Systems And Networks
AB  - This is the first part of a four-part series on foodborne disease surveillance. Although these articles are primarily built on expertise gained within North America, the substance is of value to any community or country wishing to initiate or improve its surveillance system. Foodborne disease surveillance is necessary for preventing further spread of foodborne disease and includes identifying and controlling outbreaks at the time they are occurring; gathering data on incidence of these diseases and prevalence of their etiologic agents, vehicles, and reservoirs; identifying factors that led to the outbreaks; providing a data bank for HACCP systems and risk assessments; estimating health and economic impacts of foodborne diseases; and providing information upon which to base rational food safety program goals and priorities. Reports of outbreaks by local health agencies to regional and, then, national agencies responsible for disease surveillance, laboratory isolations of certain foodborne pathogens from human beings, sentinel community studies, and hazard surveillance are the types of foodborne disease surveillance activities that are used to varying extents in Canada and the U.S. In recent years, some national surveillance reports have been collated internationally in Europe and Latin America. Surveillance at local, state/provincial, national, and international levels must be coordinated for effective and rapid transfer of data. Computer software can assist investigation and management of the information submitted through surveillance networks. Information summarized on individual reports usually includes (a) location of the event, (b) clinical data, (c) epidemiologic data, (d) laboratory findings, and (e) results of on-site investigations. Each outbreak report should be subjected to critical review before classifying it into the various categories of surveillance data. Such a review would also be useful when comparing surveillance data from different places and intervals. Highlights of individual reports are tabulated as line listings that are the direct sources of surveillance data, which are the subject of the second and third parts of this series.

TI  - Marine Mammals Of Mexico: Richness Patterns, Protected Areas, And Conservation Trends
AB  - Mexico registers about 60\% of the total of marine mammals worldwide. However, species listed under a risk category show that, globally, Mexico faces big marine mammal conservation challenges. Thus, it becomes essential to successfully apply the existing knowledge into interdisciplinary conservation programs. We generated a presence/absence species richness map containing all 47 marine mammal species recorded in Mexico's Exclusive Economic Zone. After selecting nine oceanographic variables influencing marine mammal species richness, the top three factors influencing such richness were sea surface temperature and dissolved oxygen grouped in component \#1, and salinity composed component \#2. We also identified the species that are protected within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) category and its representation in management programs of these areas. Currently, 98\% of marine mammal species distributed in Mexican waters are protected within an MPA; nevertheless, around 12\% of them are not listed in management programs. Three priority sites in the Pacific Ocean and one for the Gulf of Mexico were identified to promote their conservation. Considering the sentinel and umbrella attributes of marine mammals, the information presented here will not only benefit their populations, but will also contribute to address marine species and ecosystems threats and improve the effectiveness of conservation plans.

AB  - 1. Hen harriers Circus cyaneus prey on red grouse Lagopus l. scoticus and high breeding densities of harriers can limit the number of grouse available for shooting in the autumn. Ultimately, grouse hunting contributes to the maintenance of heather moorland, an ecologically important habitat for biodiversity in general and hen harriers in particular. Predation rates vary widely among harrier individuals. Understanding which factors influence this variation would be useful to target management to mitigate the effect of harriers on grouse, such as diversionary feeding. 2. We used a simple habitat-based approach to test whether we could identify harrier nests to which most grouse were delivered. Using remote sensing habitat data, we tested whether delivery rates of dead grouse to the nest by hen harriers were higher for those pairs nesting in sites with more heather Calluna vulgaris. A relationship between heather cover and grouse delivery rates might have been expected as grouse densities were correlated with heather cover. 3. After adjusting for annual variation in grouse abundance, the rate at which grouse were delivered to harrier nests was positively associated with the proportion of heather cover within 2 km of harrier nests. This was primarily due to the positive effect of heather cover on female delivery rates. 4. This result allowed us to use habitat data to predict the harrier nests to which most grouse chicks would be delivered. Comparison of predictions of the model with observations of food delivery to nests indicated that, in terms of grouse chick delivery, the model correctly predicted the top 50\% of harrier nests in five of six years. 5. We undertook an experiment where carrion was provided to certain harriers at nest sites, in order to decrease their predation on grouse. Data from this experiment showed that when harriers were given diversionary food, the relationship between grouse predation rate and habitat was removed, with grouse predation reduced to negligible levels in most cases. This demonstrated the increased benefit of feeding birds with the highest proportion of heather cover within 2 km of their nest sites, rather than feeding birds at random within the conflict population. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of heather cover around hen harrier nests can be used to predict which pairs will predate most grouse within a population. This information should facilitate targeted management practices, which may accrue greater benefit for grouse stocks and potentially reduce the conflict between grouse shooting and conservation of biodiversity.

TI  - Characterising The Progress In Hiv/Aids Research In The Middle East And North Africa
AB  - Objectives The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is perceived to have limited HIV data. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterise the progress in HIV research in this region since the discovery of the epidemic. Methods Four indices were defined and implemented to measure the progress of HIV research using the PubMed, Embase, MENA HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Synthesis Project and US Census Bureau HIV/AIDS Surveillance databases. The four indices provide complementary measures to characterise different aspects of the progress of HIV research. Results A total of 2118, 2352, 683 and 4889 records were identified through the PubMed, the Embase, the Synthesis Project and the HIV Prevalence indices, respectively. The proportion of the total global HIV records that relate to MENA is 1.2%. Overall, the indices show steady progress in the number of new records every year, with an accelerated pace in the last few years. The rate of progress in MENA was also higher than the rate of progress in HIV records globally. There is no evidence so far of stabilisation or a peak in the number of new records year by year. About half of the records were produced after the year 2005. The number of records shows large heterogeneity across countries. Conclusions MENA has witnessed a rapid growth in HIV research over the last decade. However, there are still large gaps in HIV scientific evidence in the region, and the progress is far from being uniform across countries. Ongoing and future research needs to be geared towards academic standard and production of scientific publications.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Expansion And Determinants Of Light Pollution In India's Riparian Habitats
AB  - As the world embraced Artificial Light at Night (ALAN) and its numerous benefits, the transforming nocturnal environment witnessed the negative impacts of this contaminant of emerging concern, and its consequent Light Pollution, on the fitness and populations of numerous organisms. Over the decades, India's unbridled population growth and rapid urbanization have accelerated the use of ALAN yet research on light pollution, in India, as a potential biodiversity threat remains almost untapped. The present study utilized nighttime light data from the Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiation Suite Day-Night Band (VIIRS DNB) to investigate the spatio-temporal trends of ALAN across India's major river basins, emphasizing on critical riparian habitats. The study also aimed to identify the significant effects on night-time brightness in these habitats. Our findings indicated the year, riparian fauna group and presence within and near protected areas as significant determinants of light pollution in the riparian habitats of species of conservation concern. Light pollution was observed to grow in these habitats from the year 2012 to 2020. Higher radiance, in general, were observed for habitats near conurbations, airports, ports and docks, petroleum refineries, thermal power plants, and nuclear power stations. Otter and Turtle habitats had higher night-time brightness than other groups. The significant increase of ALAN within a span of eight years is concerning, particularly for the critically endangered gharial, which was observed to inhabit predominantly darker habitats. This, along with the gaps in our knowledge regarding the effects of ALAN on these species, urgently warrants a better understanding of its effects in riparian ecosystems. We have highlighted research gaps on ALAN from India's perspective and suggest that national biodiversity programs should evaluate ALAN as a potential biodiversity threat to limit its expansion in critical riparian ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - 76-Year Decline And Recovery Of Aspen Mediated By Contrasting Fire Regimes: Longunburned, Infrequent And Frequent Mixedseverity Wildfire
AB  - Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is a valued, minor component on northeastern California landscapes. It provides a wide range of ecosystem services and has been in decline throughout the region for the last century. This decline may be explained partially by the lack of fire on the landscape due to heavier fire suppression, as aspen benefit from fire that eliminates conifer competition and stimulates reproduction through root suckering. However, there is little known about how aspen stand area changes in response to overlapping fire. Our study area in northeastern California on the Lassen, Modoc and Plumas National Forests has experienced recent large mixed-severity wildfires where aspen was present, providing an opportunity to study the re-introduction of fire. We observed two time periods; a 52-year absence of fire from 1941 to 1993 preceding a 24-year period of wildfire activity from 1993 to 2017. We utilized aerial photos and satellite imagery to delineate aspen stands and assess conifer cover percent. We chose aspen stands in areas where wildfires overlapped (twice-burned), where only a single wildfire burned, and areas that did not burn within the recent 24-year period. We observed these same stands within the first period of fire exclusion for comparison (i.e., 1941 1993). In the absence of fire, all aspen stand areas declined and all stands experienced increases in conifer composition. After wildfire, stands that burned experienced a release from conifer competition and increased in stand area. Stands that burned twice or at high severity experienced a larger removal of conifer competition than stands that burned once at low severity, promoting expansion of aspen stand area. Stands with less edge:area ratio also expanded in area more with fire present. Across both time periods, stand movement, where aspen stand footprints were mostly in new areas compared to footprints of previous years, was highest in smaller stands. In the fire exclusion period, smaller stands exhibited greater loss of area and changes in location (movement) than in the return of fire period, highlighting their vulnerability to loss via succession to conifers in the absence of disturbances that provide adequate growing space for aspen over time. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Assessment Of Ecosystem Health By Optimizing Vigor-Organization-Resilience Model: A Case Study In Fuzhou City, China
AB  - Although remote sensing technology has been used to evaluate regional ecosystem health for a long time, it is still necessary to find a suitable index system to better evaluate ecosystem health. This study aims to improve the ecosystem health measurement ability of remote sensing technology. This research was carried out in Fuzhou under the traditional Vigor-Organization-Resilience (VOR) framework by optimizing and improving the construction method of sub-indexes. Sub-indexes were constructed using spectral index analysis, landscape theoretical ecology model and spatial measurement. Three remote sensing datasets were used (1996, 2008 and 2021) to carry out remote sensing diagnosis of regional ecosystem health in the Fuzhou administrative region. The main research findings and conclusions were as follows. A new comprehensive vigor index (CVI) was developed by the principal component analysis (PCA) based on the four indicators: fractional vegetation cover (FVC), global vegetation moisture index (GVMI), vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), normalized differential buildup and bare soil index (NDBSI). A new organizational index was constructed based on the landscape index. Four types of indexes, namely landscape heterogeneity (LH), landscape connectivity (LC), the shape characteristics of forest patches (CS) and the connectivity of forest patches (CC) were used as the main factors for calculating the organizational index. A resilience index calculation framework was proposed based on the habitat quality model. The temporal and spatial characteristics of ecosystem health were evaluated and analyzed. The regional ecosystem health value of the whole region reduced gradually, with average values of 0.3521 (1996), 0.3445 (2008) and 0.3345 (2021) respectively. The average reduction rate was 0.0007 per year (1996-2021). The proposed remote sensing diagnosis method provides a complete framework for solving the problems of measuring the dynamic evolution process and characteristics of regional ecosystem health.

TI  - Construction And Optimization Of Ecological Security Pattern In Three-River-Source National Park Based On Ecological Sensitivity And Landscape Connectivity
AB  - The function of the national ecological security barrier in Three - River - Source National Park is prominent, so it is of great significance to construct and optimize its ecological security pattern. Based on the land use and remote sensing data in 2020, and the morphological pattern spatial analysis method (MSPA), we constructed the ecological sensitivity evaluation system. In addition, we extracted the important ecological corridors and potential ecological corridors to form the ecological security pattern of Three - River - Source National Park. The functions of the ecological security pattern were optimized using the minimum cumulative resistance model and the gravity model. The results are as follows: (1) The ecological source area of Three-River-Source National Park was 26 833 km2, accounting for 21. 80% of the total area. (2) A total of 9 important ecological corridors (536. 62 km) and 55 potential ecological corridors (6 080. 15 km) were extracted, among which 45 potential ecological corridors (5 124. 17 km) and 8 important ecological corridors (522. 10 km) were extracted from the Yangtze River Source Park and Lancang River Source Park. Meanwhile, 10 potential ecological corridors (955. 98 km) and 1 important ecological corridor (14. 52 km) were extracted from Huangheyuan Park. (3) Optimization of the ecological functions of Three-River-Source National Park results in a core protection area (39 613. 58 km2 ), an ecological conservation area (67 261. 84 km2 ), a recreation exhibition area (10 143. 44 km2 ) and a traditional utilization area (6 081. 34 km2 ), accounting for 32. 18%, 54. 64%, 8. 24%, and 4. 94% respectively. The results provided reference value for the spatial planning of Three - River - Source National Park and future function optimization of national ecological security barriers. © 2023 Resources and Environment in the Yangtze Basin.

TI  - Distribution And Habitat Use Of The Madagascar Peregrine Falcon: First Estimates For Area Of Habitat And Population Size
AB  - Accurately demarcating distributions of biological taxa has long been at the core of ecology. Yet our understanding of the factors defining species range limits is incomplete, especially for tropical species in the Global South. Human-driven threats to the survival of many taxa are increasing, particularly habitat loss and climate change. Identifying distributional range limits of at-risk and data-limited species using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can thus inform spatial conservation planning to mitigate these threats. The Madagascar Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus radama is the resident sub-species of the Peregrine Falcon complex distributed across Madagascar, Mayotte, and the Comoros Islands. There are currently significant knowledge gaps regarding its distribution, habitat preferences, and population size. Here, we use penalized logistic regression and environmental ordination to identify Madagascar Peregrine Falcon habitat in both geographic and environmental space and propose a population size estimate based on inferred habitat. From the penalized logistic regression model, the core habitat area of the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon extends across the central and northern upland plateau of Madagascar with patchier habitat across coastal and low-elevation areas. Range-wide habitat use in both geographic and environmental space indicated positive associations with high elevation and aridity, coupled with high vegetation heterogeneity and >95\% herbaceous landcover, but general avoidance of areas >30\% cultivated land and >10\% mosaic forest. Based on inferred high-class habitat from the penalized logistic regression model, we estimate this habitat area could potentially support a population size ranging between 150 and 300 pairs. Following IUCN Red List guidelines, this subspecies would be classed as 'Vulnerable' due to its small population size. Despite its potentially large range, the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon has specialised habitat requirements and would benefit from targeted conservation measures based on spatial models to maintain viable populations.

TI  - Pirra Jungku: Comparison Of Traditional And Contemporary Fire Practices On Karajarri Country, Western Australia
AB  - Traditional fire practices in Australia's deserts may have created mosaics of post-fire seral stages that benefitted some plants and animals. Managing fire to emulate the patterns produced by traditional burning practices is a common objective in contemporary conservation planning in Australia's deserts. However, the extent to which traditional burning in deserts affected fire regimes across space and time is contested. We aim to contribute to knowledge about the impacts of traditional burning on fire patterns in the Great Sandy Desert, northwest Australia. Our study covered the traditional lands of the Karajarri people, where some families were living a traditional lifestyle on Country until the 1960s. We analysed high-quality aerial photographs taken over 18,000 km(2) of Karajarri Country in the 1940s. Fire footprints up to several years old were mapped from these images, and their spatial characteristics were compared to those of contemporary fire regimes over the same area, visualised using high-resolution Sentinel satellite imagery. Fires in the 1940s (considered traditional) were more numerous but much smaller than contemporary (2016-2020) fires. The areal extent of recently burnt areas was smaller and the fire frequency was lower in the 1940s. Contemporary fire patterns around cultural sites differed little from fire patterns elsewhere in the landscape, possibly because people were burning over large areas rather than only at localised sites. Our study suggests that Karajarri influenced fire patterns at a landscape scale in the Great Sandy Desert, at least during periods of average rainfall. The findings are helping Karajarri refine fire management goals, for example, by informing the size and dispersion of future burns, and supporting community discussion about fire and culture. Fire management outcomes for plants and animals are being tracked with a biodiversity monitoring program.

TI  - Using Water Residency Time To Enhance Spatio-Temporal Connectivity For Conservation Planning In Seasonally Dynamic Freshwater Ecosystems
AB  - Addressing spatial connectivity in conservation planning is important to ensure the maintenance of patterns and processes needed to support the persistence of biodiversity. In freshwater ecosystems, spatial connectivity is constrained by the presence of water, which exhibits marked temporal changes in regions with wetdry seasonal climates. Previous studies have focused on spatial connectivity and overlooked the temporal component, which is required for the functionality of spatial connections (because of temporal changes in water availability). We identify priority areas for the conservation of freshwater fish, waterbirds and turtles in the Mitchell River catchment in the wetdry tropics of northern Australia. We demonstrate how adequacy of freshwater conservation can be enhanced by integrating an estimate of water residency time (WRT) into the prioritization process. WRT reflects refugial potential and connectivity in freshwater ecosystems and was quantified using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flood and post-flood Landsat satellite imagery. We compare the spatial allocation of priority areas and the spatial and temporal connectivity under two alternative scenarios: (i) accounting only for spatial connectivity and (ii) integrating spatial and temporal connectivity. Priority areas identified under the spatial and temporal connectivity scenario showed a 40\% increase in WRT values with respect to the traditional spatial connectivity scenario. This was achieved at no additional cost in terms of total protected area and maintaining the same spatial connectivity. Despite priority areas identified under the two alternative scenarios showing intermediate spatial overlap (64\%), the selection process was more efficiently biased towards planning units with high WRT values. WRT in planning units that were only selected under the temporal connectivity scenario was 2.5 times higher than in planning units that only appeared in the traditional connectivity scenario. This reveals the importance of accounting for WRT when identifying freshwater priority areas in wetdry seasonal environments. Synthesis and applications: Considering the temporal connectivity in conservation prioritization as we propose here helps to assess periods of longest spatial connections, thereby maximizing the refugial role of freshwater priority areas during dry periods. Using publicly available satellite imagery data and software, our approach allows improved management of aquatic resources and biodiversity during periods of water scarcity, which may increase in incidence and duration with climate change.

TI  - Diagnosing Pristine Pine Forest Development Through Pansharpened-Surface-Reflectance Landsat Image Derived Aboveground Biomass Productivity
AB  - A map of natural forest aboveground biomass (AGB) can serve as a baseline for forest managers to integrate multi-temporal information to account for the trend of reducing carbon emission from the forest degradation over time. Taking advantage of spectral and spatial enhancement in Landsat OLI images, a machine learning based kNN algorithm was applied to derive AGB maps of a pristine forest of Pinus kesiya in 2014 and 2019 via allometric models of the pine and inventory data. AGB productivity of the study site was derived and examined for diagnosing the pristine pine forest development. The radiance of the Landsat image was first restored and then normalized by the FLAASH model, a radiation transfer model-based algorithm used to derive surface reflectance image, and finally a pansharpening technique was applied to improve the spatial resolution while retaining the spectral resolution of the reflectance image. Results showed that the pansharpened surface reflectance image was able to derive AGB maps with a satisfactory accuracy of root mean square percentage error, RMSPE = 15\%, which shows significant improvement on the performance of AGB estimation using the raw image (RMSPE = 56\%) and non-pansharpened surface reflectance image (RMSPE = 48\%). The loss of AGB stocks is mainly caused by landslide, forest fire, and agricultural expansion, particularly the use of fire for land preparation for cropping. Land covers other than pine stands have complicated the edge of the pristine pine forest. The non-forest cover types surrounded the forest enlarged the boundary of the forest and made the pristine forest slightly fragmented. The results also showed that the AGB loss/gain of a forest parcel is negatively/positively related to the size of the parcel. Appropriate forest land zoning and community-based forest management for the surrounding non-pristine pine forest could have the benefit of mitigating the degradation of the pristine pine forest and improving the biomass stocks for better REDD achievements.

TI  - Utilizing Multiple Lines Of Evidence To Determine Landscape Degradation Within Protected Area Landscapes: A Case Study Of Chobe National Park, Botswana From 1982 To 2011
AB  - The savannas of Southern Africa are an important dryland ecosystem as they cover up to 54% of the landscape and support a rich variety of biodiversity. This paper evaluates landscape change in savanna vegetation along Chobe Riverfront within Chobe National Park Botswana, from 1982 to 2011 to understand what change may be occurring in land cover. Classifying land cover in savanna environments is challenging because the vegetation spectral signatures are similar across distinct vegetation covers. With vegetation species and even structural groups having similar signatures in multispectral imagery difficulties exist in making discrete classifications in such landscapes. To address this issue, a Random Forest classification algorithm was applied to predict land-cover classes. Additionally, time series vegetation indices were used to support the findings of the discrete land cover classification. Results indicate that a landscape level vegetation shift has occurred across the Chobe Riverfront, with results highlighting a shift in land cover towards more woody vegetation. This represents a degradation of vegetation cover within this savanna landscape environment, largely due to an increasing number of elephants and other herbivores utilizing the Riverfront. The forested area along roads at a further distance from the River has also had a loss of percent cover. The continuous analysis during 1982-2011, utilizing monthly AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values, also verifies this change in amount of vegetation is a continuous and ongoing process in this region. This study provides land use planners and managers with a more reliable, efficient and relatively inexpensive tool for analyzing land-cover change across these highly sensitive regions, and highlights the usefulness of a Random Forest classification in conjunction with time series analysis for monitoring savanna landscapes. © 2016 by the authors.

TI  - Blue Accounting Approaches In The Emerging African Blue Economy Context
AB  - The Blue Economy (BE) relates to the sustainable use and conservation of marine and freshwater environments. Accounting for the BE has not yet been undertaken in African countries due to disparities in data collection related to social, economic, and ecological components of the BE; it is a critical factor in decision and/or policymaking associated with BE objectives. This review provides a conceptual understanding of blue accounting and outlines some of the best practices, lessons learned, and key policy messages in blue accounting systems. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) Blue Economy Valuation Toolkit (BEVTK) recently paved the way for the development of an African national BE accounting system. The aim of the BEVTK was to build a tool capable of capturing and recording various dimensions of human interaction with the ‘blue environment’. It is organised around three easily comprehensible modules that address the above-mentioned dimensions. The toolkit has provided a meaningful overview of the BE in the Seychelles to better understand the economic importance of its industries and can capture changes in stocks of natural capital and ecosystem services. The main challenge is in collecting the necessary information needed to run the toolkit. The application of the BEVTK can therefore be seen as part of the preparatory phase for development of proper BE accounting which should be done in a unified way to ensure that all above-mentioned dimensions are taken into consideration within a customizable framework. Such a unified approach will allow comparisons between countries as data collection, analysis and presentation will be standardised. Copyright © 2023 by the author(s).

TI  - Multispectral Vegetation Indices And Machine Learning Approaches For Durum Wheat (Triticum Durum Desf.) Yield Prediction Across Different Varieties
AB  - Durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) is one of the most widely cultivated cereal species in the Mediterranean basin, supporting pasta, bread and other typical food productions. Considering its importance for the nutrition of a large population and production of high economic value, its supply is of strategic significance. Therefore, an early and accurate crop yield estimation may be fundamental to planning the purchase, storage, and sale of this commodity on a large scale. Multispectral (MS) remote sensing (RS) of crops using unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a powerful tool to assess crop status and productivity with a high spatial-temporal resolution and accuracy level. The object of this study was to monitor the behaviour of thirty different durum wheat varieties commonly cultivated in Italy, taking into account their spectral response to different vegetation indices (VIs) and assessing the reliability of this information to estimate their yields by Pearson's correlation and different machine learning (ML) approaches. VIs allowed us to separate the tested wheat varieties into different groups, especially when surveyed in April. Pearson's correlations between VIs and grain yield were good (R2 > 0.7) for a third of the varieties tested; the VIs that best correlated with grain yield were CVI, GNDVI, MTVI, MTVI2, NDRE, and SR RE. Implementing ML approaches with VIs data highlighted higher performance than Pearson's correlations, with the best results observed by random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models.

TI  - The Last Mile In School Access: Mapping Education Deserts In Developing Countries
AB  - With recent advances in high-resolution satellite imagery and machine vision algorithms, fine-grain geospatial data on population are now widely available: kilometer-by-kilometer, worldwide. In this paper, we showcase how researchers and policymakers in developing countries can leverage these novel data to precisely identify “education deserts” – localized areas where families lack physical access to education – at unprecedented scale, detail, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate how these analyses could valuably inform educational access initiatives like school construction and transportation investments, and outline a variety of analytic extensions to gain deeper insight into the state of school access across a given country. We conduct a proof-of-concept analysis in the context of Guatemala, which has historically struggled with educational access, as a demonstration of the utility, viability, and flexibility of our proposed approach. We find that the vast majority of Guatemalan population lives within 3 km of a public primary school, indicating a generally low incidence of distance as a barrier to education in that context. However, we still identify concentrated pockets of population for whom the distance to school remains prohibitive, revealing important geographic variation within the strong country-wide average. Finally, we show how even a small number of optimally-placed schools in these areas, using a simple algorithm we develop, could substantially reduce the incidence of education deserts in this context. We make our entire codebase available to the public – fully free, open-source, heavily documented, and designed for broad use – allowing analysts across contexts to easily replicate our proposed analyses for other countries, educational levels, and public goods more generally. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Carbon Storage In A Peri-Urban Neotropical Forest: Assessing Its Potential And Patterns Of Change Over Half A Century
AB  - Forest ecosystems are associated with environmental regulation services, such as carbon storage, which is an outstanding service. Carbon fluxes in cities are difficult to estimate due to the scale at which they are addressed, particularly at the local level. In this work, we were interested in determining the carbon stored in the aboveground biomass of the tropical montane cloud forest tree species located on the western periphery of the city of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. With these data, we interpolated the storage and sequestration over five decades through image satellites and aerial photography of this unique forest. Additionally, to assess this potential as a basis for a biodiversity contribution to city resilience, we conducted phytosociological sampling. Native species such as Quercus xalapensis, Liquidambar styraciflua var. mexicana and Q. lancifolia showed the most significant values of 72.92, 58.79, and 49.14 Mg ha−1, respectively, of carbon. We used phytosociological sampling to better understand structural and functional features of urban forest biodiversity that can contribute to management practices for adaptation to climate change. In addition, the native species currently studied offer an opportunity for the city to implement better-targeted reforestation and ecological restoration programs for integrated landscaping in urban planning. Our results suggest that between 1966 and 2022, there was a forest recovery of 52.4 ha and an increase in urban areas of 63.4 ha, which is equivalent to an increase from 7,700.86 Mg ha−1 in 1966 to 12,620.00 Mg ha−1 in 2022. In this context, it is possible to both recover the vegetation cover and expand the city, thus avoiding part of the loss of ecosystem services that urbanization usually implies. This should be promoted among decision-makers and citizens in urban planning. Recovery processes can take place successfully in some cases even as urban areas expand. This possibility is relevant due to the many contributions that vegetation provides to citizens, including carbon storage. The opportunity to study five decades allows us to know the history, monitor the processes and make a projection to conserve the vegetation and improve management. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Analysis From The New Solar Radiation Atlas For Saudi Arabia
AB  - This paper presents one of the first discussions on the new Solar Atlas of Saudi Arabia, which was launched in February 2014. It assesses selected solar resource and surface meteorological measurements available from the new Renewable Resource Atlas for Saudi Arabia developed by the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE) as part of the Renewable Resource Monitoring and Mapping (RRMM) Program. The Solar Atlas provides live data recorded from 41 stations across the country. Accurate solar resource data is critical in reducing technical and financial risks of deploying utility-scale solar energy conversion systems. This paper presents solar maps of the country over time, showing that the direct normal irradiance (DNI) in various regions of the country ranges from approximately 9000 W h/m2/day in the summer months to 5000 W h/m2/day in the winter months. Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) in various regions can be as high as 8.3 kW h/m2/day. One year of ground based solar radiation measurements from new stations at KACARE Headquarters Riyadh and Qassim University are compared with satellite-based model estimates of long-term DNI and GHI solar resources on a monthly mean daily total basis. Comparing the locally measured DNI data at KACARE Headquarters Riyadh with GeoModel, the average difference is about 6.9% of the reported values, the average measurement uncertainty being 8.4%. For GHI measured at KACARE Headquarters Riyadh, a fairly good agreement can be seen between the RRMM values and GeoModel with the average difference being about 5.6%, while the average measurement uncertainty being 6.7%. It might be noted that the GeoModel has data uncertainties for monthly mean daily total radiation in the range of ±8% to ±15% for DNI, and ±4% to ±8% for GHI. Finally, the paper reviews data from the recording station at Qassim University (QU), which is equipped with a variety of instruments for measuring solar radiation and surface metrological conditions. The measured values of DNI at QU varied from a maximum of 8367 W h/m2/day in July to a minimum of 4702 W h/m2/day in January. In terms of percentages, the average difference between the measured monthly mean daily total radiation and the GeoModel estimates is about 5.4% of the reported values, the average measurement uncertainty being 5.1%. In most cases, the observed differences between measured and modeled data were within the combined estimated uncertainty. The results from Solar Atlas are critical in guiding policies, reducing the risks for deploying solar facilities and providing judicious information for construction of solar facilities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Pyrogenic Carbon Decomposition Critical To Resolving Fire's Role In The Earth System
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in the aggregate carbon balance of fires, according to a 1901 to 2010 land surface model study that, assuming steady state, shows potentially greater pyrogenic carbon production than legacy losses at global scale, due mostly to grassland adaptations to fire. Recently identified post-fire carbon fluxes indicate that, to understand whether global fires represent a net carbon source or sink, one must consider both terrestrial carbon retention through pyrogenic carbon production and carbon losses via multiple pathways. Here these legacy source and sink pathways are quantified using a CMIP6 land surface model to estimate Earth's fire carbon budget. Over the period 1901-2010, global pyrogenic carbon has driven an annual soil carbon accumulation of 337 TgC yr(-1), offset by legacy carbon losses totalling -248 TgC yr(-1). The residual of these values constrains the maximum annual pyrogenic carbon mineralization to 89 TgC yr(-1) and the pyrogenic carbon mean residence time to 5,387 years, assuming a steady state. The residual is negative over forests and positive over grassland-savannahs (implying a potential sink), suggesting contrasting roles of vegetation in the fire carbon cycle. The paucity of observational constraints for representing pyrogenic carbon mineralization means that, without assuming a steady state, we are unable to determine the sign of the overall fire carbon balance. Constraining pyrogenic carbon mineralization rates, particularly over grassland-savannahs, is a critical research frontier that would enable a fuller understanding of fire's role in the Earth system and inform attendant land use and conservation policy.

TI  - Duterte, Overseas Filipino Workers, And The Ethics Of Representation
AB  - Codex 13 Figure 2. Online version of a photograph of Grace de Guzman. Photograph courtesy of Eloisa Lopez. Duterte, Overseas Filipino Workers, and the Ethics of Representation Ethel Tungohan Although the problem persists I really do believe the photographs put a face to the numbers. They allowed more people to witness the harrowing things we saw. More organizations were spurred to action from the reporting. None of this would have come to light if not for the very first wave of local reporters saying: this really is happening. —­ Hannah Reyes Morales, “Coming Home to Cover Duterte’s Deadly Drug War” Consisting primarily of former and current migrant workers who came to Canada under the low-­ skilled Temporary Foreign Workers Program (TFWP), members of the Filipino diaspora in Edmonton, Alberta, have oftentimes expressed to me their disillusionment with the way politics was conducted back home, the economic conditions that led them to 14 Codex seek jobs abroad in the first place, and the sacrifices they underwent in Canada. Living and working in Canada did not mean that they were uninvolved with events in the Philippines. On the contrary, being migrant workers abroad with obligations to send remittances to family and other loved ones in the Philippines meant that they maintained transnational ties. I actually first heard about Rodrigo Duterte first announcing his candidacy for president from them. Despite favorable media depictions of the progress former president Benigno Aquino Jr. has made, which included “rapid economic growth of 6.9% and improved performance in global competitiveness rankings (from 86th place to 47th)” (Curato 2017, 144), many of those with whom I spoke were disillusioned. The economic benefits that purportedly accrued under Aquino seemed to them only to be felt by a few, leaving behind marginalized communities that included Filipino migrant workers. Through Duterte, many Filipinos in the diaspora felt that at long last, somebody was setting the nation on the correct path. Stories of Duterte’s reign as mayor of Davao were shared with reverence. That Duterte also made gestures toward catering to progressive causes, including his decision to offer cabinet-­level positions to progressive politicians (Bello 2017) and his condemnation of “anti–­Overseas Filipino Worker” (OFW) policies such as Philippine customs agents’ tendency to vigilantly search the luggage of returning overseas workers to search for taxable goods (Ranada 2016), seemed to show that despite his blustering persona, his politics were commendable. In addition, Duterte’s unwillingness to kowtow to U.S. imperialist policies appealed to progressive members of the diaspora (Bello 2017). Consequently, pro-­Duterte groups mushroomed across Canada, as they did in countries where there were numerous OFWs. The explicit goal was to get not just OFWs but also their families back home to support Duterte. Interestingly, within months of his election, some of the same members of the Filipino diaspora who supported him started to doubt his sincerity. There were hushed reports of extrajudicial killings, of children being the collateral damage in his “war against drugs,” of police forces acting without restraint. Then there was the jailing of political opponents, the eventual ousting of progressive cabinet members like former Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary Judy Taguiwalo, and the unceasing attacks against journalists. More recently, Duterte’s statements that he was “powerless to protect OFWs” and his belief that rape and sexual violence were unfortunate yet unavoidable realities that female OFWs had to face (Aguilar 2019) caused widespread anger among the Filipino OFWs whom I knew in Canada, including former supporters. Codex 15 Still, there were those in the diaspora who doubted the veracity of the reports. The discourse of “fake news” became prominent transnationally through Duterte’s and U.S. president Donald Trump’s use of the term. Both disavowed news reports that challenged t eir respective actions. This meant that there was widespread confusion about what was true and what was not. Hence many Filipinos abroad were unsure of who and what to believe. The way Duterte supporters quickly mobilized against anyone who dared voice concerns about Duterte, with vitriolic and oftentimes gendered threats made frequently, lent a chilling atmosphere to political discourse online. And yet even members of the Filipino diaspora who did not know what. © 2020, Studies in Global Asias. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Mapping Changes In Artisanal And Small-Scale Mining (Asm) Landscape Using Machine And Deep Learning Algorithms. - A Proxy Evaluation Of The 2017 Ban On Asm In Ghana
AB  - Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) landscapes form integral part of the Land use land cover (LULC) in the developing worlds. However, the spatial, spectral, and temporal footprints of ASM present some challenges for using most of the freely available optical satellite sensors for change analysis. The challenge is even profound in tropical West African countries like Ghana where there is prolonged cloud cover. Whiles very few studies have used Sentinel-2 data to map change analysis in ASM landscape, none examined the contribution of individual S2 bands to the ASM classifications. Also, despite the capabilities of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for LULC classifications, few studies have compared the performances of different classifiers in mapping ASM landscape. This study utilized Sentinel-2 data, four ML and DL models (Artificial Neural Network –ANN, Random Forest – RF, Support Vector Machines –SVM, a pixel-based Convolutional Neural Network-CNN) and image segmentation to examine the performance of S2 bands and ML and DL algorithms for change analysis in ASM landscape, with the Birim Basin in Ghana as a study area. The result of the change analysis was used to assess changes in LULC during the recent ban on the expansion of ASM in the country. It was found out that ANN is a better classifier of ASM achieving the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 99.80% on the segmented Sentinel-2 bands. The study also found out that the Band 5 Vegetation Red Edge (VRE) 1 contributed most to classifying ASM, with the segmented VRE 1 being superlative over the other predictors. In terms of expansion, ASM increased by 59.17 km2 within the period of the study (January 2017 to December 2018), suggesting that ASM still took place under the watch of the ban. The classification results showed that most of the peripheral of forest and farmland have been converted to ASM with little disturbance within the interior of the forest reserves. The study revealed that, the ban was yielding very little or no results due to a number of policy deficiencies including low staff strength, lack of logistics and low remuneration. Enforcement of legal instruments against ASM and farming activities within the forest reserves, improvement in the monitoring systems and intensification of public education on the value of forest and the need to protect it are some of the major recommendations that could control encroachment on the forest reserves. © 2021

TI  - Monitoring The Coastal Wetlands Dynamics In Northeast Italy From 1984 To 2016
AB  - The Adriatic coast of Northeast Italy is one of the representative areas holding high ecological value in the Mediterranean. In this research, we have monitored the environmental change of coastal wetland in ten studied sites that covered all the Ramsar sites and most of the natural reserves in Northeast Italy from 1984 to 2016. The results show that the coastal wetland environment has been changing associated with a multitude of influential factors, including economic development, reserve initiatives, and sea-level rise, which have been quantitively analyzed for each of the studied wetland sites. The results of the analysis confirm that (1) with robust reservation policy, the landuse of the coastal wetland sites remained generally stable despite the continuous anthropogenic disturbance; (2) wetlands located in the insular area with low elevation are subject to more severe impact from sea-level rise inundation; (3) the continental coastal wetlands in reserve area show the polarization phenomenon which is strengthened by strict reservation policy and contiguous aggressive anthropogenic activities. To protect the insular coastal wetlands and reduce the polarization effects on continental coastal wetlands, more efficient measures should be taken to strengthen and implement the existing reservation directives and regulations actively.

TI  - Resource Assessment Methods In The Offshore Wind Energy Sector
AB  - Offshore wind industry has experienced a large development over the past decades. Some key factors in the development, sitting and operation of an offshore wind farm include the accurate estimation and forecast of the wind resources and the quantification of the inherent variability in wind power generation. Wind resource estimates are characterized by various degrees of uncertainties that could lead to highly misleading results. Most often, risk-based financial models on which wind project investments are based, are strongly dependent upon these uncertainties, which constitute a barrier for wind energy penetration into the electricity grid. On that account, for a correct and reliable wind power assessment it is of utmost importance to increase the quality and quantity of wind data available. An accurate estimation of wind field is a challenging task that requires reliable sources of data. Offshore meteorological observations from meteorological masts or marine buoys constitute the most commonly used source of data to build energy density maps due to its large reliability. Nevertheless, in situ measures are often sparsely located, not available where the observations are most needed, and have a poor temporal coverage. To overcome these limitations, the wind field may be obtained from a variety of alternative methods available for energy assessment, from satellite remote sensing observations to numerical weather prediction models. This paper gives an overview of the available methods for addressing the wind resource and overall development potential of a candidate site together with a review of the statistical methods to deal with variability and long-term extrapolation of wind speed time series. Finally, the present and future challenges and perspectives are addressed and identified, highlighting the reforms that may be crucial in the forthcoming period. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Spring Migration And Summer Destinations Of Northern Pintails From The Coast Of Southern California
AB  - To examine pathways timing and destinations during migration in spring we attached satellite monitored transmitters (platform transmitting terminals) to 10 northern pintails (Anus acuta) during February 2001 at Point Mugu Ventura County California This is a wintering area on the southern coast of California We obtained locations from five adult males and three adult females every 3rd day through August Average date of departure from the wintering area was 15 March (SF = 3 days) We documented extended stopovers of >= 30 days for several northern pintails that could have accommodated nesting attempts (San Joaquin Valley southwestern Montana southern Alberta north central Nevada) or post nesting molt (eastern Oregon south-central Saskatchewan northern Alaska central Alberta) Wintering northern pintails from the southern coast of California used a wide range of routes nesting areas and schedules during migration in spring which was consistent with the larger wintering population in the Central Valley of California Therefore conservation of habitat that is targeted at stopover nesting and molting areas will benefit survival and management of both wintering populations

TI  - Digital Mapping For Cost-Effective And Accurate Prediction Of The Depth And Carbon Stocks In Indonesian Peatlands
AB  - Tropical peatlands have an important role in the global carbon cycle. In order to quantify carbon stock for peatland management and conservation, the knowledge of the spatial distribution of peat and its depth is essential. This paper proposed a cost-effective and accurate methodology for mapping peat depth and carbon stocks in Indonesia. The method, based on the scorpan spatial soil prediction function framework, was tested in Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatra and Katingan, Central Kalimantan. A peat hydrological unit, where a peatland is bounded by at least two rivers, is defined as the mapping area or extent. Peat depth is modelled as a function of topography and spatial position. Four machine learning models were evaluated to model and map peat depth: Cubist regression tree, Random Forests (RF), Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Covariates representing topography and spatial position were derived from the 1 arc-second digital elevation model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (resolution of 30.7 m). The spatial models were calibrated from field observations. For model calibration and uncertainty analysis, the k-fold cross validation approach was used. Three models: Cubist, Random Forests, and Quantile Regression Forests models showed excellent accuracies of peat depth prediction for both areas where the coefficient of determination values range from 0.67 to 0.92 and root mean squared error (RMSE) values range from 0.6 to 1.1 m. ANN showed inferior results. In addition, QRF and Cubist showed the best account of the uncertainty of prediction, in terms of percentage of observations that fall within the defined 90% confidence interval. In terms of the best predictor, elevation comes first. Using the spatial prediction functions, peat depth maps along with their 90% confidence interval were generated. The estimated mean carbon stock for Ogan Komering Ilir is 0.474 Gt and for Katingan is 0.123 Gt. Our estimate for Ogan Komering Ilir is twice larger than a previous study because we mapped the peatland hydrological unit, while the previous study only delineated peat domes. Finally, we recommend a sampling method for peat depth mapping using numerical stratification of elevation to cover both the geographical and covariate space. We expect that the combination of an improved sampling strategy, machine learning models, and kriging will increase the accuracy of peat depth mapping. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Combining Ground-Based And Remotely Sensed Snow Data In A Linear Regression Model For Real-Time Estimation Of Snow Water Equivalent
AB  - Effective water resources management in California relies substantially on real-time information of snow water equivalent (SWE) at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the State. However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snowcovered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R-2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6\% to 2.2\% in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87\% of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1\% PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81\% variance with 1.4\% PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73\% and-2.4\%, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75\% and-15.9\%, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85\% of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with-9.2\% PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86\% and-11.3\%, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64\% and 28.2\%, respectively) and NWM (33\% and-30.1\%, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in California, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.

TI  - Air Pollution In The Gobi Desert Region: Analysis Of Dust-Storm Events
AB  - Air pollutants in nine cities of the Gobi Desert region are examined in this study. Mean concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, retrieved from ground-based air quality monitoring stations, were 36.2 +/- 23.7 and 97.3 +/- 84.5 mu g center dot m(-3), respectively. The highest concentrations of pollutants were in spring and winter. This can be explained by wind-borne dust in the spring and emissions from domestic sources during the winter heating season. The highest PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were registered in a period of dust-storm activity with values of 343 mu g center dot m(-3) and 1,642 mu g center dot m(-3). Generally, clean continental (CC) was the dominant aerosol type (73.9\%), followed by mixed (MX) aerosol type (20.4\%) with insignificant contribution of clean marine (CM) (2.1\%), urban/industrial and biomass burning (UI/BB) (0.9\%) and desert dust (DD) (2.7\%) aerosol types. The various measures of pollution retrieved from AERONET stations, including aerosol optical depth (AOD), angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE), asymmetry parameter (AP), single scattering albedo (SSA) and aerosol volume size distribution (AVSD), specify the content of coarse aerosol fractions in the period of dust activity. The aerosol radiative forcing at the bottom of the atmosphere (ARF(BOA)) and the top of the atmosphere (ARF(TOA)) during dust days were estimated to be -115.76 and -241.31 W center dot m(-2), with a corresponding heating rate of 3.52 K center dot day(-1). According to the backward and forward trajectories of air masses, the dust cloud moved to the east and southeast from the epicentre, affecting the eastern and the central parts of the country. This study may advise environmental policy, as it showed how controlling causes of pollution can improve air quality.

TI  - Evaluation And Analysis Of The Gross Ecosystem Product Towards The Sustainable Development Goals: A Case Study Of Fujian Province, China
AB  - Achieving sustainable development is an issue of global concern. Accounting for the gross ecosystem product (GEP) value can specifically quantify the value of ecosystems for people, which is conducive to the formulation of sustainable eco-management decisions. Multi-source data, including remote sensing images, geospatial data, and statistical bulletin information, were used to quantify the GEP value of material products, regulating services, and cultural services for Fujian Province, China, during 2000-2020. On this basis, the spatio-temporal characteristics of GEP and the coupling relationship between GEP and GDP were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) the value of GEP in Fujian Province increased by 27.9\% from CNY 3589.04 billion in 2000 to CNY 4590.25 billion in 2020. Among the service values, the contribution rate of regulating services to GEP was always the highest during the study period. (2) The spatial distribution pattern of GEP in Fujian Province was higher in the west and lower in the east. Comparing prefecture-level cities, Nanping maintained its GEP at the maximum value level over the past 21 years, while Xiamen and Putian maintained their GEP at the minimum value level. (3) GDP grew faster relative to GEP over the past 21 years, and the difference between GEP and GDP decreased. GEP had a long-term positive effect on GDP, while GDP had a smaller effect on GEP in the short term. The research was not only enriched in relation to GEP accounting, but also the policy recommendations for improving the mechanisms related to the optimization of sustainable development goals have some practical significance.

TI  - Application Of The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi) In The Characterization Of The Vegetative Cover Of Juazeiro Do Norte – Ce
AB  - Remote sensing data are fundamental in research focused on studies of vegetation behavior, as well as in the monitoring of meteorological and environmental phenomena. In this context, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been widely used for monitoring and evaluating vegetation, as it is one of the first analytical products of remote sensing used to simplify the complexities of multispectral images. Thus, accurate and timely monitoring of earth's surface characteristics provides the basis for a better understanding of the interactions and relationships between human and natural phenomena aiming at better use and resource management. In this sense, the objective of this article is to generate a thematic map of the situation of the vegetation cover of the municipality of Juazeiro do Norte-CE from the (NDVI). The Geographic Information System (SIG QGIS), version 2.18, was used to carry out this work. NDVI was calculated from satellite images obtained free of charge on the Earth Explorer website. It is noteworthy as results that the maximum NDVI was 0.60901. This value close to 1 (one) indicates a good amount of dense vegetation cover. Thus, the application of NDVI was relevant to identify how the current situation of the municipality is found in relation to its vegetation, because this index can help in decision-making by public management in environmental planning, since it acts as an indicator of green areas. Therefore, this technique may improve the detection of changes in vegetation in future studies. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

(JCL) is one of the most prominent energy crops due to its superior agronomical traits, where it can grow in non-arable lands and harsh climates with minimal water requirements. A significant number of studies were published on the utilisation of JCL for biofuel production, whereas there are no studies on its use in greenbelt (GB) or windbreak technologies reported thus far. Meanwhile, a few approaches on the delineation of greenbelts to fight desertification in the arid regions exist in literature. This study presents a novel approach to delineate a multipurpose energy-greenbelt using JCL crop for biofuel production, as well as to preserve the soil and enhance air quality, thereby helping to combat desertification and sand-dust storms (SDS). The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in the state of Qatar for the diversification of its renewable energy resources. Moreover, Qatar is also suffering from land degradation due to erosion factors and desert creep. A multi-dimensional approach is proposed for this purpose using satellite and meteorological data to initially select the optimal plantation sites that potentially contribute to the highest possible biofuel yield. The spatial analysis was carried out using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique for multi-criteria decision making in the geographic information system (ArcGIS). In addition, the Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery were utilised in combination with historical records from the weather stations to evaluate the patterns of SDS, land degradation and urban expansion, to best define optimal GB pathway. COMSOL Multiphysics software was subsequently employed to evaluate the performance of Jatropha-GB and determine its optimal density. The different solutions for GB delineation spans 166.6-227.8 km length and (6 x 6 m) of field density. It is expected that the economic and environmental benefits from the derived GB configuration include: (a) protection of up to 87\% of Qatar farms against further deterioration; (b) yield of up to 36 M gallon of green liquid fuels; (c) capture of 0.33 M tonnes of CO2 per 1 km GB-depth annually; and (d) provide a better air quality for around 95\% of the Qatar population.

TI  - Wheat Basal Crop Coefficients Determined By Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
AB  - Crop coefficient methodologies are widely used to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for determining irrigation scheduling. Generalized crop coefficient curves presented in the literature are limited to providing estimates of ETc for "optimum" crop condition within a field, which often need to be modified for local conditions and cultural practices, as well as adjusted for the variations from normal crop and weather conditions that might occur during a given growing season. Consequently, the uncertainties associated with generalized crop coefficients can result in ETc estimates that are significantly different from actual ETc, which could ultimately contribute to poor irrigation water management. Some important crop properties such as percent cover and leaf area index have been modeled with various vegetation indices (VIs), providing a means to quantify real-time crop variations from remotely-sensed VI observations. Limited research has also shown that VIs can be used to estimate the basal crop coefficient (K (cb)) for several crops, including corn and cotton. The objective of this research was to develop a model for estimating K (cb) values from observations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for spring wheat. The K (cb) data were derived from back-calculations of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient procedures using field data obtained during two wheat experiments conducted during 1993-1994 and 1995-1996 in Maricopa, Arizona. The performance of the K (cb) model for estimating ETc was evaluated using data from a third wheat experiment in 1996-1997, also in Maricopa, Arizona. The K (cb) was modeled as a function of a normalized quantity for NDVI, using a third-order polynomial regression relationship (r(2)=0.90, n=232). The estimated seasonal ETc for the 1996-1997 season agreed to within -33 mm (-5\%) to 18 mm (3\%) of measured ETc. However, the mean absolute percent difference between the estimated and measured daily ETc varied from 9\% to 10\%, which was similar to the 10\% variation for K (cb) that was unexplained by NDVI. The preliminary evaluation suggests that remotely-sensed NDVI observations could provide real-time K (cb) estimates for determining the actual wheat ETc during the growing season.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of A Shallow, Fringing Reef Platform For Analysis Of Island Sector Susceptibility And Development Of A Coastal Vulnerability Index
AB  - Like many islands in middle latitudes, Pacific islands are often fringed by protective coral reefs that attenuate wave energy impacting the coastline. Measurement of the extent and distribution of shallow reef platforms by remote sensing of bathymetry enables an assessment of the relative exposure or protection of each part of an island. Fringing reefs are one of a number of physical variables relevant to the coastline's susceptibility to erosion and inundation resulting from extreme weather and conditions exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. In this research the extent of shallow reef platform around Lifuka Island, Tonga, was determined using a modified Stumpf band ratio method applied to Landsat 8 and high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery, with aerial LIDAR data available for ground-truth purposes. The results indicate that both sets of satellite imagery provide a means of measuring the bathymetry to at least 15 m with a correlation (R2) value of 0.87 for Landsat 8 and to 15 m with a correlation (R2) value of 0.86 for Quickbird, when compared with the LIDAR survey. This article forms part of the research into the preparation of a coastal vulnerability index to inform decision-making and risk assessment for Pacific Island nations at the subisland scale. The mapping of the fringing reef by remote sensing allows its spatial distribution to be considered in the assessment of risk to coastal regions to inundation and erosion processes. Further, it demonstrates the value of freely available Landsat data for planning adaptation to climate change in developing nations at a level pertinent to local governance of villages and communities. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2018.

TI  - Uav Based Soil Moisture Remote Sensing In A Karst Mountainous Catchment
AB  - Spatial distribution of soil moisture (SM) is a prerequisite for research and management of agriculture and ecology. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve SM data in highly heterogeneous landscapes. By investigating environmental factors (soil, vegetation and topography) and comparing different remote sensing sources (Landsat-8, Radarsat-2, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) V002 (ASTGTM2), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for karst mountainous catchments of southwest China, this study identified key controlling factors on the spatial distribution of SM and built a remote sensing model for SM estimation in highly heterogeneous landscapes. Results showed that vegetation type (35.7\%), aspect (7.7\%), height index (4.2\%), soil bulk density (3.3\%), soil total nitrogen (3.1\%), aspect interact with vegetation type (3.4\%) and soil total phosphorous (1.3\%) totally explained 58.8\% of the SM variability. The correlations between SM and topographic derivatives varied with DEM resolutions (1-50 m), and generally reached their highest values at 7 m for height index, slope gradient, and aspect, 16 m for flow accumulation and topographic wetness index, and 43 m for curvature. Partial least-squares regression analysis showed that optical and infrared bands from Landsat-8 and topographic derivatives from UAV photogrammetry DEM were more strongly con-elated with SM than other datasets. An empirical model (SM = 9.27 {*} 10(-2)HI - 1.82 {*} 10(-5) B5 + 0.519) with only height index and B5 band from Landsat-8 as inputs is proposed, as it shows acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.36; RMSE = 0.076). The results of this study provide useful information for SM remote sensing in karst mountainous area and similar heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Adaptive Multi-View Multi-Label Learning For Identifying Disease-Associated Candidate Mirnas
AB  - Increasing evidence has indicated that microRNAs(miRNAs) play vital roles in various pathological processes and thus are closely related with many complex human diseases. The identification of potential disease-related miRNAs offers new opportunities to understand disease etiology and pathogenesis. Although there have been numerous computational methods proposed to predict reliable miRNA-disease associations, they suffer from various limitations that affect the prediction accuracy and their applicability. In this study, we develop a novel method to discover disease-related candidate miRNAs based on Adaptive Multi- View Multi-Label learning(AMVML). Specifically, considering the inherent noise existed in the current dataset, we propose to learn a new affinity graph adaptively for both diseases and miRNAs from multiple similarity profiles. We then simultaneously update the miRNAdisease association predicted from both spaces based on multi-label learning. In particular, we prove the convergence of AMVML theoretically and the corresponding analysis indicates that it has a fast convergence rate. To comprehensively illustrate the prediction performance of our method, we compared AMVML with four state-of-the-art methods under different validation frameworks. As a result, our method achieved comparable performance under various evaluation metrics, which suggests that our method is capable of discovering greater number of true miRNA-disease associations. The case study conducted on thyroid neoplasms further identified a potential diagnostic biomarker. Together, the experimental results confirms the utility of our method and we anticipate that our method could serve as a reliable and efficient tool for uncovering novel disease-related miRNAs. © 2019 Liang et al.

TI  - Organisational Issues For Global Navigation Satellites Systems Implementation
AB  - The availability in the next future of space-based assets supporting global references services such as positioning, navigation, timing, weather or even risk/disaster mitigation for maritime, air, or ground users holds great potentials for the benefits of mankind. However, several challenge need to be met before accessing those benefits. Apart from technical aspects that remain considerable, organizational and institutional aspects shall not be overlooked since they often represent severe constraints for the implementation of such large complex systems. Taking global navigation satellites system for air transport as an example, this paper will address the key implementation issues such as control, sovereignty, liability, international competition and cost recovery. A survey of the implementation strategies for augmentation systems proposed for the various regions (mainly in the USA, Europe, CIS and Japan) is provided. An assessment of the various policies is presented as well as concluding remarks and recommendations for further studies. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping And Assessment Of Wetland Conditions By Using Remote Sensing Images And Poi Data
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most valuable natural resources on earth and play an important role in preserving biodiversity. However, due to economic development and human disturbances, many wetlands across the world have deteriorated and disappeared over the past several decades. By using remote sensing images and point of interest (POI) data, we proposed a knowledge-based raster mapping (KBRM)-based framework and implemented it in the assessment of wetland ecological conditions in Suzhou, China. Density maps of waterbodies, vegetation covers, imperviousness, roads, and POI values were derived and used as five ecological indicators that can represent the ecological conditions of wetlands. The KBRM approach was used to integrate these indicators into an overall rating and map wetland ecological conditions efficiently. Thus, spatial variations in wetland ecological conditions can be distinguished and represented in detail. Cross validation was conducted with water quality data at 15 field sampling sites. The validation results demonstrated that the overall wetland condition scores generated by our approach and the water quality index (WQI) values calculated from water quality data were strongly correlated. These findings confirm that our framework could be used to effectively map and evaluate spatial variations in wetland ecological conditions and provide more support for policy-making in wetland protection and management

TI  - Mangrove Plantation Suitability Mapping By Integrating Multi Criteria Decision Making Geospatial Approach And Remote Sensing Data
AB  - Mangroves are woody plant communities that appear in tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in intertidal zones along the coastlines. Despite their considerable benefits to humans and the surrounding environment, their existence is threatened by anthropogenic activities and natural drivers. Accordingly, it is vital to conduct efficient efforts to increase mangrove plantations by identifying suitable locations. These efforts are required to support conservation and plantation practices and lower the mortality rate of seedlings. Therefore, identifying ecologically potential areas for plantation practices is mandatory to ensure a higher success rate. This study aimed to identify suitable locations for mangrove plantations along the southern coastal frontiers of Hormozgan, Iran. To this end, we applied a hybrid Fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP (FDANP) model as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to determine the relative importance of different criteria, combined with geospatial and remote sensing data. In this regard, ten relevant sources of environmental criteria, including meteorological, topographical, and geomorphological, were used in the modeling. The statistical evaluation demonstrated the high potential of the developed approach for suitable location identification. Based on the final results, 6.10\% and 20.80\% of the study area were classified as very-high suitable and very-low suitable areas. The obtained values can elucidate the path for decision-makers and managers for better conservation and plantation planning. Moreover, the utility of charge-free remote sensing data allows cost-effective implementation of such an approach for other regions by interested researchers and governing organizations.

TI  - Exploring Built-Up Indices And Machine Learning Regressions For Multi-Temporal Building Density Monitoring Based On Landsat Series
AB  - Uncontrolled built-up area expansion and building densification could bring some detrimental problems in social and economic aspects such as social inequality, urban heat islands, and disturbance in urban environments. This study monitored multi-decadal building density (1991– 2019) in the Yogyakarta urban area, Indonesia consisting of two stages, i.e., built-up area classification and building density estimation, therefore, both built-up expansion and the densification were quantified. Multi sensors of the Landsat series including Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were utilized with some prior corrections to harmonize the reflectance values. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to distinguish between built-up and non built-up areas. Regression algorithms, i.e., linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) were explored to obtain the best model to estimate building density using the inputs of built-up indices: Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), and NIR-based built-up index based on the red (VrNIR-BI) and green band (VgNIR-BI). The best models were revealed by SVR with the inputs of UI-NDBI-IBI and LR with a single predictor of UI, for Landsat 8 (2013–2019) and Landsat 5/7 (1991–2009), respectively, using separate training samples. We found that machine learning regressions (SVM and RF) could perform best when the sample size is abundant, whereas LR could predict better for a limited sample size if a linear positive relationship was identified between the predictor(s) and building density. We conclude that expansion in the study area occurred first, followed by rapid building development in the subsequent years leading to an increase in building density. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Scale Dependence Of Urban Green Space Cooling Efficiency: A Case Study In Beijing Metropolitan Area
AB  - Urban Green Space (UGS), providing environmental, social and economic benefits simultaneously, has been regarded as a cost-effective Nature-based Solution (NbS) to combat the effects of urban heat island (UHI). Under the dual pressure of increasing demand for limited land resources and mitigating UHI, how to scientifically and effectively use the limited space to obtain the maximum cooling efficiency (scaling of cooling intensity and UGS size) is an important component of strategic urban green planning. However, the scale dependence of UGS cooling effect has not yet been sufficiently quantified, particularly with respect to involving small and medium size UGS. Here, we explored the size-dependent UGS cooling efficiency in Beijing using 10,003 UGS patches extracted from high-resolution remote sensing images. We found that 5922 UGS (59.20 \%) exhibited a "cooling island effect", the cooling service of UGS could reduce land surface temperature by 0.06 \& PLUSMN; 0.05 degrees C to 3.81 \& PLUSMN; 1.01 degrees C, and the cooling intensity enhanced nonlinearly with increasing size and closely related to the complexity of UGS shape and vegetation quality. We further showed that the cooling efficiency of small, medium and large UGS was-0.004 \& PLUSMN; 0.03 (n = 2201), 0.79 \& PLUSMN; 0.01 (n = 3570), 0.19 \& PLUSMN; 0.03 (n = 151), respectively, suggesting that strategic urban greening to combat urban heat should target on increasing medium-sized UGS and managing the layout of green space. These findings emphasize the significance of considering and further exploring the scale dependence of UGS cooling effect in mitigating urban heat.

TI  - The World Radiocommunication Conferences Process: Help Or Hindrance To New Satellite Development?
AB  - The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) provides a forum in which government and industry cooperate for the improvement and rational use of telecommunications worldwide. One of the missions of the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) is the management of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital locations, which are increasingly in demand from a large number of services. The ITU-R's mission is to ensure rational, equitable, efficient and economical use of this spectrum by all radio-communication services, including those using satellite orbit, and to facilitate studies and adoption of regulations and recommendations on radiocommunication matters. World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) review and revise radio regulations, allocations, and allotment plans, and address any radiocommunication matters. The WRCs are now convened every two or three years. However, with that level of infrequency, spectrum allocation planning might not be very responsive to industry development. Moreover, the general scope of the agenda is extensive and results in political compromise instead of technical readiness. It creates tension regarding the need for adequate time to have relevant technical studies done to support or refute proposals. This issue of political versus technical interests becomes more crucial with the growth of regional activities for coordination and the economic value of the spectrum. In addition, industry has intemational-rather then merely national- representation, affecting the technical study process. In turn, the WRC process impacts on industry are significant: resulting in delays, uncertainties, and political compromises affecting technical viability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - A Similarity Distance-Based Space-Time Random Forest Model For Estimating Pm2.5 Concentrations Over China
AB  - China has experienced persistent fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution for the past few years, which adversely affects both physical and mental health. The availability of high-accuracy and full-coverage PM2.5 products will be of substantial value in formulating effective policies to combat and regulate PM2.5 pollution. Therefore, we have developed a similarity distance-based space-time random forest (SDSTRF) model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations over China by integrating surface measurements, satellite aerosol products, meteorological data, and auxiliary information. The proposed model not only accounts for spatial-temporal heterogeneity, but also uses the similarity distance to avoid errors caused by outliers. It has undergone rigorous validation through three different cross-validation (CV) approaches and has shown high and stable accuracy, particularly in the site-based CV with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.68 μg/m3, along with a relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 27.48%. In addition, the leave-out data are predicted to determine if the SDSTRF model is accurate in its predictive power, which achieves an impressive site-based CV R2 of 0.80 and an RMSE of 12.89 μg/m3, along with an rRMSE of 33.01%. The results from a variety of validation approaches strongly indicate that the SDSTRF model can provide accurate estimation of PM2.5 concentrations at different time scales and outperform many other space-time models by incorporating similarity distance. The proposed model would be a promising application in air pollution studies with remote sensing. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Chiropractic Care Of A Patient With Erb's Palsy With A Review Of The Literature
AB  - Background: Descriptions of the inability of children to move their arms following birth have been recorded since the days of Hippocrates. In industrialized countries, the incidence ranges from 0.38 to 3.0 per thousand live births, making it a very common injury in neonates and a clinically common presentation. Sentinel observations by Erb (due to injury to the upper brachial plexus) and Klumpkey (due to injuries to the lower brachial plexus) now bear their names. Birth weight greater than 4000 g, the use of forceps and a very difficult delivery are just some of the risk factors involved. An alternative explanation for obstetric palsy may involve an irregular contour of the posterior pelvis of the mother causing impaction of the posterior shoulder of the fetus as it passes over the sacral promontory. Although testimonials are replete in chiropractic on the successful care of patients with various pediatric conditions, documentation in the scientific literature is wanting. To address this issue, we provide the following case report as a first step towards establishing an evidence base for chiropractic management of the condition. Case Presentation: The patient was an 8-year-old female with medically diagnosed Erb's Palsy. She presented with the typical 'waiter's tip' deformity in the right arm. Since birth, the patient had restricted range of motion in the right upper extremity at all involved joints along with muscle rigidity despite long-term medical care. Her condition affected several aspects of her life including interpersonal processes with her peers at school and in her social environment. Methodology: Single case report. Intervention: The patient was cared for with site-specific, low amplitude, high velocity chiropractic adjustments (Gonstead Technique) to sites of vertebral and extravertebral subluxations as well as myofascial release of the right upper extremity. Outcome: Following 3 months of care, the patient's range of motion was bilaterally symmetrical and muscle tonicity had normalized. The patient was able to fully participate in social and sporting activities, including rock climbing. Conclusion: This case report demonstrates a single case in which a pediatric patient suffering from obstetric palsy (i.e., Erb's Palsy) benefited from chiropractic care. © 2008 The College of Chiropractors.

TI  - Uas And Landsat Imagery To Determine Fuel Condition For Fire Behaviour Prediction On Spinifex Hummock Grasslands Of Arid Australia
AB  - Flammable spinifex grasslands of arid Western Australia cover about 98 million hectares of the state, and large wildfires in this environment threaten biodiversity, life, property and cultural values. Understanding fire behaviour in spinifex grasslands informs prescribed burning and wildfire suppression activities. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are aiding in improving fire behaviour prediction by providing comprehensive and accurate measurements of vegetation cover, volume and height, the fuel characteristics of vegetation that influence fire behaviour. Classification of spinifex cover derived from UAS image capture has been compared to field transects. Data from UAS align better with Landsat satellite imagery than fuel cover measures from field transects. A good correlation was found between UAS-derived vegetation cover and Landsat imagery, which means satellite imagery can be used with confidence to estimate and map fuel cover at a range of temporal and spatial scales. UAS have also proven useful in the development of a spectral index describing spinifex cover. The rapid development of affordable UAS instruments and software has enabled the production of point clouds, which provide further vegetation structure information not available from previous image captures. These developments in UAS application together with satellite imagery will enable fire managers to more efficiently and accurately map fuel characteristics at a range of scales, greatly enhancing their ability to forecast fire danger and to predict fire behaviour without having to carry out costly ground-based field measurements. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Assessing Land Cover And Ecological Quality Changes Under The New-Type Urbanization From Multi-Source Remote Sensing
AB  - The traditional rapid urbanization process is the result of a strong focus on economic development, while its ecological and environmental aspects are less focused upon. The "new-type urbanization " (NTU) concept considers ecological conservation during the urbanization process. The different impacts of the two processes on regional ecological environment evolutions remain insufficiently investigated and still draw significant attention from urban planners and land managers when formulating proper land use policies. Thus, this study was designed to fill the gap by evaluating and comparing different effects of the traditional urbanization and NTU on urban land cover (LC) and ecological quality changes in the Jiangbei New Area, Nanjing, China. We first established a LC database using an object-oriented classification of multi-source high-resolution satellite images. Next, we quantified changes in ecological quality using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model. Subsequently, spatial auto-correlation analysis was conducted to detect the clustering trend of the changing ecological quality in the study area over time. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the LC maps was 90.75\% in 2009, 91.75\% in 2015, and 92.04\% in 2019. The average RSEI values of the study area were 0.583, 0.559, and 0.579, respectively. The spatial auto-correlation analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between the ecological qualities. However, the spatial distribution changed slightly from a clustered trend to a more random and dispersed trend as the Moran's I decreased. The observed changes are attributed to the strict implementation of ecological conservation and restoration policies by the local government in the NTU process, as well as an increased residents' awareness of protecting natural resources, indicating that the traditional urbanization has a stronger negative disturbance on regional ecological conditions than NTU. The proposed evaluation method can be applied to other similar regions for sustainable urban management.

TI  - Evaluation Of The Health Status Of Indonesian Watersheds Using Impervious Surface Area As An Indicator
AB  - Impervious surfaces affect the ecosystem function of watersheds. Therefore, the impervious surface area percentage (ISA\%) in watersheds has been regarded as an important indicator for assessing the health status of watersheds. However, accurate and frequent estimation of ISA\% from satellite data remains a challenge, especially at large scales (national, regional, or global). In this study, we first developed a method to estimate ISA\% by combining daytime and nighttime satellite data. We then used the developed method to generate an annual ISA\% distribution map from 2003 to 2021 for Indonesia. Third, we used these ISA\% distribution maps to assess the health status of Indonesian watersheds according to Schueler's criteria. Accuracy assessment results show that the developed method performed well from low ISA\% (rural) to high ISA\% (urban) values, with a root mean square difference value of 0.52 km(2), a mean absolute percentage difference value of 16.2\%, and a bias of -0.08 km(2). In addition, since the developed method uses only satellite data as input, it can be easily implemented in other regions with some modifications according to differences in light use efficiency and economic development in each region. We also found that 88\% of Indonesian watersheds remain without impact in 2021, indicating that the health status of Indonesian watersheds is not a serious problem. Nevertheless, Indonesia's total ISA increased significantly from 3687.4 km(2) in 2003 to 10,505.5 km(2) in 2021, and most of the increased ISA was in rural areas. These results indicate that negative trends in health status in Indonesian watersheds may emerge in the future without proper watershed management.

We assessed the performance of two satellite vegetation indices derived from MODIS-Terra, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), over the northern and southern sectors of the Chiloe Island System (CIS) to advance our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the region. Then we examined their time-varying relationships with two climatic indices indicative of tropical and extratropical influence, the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) index, respectively. The 17-year time series showed that only EVI captured the seasonal pattern characteristic of temperate regions, with low (high) phenological activity during Autumn-Winter (Spring-Summer). NDVI saturated during the season of high productivity and failed to capture the seasonal cycle. Temporal patterns in productivity showed a weakened seasonal cycle during the past decade, particularly over the northern sector. We observed a non-stationary association between EVI and both climatic indices. Significant co-variation between EVI and the Nino-Southern Oscillation index in the annual band persisted from 2001 until 2008-2009; annual coherence with AAO prevailed from 2013 onwards and the 2009-2012 period was characterized by coherence between EVI and both climate indices over longer temporal scales. Our results suggest that the influence of large-scale climatic variability on local weather patterns drives phenological responses in the northern and southern regions of the CIS. The imprint of climatic variability on patterns of primary production across the CIS may be underpinned by spatial differences in the anthropogenic modification of this ecosystem, as the northern sector is strongly modified by forestry and agriculture. We highlight the need for field validation of satellite indices around areas of high biomass and high endemism, located in the southern sector of the island, in order to enhance the utility of satellite vegetation indices in the conservation and management of austral ecosystems.

TI  - Ai For Space Traffic Management
AB  - Morgan Stanley forecasts the space industry to top 1 trillion dollars by 2040. Of these 1 trillion dollars, 1.5 billion dollars are expected to be the contribution of the space situational market alone. Satellite operators are already paying the price of space debris. Current approaches for collision avoidance and space traffic management face serious challenges, mainly: (1) Insufficient data and endangered autonomy of action in space; (2) A high number of false alerts and a large uncertainty; (3) Lack of scalability and automation for an increasing number of assets. This paper explores the potential of AI for Space and presents some of the advances made by Neuraspace in Space Traffic Management, including the analysis of conjunction data messages (CDMs), predicting uncertainties, and risk classification, and the economic benefits of new approaches. Further, the paper addresses the need for a more active role of the private sector and an evolution of the role of the public sector to foster space sustainability and support the growth companies leading this effort.

TI  - Green Spaces And Cognitive Development At Age 7 Years In A Rome Birth Cohort: The Mediating Role Of Nitrogen Dioxide{*
AB  - Introduction There is evidence of improvement on mental health and well-being due to contact with green spaces, through various mechanisms and with potentially differential impacts in different populations. Many of these studies have been conducted among adults, while children have not been sufficiently investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the association between residential exposure to greenness and cognitive development at age 7 and to evaluate nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a potential mediator of this association.Methods This longitudinal study was based on a cohort of newborns enrolled at delivery in two large obstetric hospitals in Rome. We assessed cognitive development at 7 years of age through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III edition (WISC-III). We estimated residential surrounding greenness, using satellite derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), within 300m and 500m buffers around each residential address at birth. We applied weighted multiple linear regression analyses to study the association between NDVI and the WISC-III cognitive scores, using the inverse probability weighting methodology to correct for potential selection bias. We performed a mediation analysis to evaluate the mediating role of NO2 in the association under study.Results We enrolled 719 children at birth and performed our analyses only on 465 children with data on exposure and outcome. The results were not consistent for the average residential surrounding greenness in 300m buffer. For an IQR increase in greenness within 500m buffer around home addresses at birth we found a progress in Arithmetic subtest (?:0.39; 90\% CI: 0.11?0.6), a test concerning with attention, concentration and numerical reasoning, apart from an indication of the positive association with Full scale IQ and Verbal IQ. This association was partly mediated by reduction in NO2, since adding this pollutant in our model explained 35\% (90\% CI: 7\%?62\%) of our estimate. Conclusions Our findings showed an association between residential surrounding greenness within 500m and better scores on attention tests at 7 years of age. The observed association between Arithmetic subtest and NDVI was mediated, in part, by a reduction in NO2. This topic has important public health implications in supporting green urban planning policies and promoting children?s well-being.

TI  - Temporal-Spatial Distribution Of Ecosystem Health And Its Response To Human Interference Based On Different Terrain Gradients: A Case Study In Gannan, China
AB  - The exploitation, utilization, and protection of land resources are some of the great social problems during the process of rapid urbanization in China. The status of land use directly affects ecosystem health (ESH). The evaluation of ESH and the spatial correlations between urbanization caused by human interference help us to analyze the influence of urbanization on ecosystems and also provide new insight into reasonable and scientific resource management. In this study, we evaluated the ESH of Gannan, in Jiangxi Province, China, based on ecosystem service values (ESV) and selected a series of indicators to detect the impact of urbanization on ecosystem health in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010. and 2015. Remote sensing (RS) and the Geographic Information System (GIS) were used as processing tools to calculate basic data and to map the results based on different terrain gradients. The results show that ecosystem health suffered a downward trend from 1990 to 2015. Especially, the area proportion at an unhealthy level and average health (ave-health) level increased prominently, and the area of a well state decreased. Further, the results indicate that urbanization had a negative impact on ESH. The degree of a negative correlation increases with the process of urban sprawl. In addition, we found that from 1990 to 2015, the area proportion of a degraded level and unhealthy level was the highest on the first terrain gradient, and as the terrain gradient increased, this area proportion also decreased. However, the high interference region occupies a higher proportion in the lower terrain gradient. Consequently, the results could reveal the impact of urbanization on ecosystem health and could provide an even more effective service for a sustainable development.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment In Wenchuan County After The 5.12 Magnitude Earthquake
AB  - Wenchuan was designated as one of the earthquake-stricken areas after the 2008 5.12-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake. During the decade following the earthquake, many post-earthquake landslides have occurred, seriously threatening the property of the local population's lives and property. At present, there are few long-term spatiotemporal changes studies on landslides generated after the earthquake. The main aim of the present study is to use Landsat multi-period remote sensing image data, combined with post-earthquake landslide interpretation point data, to extract landslide point information from 2011, 2014, and 2018 to analyze the spatial evolution of landslides and define reliable susceptibility models for landslides in 2018 using an assessed certainty factor (CF), an integrated CF with random forest (RF), and an integrated CF with logistic regression (LR). The area under cure (AUC) was used to test the accuracy of the three models and obtain the most reflective susceptibility map. The results show that the RF-CF model produced the optimal result in terms of its AUC value (0.84). Over the past decade, the high-density area has become more concentrated than that of other grades and its coverage small, and its proportion has gradually decreased; the proportion of landslides in low-density areas has been increasing, and its distribution has become more concentrated. These research results fill the gap in the study of temporal and spatial changes in landslides after an earthquake and provide a scientific basis for disaster management and prediction in landslide-prone areas such as Wenchuan.

TI  - Proposing Multicriteria Decision Based Valuation Of Ecosystem Services For Fragmented Landscape In Mountainous Environment
AB  - Landscape structure or fragmentations have important effects on ecosystem services, with a common assumption being that fragmentation effects can reduce ecosystem services provision. Impact of Land use land cover (LULC) change on ecosystem service value is well explored techniques in recent times, but landscape fragmentation effect on ecosystem services value (ESV) is yet not quantitatively explored. The present work has intended to focus on the fragmentation effect on ESV introducing a new approach along with the effect of LULC change on ESV. All the analysis is done considering four times (1991, 2001, 2011, 2019) from Landsat images. Fragmentation analysis in ArcGis software has generated six hierarchic landscape units like patch, edge, perforated, small core, medium core and large core. For showing fragmentation effect ESV is computed for a typical LULC as a whole using Coefficient value (CV) of Costanza (1997) and 2014 and ESV of the fragmented landscapes using weighted CV based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Result has clearly demonstrated that due to fragmentation of forest and water body, a major means of qualitative degradation of eco-region, ESV of the respective lands have reduced from 24.43 to 20.57 million USD/year from 1991 to 2019. Total ESV of agriculture and built up land were respectively 43.62 and 4.15 million USD in 1991 and it was changed to 37.92 and 5.85 million USD in 2019. Computed ESV of forest without considering fragmentation effect is 14.68 million USD/year but it is diminuend only 5.71 million USD/year if fragmentation effect is considered in 2019. The ESV of the water body is six times lower in the fragmented landscape as per 2019. Anthropogenic effects have a paramount role for growing land use change, fragmentation and change of ESV in a natural landscape.

TI  - Surface Ruptures Of The 2022 Mw 6.7 Menyuan Earthquake Revealed By Integrated Remote Sensing
AB  - Objectives On 8th January 2022, a large earthquake (Mw 6.7) struck Menyuan County, Qinghai, China, causing serious damage to Lanzhou-Xinjiang high speed railway and forcing the closure of the railway for repairs, which has attracted highly domestic and international attention. Methods We presented a technical framework to determine earthquake surface ruptures by integrating optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images as well as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and evaluated its damage to traffic networks. Firstly, we acquired a range of datasets including GF-1, GF-7, Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1A SAR images. GF-1 and GF-7 images were used to determine the spatial distribution characteristic of the surface ruptures. Secondly, we employed to estimate 2D surface displacement fields using optical pixel offset technique. One in the east-west (EW) direction and the other in the south-north (SN) direction. SAR pixel offset technique was utilized to acquire surface displacements in the range and azimuth directions whilst interferometric SAR(InSAR) was mainly for surface displacements in the radar line of sight (i.e. the range direction). Structure from motion (SfM) was used to process UAV images to obtain high precision digital surface models (DSMs). Finally, all the abovementioned information was used to precisely determine the spatial distribution and surface displacement characteristics of the earthquake surface ruptures. Results Our results show that the maximum surface displacement in the EW direction was about 2.0 m, the maximum in the range direction was approximately 1.5 m, and the total length of the surface ruptures was around 36.22 km. Furthermore, we performed an assessment of traffic inefficiency in Menyuan and its surrounding areas based on the distribution of historical geohazards as well as the earthquake surface ruptures using machine learning methods support vector machine models. Conclusions The Menyuan earthquake had the greatest impacts on highways, and the least impacts on rural roads. The southeast sections of the major highways G0611 and G338 had high risks. The technical framework demonstrated in this paper appears to be promising to precisely map surface ruptures, which in turn will directly benefit to earthquake disaster reduction. © 2022 Wuhan University.

TI  - Cloud-Based Analysis Of Large-Scale Hyperspectral Imagery For Oil Spill Detection
AB  - Spectral indices are of fundamental importance in providing insights into the distinctive characteristics of oil spills, making them indispensable tools for effective action planning. The normalized difference oil index (NDOI) is a reliable metric and suitable for the detection of coastal oil spills, effectively leveraging the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands offered by commercial sensors. The present study explores the calculation of NDOI with a primary focus on leveraging remotely sensed imagery with rich spectral data. This undertaking necessitates a robust infrastructure to handle and process large datasets, thereby demanding significant memory resources and ensuring scalability. To overcome these challenges, a novel cloud-based approach is proposed in this study to conduct the distributed implementation of the NDOI calculation. This approach offers an accessible and intuitive solution, empowering developers to harness the benefits of cloud platforms. The evaluation of the proposal is conducted by assessing its performance using the scene acquired by the airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor during the 2010 oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The catastrophic nature of the event and the subsequent challenges underscore the importance of remote sensing (RS) in facilitating decision-making processes. In this context, cloud-based approaches have emerged as a prominent technological advancement in the RS field. The experimental results demonstrate noteworthy performance by the proposed cloud-based approach and pave the path for future research for fast decision-making applications in scalable environments. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Assessing Multiple Years' Spatial Variability Of Crop Yields Using Satellite Vegetation Indices
AB  - Assessing crop yield trends over years is a key step in site specific management, in view of improving the economic and environmental profile of agriculture. This study was conducted in a 11.07 ha area under Mediterranean climate in Northern Italy to evaluate the spatial variability and the relationships between six remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and grain yield (GY) in five consecutive years. A total of 25 satellite (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) images were downloaded during crop growth to obtain the following VIs: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Simple Ratio (SR). The surveyed crops were durum wheat in 2010, sunflower in 2011, bread wheat in 2012 and 2014, and coriander in 2013. Geo-referenced GY and VI data were used to generate spatial trend maps across the experimental field through geostatistical analysis. Crop stages featuring the best correlations between VIs and GY at the same spatial resolution (30 m) were acknowledged as the best periods for GY prediction. Based on this, 2-4 VIs were selected each year, totalling 15 VIs in the five years with r values with GY between 0.729{*}{*} and 0.935{*}{*}. SR and NDVI were most frequently chosen (six and four times, respectively) across stages from mid vegetative to mid reproductive growth. Conversely, SAVI never had correlations high enough to be selected. Correspondence analysis between remote VIs and GY based on quantile ranking in the 126 (30 m size) pixels exhibited a final agreement between 64\% and 86\%. Therefore, Landsat imagery with its spatial and temporal resolution proved a good potential for estimating final GY over different crops in a rotation, at a relatively small field scale.

TI  - Movements Of Satellite Tracked Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus Magellanicus) In A Wintering Area In Southern Brazil
AB  - Food availability and oceanographic conditions drive the distribution and movement of marine vertebrates. Tracking efforts towards seabirds usually focus on their breeding period, tagging adults in colonies. In this study, we tracked four juvenile and one adult Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) with satellite transmitters. These individuals were caught incidentally in gillnets and were tagged at sea, with the exception of the adult that was rehabilitated and released on the beach. The penguins were tracked in their wintering grounds, where behavior and oceanographic characteristics of the area used were determined. All five birds remained along the coast of southern Brazil and Uruguay in neritic waters up to 10 km offshore and 50 m in depth. The four juveniles used a mean area of 1,426 km(2), travelling on average at 7.4 km/h. The high turning angles observed and mean sinuosity of 2.46 indicated that the penguins were foraging. The adult penguin covered an area of 1,033 km(2), at a mean speed of 4.6 km/h, and with low sinuosity (0.43), which is suggestive of either travelling movements or an experienced hunter who needs a few turning angles to forage. The adult travelled 538 km in total, reaching a maximal distance of 465 km. Locations were obtained over a period of 7-10 days, and all five penguins remained in waters of the coastal branch of the Malvinas Current, an area characterized by cold sea surface temperatures (SST, mean = 13.4 ?) and high primary productivity. Salinity values (34.06 PSU) were also typical of the Malvinas Current and were influenced by the La Plata River plume, whose waters are low in salinity and nutrient rich. All five penguins remained near the coast probably because these waters are rich in nutrients, and carry the penguins' main prey, the Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita). Regarding conservation concerns involving these penguins, we highlight the current management of the anchovy fisheries and the development of offshore windfarms that could potentially cause major disturbances to the penguins' foraging habitat. The establishment of the Albarda \& SIM;o National Park in the nearshore area used by the penguins is highly desirable for the protection of the species and their feeding resources.

TI  - Wetland Monitoring, Serving As An Index Of Land Use Change-A Study In Samaspur Wetlands, Uttar Pradesh, India
AB  - Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world and any alterations might lead to changes in their bio-physical, socio-economic and climatic conditions. Wetland dynamics as an index of land use change were studied. Satellite remote sensing was utilized to understand the periodic and seasonal dynamics of Samaspur wetlands using Landsat and RESOURCESAT-1 temporal data. Index-based (i.e., Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) classification resulted in meaningful discrimination of wetland classes. Results indicate (i) effective water spread areas have increased to optimum capacity at 1990 due to the influence of Sharda canal, (ii) expansion of the agricultural area has led to reduction of the wetland buffer area, and (iii) increase in vegetation biomass due to pesticide-fertilizer runoff and sedimentation load. We also reiterate (i) free availability of the Landsat satellite data in public domain facilitating such monitoring studies and (ii) availability and utility of SWIR band information in wetland classification exercise. The study concludes that policy-driven measures have both long and short term impacts on land use and its natural wetland ecosystems; and the characterizing the later serves as indictor of the former and perhaps vice versa.

TI  - Philopatry And Regional Connectivity Of The Great Hammerhead Shark, Sphyrna Mokarran In The Us And Bahamas
AB  - A thorough understanding of movement patterns of a species is critical for designing effective conservation and management initiatives. However, generating such information for large marine vertebrates is challenging, as they typically move over long distances, live in concealing environments, are logistically difficult to capture and, as uppertrophic predators, are naturally low in abundance. Large-bodied, broadly distributed tropical shark typically restricted to coastal and shelf habitats, the great hammerhead shark Sphyrna mokarran epitomizes such challenges. Highly valued for its fins (in target and incidental fisheries), it suffers high bycatch mortality coupled with fecundity conservative life history, and as a result, is vulnerable to over-exploitation and population depletion. Although there are very little species-specific data available, the absence of recent catch records give cause to suspect substantial declines across its range. Here, we used biotelemetry techniques (acoustic and satellite), conventional tagging, laser-photogrammetry, and photo-identification to investigate the level of site fidelity/residency for great hammerheads to coastal areas in the Bahamas and U.S., and the extent of movements and connectivity of great hammerheads between the U.S. and Bahamas. Results revealed large-scale return migrations (3030 km), seasonal residency to local areas (some for 5 months), site fidelity (annual return to Bimini and Jupiter for many individuals) and numerous international movements. These findings enhance the understanding of movement ecology in great hammerhead sharks and have potential to contribute to improved conservation and management.

TI  - Assessment Of Soil Erosion Hazard And Prioritization For Treatment At The Watershed Level: Case Study In The Chemoga Watershed, Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
AB  - Soil erosion by water is the most pressing environmental problem in Ethiopia, particularly in the Highlands where the topography is highly rugged, population pressure is high, steeplands are cultivated and rainfall is erosive. Soil conservation is critically required in these areas. The objective of this study was to assess soil erosion hazard in a typical highland watershed (the Chemoga watershed) and demonstrate that a simple erosion assessment model, the universal soil loss equation (USLE), integrated with satellite remote sensing and geographical information systems can provide useful tools for conservation decision-making. Monthly precipitation, soil map, a 30-m digital elevation model derived from topographic map, land-cover map produced from supervised classification of a Land Sat image, and land use types and slope steepness were used to determine the USLE factor values. The results show that a larger part of the watershed (>58 per cent of total) suffers from a severe or very severe erosion risk (>80 t ha(-1) y(-1)), mainly in the midstream and upstream parts where steeplands are cultivated or overgrazed. In about 25 per cent of the watershed, soil erosion was estimated to exceed 125 t ha(-1) y(-1). Based on the predicted soil erosion rates, the watershed wits divided into six priority categories for conservation intervention and 18 micro-watersheds were identified that may be used as planning units. Finally, the method used has yielded it fairly reliable estimation of soil loss rates and delineation of erosion-prone areas. Hence, it similar method can be used in other watersheds to prepare conservation master plans and enable efficient use of limited resources. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Using Clinical Variables To Guide Surgical Site Infection Detection: A Novel Surveillance Strategy
AB  - Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a common and expensive health careeassociated infection, and are used as a health care quality benchmark. As such, SSI detection is a major focus of infection prevention programs. In an effort to improve on conventional surveillance methods, a simple algorithm for SSI detection was developed using clinical variables not traditionally included in National Healthcare Safety Network definitions. Methods: A case-control study was conducted among surgeries performed at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System between January 2008 and December 2009. SSI cases were matched to controls without SSI. Clinical variables (administrative, microbiological, pharmacy, radiology) were compared between the groups to determine those that best identified SSI. Results: A total of 70 SSIs were matched to 70 controls. On multivariable analysis, variables significantly associated with SSI identification were wound culture order, computed tomography scan/magnetic resonance imaging order, antibiotic order within 30 days after surgery, and application of a relevant International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision code. Among patients with no SSI identifiers, 98% were correctly classified as having no SSI. Among patients with multiple SSI identifiers, 97.1% were correctly identified as having SSI. The area under the curve for this model was 0.87. Conclusion: We have derived a novel surveillance algorithm for SSI detection with excellent operating characteristics. This algorithm could be automated to streamline infection control efforts. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

TI  - Spectral Super Resolution Of Hyperspectral Images Via Coupled Dictionary Learning
AB  - High-spectral resolution imaging systems play a critical role in the identification and characterization of objects in a scene of interest. Unfortunately, multiple factors impair spectral resolution, as in the case of modern snapshot spectral imagers that associate each hyperpixel with a specific spectral band. In this paper, we introduce a novel postacquisition computational technique aiming to enhance the spectral dimensionality of imaging systems by exploiting the mathematical frameworks of sparse representations and dictionary learning. We propose a coupled dictionary learning model which considers joint feature spaces, composed of low- and high-spectral resolution hypercubes, in order to achieve spectral superresolution performance. We formulate our spectral coupled dictionary learning optimization problem within the context of the alternating direction method of multipliers, and we manage to update the involved quantities via closed-form expressions. In addition, we consider a realistic spectral subsampling scenario, taking into account the spectral response functions of different satellites. Moreover, we apply our spectral superresolution algorithm on real satellite data acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors. Finally, we have investigated the problem of hyperspectral image unmixing using the recovered high-spectral resolution data cube, and we are able to demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant value in hyperspectral image understanding techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to synthesize high-spectral-resolution 3-D hypercubes, achieving better performance compared to state-of-the-art resolution enhancement methods. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Long-Term Low-Level Ambient Air Pollution Exposure And Risk Of Lung Cancer – A Pooled Analysis Of 7 European Cohorts
AB  - Background/aim: Ambient air pollution has been associated with lung cancer, but the shape of the exposure-response function - especially at low exposure levels - is not well described. The aim of this study was to address the relationship between long-term low-level air pollution exposure and lung cancer incidence. Methods: The “Effects of Low-level Air Pollution: a Study in Europe” (ELAPSE) collaboration pools seven cohorts from across Europe. We developed hybrid models combining air pollution monitoring, land use data, satellite observations, and dispersion model estimates for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O3) to assign exposure to cohort participants’ residential addresses in 100 m by 100 m grids. We applied stratified Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, calendar year, marital status, smoking, body mass index, employment status, and neighborhood-level socio-economic status). We fitted linear models, linear models in subsets, Shape-Constrained Health Impact Functions (SCHIF), and natural cubic spline models to assess the shape of the association between air pollution and lung cancer at concentrations below existing standards and guidelines. Results: The analyses included 307,550 cohort participants. During a mean follow-up of 18.1 years, 3956 incident lung cancer cases occurred. Median (Q1, Q3) annual (2010) exposure levels of NO2, PM2.5, BC and O3 (warm season) were 24.2 µg/m3 (19.5, 29.7), 15.4 µg/m3 (12.8, 17.3), 1.6 10−5m−1 (1.3, 1.8), and 86.6 µg/m3 (78.5, 92.9), respectively. We observed a higher risk for lung cancer with higher exposure to PM2.5 (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.23 per 5 µg/m3). This association was robust to adjustment for other pollutants. The SCHIF, spline and subset analyses suggested a linear or supra-linear association with no evidence of a threshold. In subset analyses, risk estimates were clearly elevated for the subset of subjects with exposure below the EU limit value of 25 µg/m3. We did not observe associations between NO2, BC or O3 and lung cancer incidence. Conclusions: Long-term ambient PM2.5 exposure is associated with lung cancer incidence even at concentrations below current EU limit values and possibly WHO Air Quality Guidelines. © 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - The Transition From Research To Operations In Earth Observation: The Case Of Nasa And Noaa In The Us
AB  - That basic scientific research often leads to new insights, concepts, and inventions that can have important practical applications and benefits is an established element of the rationale for federal government investment in research and technology. The way in which scientific studies of the Earth from space make their way into practical approaches to environmental measurements and management presents an enlightening case study of the research-to-applications transfer process. This article discusses how fundamental concepts of technology transfer and diffusion are illustrated in the process of transitioning Earth science research into operations at the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), particularly as it is presented in the National Research Council study, Satellite Observations of the Earth's Environment: Accelerating the Transition of Research to Operations. The authors assert that successful and efficient transitions of this type require not only a detailed understanding of the technologies involved but an appropriately developed social structure to better facilitate those transitions.

TI  - Central Cohesion Gradual Hashing For Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
AB  - With the recent development of remote sensing technology, large image repositories have been collected. In order to retrieve the desired images of massive remote sensing data sets effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel central cohesion gradual hashing (CCGH) mechanism for remote sensing image retrieval. First, we design a deep hashing model based on ResNet-18 which has a shallow architecture and extracts features of remote sensing imagery effectively and efficiently. Then, we propose a new training model by minimizing a central cohesion loss which guarantees that remote-sensing hash codes are as close to their hash code centers as possible. We also adopt a quantization loss which promotes that outputs are binary values. The combination of both loss functions produces highly discriminative hash codes. Finally, a gradual sign-like function is used to reduce quantization errors. By means of the aforementioned developments, our CCGH achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in the task of remote sensing image retrieval. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public remote sensing image data sets. The obtained results support the fact that our newly developed CCGH is competitive with other existing deep hashing methods. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Improving Spatial Resolution Of Satellite Soil Water Index (Swi) Maps Under Clear-Sky Conditions Using A Machine Learning Approach
AB  - One of the limitations of daily Soil Water Index (SWI) products obtained from satellite imagery is the low spatial resolution, limiting their precise applications. The purpose of this study was to present a machine learning based approach to improve the spatial resolution of the SWI obtained from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). Surface biophysical, topographic, and geographical properties (environmental parameters) maps of three field sites from the United States of America (USA), France, and Iran were prepared with a spatial resolution of 30, 1000 and 10,000 m and their effects on SWI were investigated. A SWI estimation model was constructed based on a Random Forest (RF) regression using effective environmental parameters and used to map SWI at 1,000 and 30 m spatial resolutions. The final SWI map with an improved spatial resolution was prepared after applying a correction due to a residual error. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed model was evaluated based on measured soil moisture (SM) data recorded at ground stations. The results showed that land surface temperature had the greatest effect on the spatial distribution of SWI. The impact of surface biophysical properties on the SWI was greater than topographical and geographical properties. The mean SWI error in USA, France, and Iran at spatial resolution of 10,000 (improved 1000 m) for warm season were 23.6 % (15.8 %), 14.2 % (9.8 %) and 10.7 % (7.4 %), respectively. These values for cold season were 27.9 % (17.2 %), 15.3 % (13.2 %) and 15.5 % (8.8 %), respectively. Mean of R2 and RMSE between measured SM values and SWI 10,000 m (1000 m and 30 m) were 0.13 (0.43 and 0.73) and 17.6 (12.1 and 7.2 %), respectively. These values for cold season were 0.10 (0.39, 0.67), and 20.7 (14.3, 7.2 %), respectively. The proposed machine learning based approach showed strong potential in improving the spatial resolution of SWI and giving the opportunity for various precise applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ten Lessons For The Next Influenza Pandemic - An English Perspective: A Personal Reflection Based On Community Surveillance Data
AB  - We review experience in England of the swine flu pandemic between May 2009 and April 2010. The surveillance data from the Royal College of General Practitioners Weekly Returns Service and the linked virological data collected in the integrated program with the Health Protection Agency are used as a reference frame to consider issues emerging during the pandemic. Ten lessons are summarized. (1) Delay between illness onset in the first worldwide cases and virological diagnosis restricted opportunities for containment by regional prophylaxis. (2) Pandemic vaccines are unlikely to be available for effective prevention during the first wave of a pandemic. (3) Open, realistic and continuing communication with the public is important. (4) Surveillance programs should be continued through summer as well as winter. (5) Severity of illness should be incorporated in pandemic definition. (6) The reliability of diagnostic tests as used in routine clinical practice calls for further investigation. (7) Evidence from serological studies is not consistent with evidence based on health care requests made by sick persons and is thus of limited value in cost effectiveness studies. (8) Pregnancy is an important risk factor. (9) New strategies for administering vaccines need to be explored. (10) Acceptance by the public and by health professionals of influenza vaccination as the major plank on which the impact of influenza is controlled has still not been achieved. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

TI  - Potential Supply And Actual Use Of Cultural Ecosystem Services In Mountain Protected Areas And Their Surroundings
AB  - The potential supply of ecosystem services is often assessed using land cover data. Assessment of actual use of ecosystem services by beneficiaries remains less covered and is often assumed to be congruent with potential supply. However, we believe that to contribute to the sustainable management of multifunctional landscapes, more insights are needed on the links between landscape characteristics and the various facets of ecosystem services. In this paper, we assess cultural ecosystem services (CES) such as recreation, inspiration or scenic beauty in three European mountain protected areas and their surroundings. We study the alignment between the potential supply and actual use of CES. CES potential supply was modelled using six biophysical indicators derived from earth observation and open geospatial data. For CES actual use, we employed participatory mapping with protected area visitors and local experts. We modelled CES actual use as a function of landscape biophysical indicators, weighted by (i) stated and (ii) revealed visitor preferences, and accessibility in each protected area using generalized additive mixed-effects models. Accessibility alone could explain around 50\% of the variability of CES actual use, and with the additional inclusion of the 'natural and cultural features' variable, the actual use models reached an explanatory power of around 80\% for all three case-studies. Importantly, biophysical information using land cover data alone cannot fully describe CES actual use, and there was little congruency between modelled potential supply and actual use. Additional socio-cultural features are required to explain the patterns of locations where protected area visitors enjoy CES. Our results can inform visitor management by addressing CES actual use and thereby provide evidence for landscape management and con-servation planning and management, including offering a rewarding experience of nature for visitors.

TI  - Benefits Of Flood-Prone Land Use And The Role Of Coping Capacity, Candaba Floodplains, Philippines
AB  - Socio-ecological benefits provided by floods and use of flood-prone land can be essential, particularly where livelihoods are tied to natural hydrologic cycles, for instance in many developing countries. We use a physically based rainfall-runoff model and remotely sensed data to characterize seasonal inundation in Candaba, Philippines. Through community surveys and focus groups, we identify strategies that allow residents to cope with floods and benefit from the use of flood-prone lands. We apply direct market pricing methods to assess seasonal land use benefits in flood-prone and dry villages. While primary benefits are associated with rice cultivation, we find that flood-prone communities adapt their livelihoods to seasonal inundation, for instance, by using land alternately for agriculture and wild catch fisheries during dry and wet seasons, respectively. Livelihood benefits in flood-prone villages (US \$ 2266/ha) were similar to benefits in non-flooded villages (US \$ 2746/ha). In flood-prone villages, mean benefits from wild fish capture (US \$ 190/ha) are marginal to mean benefits from farming during the wet season (US \$ 1200/ha). However, the adaptive practice of wet season fisheries and dry season agriculture in flood-prone lands yields annual benefits (US \$ 1754/ha) that are significant within the context of the local economy. We conclude that discounting benefits from direct flood-prone land use may misrepresent the socio-economic role of floodplains. Supporting benefits from floodplain use while targeting coping capacities may enhance resilience to seasonal flooding, livelihoods and ecosystem function linked to natural hydrologic processes.

TI  - Use Of Sentinel-3 Olci Images And Machine Learning To Assess The Ecological Quality Of Italian Coastal Waters
AB  - Understanding and monitoring the ecological quality of coastal waters is crucial for preserving marine ecosystems. Eutrophication is one of the major problems affecting the ecological state of coastal marine waters. For this reason, the control of the trophic conditions of aquatic ecosystems is needed for the evaluation of their ecological quality. This study leverages space-based Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument imagery (OLCI) to assess the ecological quality of Mediterranean coastal waters using the Trophic Index (TRIX) key indicator. In particular, we explore the feasibility of coupling remote sensing and machine learning techniques to estimate the TRIX levels in the Ligurian, Tyrrhenian, and Ionian coastal regions of Italy. Our research reveals distinct geographical patterns in TRIX values across the study area, with some regions exhibiting eutrophic conditions near estuaries and others showing oligotrophic characteristics. We employ the Random Forest Regression algorithm, optimizing calibration parameters to predict TRIX levels. Feature importance analysis highlights the significance of latitude, longitude, and specific spectral bands in TRIX prediction. A final statistical assessment validates our model's performance, demonstrating a moderate level of error (MAE of 0.51) and explanatory power (R2 of 0.37). These results highlight the potential of Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery in assessing ecological quality, contributing to our understanding of coastal water ecology. They also underscore the importance of merging remote sensing and machine learning in environmental monitoring and management. Future research should refine methodologies and expand datasets to enhance TRIX monitoring capabilities from space.

TI  - Ecosystem Services Provided By The Exotic Bivalves Dreissena Polymorpha, D. Rostriformis Bugensis, And Limnoperna Fortunei
AB  - The ecosystem services approach to conservation is becoming central to environmental policy decision making. While many negative biological invasion-driven impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning have been identified, much less was done to evaluate their ecosystem services. In this paper, we focus on the often-overlooked ecosystem services provided by three notable exotic ecosystem engineering bivalves, the zebra mussel, the quagga mussel, and the golden mussel. One of the most significant benefits of invasive bivalves is water filtration, which results in water purification and changes rates of nutrient cycling, thus mitigating the effects of eutrophication. Mussels are widely used as sentinel organisms for the assessment and biomonitoring of contaminants and pathogens and are consumed by many fishes and birds. Benefits of invasive bivalves are particularly relevant in human-modified ecosystems. We summarize the multiple ecosystem services provided by invasive bivalves and recommend including the economically quantifiable services in the assessments of their economic impacts. We also highlight important ecosystem disservices by exotic bivalves, identify data limitations, and future research directions. This assessment should not be interpreted as a rejection of the fact that invasive mussels have negative impacts, but as an attempt to provide additional information for scientists, managers, and policymakers.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations In Biophysical Water Quality Parameters: An Integrated In Situ And Remote Sensing Analysis Of An Urban Lake In Chile
AB  - This study aims to develop and implement a methodology for retrieving bio-optical parameters in a lagoon located in the Biobío region, South-Central Chile, by analyzing time series of Landsat-8 OLI satellite images. The bio-optical parameters, i.e., chlorophyll-a (Chl-a, in mg·m−3) and turbidity (in NTU) were measured in situ during a satellite overpass to minimize the impact of atmospheric distortions. To calibrate the satellite images, various atmospheric correction methods (including ACOLITE, C2RCC, iCOR, and LaSRC) were evaluated during the image preprocessing phase. Spectral signatures obtained from the scenes for each atmospheric correction method were then compared with spectral signatures acquired in situ on the water surface. In short, the ACOLITE model emerged as the best fit for the calibration process, reaching R2 values of 0.88 and 0.79 for Chl-a and turbidity, respectively. This underlies the importance of using inversion models, when processing water surfaces, to mitigate errors due to aerosols and the sun-glint effect. Subsequently, reflectance data derived from the ACOLITE model were used to establish correlations between various spectral indices and the in situ data. The empirical retrieval models (based on band combinations) yielding superior performance, with higher R2 values, were subjected to a rigorous statistical validation and optimization by applying a bootstrapping approach. From this process the green chlorophyll index (GCI) was selected as the optimal choice for constructing the Chl-a retrieval model, reaching an R2 of 0.88, while the red + NIR spectral index achieved the highest R2 value (0.79) for turbidity analysis, although in the last case, it was necessary to incorporate data from several seasons for an adequate model training. Our analysis covered a broad spectrum of dates, seasons, and years, which allowed us to search deeper into the evolution of the trophic state associated with the lake. We identified a striking eight-year period (2014–2022) characterized by a decline in Chl-a concentration in the lake, possibly attributable to governmental measures in the region for the protection and conservation of the lake. Additionally, the OLI imagery showed a spatial pattern varying from higher Chl-a values in the northern zone compared to the southern zone, probably due to the heat island effect of the northern urban areas. The results of this study suggest a positive effect of recent local regulations and serve as the basis for the creation of a modern monitoring system that enhances traditional point-based methods, offering a holistic view of the ongoing processes within the lake. © 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Urbanization, Ecosystem Services, And Their Interactive Coercive Relationship In Hunan Province, China
AB  - Failing to balance developmental considerations of the urbanization level (UL) and ecosystem services (ESs) causes issues such as land degradation and social conflict, presenting significant challenges for regional sustainable development. Although numerous studies reported the relationship between UL and ESs, only a few have explored the coupling coordination relationship between urbanization subsystems and ESs from a multidimensional perspective. This study aimed to measure the spatiotemporal characteristics of UL and ESs in Hunan Province from 2000 to 2018 using statistical data and remote sensing monitoring data regarding land use. The multidimensional coupling coordination relationship between urbanization systems and ESs was analyzed using a coupling coordination degree (CCD) model. The results showed that the UL of Hunan Province increased from 2000 to 2018, was spatially high in the east and low in the west, and extended outward from city centers. The average ecosystem services value (ESV) in Hunan Province showed a decreasing trend with some fluctuation. The average ESV in mountainous areas and lake areas was higher than that in the areas surrounding major urban agglomerations. Although the overall CCD between UL and ESs in Hunan Province increased during the study period and entered the coordination stage, the degree of coupling coordination between urbanization subsystems and ESs varied greatly. Thus, the findings of the present study can support the formulation of policies for ecosystem protection and sustainable urbanization in Hunan Province. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Modelling Quantities And Qualities (Q&Q) Of Faecal Sludge In Hanoi, Vietnam And Kampala, Uganda For Improved Management Solutions
AB  - The importance of faecal sludge management is gaining recognition. However, methods are still lacking to reasonably estimate the quantities and qualities (Q&Q) that need to be managed, which makes the planning for and implementing of management solutions quite difficult. The objective of this study was to collect and analyse Q&Q of faecal sludge at a citywide scale, and to evaluate whether “SPA-DET” data (=> spatially analysable - demographic, environmental and technical) could then be used as predictors of Q&Q of faecal sludge. 60 field samples and questionnaires from Hanoi and 180 from Kampala were analysed. Software tools were used in an iterative process to predict total solids (TS) and emptying frequency in both Hanoi, Vietnam and Kampala, Uganda. City-specific data could be predicted with types of “SPA-DET” data as input variables, and model performance was improved by analysing septic tanks and pit latrines separately. Individual models were built for TS concentrations and emptying frequency. In addition, a model was built across both cities for emptying frequency of septic tanks based on number of users and containment volume, indicating predictive models can be relevant for multiple cities. Number of users, containment volume, truck volume and income level were identified as the most common variables for the correction function. Results confirm the high intrinsic variability of faecal sludge characteristics, and illustrate the importance of moving beyond simple reporting of city-wide average values for estimations of Q&Q. The collected data and developed scripts have been made available for replication in future studies. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - Quantitative And Qualitative Assessment Of Soil Erosion Risk In Małopolska (Poland), Supported By An Object-Based Analysis Of High-Resolution Satellite Images
AB  - In 2011 the Marshal Office of Małopolska Voivodeship decided to evaluate the vulnerability of soils to water erosion for the entire region. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of the erosion risk for the soils of the Małopolska region was done based on the USLE approach. The special work-flow of geoinformation technologies was used to fulfil this goal. A high-resolution soil map, together with rainfall data, a detailed digital elevation model and statistical information about areas sown with particular crops created the input information for erosion modelling in GIS environment. The satellite remote sensing technology and the object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach gave valuable support to this study. RapidEye satellite images were used to obtain the essential up-to-date data about land use and vegetation cover for the entire region (15,000 km 2 ). The application of OBIA also led to defining the direction of field cultivation and the mapping of contour tillage areas. As a result, the spatially differentiated values of erosion control practice factor were used. Both, the potential and the actual soil erosion risk were assessed quantificatively and qualitatively. The results of the erosion assessment in the Małopolska Voivodeship reveal the fact that a majority of its agricultural lands is characterized by moderate or low erosion risk levels. However, high-resolution erosion risk maps show its substantial spatial diversity. According to our study, average or higher actual erosion intensity levels occur for 10.6 % of agricultural land, i.e. 3.6 % of the entire voivodeship area. In 20 % of the municipalities there is a very urgent demand for erosion control. In the next 23 % an urgent erosion control is needed. Our study showed that even a slight improvement of P-factor estimation may have an influence on modeling results. In our case, despite a marginal change of erosion assessment figures on a regional scale, the influence on the final prioritization of areas (municipalities) according to erosion control needs is visible. The study shows that, high-resolution satellite imagery and OBIA may be efficiently used for P-factor mapping and thus contribute to a refined soil erosion risk assessment. © 2013 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Variations In Vegetation Index And Its Impact Factors In The West Liaohe Plain In Inner Mongolia
AB  - The West Liaohe Plain is located in the farming-pasturing ecotone in North China, which lies in the semi-arid region, including the Kerqin Sandy Land, where the ecological environment is extremely fragile. It is of great significance to study the spatio-temporal variation in vegetation index and its influencing factors for predicting the risk of land degradation, which can provide technical support for the protection and management of ecological environment and the rational development and utilization of water resources in the watershed. In this paper, based on the MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2019, the univariate linear regression trend method and Mann-Kendall test are used to analyze the vegetation growth trend and mutation in this area in the past 20 years. Considering the water and heat conditions affecting vegetation growth, the correlations between NDVI and meteorological factors (precipitation, air temperature), soil moisture, groundwater depth and other factors are analyzed. In addition, combined with human activities, the impact of land use type change on NDVI is analyzed. The results indicate that (1) the NDVI during the vegetation growing season from 2000 to 2019 shows an overall upward trend, with no significant abrupt change points, the highest value is 0.56 and the lowest value is 0.41. (2) NDVI presents a spatial distribution characteristic of “high in the east and low in the west”. The NDVI of different land use types are in the descending order: cultivated land > forest land > swamp land > flood plain > grassland > saline land > sandy land. (3) The 92.5% of the area shows an increasing trend, and the 7.5% of the area shows a decreasing trend. (4) NDVI is positively correlated with precipitation, temperature and soil moisture, with correlation coefficients of 0.86, 0.80 and 0.81, respectively and precipitation has a greater impact on vegetation. (5) The most suitable groundwater level depth for natural vegetation growth is about 3 m, and when the groundwater level depth is more than 10 m, NDVI will decrease sharply with the increasing groundwater levael depth. (6) Human activities such as land reclamation and afforestation are the main reasons for the increasing trend of NDVI in recent 20 years, which improves the ecological environment to a certain extent. © Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology 2022.

TI  - Sustainable Fresh Water Resources Management In Northern Kuwait-A Remote Sensing View From Raudatain Basin
AB  - The paper presents time and cost effective remote sensing technology to estimate recharge potential of fresh water shallow aquifers for their sustainable management of water resources in arid ecosystem. Precipitation measurement of Raudatain basin in Kuwait from TRMM data has been made and integrated with geological, geomorphological and hyrological data, to estimate the recharge potential of this basin. The total precipitation in the basin is estimated at 334 MCM for the year 2003. The initial losses are estimated at 78.43% and the transmission loss at 14.866% of the net precipitation. For sustainable management of the ground water resources, recharge wells have been proposed in the higher order streams to augment the Raudatain aquifer in Kuwait. If the available quantity of precipitation can be successfully utilized, it will reduce considerable pressure on desalination, which leads to increased salinity at the coast in Arabian Gulf. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dynamic Evaluation Of Agricultural Drought Hazard In Northeast China Based On Coupled Multi-Source Data
AB  - As the climate warms, the impact of drought on plants has increased. We aimed to construct a comprehensive drought index (CDI), coupling soil-vegetation-atmosphere drought and heat conditions based on multi-source information, and to combine it with static and dynamic drought hazard evaluation models to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of agricultural drought disasters and hazards during the growing season (May to September) in Northeast China (NEC). The results demonstrated that the CDI could combine the benefits of meteorology (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI), vegetation (vegetation health index, VHI), and soil (standardized soil moisture condition index, SMCI) indices. This was performed using a relative weighting method based on the remote sensing data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to determine the weights of SPEI, VHI, and SMCI. The CDI for drought monitoring has the advantages of broad spatial range, long time range, and high accuracy, and can effectively reflect agricultural drought; the growing season in NEC showed a trend of becoming drier during 1982-2020. However, the trends of the drought index, the impact range of drought events, and the hazard of agricultural drought all turned around 2000. The drought hazard was highly significant (p < 0.001) and decreased from 2000 to 2020. The frequency of drought disasters was the highest, and the hazard was the greatest in May. The best level of climatic yield anomalies in maize were explained by drought hazard in August (R-2 = 0.28). In the center and western portions of the study area, farmland and grassland areas were where higher levels of hazard were most commonly seen. The dynamic hazard index is significantly correlated with climatic yield anomalies and can reflect the actual impact of drought on crop yield. The study results serve as a scientific foundation for drought risk assessment and management, agricultural planning, and the formulation of drought adaptation policies, as well as for ensuring food security in China.

TI  - Monitoring Spatiotemporal Variations In Nutrients In A Large Drinking Water Reservoir And Their Relationships With Hydrological And Meteorological Conditions Based On Landsat 8 Imagery
AB  - Nutrient enrichment is a major cause of water eutrophication, and variations in nutrient enrichment are influenced by environmental changes and anthropogenic activities. Accurately estimating nutrient concentrations and understanding their relationships with environmental factors are vital to develop nutrient management strategies to mitigate eutrophication. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data is used to estimate nutrient concentrations and analyze their responses to hydrological and meteorological conditions. Two well-accepted empirical models are developed and validated to estimate the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (C-TN and C-TP) in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir using Landsat 8 OLI data from 2013 to 2016. Spatially, C-TN decreased from the transition zone to the riverine zone and the lacustrine zone. On the other hand, C-TP decreased from the riverine zone to the transition zone and the lacustrine zone. Temporally, C-TN displayed elevated values during the late fall and winter and had lower values during the summer and early fall, whereas C-TP was higher during the spring and lower during the winter. Among the environmental factors, the rainfall and the inflow rate have strong positive correlations with the nutrient concentrations. TN is more sensitive to meteorological factors (wind speed, temperature, sunshine duration), and the spatial driving forces vary among the different sections of the reservoir. However, TP is more easily influenced by human activities, such as fishery and agricultural activities. Current results would improve our understanding of the drivers of nutrients spatiotemporal variability and the approach in this study can be applicable to other similar reservoir to develop related strategies to mitigate eutrophication.

TI  - Improved Integrated Water Resource Modelling By Combining Dpsir And System Dynamics Conceptual Modelling Techniques
AB  - Similar to any modelling technique, system dynamics (SD) modelling should start with the essential step of scoping and identifying the problem of interest before further analysis and modelling. In practice, this first step is a challenging task, especially when wicked issues such as water management are being addressed. There is still a vital need for modelling methods and tools that can support modellers to identify and assemble essential data to inform problem scoping and boundary setting. This article aims to narrow this gap by presenting a methodology for combining a series of conceptual modelling techniques (extending the usually linear Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework with causal loop diagrams, system archetypes, stock and flow diagrams) towards the development of a quantitative SD model. A case study of the Gorganroud-Gharesu Basin, in Iran, is used to illustrate the benefits of the methodology. Our experience shows that combining multiple conceptual models provides complementary insights into the problem boundaries and model structure, as a basis for developing the SD model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Soil Salinization In The Oasis Areas Of Downstream Inland Rivers -Case Study: Minqin Oasis
AB  - Soil salinization is the main resource and environmental problem in arid and semiarid regions, and it seriously restricts regional ecological security and sustainable agricultural development. Accurate monitoring of soil salinization and analysis of its main influencing factors are of great significance to the improvement and management of soil salinization. In this paper, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and salinity index (SI) were extracted from Landsat images of the Minqin oasis from 2000 to 2018, and these data were used to construct a soil salinization remote sensing monitoring index model (SDI). The index extracted by the model was used to monitor the soil salinization information, and the index values were graded to obtain different degrees of soil salinized land. The measured data were used to verify the accuracy of the SDI through trend analysis, stability analysis and other methods, and explore the characteristics and main influencing factors of soil salinization in the Minqin oasis. The results showed that the spatial distribution characteristics of the different degrees of soil salinity extracted by the SDI model were consistent with the measured results. The area of salinized soil in the Minqin oasis exceeded 80\%, and the proportion of lightly salinized soil was the largest. The area ratio of salinized soil did not change much from 2000 to 2018, but the changes between different degrees of salinized soil were large.The unused land in the Minqin oasis exhibited a high degree of salinization, which was manifested spatially in the northwest of the Minqin oasis and the areas surrounding Qingtu Lake. In addition, the soil salinization of the Minqin oasis exhibited obvious seasonal differences, and the different degrees of salinization also changed with the change in seasons. The analysis of the main influencing factors of soil salinization in the Minqin oasis revealed that the large land occupation ratio of salinized land in the Minqin oasis was related to the local climatic factors. In recent years, changes in soil salinity in parts of the Minqin oasis and Qingtu Lake area were mainly the result of ecological water conveyance.

TI  - A Combined Gis-Based Remote Sensing And Wireline Log Data Analysis For Water Resource Management In The Economic Capital District Of Cameroon
AB  - Drinking water has been supplied to the city of Douala since 1983 from the groundwater from the Massoumbou catchment field. The growth of population in the urban city leads to the development of novel groundwater resources. Several wells have been drilled by the National Company in charge of water in the area. However, the drawdown has dropped off completely after several days of exploitation. To understand the problem, remote-sensing-based GIS and gamma-ray logging have been used, respectively, to investigate the water accumulation network zone and clay content of the reservoir. The results have shown that the deep groundwater potential aquifer is located in the sand lithology with a Shale content range between 5.5 and 8.8\% and 10 m and 148 m of the depth. The drainage density, lineaments density, slope, soil, rainfall, and surface lithology maps were overlaid to obtain the benefit position of the water well. From the overall analysis, the potential zone of groundwater in the study area is classified into five classes named as very good (5.3\%), good (19.2\%), moderate (21.8\%), low (30.8\%), and poor (22.8\%) zone. During validation, the 14 dug wells of the area are located in the poor, low, and moderate potential zones. This paper can serve as a guide on water resource management in the economic capital district of Cameroon.

TI  - Functional Integrity Of Freshwater Forested Wetlands, Hydrologic Alteration, And Climate Change
AB  - Climate change will challenge managers to balance the freshwater needs of humans and wetlands. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that most regions of the world will be exposed to higher temperatures, 2, and more erratic precipitation, with some regions likely to have alternating episodes of intense flooding and mega-drought. Coastal areas will be exposed to more frequent saltwater inundation as sea levels rise. Local land managers desperately need intra-regional climate information for site-specific planning, management, and restoration activities. Managers will be challenged to deliver freshwater to floodplains during climate change-induced drought, particularly within hydrologically altered and developed landscapes. Assessment of forest health, both by field and remote sensing techniques, will be essential to signal the need for hydrologic remediation. Studies of the utility of the release of freshwater to remediate stressed forested floodplains along the Murray and Mississippi Rivers suggest that brief episodes of freshwater remediation for trees can have positive health benefits for these forests. The challenges of climate change in forests of the developing world will be considered using the Tonle Sap of Cambodia as an example. With little ecological knowledge of the impacts, managing climate change will add to environmental problems already faced in the developing world with new river engineering projects. These emerging approaches to remediate stressed trees will be of utmost importance for managing worldwide floodplain forests with predicted climate changes. © 2016, © 2016 Middleton and Souter et al.

TI  - Assessing The Utility Of Geospatial Technologies To Investigate Environmental Change Within Lake Systems
AB  - Over 50% of the world's population live within 3 km of rivers and lakes highlighting the on-going importance of freshwater resources to human health and societal well-being. Whilst covering c. 3.5% of the Earth's non-glaciated land mass, trends in the environmental quality of the world's standing waters (natural lakes and reservoirs) are poorly understood, at least in comparison with rivers, and so evaluation of their current condition and sensitivity to change are global priorities. Here it is argued that a geospatial approach harnessing existing global datasets, along with new generation remote sensing products, offers the basis to characterise trajectories of change in lake properties e.g., water quality, physical structure, hydrological regime and ecological behaviour. This approach furthermore provides the evidence base to understand the relative importance of climatic forcing and/or changing catchment processes, e.g. land cover and soil moisture data, which coupled with climate data provide the basis to model regional water balance and runoff estimates over time. Using examples derived primarily from the Danube Basin but also other parts of the World, we demonstrate the power of the approach and its utility to assess the sensitivity of lake systems to environmental change, and hence better manage these key resources in the future. © 2015 The Authors

TI  - Communication Value Of Urban Space In The Urban Planning Process On The Example Of A Polish City
AB  - The main aim of this study was to determine the communication value of urban space. This goal was pursued in several research stages. For the needs of this study, the concept of communication value of public transport was defined as the ease of transit between points in space by means of public transport. The communication value of urban space is directly proportional to the number of lines serving a given stop, the number of lines departing from a given stop, and the distance to a public transport stop. The indicators of communication value were determined. The theoretical assumptions for developing a method for the determination of communication value were also developed. The proposed method was verified in the study area, and the applicability of the proposed method was discussed. The study was conducted in the city of Olsztyn where two types of public transport are available: buses and trams. In the analyzed period, Olsztyn had 35 bus lines, including 25 regular lines, 3 commuter lines, 5 seasonal lines, and 2 night lines. There were also 3 tram lines in the city. The main public transport operator had a fleet of 160 vehicles. The results of the study indicate that the proposed method supports the identification of areas with high communication value as well as areas where public transport requires improvement. Due to its universality, the method is applicable in many areas, from city planning through the process of estimating the market value of the property to the decisions made by the inhabitants when choosing their place of residence. Acoustic value maps have recently gained popularity in urbanized areas. A map of the communication value of urban space based on the proposed method is likely to become equally popular.

TI  - Socio-Economic Disparities In Greenspace Quality: Insights From The City Of Melbourne
AB  - PurposeThis paper takes a prudent approach to assessing the quality of greenspace in low- and high socio-economic status (SES) settings. Socio-economic data from deprivation indexes were used to systematically define low- and high-SES suburbs. A Geographical Information System (GIS) observation of greenspaces was used to score spaces according to a scoring criterion contingent on six quality facets. Statistics were then synthesised, producing a Cohen effect score highlighting disparities in each criterion between the two SES groups.Design/methodology/approachAs the phenomena of locational prejudice and meritocratic inequality continue to garner global attention, this paper extrapolates this to a world-renown metropolis, Melbourne. This paper endeavours to provide invaluable insights into the environmental injustice paradigm within greenspace and its respective quality.FindingsConclusive results affirmed a concerning disparity in the quality of greenspace between Melbourne's low- and high-SES settings. Cohen's effect size found that on average, there was a "medium" distinction between the spaces, whilst an individual focus on the quality facets concluded diverse findings.Research limitations/implicationsThe core of study adopted a meticulous virtual assessment to critique the quality of selected greenspaces opposed to an in-person-real world assessment which could garner more nuanced findings.Originality/valueExisting literature on Melbourne has prioritised distribution, proximity and accessibility domains when assessing inequitable greenspace and, consequently, has catalysed a research gap in greenspace quality. This is also one of the first papers to provide insight into the "Plan Melbourne" policy regarding urban regeneration and ameliorating public open spaces.

TI  - Rapid Estimation Of Water Stress In Choy Sum (Brassica Chinensis Var. Parachinensis) Using Integrative Approach
AB  - To optimize crop water consumption and adopt water-saving measures such as precision irrigation, early identification of plant water status is critical. This study explores the effectiveness of estimating water stress in choy sum (Brassica chinensis var. parachinensis) grown in pots in greenhouse conditions using Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and crop vegetation indicators to improve irrigation water management. Data on CWSI and Spectral reflectance were collected from choy sum plants growing in sandy loam soil with four different soil field capacities (FC): 90–100% FC as no water stress (NWS); 80–90% FC for light water stress (LWS); 70–80% FC for moderate water stress (MWS); and 60– 70% FC for severe water stress (SWS). With four treatments and three replications, the experiment was set up as a completely randomized design (CRD). Throughout the growing season, plant water stress tracers such as leaf area index (LAI), canopy temperature (Tc), leaf relative water content (LRWC), leaf chlorophyll content, and yield were measured. Furthermore, CWSI estimated from the Workswell Wiris Agro R Infrared Camera (CWSIW) and spectral data acquisition from the Analytical Spectral Device on choy sum plants were studied at each growth stage. NDVI, Photochemical Reflectance Index positioned at 570 nm (PRI570), normalized PRI (PRInorm), Water Index (WI), and NDWI were the Vegetation indices (VIs) used in this study. At each growth stage, the connections between these CWSIW, VIs, and water stress indicators were statistically analyzed with R2 greater than 0.5. The results revealed that all VIs were valuable guides for diagnosing water stress in choy sum. CWSIW obtained from this study showed that Workswell Wiris Agro R Infrared Camera mounted on proximal remote sensing platform for assessing water stress in choy sum plant was rapid, non-destructive, and user friendly. Therefore, integrating CWSIW and VIs approach gives a more rapid and accurate approach for detecting water stress in choy sum grown under greenhouse conditions to optimize yield by reducing water loss and enhancing food security and sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment Of Non-Point Source Pollution Measured Through Land Use/Land Cover (Lulc) Changes In A Tropical Complex Catchment
AB  - The contribution of non-point source pollution (NPS) to the contamination of surface water is an issue of growing concern. Non-point source (NPS) pollutants are of various types and altered by several site-specific factors making them difficult to control due to complex uncertainties involve in their behavior. Kelantan River basin, Malaysia is a tropical catchment receiving heavy monsoon rainfall coupled with intense land use/land cover (LULC) changes making the area consistently flood prone thereby deteriorating the surface water quality in the area. This study was conducted to determine the spatio-temporal variation of NPS pollutant loads among different LULC changes and to establish a NPS pollutant loads relationships among LULC conditions and sub-basins in each catchment. Four pollutants parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (AN) were chosen with their corresponding event mean concentration values (EMC). Soil map and LULC change maps corresponding to 1984, 2002 and 2013 were used for the calculation of runoff and NPS pollutant loads using numeric integration in a GIS environment. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted for the comparison of NPS pollutant loads among the three LULC conditions used and the sub-basins in each catchment. The results showed that the spatio-temporal variation of pollutant loads in almost all the catchments increased with changes in LULC condition as one moves from 1984 to 2013, with 2013 LULC condition found as the dominant in almost all cases. NPS pollutant loads among different LULC changes also increased with changes in LULC condition from 1984 to 2013. While urbanization was found to be the dominant LULC change with the highest pollutant load in all the catchments. Results from ANOVA reveals that statistically most significant (p < 0.05) pollutant loads were obtained from 2013 LULC conditions, while statistically least significant (p < 0.05) pollutant loads were obtained under 1984 LULC condition. This reveals the clear effect of LULC changes on NPS pollution. The findings of this study may be useful to water resource planners in controlling water pollution for future planning.

TI  - Informal And Ubiquitous: Colonias, Premature Subdivisions And Other Unplanned Suburbs On America's Urban Fringe
AB  - Along the US border with Mexico there are thousands of communities designated by the federal government as colonias, a name that highlights the large numbers of low-income, Hispanic immigrants that live in these communities. These subdivisions have been studied extensively in recent years, often using insights from the concept of urban informality. This research has highlighted the challenges posed by exploitative land sales practices, poor-quality or non-existent infrastructure and poor-quality housing in these communities. However, similar informal subdivisions exist along the urban fringe elsewhere across the US, though they are not designated as colonias by the federal government and scholars rarely consider their similarities to colonias in the border region. This study uses data on Census Designated Places from the American Community Survey, satellite imagery and county property records to examine the extent and nature of these subdivisions. The results illustrate that informal land development of the sort described here is not restricted only to the border region, to immigrant enclaves or to Hispanic communities. Instead, it is demonstrated that informal subdivisions exist in large numbers across Southern and Western states and, though their numbers are smaller, they are present even in the Midwest and Northeast. Moreover, these subdivisions are home to diverse populations and they provide important benefits such as expanded opportunities of homeownership for minorities and the poor.

TI  - The Role Of The State In The Decline Of Public Space - A Historical Perspective
AB  - According to Mike Davis, the militarisation of urban space is a process that builds a city wound securitisation, leading to an urban space made exclusive through surveillance and disciplining strutegies. The end or decline of public space is described as the result of such militarisation processes by critical theorists who linked it to capitalist, neoliberal city governance. Thus understood, urban space is formed by capital to achieve an economically more competitive city leading to the displacement of the poor and homeless. As a result, public space ceases to exist as the epitome o f democracy, as a place where different social groups can mingle and voice their discontent. While such processes of militarisation increasingly characterise the urban spaces of Budapest, too, it is not necessarily the case that the discourse on the "decline" or "end of public space" also applies to Budapest when it is analysed from a local and historical perspective. In addition, the question arises as to whether there has ever actually been a more democratic public space in Budapest. This article focuses on the changing role of the state through its interpretation of the meaning and use of public space, starting from Lefebvre's argument that power is mediated through space. In addition to Lefebvre's theories on the production of space, this study is informed by Susan Gal's paper on the semiotics of public/private distinction, as it is helpful for a deeper understanding of the relationship between the state and public space. Based on feminist theory, Gal argues that the difference between public and private is ideologically defined. Therefore, the relation between public and private cannot alone describe society, it rather acts as a tool for argument or discussion of value systems. The aim is to understand from a historical perspective the decline of public space and the militarisation of urban space as discussed by critical theorists in the case of Budapest. For such urban tendencies should be seen not only with regard to capital(ism) but also in the context of (central and local) governments. The basis is provided by analyses of both the minutes of the Budapest Metropolitan Council of 1978 and archive footage (news and advertisements) from the 1960s to the 1970s. The article concludes that although the militarisation of urban space described by Davis also characterises Budapest, especially since the 2000s, the author's historical research suggests that in the case of Budapest the lack of democratic public space has a longer history than neoliberal urban planning, rooted in the period ofstate socialism when other policies of exclusion privileged certain social groups.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Dynamics Of Vegetation In Xishuangbanna From 2001 To 2015 Based On Mod13q1 Data
AB  - Xishuangbanna, the largest rainforest region in China, is one of the most important biodiversity conservation areas in the world. Studying the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation in Xishuangbanna and its relationship with climate factors can provide scientific supports for environmental management. This study, based on MODIS-NDVI dataset, aims to assess the spatial-temporal dynamics and spatial autocorrelation distribution pattern of NDVI and its response to thermal-moisture factors in Xishuangbanna from 2001 to 2015. Spatial autocorrelation analysis, linear-regression analysis and partial correlation analysis were carried out. From 2001 to 2015, annual NDVI showed a slowly upward trend, with a rate of 0.11% · 10 a-1 and the most pronounced enhancement in 2011-2015. NDVI had a “season inversion” phenomenon, i.e., the lowest NDVI value occurred in summer. In the past 15 years, mean NDVI of Xishuangbanna was 0.875, with a pattern of “high in the east and low in the west”. The NDVI threshold within 0.850.9 accounted for the largest proportion of the area. From 2001 to 2015, the Global Moran’s I of NDVI was greater than 0.65, showing a significant positive spatial autocorrelation, but the degree of spatial agglomeration of NDVI had weakened and tended to be fragmented. In 2013, the spatial heterogeneity of NDVI was the strongest. There were differences in vegetation change across different climate types. In the north tropical zone, the areas with improvement and degradation accounted for 28.74% and 9.40%, respectively. In the south subtropical ami mid-subtropical zones, the deteriorated area was slightly higher than the improved area. Temperature was the dominant factor driving vegetation growth in Xishuanghanna. which was positively correlated with NDVI from December to February of the following year. Precipitation from June to November was significantly negatively correlated with NDVI. © 2019, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Integrated Framework To Map Animal Distributions In Large And Remote Regions
AB  - In this paper we show how new technologies can be incorporated from the gathering of field data on wildlife distribution to the final stage of producing distribution maps. We describe an integrated framework for conducting wildlife censuses to obtain data to build predictive models of species distribution that when integrated in a GIS will produce a distribution map. Field data can be obtained with greater accuracy and at lower costs using a combination of Global Positioning System, Personal Digital Assistant, and specific wildlife recording software. Sampling design benefits from previous knowledge of environmental variability that can be obtained from free remote sensing data. Environmental predictors derived from this remote sensing information alone, combined with automatic procedures for predictor selection and model fitting, can render cost-effective predictive distribution models for wildlife. We show an example with guanaco distribution in the Patagonian steppes of Santa Cruz province, Argentina. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Testing The Capabilities Of The New Worldview-3 Space-Borne Sensor's Red-Edge Spectral Band In Discriminating And Mapping Complex Grassland Management Treatments
AB  - The majority of grasslands are overused and poorly managed, globally. The overuse of these grasslands has resulted in the adoption of numerous management treatments as interventions for optimizing their productivity. However, there are limited comprehensive frameworks and objective precedents for monitoring these grasslands and rangelands. In that regard, understanding the effect of such rangeland management treatments on grassland productivity is, therefore, a critical step towards their effective conservation and sustainable management. This study sought to test the capabilities of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite data derivatives in characterizing grasslands administered with different rangeland management treatments (i.e. mowing, grazing, burning, fertilizer application, and control: no-treatment), using discriminant analysis. We compared the accuracies obtained based on WV-3 standard visible and near-infrared bands and vegetation indices (VIs), excluding and including the red-edge. Results illustrate that incorporating the strategically positioned red-edge band improves the classification accuracy of the four different rangeland management treatments from 65\% to 70\%. Furthermore, the overall accuracy was 73\% when standard VIs were used and it increased to 78\% when the red-edge VIs were added to standard VIs. Other than the red-edge derivatives, the results of this study showed that the yellow, red, NIR-1, and NIR-2 bands were the most influential. The utility of fine spatial resolution sensors such as the newly launched WV-3, with strategically positioned bands (red-edge), could offer detailed information essential for the sustainable management of grasslands.

TI  - Simulation Of Landscape Pattern Evolution In Dengkou County Using Aes-Lpi-Ca Model
AB  - Landscape pattern is closely related to many local ecological processes. Study on the future evolution of landscape pattern in the arid area of Northwest China is of great significance to local prevention and controlling of desertification and water and soil conservation. Therefore, taking Dengkou County, Bayannaoer City, Inner Mongolia as study area, a AES-LPI-CA model was built based on the LPI-CA-Markov model to simulate the landscape pattern of Dengkou County in 2014 by using the remote sensing image interpretation data of 2000 and 2007. Firstly, the landscape pattern transfer appropriate atlas was built and artificial endocrine system (AES) was used to adjust the probabilities of the CA center cell transfer into different landscape types, the cellular automata neighborhood rule was taken into consideration, and the transfer direction of the center cell was settled. Then the un-transition probability (UTP) map which was built based on the quantitative relation between landscape index (LPI) and UTP was used to define the occurrence probability of the transfer, and the landscape transition probability matrix which was generated by using Markov model was used to make the final decision of transfer. The simulation result of the model was compared with the results of LPI-CA-Markov model and CA-Markov model. The Kappa index of agreement (KIA) of simulation results of the three models were 0.823 6, 0.785 5 and 0.768 2, respectively, AES-LPI-CA model had a higher simulation precision. The research result had referential values for the study on future evolution of landscape and formulation of ecological policy. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.

TI  - Early Warning Of Illegal Development For Protected Areas By Integrating Cellular Automata With Neural Networks
AB  - Ecological security has become a major issue under fast urbanization in China. As the first two cities in this country, Shenzhen and Dongguan issued the ordinance of Eco-designated Line of Control (ELC) to "wire" ecologically important areas for strict protection in 2005 and 2009 respectively. Early warning systems (EWS) are a useful tool for assisting the implementation ELC. In this study, a multi-model approach is proposed for the early warning of illegal development by integrating cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The objective is to prevent the ecological risks or catastrophe caused by such development at an early stage. The integrated model is calibrated by using the empirical information from both remote sensing and handheld GPS (global positioning systems). The MAR indicator which is the ratio of missing alarms to all the warnings is proposed for better assessment of the model performance. It is found that the fast urban development has caused significant threats to natural-area protection in the study area. The integration of CA, ANN and GPS provides a powerful tool for describing and predicting illegal development which is in highly non-linear and fragmented forms. The comparison shows that this multi-model approach has much better performances than the single-model approach for the early warning. Compared with the single models of CA and ANN, this integrated multi-model can improve the value of MAR by 65.48% and 5.17% respectively. © 2013.

TI  - Water Quality Assessment For Organic Matter Load In Urban Rivers Considering Land Cover Dynamics
AB  - The strategy of considering a model that is comparable to the Soil Conservation Service Curve-Number (SCS-CN) method that employs land use maps to estimate the effects of land use on the water quality has considerable potential for application. This paper presents the LUPC (Land Use Pollutant Contribution) Model to estimate water pollution from the watershed land use obtained by satellite image classification (Sentinel-2). It defines that each land use produces a specific pollutant load per unit area, called Pollutant Standard Index (PSI), which undergoes degradation and/or retention until it reaches the river. This decay estimate is based on a Kernel Function. Organic matter (OM) was the pollutant chosen for the definition of the LUPC model and fractions of labile and refractory organic matter (LOM, ROM). The model was applied to the Barigui River basin, and five samples were collected at 12 points along the river. Water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV-Visible absorbance in addition to chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and nitrogen and phosphorus fractions were the reference for modeling purposes. The results indicate that organic loads can be estimated from watershed characteristics, despite influence from seasonal influences captured by the PSI values and the basin shape parameter. Considering its versatile response, the LUPC model can be used for integrated water resources and land use planning and management and be indicator of the potential pollution of rivers by OM.

TI  - Zonation And Spatiotemporal Evolution Of China's Desertification
AB  - Land desertification is one of the most serious eco- environmental problems in the world, and is among the top ten environmental and development problems that threaten the survival of human beings. China has severe desertification, and desertification has greatly affected China's eco- environment and social development. In this context, the research on desertification is of great significance to China. The evolution of desertification is mainly manifested in the change of desertification area, the area change, change of desertification types, vegetation change, and so on. In this paper, the 31 provincial regions of China (excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau) were included as the study area. Remote sensing was utilized to study the spatiotemporal evolution of the thematic factors of desertification, salinization, and erosion- induced desertification. Following the principles of regional differentiation, genesis, and multi- level sequences, China was divided into 8 desertification zones, 42 desertification sub- regions, and 36 desertification communities. Based on the desertified land type maps of 1975, 2000 and 2017, we analyzed the desertification evolution by focusing on the changes in the area and gravity center of China’s desertification. According to the percentage of increase or decrease of desertified land area over a certain period of time, the evolution types of desertification can be divided into 7 categories. The present study reveals the current situation of China’s desertification, and analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution and the gravity center movements of different desertification regions. Next, the key target areas and management suggestions of desertification control in China were discussed. Our findings are as follows. (1) There are many kinds of deserts and desertified lands in China, of which the area of severe desertification is 25.18×104 km2, accounting for 19.59% of the total desertification area. (2) From 1975 to 2017, China's desertification has been significantly reversed, and the dynamic characteristics of desertification in 1975- 2000 differed from 2000-2017. The intensity of desertification in 2000-2017 significantly reduced as compared to 1975-2000, thanks to the decrease in aggravated areas and increase in weakened areas. (3) The migration value of desertification center of gravity can indirectly reflect the development trend and degree of dynamic change of desertification, the greater the migration, the more significant the difference of desertification change in this region, and the direction of center of gravity migration is the area where desertification area increases. The coordinate migration of desertification barycenter points in different periods has the same orientation. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Long-Term Ecological Environment Quality Evaluation And Its Driving Mechanism In Luoyang City
AB  - The quality of the ecological environment determines human well-being, and the degree of ecological environment quality has a significant impact on regional sustainable development. Currently, the assessment content of ecological environment quality in Luoyang is relatively single-indicator-based and is insufficient to comprehensively reflect the changes in the ecological environment quality of Luoyang city. Therefore, the study aims to use the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI), a comprehensive evaluation model, with Landsat remote sensing images and statistical yearbooks as the data sources, to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamic changes in the ecological environment quality of Luoyang city from 2002 to 2022 through trend analysis and mutation testing; the study employs geographical detectors to analyze the driving factors about the changes in ecological environment quality. The study found that: (1) the average RSEI value in Luoyang city has increased by 0.102 in the past 20 years, indicating an overall improvement in the ecological environment quality of Luoyang city. (2) The northern region of the study area has lower RSEI values, while the southern region has better ecological environment quality, which corresponds to the fact that the northern part of Luoyang city has intensive human activities, while the southern part is characterized by higher vegetation coverage in mountainous areas. (3) The proportion of areas with medium and above ecological environment quality grades have increased from 47.2\% to 67.5\%, indicating a positive trend in future ecological environment quality changes. (4) The population change was the strongest single factor influencing the ecological environment quality change in Luoyang city. The interaction between temperature and GDP was relatively the strongest. The current ecological environment status in the study area is the result of the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic factors. The research conclusions contribute to improving regional ecological environment quality and are of great significance for the regional ecological environment planning and the achievement of sustainable development goals.

TI  - Spatial Statistics Techniques For Spei And Ndvi Drought Indices: A Case Study Of Khuzestan Province
AB  - Drought is a major water resources management issue in Iran. Khuzestan Province is in a drought state due to water shortage. Therefore, identifying areas at high risk of drought and when drought occurs is essential for drought management. For this purpose, this study used precipitation and temperature data of 12 selected stations and MODIS sensor images from the United States Geological Survey database in 2000-2017. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated using the Hargreaves-Samani method and ENVI software. Moreover, different spatial statistics techniques were used in the ArcGIS environment to analyze the results. Also, time series diagrams were drawn, and the trend was evaluated using the Mann-Kendall test. Finally, the distribution of NDVI values was investigated using EasyFit software, and the amount of drought damage was determined using NDVI. The investigation of the cluster maps of the Anselin Local Moran's Index along with hot and cold spots formed for both SPEI and NDVI showed that drought severity was higher at the southern stations than at the semi-northern and northwestern ones in the province. Moreover, the survey results using the EasyFit software showed that the southern stations, including the Ahvaz, Mahshahr, and Omidiyeh-Aghajari stations, were more at risk of drought than the other stations due to the drought threshold. Furthermore, the total damage caused by drought for the Ahvaz and Abadan stations showed a damage rate of 50\%.

TI  - Mapping Algal Blooms In Aquatic Ecosystems Using Long-Term Landsat Data: A Case Study Of Yuqiao Reservoir From 1984-2022
AB  - Water eutrophication poses a dual threat to ecological and human well-being. Gaining insight into the intricate dynamics of phytoplankton bloom phenology holds paramount importance in comprehending the complexities of aquatic ecosystems. Remote sensing technologies have gained attention for mapping algal blooms (ABs) effectively, but distinguishing them from aquatic vegetation (AV) remains challenging due to their similar spectral characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a meticulous three-step methodology for AB mapping employing long-term Landsat imagery. Initially, a multi-index decision tree model (DTM) is deployed to identify the vegetation signal (VS) encompassing both AV and ABs. Subsequently, the annual maximum growth range of AV is precisely delineated using vegetation presence frequency (VPF) in conjunction with normal and low water level imagery. Lastly, ABs are accurately extracted by inversely intersecting VS and AV. The performance of our approach is thoroughly validated using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) based on a Gaofen-2 Panchromatic Multi-spectral (GF-2 PMS) image, demonstrating strong consistency with notable values of 0.822 longitudinally, 0.771 latitudinally, and 0.797 overall. The method is applied to Landsat images from 1984 to 2022 to quantify the spatial distribution and temporal variations of ABs in Yuqiao Reservoir-a significant national water body spanning a vast area of 135 km2 in China. Our findings reveal a pervasive and uneven dispersion of ABs, predominantly concentrated in the northern sector. Notably, the intensity of ABs experienced an initial surge from 1984 to 2008, followed by a subsequent decline from 2014 to 2022. Importantly, anthropogenic activities, such as fish cage culture, alongside pollution stemming from nearby industrial and agricultural sources, exert a profound influence on the dynamics of water eutrophication. Fortunately, governmental initiatives focused on water purification exhibit commendable efficacy in mitigating the ecological burden on reservoirs and upholding water quality. The methodological framework presented in this study boasts remarkable precision in AB extraction and exhibits considerable potential in addressing the needs of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Relationship Between Landslides And Mechanisms At The Heifangtai Terrace, Northwest China
AB  - Landslide disasters have occurred frequently in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) due to increased agricultural irrigation. To explore the spatiotemporal relationship between landslides and mechanisms at the Heifangtai terrace, the HFT irrigated area was selected as a typical case study to investigate the fundamental mechanism of the irrigation-induced landslide in the CLP. Multi-temporal remote sensing images, topographic maps, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry data were used to investigate the evolution progress of landslides. Moreover, the evolution mechanism was discussed through topographic analysis, field monitoring, and laboratory testing. The results showed that erosion, collapse, and sliding had occurred at different scales and at different locations in the past 50 years. With an average retrogressive speed of 9.6 × 103 m2 per year, the tableland decreased by 4.9 × 105 m2 from 1967 to 2018, accounting for about 4.5% of its total area. Over 20 landslides and collapses were extracted in the Dangchuan section in the past four years. More than 5.48 × 105 m3 of loess slipped with an average volume of 381 m3 per day. The evolutionary process of the irrigation-induced landslide, which features retrogression, lateral extension, and clustering, began with local failure and ended in a series of slidings. The increase of groundwater level was a slow process, which is the reason for the lagged occurrence of the landslide. The influence of rainfall and irrigation on slope stability was greater than that of the periodic change of the groundwater level. The triggering effect of irrigation and rainfall on the landslide had a time lag due to slow loess infiltration, and the time response among irrigation, rainfall, and groundwater level was 4–6 months. Our findings provide guidance, concerning the planning and controlling of landslide disasters, which is of critical value for human and construction safety. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Legality Of The Deployment Of Conventional Weapons In Earth Orbit:: Balancing Space Law And The Law Of Armed Conflict
AB  - The Bush Administration of the United States recently released a revised National Space Policy. Although the revised National Space Policy can be interpreted as a step towards the weaponization of space, it does not necessarily weaponize space. It nonetheless brings to the forefront important legal issues concerning the basing of conventional weapons in space. The present international law matrix on the issue of space-based weapons is to be found in international space law, principally in the Outer Space Treaty, where certain prohibitions apply to nuclear weapons and to weapons of mass destruction, Space must also be used for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development. Space objects must be registered in accordance with the Registration Convention. The UN collective security system and the customary right of self-defence govern the use of force or jus ad bellum. The means and methods through which self-defence is exercised are in turn governed by international humanitarian law. Should space be weaponized the basing of these weapons and their use will be subject not only to international space law but also to the UN Charter and to international humanitarian law. The interface between these legal regimes consequently gains in importance, possibly forcing a reinterpretation of certain space treaties along with a correction in state practice.

TI  - Davids Vs Goliaths In The Small Satellite Industry: The Role Of Technological Innovation Dynamics In Firm Competitiveness
AB  - In this paper, a conceptual framework of the nature, structure, and dynamics of technological innovation is developed and applied to the small satellite industry. Important components of this framework include: a) the speed and acceleration of technological innovation, and b) the linear and non-linear interactions between technology producers and users (technology and market push and pull mechanisms). We conceptualize technology development and commercialization as an ongoing cooperative and competitive (co-opetitive) process involving enabling and inhibiting factors or mechanisms which govern the speed and acceleration of technological innovation. Enabling factors may include CRADAs, strategic alliances, spin-offs, intellectual property rights, SBIRs, and mentor-protege relationships. Inhibiting factors may include excessive regulation at state, national, and international levels, technological, structural or financial barriers to market entry, competitor response to market entry, and culture clashes such as engineering versus marketing culture or firm versus government Versus university cultures. These enabling and inhibiting factors influence and are also influenced by technological and market pulling and pushing forces. We postulate that the size of a firm, in addition to its ability to adapt to and/or absorb technological and market discontinuities, determines the rate at which it innovates (speed of innovation), as well as the rate at which it varies its innovation speed (acceleration of innovation). It is also postulated that a firm's speed and acceleration of innovation are directly proportional to its long-term competitiveness and market success. This conceptual framework was employed to evaluate the capability of small and large firms to develop and commercialize new technologies in the small satellite industry. Three firms that are active players in the small satellite industry were examined. These firms are small relative to the large aerospace giants (such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing) but they vary in size and age. Two of the firms studied are US start-ups and one is a British university spin-off. Our findings were synthesized to derive insights that could be generalized for the benefit of technology entrepreneurs as well as policy makers in other technology-driven and alliance-rich industries (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Mapping 30m China Annual Impervious Surface From 1992 To 2021 Via A Multi-Level Classification Approach
AB  - Accurately mapping impervious surface has great significance and application for urbanization monitoring, urban sustainable planning, ecosystem protection, etc. In this study, an automatic and high-performance multi-level classification approach based on time-series similarity, spectral feature, and logical reasoning was proposed to accurately map China's annual impervious surface dataset (CAID) from 1992 to 2021 using Landsat time-series images. Firstly, the synthesized image of 30-year night-time light maximum value was used to mask the areas where humans are inactive, which will preliminarily screen out the impervious surface and mitigate the computational volume. Then, similarity measurement based on dynamic time warping was performed, respectively, for periodic index series, which were weighted by an amplitude scale factor. Furthermore, similarity measurement, spectral features, and logical reasoning of long-time-series land cover type were combined to construct a multi-level approach to mapping impervious surface. Finally, for the computational efficiency of pixel-level time-series classification, we built a distributed parallel high-performance computing framework to fully utilize local computing resources for efficiently developing CAID. Using 58,839 validation samples based on stratified random sampling, the overall accuracy and F1-score of CAID were 90.05% and 88.49%. A comparison with five existing 30 m impervious surface products further indicated that our CAID achieved better impervious surface extraction accuracy and was capable of finely delineating impervious surface landscapes. Therefore, it was concluded that our CAID is an accurate and credible product that can provide an important data base for urbanization and urban-related research in China. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Relating Vegetation Dynamics To Climate Variables In Taiwan Using 1982-2012 Ndvi3g Data
AB  - This research aims to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics and associated climate variables in Taiwan by utilizing mean-variance analysis (MVA), relative directional persistence analysis, and Pearson's product moment correlation analysis on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived NDVI3g data from 1982 to 2012. The results indicate a slightly increasing mean-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value with a relatively higher variance during the 1990s and lower variance during the 2000s, which may be explained by the observed fluctuation in precipitation. Additionally, NDVI patterns are identified as increasing in the first half of the year and decreasing in the second half of the year. Spatially, decreasing patterns are observed in all regions except that the northern counties exhibit an increasing NDVI pattern supported by the observed increase in precipitation. Moreover, sunshine duration and temperature are positively correlated with NDVI, whereas precipitation and cloud amount exhibit a negative correlation with NDVI in Taiwan. In the context of global environmental change, this research highlights the utility of applying a combined spatial-temporal approach to remote sensing products. This is an approach with potential applications such as landscape management, conservation practice, and water resource management for policy makers and stakeholders in and beyond Taiwan.

TI  - Delineation Of Groundwater Potential Zones Using Geo-Spatial And Ahp Techniques: Ambo Area, Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
AB  - The town of Ambo in Ethiopia has experienced a severe lack of drinking water. The surface water resources in the region can be supplied with groundwater supplies that precisely pinpoint their recharge and prospective areas, which are frequently unsure for a variety of reasons. In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation techniques (MCET) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a spatial prediction tool were utilized in exploring the groundwater potential of the study area. Rainfall, geomorphology, geology, soil, land use, slope, and drainage density were all included as affecting elements in the analysis. The weights of these criteria were calculated using the AHP technique with the Arc GIS 10.3 software and its sub-modules. The study's main conclusions were that groundwater-potential index values for the study area were estimated. The groundwater-potential zone evaluation of the study area was obtained as follows: very good (2.43%), good (4.78%), moderate (67.36%), poor (25.43%); and a groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) map of the sub-basin was prepared. The derived groundwater potential map was overlaid with borehole and spring data for validation and shows good correlations with that of existing borehole and spring data. Therefore, this study demonstrates a robust method of using GIS and AHP techniques that is efficient and useful in delineating and mapping groundwater potential zones. Any groundwater management project done in these regions would offer the greatest value. Similar studies should be deemed important before planning a water resource development activity, as it would save the expense of comprehensive field trips, which are time-consuming. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Temporal Behaviour Of Surface Waterlogged Areas Using Spaceborne Multispectral Multitemporal Measurements
AB  - Waterlogging and subsequent salinization and/or alkalization is the major land degradation problem in the irrigation commands of the semi-arid regions. Information on the nature, extent and spatial distribution of waterlogged areas is a pre-requisite for restoration of fertility, which has hitherto been generated conventionally. Realising the potential of spaceborne multispectral measurements in providing reliable information on spatial patterns of waterlogged areas in a timely and cost-effective manner, a study was taken up to delineate and monitor the spatial distribution pattern of waterlogged areas in Mahanadi command Stage-I covering parts of Orissa state, eastern India using Landsat-TM, Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS-1A) Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS-II) and IRS-ID LISS-III data. A systematic on-the-screen visual interpretation approach after geo-referencing and radiometric normalization of digital multispectral data in a Silicon Graphics work station using ERDAS/ IMAGINE software was followed to realize the objectives. Results point to a significant increase in the spatial extent of waterlogged areas. Seasonally waterlogged areas increased from 29330 ha to 33421 ha and permanent waterlogged areas from 10870 ha to 12973 ha during the period 1988-89 to 1999-2000.

AB  - Water quality in the coastal area of Tripoli (Lebanon) was assessed using Landsat 7 ETM+ data, to provide a first baseline for coastal resources management. The data were geometrically rectified to a standard geographical grid and brightness values were converted to reflectance through radiometric correction. Sea-truth data, collected in the field within 6 hours before/after the time of the satellite overpass, were used to derive empirical algorithms for chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi disk depth and turbidity. Then, maps of the distribution of the selected water quality parameters were generated for the entire area of interest, and compared with analogous results obtained from SeaWiFS data. The maps indicate that the Tripoli coastal area is exposed to moderate eutrophic conditions, along most of its shoreline (in particular along the northern stretch), in correspondence with fluvial and wastewater runoff sources. The Landsat 7 ETM+ data proved useful for the intended application, and will be used to start a national database on water quality in the Lebanese coastal environment. © 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Seasonal Variability Of Fractional Vegetation Cover And Its Object-Based Spatial Pattern Analysis Over Mountain Areas
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important indicator of mountain ecosystem status. A study on the seasonal changes of FVC can be beneficial for regional eco-environmental security, which contributes to the assessment of mountain ecosystem recovery and supports mountain forest planning and landscape reconstruction around megacities, for example, Beijing, China. Remote sensing has been demonstrated to be one of the most powerful and feasible tools for the investigation of mountain vegetation. However, topographic and atmospheric effects can produce enormous errors in the quantitative retrieval of PVC data from satellite images of mountainous areas. Moreover, the most commonly used analysis approach for assessing PVC seasonal fluctuations is based on per-pixel analysis regardless of the spatial context, which results in pixel-based PVC values that are feasible for landscape and ecosystem applications. To solve these problems, we proposed a new method that incorporates the use of a revised physically based (RPB) model to correct both atmospheric and terrain-caused illumination effects on Landsat images, an improved vegetation index (VI)-based technique for estimating the PVC, and an adaptive mean shift approach for object-based PVC segmentation. An array of metrics for segmented PVC analyses, including a variety of area metrics, patch metrics, shape metrics and diversity metrics, was generated. On the basis of the individual segmented PVC values and landscape metrics from multiple images of different dates, remote sensing of the seasonal variability of PVC was conducted over the mountainous area of Beijing, China. The experimental results indicate that (a) the mean value of the RPB-NDVI in all seasons was increased by approximately 10\% compared with that of the atmospheric correction-NDVI; (b) a strong consistency was demonstrated between ground-based PVC observations and PVC estimated through remote sensing technology (R-2 = 0.8527, RMSE = 0.0851); and (c) seasonal changes in the landscape characteristics existed, and the landscape diversity reached its maximum in May and June in the study area.

TI  - Land Use And Land Cover Classification Using River Formation Dynamics Algorithm With Deep Learning On Remote Sensing Images
AB  - Currently, remote sensing images (RSIs) are often exploited in the explanation of urban and rural areas, change recognition, and other domains. As the majority of RSI is high-resolution and contains wide and varied data, proper interpretation of RSIs is most important. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification utilizing deep learning (DL) is a common and efficient manner in remote sensing and geospatial study. It is very important in land planning, environmental monitoring, mapping, and land management. But, one of the recent approaches is problems like vulnerability to noise interference, low classification accuracy, and worse generalization ability. DL approaches, mostly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revealed impressive performance in image recognition tasks, making them appropriate for LULC classification in RSIs. Therefore, this study introduces a novel Land Use and Land Cover Classification employing the River Formation Dynamics Algorithm with Deep Learning (LULCC-RFDADL) technique on RSIs. The main objective of the LULCC-RFDADL methodology is to recognize the diverse types of LC on RSIs. In the presented LULCC-RFDADL technique, the dense EfficientNet approach is applied for feature extraction. Furthermore, the hyperparameter tuning of the Dense EfficientNet method was implemented using the RFDA technique. For the classification process, the LULCC-RFDADL technique uses the Multi-Scale Convolutional Autoencoder (MSCAE) model. At last, the seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) has been exploited for the parameter choice of the MSCAE system. The achieved outcomes of the LULCC-RFDADL algorithm were examined on benchmark databases. The simulation values show the better result of the LULCC-RFDADL methods with other approaches in terms of different metrics. Authors

TI  - ‘Impact Of Urbanization On Temporal Distribution Pattern Of Storm Runoff Coefficient
AB  - Runoff coefficient (RC) is one of the important parameters, which is often considered in surface runoff and peak flood discharge estimation methods in various projects of watershed management and flood control. However, the effect of variability of RC due to human-induced activities on hydrologic behavior of the watershed has not been adequately considered globally. Therefore, the present research was carried out using 18 hyetographs and their corresponding hydrographs during 1984 to 2012 after considering the existence of suitable Landsat 7 (ETM+ and TM) satellite images with corresponding storm events for the Amameh Watershed located in Tehran Province, Iran. The object-oriented classification method was used to derive land use maps from satellite images. Afterward, four time periods were determined based on mean and standard deviation of residential area variations. The temporal distribution pattern of RC was then derived using a ranking method. The one- and two-way analyses of variance were also used to investigate the effect of residential area and rainfall variables on RC. Relationships among residential area as well as rainfall variables as independent variables and mean RC storm-wise as dependent variable were then modeled using two and multiple linear regressions. The results showed that RCs reduced in order of third, second, fourth, and first quartiles with respective values of 42.4, 38.2, 15.8, and 3.6%. The results also showed that RCs in the second and first quartiles and in the third and fourth quartiles were non-significantly decreased and increased by increasing of residential area, respectively. So that the highest variations occurred in first quartile with slope of − 144%. The results further proved that rainfall amount, φ index, and residential area with respective standardized regression coefficients (β) of 0.629, − 0.465, and − 0.108 had the highest controlling effects on RCs. The finding of the current research proved the temporal variability of RCs at storm scale with more determinant effectiveness of rainfall properties than urbanized interferences. It helps hydrologists and watershed mangers designate appropriate strategies leading to proper implementations of developmental projects. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Assessing The Impact Of Ecological Insecurity On Ecosystem Service Value In Stone Quarrying And Crushing Dominated Areas
AB  - The present study has tried to develop ecological insecurity model (EIM) in the growing stone quarrying and crushing dominated areas using robust machine learning techniques and attempted to link it with ecosystem service value (ESV). Satellite image-based landscape metrics have been used for developing machine learning-oriented EIM, and the global coefficient of Costanza et al. (Glob Environ Change 26:152-158, 2014) has been used for computing ESV. Field parameter-based ecological insecurity index (EII) has been developed for validating the EIMs along with the statistical methods. Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) revealed that 21.88 to 60.79\% area has predicted as highly ecologically insecure in all the selected four stone quarrying and crushing dominated clusters and this is has inflated from 2000 to 2020. All the applied models are acceptable in terms of their performances, but the RF model is found to be the best representative in relation to EII. It causes considerable loss of ESV which ranges from 160,845.18 US\$ to 757,445.17 US\$ in all the clusters from 2000 to 2020. The findings of the study are useful for ecological management in this area. It further recommends applying such an approach in such similar fields to establish the general finding and provides knowledge to the state of arts.

TI  - Mapping Post-Disturbance Forest Landscape Composition With Landsat Satellite Imagery
AB  - Forests worldwide are impacted by a wide variety of disturbances that are happening more frequently with more intensity than in the past due to global climate change. Forest managers, therefore, need to identify new ways to quickly and accurately predict post-disturbance forest landscape composition. We suggest the use of Landsat satellite imagery and an image processing tool to map percent canopy cover (PCC) by species and sub-canopy species counts to be used in adaptive forest management strategies. We used zero-inflated models to successfully predict PCC and sub-canopy counts (number of regenerating trees per pixel, also called biotic legacies) for 4 tree species, along with overall PCC and percent mortality, for a large portion of the Rio Grande National Forest (RGNF) in 2013. The RGNF had recently been disturbed by spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) infestation since the early 2000s and the West Fork Fire Complex in 2013. Our PCC models resulted in pseudo median differences between observed and predicted values of 0.2–6.5%, RMSE of 10.9–17.0%, and 95% confidence interval widths of 4.4–24.9%, depending on the species. The percent mortality model resulted in pseudo median differences between observed and predicted values of 1.1%, RMSE of 12.4%, and 95% confidence interval width of 4.6%. The sub-canopy PCC model resulted in a pseudo median differences between observed and predicted values of 1.3%, RMSE of 9.4%, and 95% confidence interval of 3.0%. The sub-canopy count models resulted in mean differences of 0.1–1.4 trees, RMSE of 3.0–13.4 trees, and 95% confidence interval widths of 1.1–5.0 trees, depending on species. By mapping PCC and sub-canopy counts, we have provided forest managers with knowledge of the current surviving forest (PCC) as well as the biotic legacies (sub-canopy counts) that can aid in forming hypotheses as to what the forest might become in the future, adding to the forest manager toolbox for forest management strategies. The methods described can be applied to a variety of issues within the field of disturbance ecology and, combined with change analyses, will provide forest managers with empirical evidence of current and future forest composition along with biological legacies that will impact forest regeneration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Catch-And-Release And Size Limit Regulations For Blue, White, And Striped Marlin: The Role Of Postrelease Survival In Effective Policy Design
AB  - Catch-and-release fishing as a management and conservation tool for billfish (family Istiophoridae) is practiced in many recreational fisheries, and mandatory release of billfish has been implemented for some commercial fisheries. Inherent in these approaches is the observation that survival of released fish is greater than those that are landed. Recent studies using pop-up satellite tags have begun to quantify postrelease survival rates for billfish, yet the efficacy of management measures that require some or all billfish to be released have not been evaluated. Using an age- and size-structured population model that accounts for individual variability in growth, we simulated the effects of postrelease mortality on yield, risk of recruitment overfishing, efficiency (i.e., ratio of harvest to postrelease mortality), and probability of catching trophy-sized individuals for three marlin species. Regulations such as size limits, catch-and-release, and mandatory release are likely to provide some benefit to billfish populations, but our results show that the effectiveness of these strategies is reduced when release survival is less than 100%. The management approaches most likely to benefit billfish populations are ones that focus on maximizing postrelease survival in the recreational fishery and minimize the billfish catch in commercial fisheries. © 2008 NRC.

TI  - Urban And Transport Planning, Environmental Exposures And Health-New Concepts, Methods And Tools To Improve Health In Cities
AB  - Background: The majority of people live in cities and urbanization is continuing worldwide. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution and disease. Methods: We conducted a review around the topic urban and transport planning, environmental exposures and health and describe the findings. Results: Within cities there is considerable variation in the levels of environmental exposures such as air pollution, noise, temperature and green space. Emerging evidence suggests that urban and transport planning indicators such as road network, distance to major roads, and traffic density, household density, industry and natural and green space explain a large proportion of the variability. Personal behavior including mobility adds further variability to personal exposures, determines variability in green space and UV exposure, and can provide increased levels of physical activity. Air pollution, noise and temperature have been associated with adverse health effects including increased morbidity and premature mortality, UV and green space with both positive and negative health effects and physical activity with many health benefits. In many cities there is still scope for further improvement in environmental quality through targeted policies. Making cities 'green and healthy' goes far beyond simply reducing CO2 emissions. Environmental factors are highly modifiable, and environmental interventions at the community level, such as urban and transport planning, have been shown to be promising and more cost effective than interventions at the individual level. However, the urban environment is a complex interlinked system. Decision-makers need not only better data on the complexity of factors in environmental and developmental processes affecting human health, but also enhanced understanding of the linkages to be able to know at which level to target their actions. New research tools, methods and paradigms such as geographical information systems, smartphones, and other GPS devices, small sensors to measure environmental exposures, remote sensing and the exposome paradigm together with citizens observatories and science and health impact assessment can now provide this information. Conclusion: While in cities there are often silos of urban planning, mobility and transport, parks and green space, environmental department, (public) health department that do not work together well enough, multi-sectorial approaches are needed to tackle the environmental problems. The city of the future needs to be a green city, a social city, an active city, a healthy city.

TI  - Marine Threats Overlap Key Foraging Habitat For Two Imperiled Sea Turtle Species In The Gulf Of Mexico
AB  - Effective management of human activities affecting listed species requires understanding both threats and animal habitat-use patterns. However, the extent of spatial overlap between high-use foraging areas (where multiple marine species congregate) and anthropogenic threats is not well-known. Our modeling approach incorporates data on sea turtle spatial ecology and a suite of threats in the Gulf of Mexico to identify and map "hot spots" of threats to two imperiled turtle species. Of all 820 "high" threats grid cells, our tracked turtles foraged at least 1 day in 77\% of them. Although threat data were not available outside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, our map of turtle and threat "hot spots" can be incorporated in future more comprehensive threat analyses for the region. Knowledge of these shared foraging- and threat-areas can assist managers charged with designing effective conservation and population recovery strategies, in future habitat modeling efforts, and in designations of Gulf of Mexico habitat with high conservation value.

TI  - Determining Critical Light And Hydrologic Conditions For Macrophyte Presence In A Large Shallow Lake: The Ratio Of Euphotic Depth To Water Depth
AB  - Light determines macrophyte distribution, community composition and biomass in shallow lakes. Therefore, it is vital to determine the critical underwater light climate thresholds for macrophyte degradation and recovery. In this study, we first proposed a novel index, defined as the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to water depth (WD), as a measure of the underwater light supply for macrophytes. The underwater light environment in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow, eutrophic lake) was then characterized based on this index (Z(eu)/WD) using field measurements collected from 2006 to 2013 (8 years x 4 seasons x 32 sites). The distribution of the macrophyte presence frequency (MPF, the number of investigations that identified macrophytes divided by the total number of investigations) was greater than 0.70 in Xukou Bay and East Lake Taihu over the 32 investigations, followed by the other sites distributed in East Lake Taihu. The proportion of macrophyte coverage increased with the increase in Z(eu)/WD. A significant relationship was observed between Zeu/WD and MPF for the 19 sites with macrophytes (r(2) = 0.48, p< 0.001, n = 19). In the region with high nutrient concentrations and serious water pollution, better underwater light conditions are required for the growth of macrophytes. A Z(eu)/WD value of 0.80 can be regarded as the critical underwater light threshold for the growth of macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The region with Z(eu)/WD ranging between 0.57 and 0.80 was usually covered by sparse macrophytes; this region should be vital for macrophyte recovery and environmental management in Lake Taihu. The distribution of Z(eu)/WD was further obtained using MODIS satellite-derived Zeu from June to October in 2003 and 2013. Xukou Bay and Guangfu Bay in the southern part of Lake Taihu could be regarded as potentially crucial regions for the recovery of macrophytes from the perspective of underwater light and nutrient levels.

TI  - Diverse Biosphere Influence On Carbon And Heat In Mixed Urban Mediterranean Landscape Revealed By High Resolution Thermal And Optical Remote Sensing
AB  - A fundamental challenge in verifying urban CO2 emissions reductions is estimating the biological influence that can confound emission source attribution across heterogeneous and diverse landscapes. Recent work using atmospheric radiocarbon revealed a substantial seasonal influence of the managed urban biosphere on regional carbon budgets in the Los Angeles megacity, but lacked spatially explicit attribution of the diverse biological influences needed for flux quantification and decision making. New high-resolution maps of land cover (0.6 m) and irrigation (30 m) derived from optical and thermal sensors can simultaneously resolve landscape influences related to vegetation type (tree, grass, shrub), land use, and fragmentation needed to accurately quantify biological influences on CO2 exchange in complex urban environments. We integrate these maps with the Urban Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (UrbanVPRM) to quantify spatial and seasonal variability in gross primary production (GPP) across urban and non-urban regions of Southern California Air Basin (SoCAB). Results show that land use and landscape fragmentation have a significant influence on urban GPP and canopy temperature within the water-limited Mediterranean SoCAB climate. Irrigated vegetation accounts for 31% of urban GPP, driven by turfgrass, and is more productive (1.7 vs 0.9 μmol m−2 s−1) and cooler (2.2 ± 0.5 K) than non-irrigated vegetation during hot dry summer months. Fragmented landscapes, representing mostly vegetated urban greenspaces, account for 50% of urban GPP. Cooling from irrigation alleviates strong warming along greenspace edges within 100 m of impervious surfaces, and increases GPP by a factor of two, compared to non-irrigated edges. Finally, we note that non-irrigated shrubs are typically more productive than non-irrigated trees and grass, and equally productive as irrigated vegetation. These results imply a potential water savings benefit of urban shrubs, but more work is needed to understand carbon vs water usage tradeoffs of managed vs unmanaged vegetation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Leaf My Neighbourhood Alone! Predicting The Influence Of Densification On Residential Tree Canopy Cover In Perth
AB  - Trees provide myriad ecosystem services of benefit to urban populations; however, urban development is pressuring existing urban tree coverage. Thus, a pertinent challenge for planners is identifying development scenarios that find synergies between urban growth and the preservation or enhancement of tree canopy coverage. This paper presents the training and validation of a model that predicts changes in neighbourhood-level urban tree canopy cover associated with different socio-economic and physical urban form variables. Neighbourhoods across Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, were used as a case study. A Random Forests model was trained using a suite of socio-economic and urban form variables and neighbourhood percentage tree canopy cover derived from very high resolution multispectral remote sensing images and digital surface models. This model was validated using independent test data with a mean absolute error of 1.78\% and a root mean square error of 2.42\%. An application of this model was demonstrated using the City of Nedlands, Perth, where a new planning scheme allowing denser urban development has been approved by the State Government. The magnitude and spatial variation in the change of neighbourhood tree canopy cover in the City of Nedlands in 2050 associated with three urban development scenarios was predicted using the model.

TI  - A Random Forest-Based Ca-Markov Model To Examine The Dynamics Of Land Use/Cover Change Aided With Remote Sensing And Gis
AB  - Understanding the land use/cover change (LUCC) in watersheds is essential for sustainable development. The CA-Markov model has been proven to be an effective method for land use modeling because of its simplicity and potential for evolution. However, it is difficult to apply this method to meet the requirement of land use planning and management since it fails to consider the driving forces of LUCC. To evaluate the factors that influence LUCC comprehensively, we developed and implemented a machine learning-based CA-Markov model to understand the dynamics of LUCC in a coastal watershed in Southeast China, the Minjiang River Watershed (MRW). The proposed method performed well for each land use category, with average AUC values of 0.999 and 0.916 for the training and testing periods, respectively, for suitable images. The overall accuracy for LUCC was 0.971. The urbanization process in the MRW was speeding up recently. Urban area increased by 2.22\% of the total area during 2015-2020, and most of that was from conversion of woodland and agricultural land. Additionally, the proposed method provided a much deeper understating of the forces driving the LUCC on a regional scale. Population and gross domestic product (GDP) were the major factors influencing the distribution of urbanized land in the MRW. In contrast, woodland distribution was highly related to topographic factors in the MRW. Scenario analysis was also employed to identify patterns of LUCC under different scenarios. The results showed that the process of urbanization may become more complex with increasing population and GDP and that land use evolution may be more sustainable with scientific spatial plans which consider facilities for people and ecological protection. The proposed method quantifies the LUCC in changing environmental settings and can serve as a helpful tool for sustainable watershed management.

TI  - Quantification Of An Overlooked Water Resource In The Tropical Rainfed Lowlands Using Rapideye Satellite Data: A Case Of Farm Ponds And The Potential Gross Value For Smallholder Production In Southern Laos
AB  - In southern Laos, water stored in farm ponds is largely underutilised as it is perceived to be unfit for human consumption; subsequently, groundwater is the preferred source for domestic and agricultural consumption. For the first time, this paper presents the results of a study designed to quantify the total pond water volume within the landscape via remote-sensing methods in two districts in Champasak province that could be used to improve rural household cash income through the expansion of market-oriented dry season crop production. Water bodies were delineated via simple classification of RapidEye data using the Normalised Difference Water Index and a sub-classification was performed to distinguish between ponds and the streamflow network. Final estimates of total pond volume in Sukhuma and Phonthong districts were similar to 2.30 x 10(6) m(3) and 3.55 x 10(6) m(3), respectively; and the average pond volume across both districts was similar to 1987 m(3). Sensitivity analysis of the potential gross value of farm ponds for irrigation of dry season, vegetable production typical of market-oriented smallholder activities in the area indicated that substantial gross economic gains could be made from better use and management of these resources.

TI  - Enhanced Ecosystem Services In China's Xilingol Steppe During 2000-2015: Towards Sustainable Agropastoralism Management
AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) provided by dryland regions are very vulnerable to environmental dynamics and management transformation, and it is still unclear how these services will be affected by the combined effects of accelerated climate variability and land-use changes at a regional macro level. In this study, the status, patterns and trends of ESs provided by the Xilingol steppe were quantitatively evaluated, and the impact of climate and land-use change on ESs were discussed. The results showed that favorable climatic conditions and the implementation of ecological policies had a substantial positive impact on regional vegetation restoration during 2000-2015. As a result of the vegetation greening, water retention and carbon sequestration increased significantly at rates of 16.01 m(3) ha(-1) and 1.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Soil loss caused by wind erosion, an ecosystem disservice, decreased significantly at a rate of -0.57 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Although several environmental factors had differing impacts on the ESs changes in the subregions, including the meadow, typical and desert steppes, the main factors that contributed to the enhancement of overall ESs benefits were the climatic humidification and the reduced grazing pressure in the entire study area. The above conclusion shows that, in the era of climate change, the implementation of sustainable farming-pastoral strategies can realize a "win-win" situation between ecological restoration and socioeconomic development in arid and semi-arid steppes.

TI  - Runoff Estimation With Low Altitude Remote Sensing And Satellite Images
AB  - Accurate monitoring of runoff from small and medium-sized rivers is of great significance for ecological stability in arid areas. However, it is difficult to accurately retrieve the flow of small and medium-sized rivers by remote sensing. Taking the Zhongfengchang river section of Kashi River in Nilka County, Xinjiang, China, as an example, this study constructed a power function relationship model between river width, water depth, and discharge based on the relationship fitting method and measured hydrological data, unmanned aerial vehicle data, and satellite data. Using the time series of satellite data, the runoff volume of the monitored river section was inferred 24 times in different periods. The results show that when the runoff rate is 0-50 m3·s−1 and 50-100 m3·s−1, the inversion of the runoff rate based on the hydraulic geometry of the river width is optimal, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.15 m3·s−1and 2.81 m3·s−1, respectively; when the runoff rate is 100-200 m3·s−1 and > 200 m3·s−1, the inversion of the hydraulic geometry based on water depth and river width is the best, with RMSEs of 13.37 m3·s−1 and 1.06 m3·s−1, respectively. These findings provide a new method for the fine monitoring and management of runoff of small and medium-sized rivers in areas lacking hydrologic data and have high reference value for flood disaster prediction, hydropower resource development, and water ecosystem restoration. © 2023 Journal of Ceramics.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Pattern Of Urban Eco-Environmental Quality Of Indian Megacities Using Geo-Spatial Techniques
AB  - Rapid urbanization is often responsible for the degradation of urban eco-environmental quality (UEQ), which is comprised of ecological, environmental and anthropogenic components. Hence, frequently monitoring and tracking UEQ for sustainable cities and communities is recommendable. This study, attempted to compare UEQ of three rapidly growing Indian metros/megacities–Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore. A remote sensing-based composite index, namely ‘urban eco-environmental quality index’ (UEQI), was constructed by utilizing Landsat 5 (TM), 8 (OLI-TIRS) satellite imageries and MODIS LST products of 1999/2000–2001 and 2018. Five vegetation indices (i.e. NDVI, SAVI, GVI, NDMI and TcWet) and four urban indices (i.e. BI, NDBI, UI and DTR) were categorized as per pressure-state-response (PSR) framework and integrated through spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) to construct the UEQI. The sensitivity and elasticity of UEQI had been tested with respect to population density (PD) and the percentage of impervious surface (IS). Subsequently, the spatio-temporal pattern (i.e. (non)sequential transition–from excellent to very poor) and spatial heterogeneity of UEQ were investigated using Moran’s I, and local indicator of spatial auto-correlation (LISA). Result indicated overall UEQI value for selected cities during studied periods ranged from 0.20 to 2.20, where lower and higher value referred very poor and excellent UEQ, respectively. The most degraded UEQ was found in Bangalore (average UEQI values were 1.08 and 0.80 in 2001 and 2019, respectively); and the degradation rate was also quite inflated than other cities (i.e. UEQI 1.64 per year). Additionally, the spatio-temporal pattern of UEQI demonstrated that very poor and poor UEQ were primarily clustered in the city’s centre and spilling out towards the outskirts of all cities during the studied periods. Overall, the proportional area under very poor UEQ category was increased i.e., 7.94%, 7.03% and 5.24% for Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, respectively. The non-sequential transition (i.e. excellent to poor or very poor) was prominent in Bangalore, which implied that rapid and abrupt degradation of UEQ. Whereas, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad followed mostly sequential transition. Besides, significant global (Moran’s I = > 0.80) and LISA confirmed the non-randomness pattern of UEQ for three cities. The analysis of sensitivity ensured both PD and IS were strongly influenced poor UEQI (as R 2 ≥ 0.50). Elasticity of UEQI revealed 1% increase of IS would lead to declining of 0.64%, 0.46% and 0.21% of UEQI in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore, respectively. Moreover, the study’s observation and findings could also be used for possible area intervention for ‘area-based development’ (ADB) and ‘greenfield development’ (GFD) plan, as recommended by ‘climate-resilient smart city mission’. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Influence Of The Resolution Of Forest Cover Maps In Evaluating Fragmentation And Connectivity To Assess Habitat Conservation Status
AB  - The analysis of fragmentation and habitat connectivity is important in determining their conservation status and ensuring their long-term survival. However, the reliability of assessments on habitat conservation status may depend on the resolution of forest cover maps used as inputs. The aim of this paper is to quantify differences in the results of habitat fragmentation and connectivity analysis found when using three different forest cover maps of various resolutions, and discusses their effect in the assessment of habitat conservation status. The study was conducted in a Natura 2000 habitat (9120:Atlantic acidophilous beech forests) in Spain. To measure fragmentation, we carried out a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) which provided a very detailed spatial landscape description (core, islet, bridge, loop, branch and perforation elements). We compared the habitat total area (Hta) with the habitat area without edge width (Hwe), which correspond to the obtained previous cores. To measure connectivity, we used the probability of connectivity index (PC). We used three different forest cover maps with different spatial resolutions: (1) a 2 m map derived from remote sensing using very high resolution satellite imagery (GeoEye) processed with object-based image analysis (OBIA_layer); (2) a 10 m map derived from fieldwork and aerial photo-interpretation at 1:10,000 scale (Forest_layer); and (3) a 50 m map obtained by a similar method at 1:50,000 scale (Atlas_layer). Our results confirm results obtained by previous studies showing that the resolution of input forest cover maps substantially influences MSPA results. The habitat area proportion classified as core decreased as the resolution of input forest cover maps increased, whereas the amount of islets, bridges, loops, branches and perforations increased. The spatial resolution of forest cover maps influences the assessment of habitat conservation status. Habitat conservation status was assessed as being ‘unfavourable inadequate’ (the middle rank out of three) with the coarse Atlas_layer, and as ‘unfavourable bad’ (the bottom rank out) when using the higher resolution Forest_layer and OBIA_layer. This can be critical for European environmental funding. Results obtained also show that resolution of input forest cover maps influence the calculated values of PC index. The use of high-resolution forest cover maps is critical to study habitat connectivity, since otherwise the outcome presents no appreciable result. We conclude that using remote sensing techniques together with OBIA is the most appropriate and cost-effective method for analyzing forest fragmentation and connectivity for habitat conservation status assessments. The source and/or the method of generation of the habitat data layer used (also the spatial resolution) as well as the connectivity analysis method applied must at all times be reported in such analyses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Collaborative Public Spaces And Upgrading Through Global Value Chains: The Case Of Dongguan, China
AB  - Research Summary How do multinational enterprises (MNEs) address host-country challenges after the initial investment? And when does foreign direct investment (FDI) result in local upgrading? Using a study of FDI and global value chain participation in Dongguan, China, we find a mechanism in which FDI results in sustained local economic upgrading and improved MNE subsidiary performance: a collaborative public space (CPS). A CPS is a social space based on trust that enables different and divided actors to engage, sharing concerns and information in ways that they otherwise would be disinclined to consider. Using the CPS concept, we expand understanding of the effectiveness of MNE strategies in host-country environments and the conditions in which FDI leads to change in global value chains. Managerial Summary The international strategy literature has found that FDI has ambiguous impacts on host-country regions and firms, leading in some cases to upgrading or in others to local firm deskilling or decline. It has also shown that the postinvestment strategies of MNEs, particularly political connections or business associations, have mixed results. Using the concept of a CPS, we show how the construction of a trust-based social space can improve MNE subsidiary and local firm performance and lead to changes in the structure and composition of global value chains (GVC). The GVC changes by incorporating new host-country suppliers and buyers as well as increasing the value-added, thus creating a new node and exchange patterns in the GVC.

TI  - Analysis Of Seasonal Changes Of Wetland Landscape Patterns Derived From Remote Sensing Data
AB  - As important natural ecosystems, wetlands play significant roles. Wetland ecosystems are associated with a diverse and complex array of direct and indirect uses. Direct uses include the use of the wetland for water supply and harvesting of wetland products such as fish and plant resources, while indirect benefits are derived from environmental functions such as flood water retention, groundwater recharge/ discharge, nutrient abatement, etc., depending on the type of wetlands, soil and water characteristics and associated biotic influences. Extensive loss of wetlands has occurred in many countries throughout the world. As the value of wetlands to society has become recognized, it is now important to conserve these valuable resources. To prevent further loss of wetlands, and conserve existing wetland ecosystems for biodiversity and ecosystem services and goods, it is important to inventory and monitor wetlands. For inventorying and monitoring wetlands, satellite remote sensing has many advantages. Satellite data has repeat coverage so that wetlands can be monitored seasonally or yearly. Satellite remote sensing can also provide information on surrounding land covers and their changes over time. Using satellite remotely sensed data for land cover classification is less costly and less time-consuming than aerial photography for large geographic areas. Satellite remote sensing can be especially appropriate for wetland inventories and monitoring in developing countries, where fund are limited and where little information is available on wetland areas, surrounding land covers, and wetlands losses over time.The Sanjiang Plain located in Northeast China was famous for its large area natural wetlands. However, natural wetlands shrunk substantially due to large-scale agriculture expansion under the agricultural development policies. To conserve and manage wetland resources in the Sanjiang Plain, it is important to inventory and monitor wetlands. Wetland classification is difficult because of spectral confusion with other land cover classes and among different types of wetlands. However, multi-temporal data usually improves the classification of wetlands, as do ancillary data such as soil data, elevation or topography data. This paper conducted a case study on seasonal changes of wetland landscape patterns in the North Sanjiang Plain. First, multi-season remote sensing images in 2012 were collected. Second, the object-oriented classification method and field survey data were adopted, to extract wetlands distribution data in different months, according to phonological and seasonal features of wetlands in the study region. Third, seasonal changes of wetland landscape patterns were analyzed. Results show that, remote sensing derived wetland area and landscape patterns changed in different months. In the study area, wetlands were distributed in low-lying areas, with marsh and river being the main wetland types. During different seasons, transformations between wetland and other land cover types occurred and the transformation between marsh and grassland was the most important change. Wetlands and conversions between wetlands and other land cover types were mainly distributed in low-altitude and low-slope areas, especially the areas with < 100 m elevation and < 5 °slope. Remote sensing derived wetlands changed with variations of rainfall, air temperature, and vegetation phenology. The results drawn from this study may help understand wetlands variations in important wetland regions in China and even in other countries. These conclusions are useful in the formulation of governmental policies that encourage ecologically and environmentally friendly utilization of land resources, sustainability, and proper ecosystem management under increased pressure from population increase and climate change. © 2014, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Graph Neural Networks Extract High-Resolution Cultivated Land Maps From Sentinel-2 Image Series
AB  - Maintaining farm sustainability through optimizing the agricultural management practices helps build more planet-friendly environment. The emerging satellite missions can acquire multispectral and hyperspectral imagery which captures more detailed spectral information concerning the scanned area, hence allows us to benefit from subtle spectral features during the analysis process in agricultural applications. We introduce an approach for extracting 2.5-m cultivated land maps from 10-m Sentinel-2 (S-2) multispectral image (MSI) series which benefits from a compact graph convolutional neural network. The experiments indicate that our models not only outperform classical and deep machine learning techniques through delivering higher quality segmentation maps, but also dramatically reduce the memory footprint when compared to U-Nets (almost 8k trainable parameters of our models, with up to 31-M parameters of U-Nets). Such memory frugality is pivotal in the missions which allow us to uplink a model to the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered satellite once it is in orbit, as sending large nets is impossible due to the time constraints. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Environmental And Spatial Assessment Of Urban Heat Islands In Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt
AB  - The present study is the first attempt to map Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and assess the associated environmental characteristics in Qalyubia Governorate using remote sensing and GIS integrated with a field survey. A calibrated Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquired on July 22, 2018 was processed to calculate Land Surface Temperature (LST) and UHIs as well as to evaluate the environmental conditions through calculating the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and the spectral retrieved indices. The investigated indices include Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Likewise, multispectral algorithm model was applied on the landsat calibrated image for mapping Particulate Matter of diameters lower than 10 micrometer (PM10) and characterizing its levels in the UHIs. The results demonstrated that the mean LST of each LULC class in Qalyubia Governorate followed this order; bare lands > urban > vegetation > water bodies. Most of bare land and built-up areas exist as heat island regions. The total area of UHIs was 397.5 km(2); 119.8 km(2) as bare land (30.2\%), 201.2 km(2) as built-up (50.6\%), 0.2 km(2) as water (0.05\%) and 76.3 km(2) as vegetation (19.2\%). Low mean values of NDVI and MNDWI were observed in association with UHIs regions which confirmed the positive impact of green cover and water bodies in eliminating UHIs phenomena. On other hand, NDBI showed high mean level in UHIs comparing to its levels in the study area. The average value of PM10 over UHI (94.26 mu g/m(3)) was more than that in the study area (81.07 mu g/m(3)). It can be concluded that the decrease in green spaces and water bodies as well as the increase in urban density lead to increasing the intensity and widespread of UHIs phenomenon. Therefore, the study recommends the necessity to consider results of the present study for urban designers, planners, and architects in designing and planning urban communities.

TI  - Inventorying And Monitoring Nighttime Light Distribution And Dynamics In The Mediterranean Coast Network Of Southern California
AB  - Light pollution has been of increasing concern as it relates to protected areas. As such, natural resource managers need information on the distribution, intensity, and dynamics of nighttime lights in protected areas. We examine the extent of nighttime light brightness from 1992 to 2012 in the Mediterranean Coast Network (Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Channel Islands National Park, and Cabrillo National Monument) using the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System, which has provided global annual nighttime light imagery at 0.9 km pixel resolution. Nighttime lights appeared stable in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, decreased in Cabrillo National Monument, and are extremely low in Channel Islands National Park. However, the mean brightness values in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Cabrillo National Monument were very high compared to all other National Parks. Indeed, both were comparable to the two National Parks in the USA with the highest mean brightness values (Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Hot Springs National Park). Monitoring night light extent, intensity, time series, and change detection using remote sensing should be a standard practice for all protected areas managed by the National Park Service due to the no-cost nature of the data and ease at which analyses can be undertaken. The DMSP data and calibrated products can be used to monitor long-term changes in light distribution and intensity while the higher-resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data can be used to show changes in light distribution and density throughout the year and can be used to test how policy or ordinance changes impact light pollution.

TI  - Floodplain Mapping Through Support Vector Machine And Optical/Infrared Images From Landsat 8 Oli/Tirs Sensors: Case Study From Varanasi
AB  - Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters causing huge loss to life and property. Any flood management strategy requires floodplain mapping through discrimination of the flood prone areas. The city of Varanasi or Benaras is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited city of the world. This study aims to develop tools for mapping and discrimination of floodplain of river Ganga at Varanasi. During 2014 floods, the flooded areas were extracted through Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and by Modified NDWI (MNDWI) using the NIR and SWIR bands separately from that of the Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The inundated areas were then identified through Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification. The results reveal that the MNDWI images provide a better result for flood discrimination than the NDWI images. Ground based measurements for floodplain distance varied between 11 +/- 5 m at Janki ghat (bank) and 80 +/- 5 m at Asi ghat. The validation between measured and SVMs derived values indicate a strong positive correlation of 0.88 and a low value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.62. The t-test is suggestive of no significant difference between the observed and SVMs values at 95\% confidence level, indicating a satisfactory performance of the SVMs for floodplain mapping using Landsat 8 imagery. Therefore, the methodology proposed in this study provides a novel and robust way for floodplain mapping and has potential applications in disaster management and mitigation in the flood affected regions.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Valuation On The Basis Of Land Use And Land Cover Data In The Barasat Sadar Subdivision (West Bengal, India)
AB  - Abstract: This paper discusses the response of ecosystem service values to land use/land cover (LULC) changes and examines spatial contributions of individual transformations to the ecosystem service functions in the Barasat Sadar subdivision (West Bengal, India) over the period from 1977 to 2016 on the basis of a modified coefficient. Spatiotemporal LULC patterns were identified on the basis of Landsat series satellite images taken at intervals of 10 years. To identify the LULC parameters, a supervised classification was performed on the basis of the maximum likelihood (MXL) classifier. Ecosystem service values have been computed per ha of the terrestrial ecosystem based on coefficients determined for each land cover parameter in earlier studies. In 2016, the highest ecosystem service value was attributed to surface waters ($477.06 million); while the lowest value corresponded to fallow lands ($0.98 million). The results obtained using the assumed coefficient indicate a continuous loss of the total ecosystem service value of $238.92 million over 1977–2016 due to the deterioration of agricultural fallow lands, areas occupied by dense vegetation, and shrubby lands, as well as rapid expansion of arable lands and development of an artificial infrastructure for surface-water bodies. The results of this study can be used as a reference and basis for decision making in the field of wise land resource management. In addition, the obtained data can be used to strike a compromise between urban growth and the decline of ecosystem services. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

TI  - Fallowing Temporal Patterns Assessment In Rainfed Agricultural Areas Based On Ndvi Time Series Autocorrelation Values
AB  - Fallowing is a common practice in Mediterranean areas where water scarcity becomes a limiting factor, affecting soil productivity, crop yield and biodiversity. In mainland Spain, fallow lands expand across three million hectares every year, constituting around 30\% of rainfed arable lands and 6\% of the national surface. There is a need of monitoring fallow lands to better map land use intensity and therefore achieve a sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture. However, most of current land use classification systems do not include lands under fallowing practices as a specific class. In this research, a new and highly operative methodology based on NDVI time series autocorrelation values to assess fallowing temporal patterns across rainfed agricultural areas is proposed. This approach was tested in mainland Spain, using the autocorrelation function of MODIS NDVI time series from 2001 to 2012 at 250 m spatial resolution. The field observational database from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was used for validation purposes. The dataset used includes 338 pixels with annual information about the cultivated and fallowed surface within the entire study period. It was demonstrated that specific autocorrelation values at lags corresponding to one, two, and three years contained relevant information to identify lands under fallowing practices and assess their temporal pattern. Integrating autocorrelation variables in a random forest model made it possible to improve the assessment. The classification results were in agreement with the field dataset with an overall accuracy higher than 80\%. Results revealed that approximately half of rainfed agricultural areas were regularly cultivated and distributed mainly in the northwestern Spain. The other half mainly located across northeast, center and south of Spain, showed crop-fallow rotation patterns. This methodology is a promising technique to map land management intensity using the entire time series in a highly operative manner. It is expected that in the near future the availability of remote sensing time series with better spatial resolution will make it possible to improve the assessment of agricultural intensification.

TI  - The Assessment Of Potential Risks Of Solid Municipal Waste Landfill
AB  - The field ecosystem studies of researchers by Komi Federal Research Center in the area of the proposed construction of solid industrial and household waste landfill (ecotechnopark "Shies", near railway station Shies, Arkhangelsk Region) have revealed limitations and possible potential risks in the implementation of the project. The characteristics of soil and vegetation cover, features of the chemical composition of surface waters (high content of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu related with swamping and peat water saturation) of the area were established on the territory. The peat thickness according to geo-radar sounding at bogs exceeds 1.5-2.0 m. Thematic mapping of the work areas based on the materials of modern and archival satellite images demonstrates the ratio of the areas of the dominant landscape complexes and classes of vegetation cover. A model of potential atmospheric circulation and transfer of pollution was made for the assumed source of atmospheric emission. The identified limitations are mainly associated with a high watering of the territory and the dominance of old-growth spruce stands with the presence of indicator species of intact areas, often including rare species of plants, animals and lichens of different levels of protection. Four species of lichens included in the Red Book of the Russian Federation (2008) are presented at the planning polygon area. There is a probability to meet with representatives of 15 species of rare and protected animals. A preliminary calculation of damage to the environment shows that loss of ecosystem services exceeds the economic benefits.

TI  - Developing Machine Learning Models With Multi-Source Environmental Data To Predict Wheat Yield In China
AB  - Crop yield is controlled by different environmental factors. Multi-source data for site-specific soils, climates, and remotely sensed vegetation indices are essential for yield prediction. Algorithms of data-model fusion for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction are complicated and need to be optimized to deal with model uncertainty. This study integrated multi-source environmental variables (e.g., satellite-based vegetation indices, climate data, and soil properties) into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models for wheat yield prediction in China. The performance of both RF and SVM models was investigated using different types of vegetation indices associated with other predictors. Relative importance and partial dependence analyses were used to identify the main predictors and their relationships with wheat yield. We found that using remotely sensed vegetation indices improved our model precision, and that near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) was slightly better than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in predicting yield. NIRv was better in detecting climate stress on crops, and could capture more information regarding crop growth and yield formation. Compared with the SVM model, the RF model with NIRv and other covariates had better performance in wheat yield prediction, with R-2 and RMSE being 0.74 and 758 kg/ha respectively. We also found that NIRv from jointing to heading was the most important predictor in determining yield, followed by solar radiation (especially during tillering-heading), relative humidity (during planting-tillering), soil organic carbon, and wind speed (throughout the growing season). In addition, wheat yield exhibited threshold-like responses to most factors based on our RF model. These threshold values can help to better understand how different environmental factors limit wheat yield, which will provide useful information for climate-adaptive crop management. Our findings demonstrated the potential of using NIRv for yield prediction. This approach is broadly applicable to other regions globally using publicly available data.

TI  - Integrating Demographic And Landsat (Tm) Data At A Watershed Scale
AB  - Recurrent calls for integrated resource management urge that an understanding of human activities and populations be incorporated into natural resource research, management, and protection efforts. In this paper, we hypothesize that watersheds can be a valuable geography for organizing an inquiry into the relationship between humans and the environment, and we present a framework for conducting such efforts. The framework is grounded in the emerging field of landscape ecology and incorporates demographic theory and data. Demography has been advanced by technological capabilities associated with the 1990 Census. Employing Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, we couple Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) land cover data with census-derived housing density data to demonstrate the operation of our framework and its utility for better understanding human-landscape interactions. In our investigation of the Kickapoo Watershed and two sub-watersheds, located in southwestern Wisconsin, we identify relationships between landscape composition and the distribution and social structure of human populations. Our findings offer insight into the interplay between people and biophysical systems.

TI  - Distributed Hydrological Model Based On Machine Learning Algorithm: Assessment Of Climate Change Impact On Floods

Reliable flood modelling is challenging due to the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation intensity, duration and frequency, heterogeneity in temperature rise and land-use changes. Reliable high-resolution precipitation data and distributed hydrological model can solve the problem. This study aims to develop a distributed hydrological model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simulate streamflow extremes from satellite-based high-resolution climate data. Four widely used bias correction methods were compared to select the best method for downscaling coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) global climate model (GCMs) simulations. A novel ML-based distributed hydrological model was developed for modelling runoff from the corrected satellite rainfall data. Finally, the model was used to project future changes in runoff and streamflow extremes from the downscaled GCM projected climate. The Johor River Basin (JRB) in Malaysia was considered as the case study area. The distributed hydrological model developed using ML showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.96 and 0.78 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.01 and 5.64 during calibration and validation. The simulated flow analysis using the model showed that the river discharge would increase in the near future (2020-2059) and the far future (2060-2099) for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The largest change in river discharge would be for SSP-585. The extreme rainfall indices, such as Total Rainfall above 95th Percentile (R95TOT), Total Rainfall above 99th Percentile (R99TOT), One day Max Rainfall (R x 1day), Five-day Max Rainfall (R x 5day), and Rainfall Intensity (RI), were projected to increase from 5\% for SSP-119 to 37\% for SSP-585 in the future compared to the base period. The results showed that climate change and socio-economic development would cause an increase in the frequency of streamflow extremes, causing larger flood events.

TI  - Flood Vulnerability Mapping And Urban Sprawl Suitability Using Fr, Lr, And Svm Models
AB  - Floods are among the most destructive disasters because they cause immense damage to human life, property (land and buildings), and resources. They also slow down a country's economy. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of floods, it is difficult to predict the areas that are prone to flooding. In this study, an attempt was made to create a suitability map for future urban development based on flood vulnerability maps for the catchment area of Taif, Saudi Arabia. Three models were used for this purpose, including bivariate (FR), multivariate (LR), and machine learning (SVM) were used. Thirteen parameters were used as flood-contributing parameters. The inventory map was constructed using field surveys, historical data, analysis of RADAR (Sentinel-1A), and Google Earth imagery collected between 2013 and 2020. In general, 70\% flood locations were randomly selected from the flood inventory map to generate the flood susceptibility model, and the remaining 30\% of the flood locations were used for model validation. The flood susceptibility map was classified into five zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The AUC value used to predict the performance of the models showed that the accuracy reached 89.5, 92.0, and 96.2\% for the models FR, LR, and SVM, respectively. Accordingly, the flood susceptibility map produced by the SVM model is accurate and was used to produce a flood vulnerability map with the help of urban and road density maps. Then slope and elevation maps were integrated with the flood vulnerability model to produce the final suitability map, which was classified into three zones: isolated zone, low suitability, and high suitability areas. The results showed that the highly suitable areas are located in the east and northeast of the Taif Basin, where the flood risk is low and very low. The results of this work will improve the land use planning of engineers and authorities and take possible measures to reduce the flood hazards in the area.

TI  - Testing Evapotranspiration Estimates Based On Modis Satellite Data In The Assessment Of The Groundwater Recharge Of Karst Aquifers In Southern Italy
AB  - In many Italian regions, and particularly in southern Italy, karst aquifers are the main sources of drinking water and play a crucial role in the socio-economic development of the territory. Hence, estimating the groundwater recharge of these aquifers is a fundamental task for the proper management of water resources, while also considering the impacts of climate changes. In the southern Apennines, the assessment of hydrological parameters that is needed for the estimation of groundwater recharge is a challenging issue, especially for the spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of networks of rain and air temperature stations, as well as the variable geomorphological features and land use across mountainous karst areas. In such a framework, the integration of terrestrial and remotely sensed data is a promising approach to limit these uncertainties. In this research, estimations of actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge using remotely sensed data gathered by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite in the period 2000-2014 are shown for karst aquifers of the southern Apennines. To assess the uncertainties affecting conventional methods based on empirical formulas, the values estimated by the MODIS dataset were compared with those calculated by Coutagne, Turc, and Thornthwaite classical empirical formulas, which were based on the recordings of meteorological stations. The annual rainfall time series of 266 rain gauges and 150 air temperature stations, recorded using meteorological networks managed by public agencies in the period 2000-2014, were considered for reconstructing the regional distributed models of actual evapotranspiration (AET) and groundwater recharge. Considering the MODIS AET, the mean annual groundwater recharge for karst aquifers was estimated to be about 448 mm center dot year(-1). In contrast, using the Turc, Coutagne, and Thornthwaite methods, it was estimated as being 494, 533, and 437 mm center dot year(-1), respectively. The obtained results open a new methodological perspective for the assessment of the groundwater recharge of karst aquifers at the regional and mean annual scales, allowing for limiting uncertainties and taking into account a spatial resolution greater than that of the existing meteorological networks. Among the most relevant results obtained via the comparison of classical approaches used for estimating evapotranspiration is the good matching of the actual evapotranspiration estimated using MODIS data with the potential evapotranspiration estimated using the Thornthwaite formula. This result was considered linked to the availability of soil moisture for the evapotranspiration demand due to the relevant precipitation in the area, the general occurrence of soils covering karst aquifers, and the dense vegetation.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis Of Land Use Driving Force In Coal Mining Area: Case Study In Ningdong, China
AB  - Geospatial techniques such as remote sensing and Geographic Information System are very important for studying the dynamic process of land use. To analyze the land use change and assess the driving force, SPOT satellite images of 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 were used. Classification of land use was applied using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Maximum Likelihood Technique in ENVI 5.3. Transition images and matrix were applied using Arcgis10.5 with the Excel PivotTable function. To determine the driving forces of land use change in the study area, Quantitative and Qualitative analysis were applied. Data were compared with statistical analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results showed that, the images of the study area were categorized into vegetation (arable land, garden, woodland, grassland, water and agriculture), construction (industrial and transportation) and unutilized land (salt marsh, sandy land, bare land and gully erosion land). From 2005 to 2018, constriction land use greatly increased from 100.41 km(2) (2.88\%) and 305.13 km(2) (8.76\%), respectively. Vegetation was decreased from 3190 km(2) (91.55\%) 3028 km(2) (86.91\%) in 2005 and 2018, respectively. Results of the comprehensive index of land use degree, dynamic degree, quantitative and qualitative analysis show major changes in land use of the area that caused by human activities especially new developments during the period of the study. The results showed that the Ningdong base in 2005-2018 has been in the stage of sustainable development, mainly in the conversion of grassland, forest land and cultivated land to construction land. High values of rate of change in land use related to the development and new construction and building area. This development might be as a result of anthropogenic activities through urban growth coupled with its potential impacts on urban climate. The principal component analysis shows that human activities drive the change of land use pattern in Ningdong, mainly including the policy of closing the grazing ban, industrialization and scale, population growth and urbanization. Results can provide effective data for the future ecological environment protection and sustainable development of Ningdong Energy Base. Remote sensing is a good technique for assessing the actual sequence in the development of any area that may be caused by human activities.

TI  - Spatial Distribution Of Natural Hazards And Their Proximity To Heritage Sites: Case Of The United Arab Emirates
AB  - The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) investigated World Heritage sites and listed some in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Heritage sites in any country have important cultural and economic value. However, many of the sites are subjected to potential impact by natural hazards, considering their age and the effects of climate. In the interest of reducing these impacts, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and the World Heritage Committee called for a detailed hazard assessment. This research falls within this assessment scope by applying remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) methods to assess the spatial distribution of natural hazards and their proximity to heritage sites in the UAE. Results show that heritage sites in the northeastern UAE are more vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, and sea-level rise. Still, risk varies depending on elevation and the proximity to fault lines and the coastline. In the western UAE, the majority of heritage sites are prone to the effects of desertification and sand encroachment. This study is large-scale in nature, and specific vulnerability assessments for each heritage site are beyond the scope of this paper. The database, methodology, and output from this research could be useful for many organizations, such as those working in the fields of culture and heritage, tourism, disaster management, and urban planning. Compilation of a GIS database centering upon the heritage sites in the UAE is considered a major step forward for future studies related to the sites. The GIS database is available for interested users upon request.

TI  - Gis-Based Assessment Of Soil Loss Using Ahp With Rusle Model: A Case Study Of Kaushambi-Prayagraj Watershed In The Ganga Basin, Up (India)
AB  - Surface soil loss is the major environmental problem faced by farmers in the agriculture sector regarding productivity. This research paper demonstrates the prone soil loss zones using GIS tools, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model conducted to assess soil loss, whereas, hematic layers were created using data gathered from climate conditions, geology maps, remote sensing imageries, field observations, and laboratory analyses. A conceptual methodology was constructed to implement the model across the watershed area in the Ganga basin near the Kaushambi-Prayagraj region. Based on the Land Degradation Vulnerability Index (LDVI), the whole watershed area was categorized into four classes area such as low loss (135163.7 ha), moderate loss (114864.9 ha), high loss (56240.8 ha), and severe loss (25675.5 ha). The AUC of the LDVI (84.3\%) and CR value of AHP (0.061) are indicating the high accuracy of the outcome. Whereas, average annual soil loss in (tons/ha/year) the watershed area was found as low soil loss (49.64\%), moderate soil loss (27.92\%), high soil loss (17.35\%), and severe soil loss (5.09\%). The qualitative and quantitative soil loss-prone areas would be helpful for proper management strategies to mitigate soil erosion and enhance agricultural productivity in the region.

TI  - Predicting Microhabitat Suitability For An Endangered Small Mammal Using Sentinel-2 Data
AB  - Accurate mapping is a main challenge for endangered small-sized terrestrial species. Freely available spatio-temporal data at high resolution from multispectral satellite offer excellent opportunities for improving predictive distribution models of such species based on fine-scale habitat features, thus making it easier to achieve comprehensive biodiversity conservation goals. However, there are still few examples showing the utility of remote-sensing-based products in mapping microhabitat suitability for small species of conservation concern. Here, we address this issue using Sentinel-2 sensor-derived habitat variables, used in combination with more commonly used explanatory variables (e.g., topography), to predict the distribution of the endangered Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) in agrosilvopastorial systems. Based on vole surveys conducted in two different seasons over a similar to 176,000 ha landscape in Southern Portugal, we assessed the significance of each predictor in explaining Cabrera vole occurrence using the Boruta algorithm, a novel Random forest variant for dealing with high dimensionality of explanatory variables. Overall, results showed a strong contribution of Sentinel-2-derived variables for predicting microhabitat suitability of Cabrera voles. In particular, we found that photosynthetic activity (NDI45), specific spectral signal (SWIR1), and landscape heterogeneity (Rao's Q) were good proxies of Cabrera voles' microhabitat, mostly during temporally greener and wetter conditions. In addition to remote-sensing-based variables, the presence of road verges was also an important driver of voles' distribution, highlighting their potential role as refuges and/or corridors. Overall, our study supports the use of remote-sensing data to predict microhabitat suitability for endangered small-sized species in marginal areas that potentially hold most of the biodiversity found in human-dominated landscapes. We believe our approach can be widely applied to other species, for which detailed habitat mapping over large spatial extents is difficult to obtain using traditional descriptors. This would certainly contribute to improving conservation planning, thereby contributing to global conservation efforts in landscapes that are managed for multiple purposes.

TI  - Land-Use Structure Optimization For The Lijiang River Basin Ecosystem Service Value Maximization
AB  - The land utilization structure optimization will promote the sustainable development of ecosystems, which is the top priority. The ultimate goal of ecological management is to optimize the ecosystem services to maximize the services provided by the ecosystem. The paper select the typical ecologically fragile Lijiang River basin as the study area, and the maximization of the value of the whole ecosystem services as the research target. First, combined with field experiments and five phases of Landsat high-resolution remote sensing images to obtain the basic data, estimated each item from 1998 to 2018 for the value of ecosystem services research area. Then combined with the gray linear model for predicting the value in 2018-2028. Final,with the help of Lingo software so as to put forward the optimization scheme of land structure to maximize ecological benefits, and then further to making comparison and analysis for the ecosystem value in research area where were optimized before and after. The results showed that (1) Nearly 20 years, in study area the principal land-use types are forestland and cultivated land, which accounts for 98% of whole drainage basin. The water area and cultivated land area decreased year by year, but the forestland and construction land as well as unused land area continue to increase. In addition, unused land area had changed obviously, which even increased around 30 times and mainly converted from forest land and cultivated land. (2) During studying, the value of ecosystem service had decreased around 19.55×106 RMB, which showed the trend of down after up and will keep such trend in long term. Till 2028, the drainage basin ecosystem services values will be reduced to 8067.43×106 RMB. So, the forest land value is the highest among the overall ecosystem of the drainage basin, which occupies around the 86% of basin total value in past years, followed by the water area and cultivated land area, which account for 8% and 6% separately. (3) After optimizing the study area, the total ecosystem services values in the Lijiang River basin has increased 2%, which mainly because the forest land and water area increased and improved the supply capacity for the ecosystem regulating services. Meanwhile, the arable land and construction land increased slightly, and the area of the unused land decreased significantly, which keeps the same level in 2008. This study provided the scientific support for ecological management in karst areas by optimizing the key ecosystem services values. © 2021 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Application Of Remote Sensing In Analysis Of Impact Assessment Using Biomass Vigour Changes Of Watersheds
AB  - Aim: Vegetation status analysis is the best technique to assess the impact of watershed development activities. However, this approach often ignores biomass changes which are not due to the watershed management intervention in arid/semi-Arid regions. The present study focused on the biomass vigour change detection to assess the impact ofwatershed management measures in arid Arjuni and semi-Arid Morva-Hadaf watersheds from Gujaratstate, India. Methodology: The study was carried out by multi-Temporal remote sensing data for the year, 2002 & 2012 and 1997 & 2011 for the corresponding watersheds. The changes in biomass vigour were identified using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach at watershed and sub-watershed levels for Arjuni watershed and watershed and mini-watershed levels for Morva-Hadaf watershed. The identified biomass changes were precisely tested with respect to already treated areas under watershed management programmes. ' Results: The NDVI values increased in both watersheds representing an overall increase in the biomass vigour. However, the sub-watershed level study of Arjuni watershed and mini-watershed level study of Morva-Hadaf watershed showed negative relationship between the percentage increase in NDVI, and percentage of treated area under different programmes. Interpretation: The results inferred that the increase in biomass vigour does not solely explain the implementation of watershed management measures. This clearly indicates that other than human induced factors (viz., micro-irrigation system adopted by farmers), seasonal factors (i.e., rainfall, temperature) have also influenced the NDVI values throughout the study area. Looking into the current micro-watershed clustering approach, the future work is required to distinguish between climate and human induced factors as a part of impact assessment studies. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).

TI  - Prediction Of Flash Flood Susceptibility Using Integrating Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) And Frequency Ratio (Fr) Algorithms
AB  - The landscape of Pakistan is vulnerable to flood and periodically affected by floods of different magnitudes. The aim of this study was aimed to assess the flash flood susceptibility of district Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan using geospatial model and Frequency Ratio and Analytical Hierarchy Process. Also, the study considered eight most influential flood-causing parameters are Digital Elevation Model, slop, distance from the river, drainage density, Land use/Land cover, geology, soil resistivity (soil consisting of different rocks and soil formation) and rainfall deviation. The rainfall data was collected from weather stations in the vicinity of the study area. Estimated weight was allotted to each flood-inducing factors with the help of AHP and FR. Through the use of the overlay analysis, each of the factors were brought together, and the value of drainage density was awarded the maximum possible score. According to the study several areas of the region based on the parameters have been classified in flood zones viz, very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk, and very low risk. In the light of the results obtained, 4\% of the study area that accounts for 86.25 km(2) is at high risk of flood. The areas like Bagham, Sohawa, Domeli, Turkai, Jogi Tillas, Chang Wala, Dandot Khewra were located at the very high elevation. Whereas Potha, Samothi, Chaklana, Bagrian, Tilla Jogian, Nandna, Rawal high-risk zones and have been damaged badly in the flood history of the area. This study is the first of its kind conducted on the Jhelum District and provides guidelines for disaster management authorities and response agencies, infrastructure planners, watershed management, and climatologists.

TI  - Land Cover Changing Pattern In Pre- And Post-Earthquake Affected Area From Remote Sensing Data: A Case Of Lushan County, Sichuan Province
AB  - Extremely hard-hit areas face frequent secondary geological hazards and difficulties in vegetation recovery, and subsequent effects have a significant impact on land cover changes. At present, there is a lack of research on the dynamic restoration of, and changes in, the ecological environment before and after an earthquake, and especially a lack of quantitative assessment of the impact of earthquakes on land cover at the microscopic scale of spatial distribution of landscape indices. Taking the Lushan earthquake in Sichuan Province as an example, this paper obtained land cover data from the study area between 2012 and 2020, and analyzes the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of land cover change frequency by using a comprehensive land cover degree index, land cover transfer matrix and landscape ecology index. The results show that the types of cropland, forest, built-up and bare land have changed significantly in the study area. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive land cover index of the study area showed an increasing trend, and land cover has been continuously improved under the effect of artificial measures and natural restoration. After 2013, patch density (PD) and landscape shape index (LSI) values decreased and aggregation index (AI) values increased for the vast majority of landscape land classes, indicating a benign ecological development across the region in the post-earthquake period. The research results are not only helpful to establish scientific ecological environmental management in the earthquake-stricken areas, but also helpful to formulate medium- and long-term ecological environmental monitoring and ecological restoration plans based on land cover change patterns.

TI  - Landscape Conservation Forecasting For Data-Poor At-Risk Species On Western Public Lands, United States
AB  - Managing vast federal public lands governed by multiple land use policies creates challenges when demographic data on at-risk species are lacking. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management Cedar City Field Office used this project in the Black Mountains (Utah) to inform vegetation management supporting at-risk greater sage-grouse and Utah prairie dog planning. Ecological systems were mapped from satellite remote sensing imagery and used to model species habitat suitability under two levels of management activity (custodial, preferred) and climate scenarios for historic and two global circulation models. Spatial state-and-transition models of ecological systems were simulated for all six scenarios up to 60 years while coupled with expert-developed habitat suitability indices. All ecological systems are at least moderately departed from reference conditions in 2012, whereas habitat suitability was 50.5\% and 48.4\% for sage-grouse and prairie dog, respectively. Management actions replaced non-native annual grasslands with perennial grasses, removed conifers, and controlled exotic forbs. The drier climate most affected ecological departure and prairie dog habitat suitability at 30 years only. Different climates influenced spatial patterns of sage-grouse habitat suitability, but nonspatial values were unchanged. Climate impacts on fire, vegetation succession, and restoration explain many results. Front-loading restoration is predicted to benefit under future drier climate.

TI  - Integration Of Two Spectral Indices To Monitor Loss Of Moist Grasslands Within The Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, India
AB  - We conducted a study within flood-managed grasslands to evaluate the utility of remotely sensed imagery to evaluate the influence of an altered flooding regime on grassland distribution. Grasslands found along the Torsa River, which flows north to south through the Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary in West Bengal, India, provided an excellent test case due to the protected nature of this landscape from intensive management and cultivation. Further, during the 1968 flood season, the Torsa River experienced a major shift in its course from the west side of the sanctuary to east. We used remote-sensing data to identify an efficient method to spectrally monitor changes in grassland distribution. Spectrally normalized multi-temporal (1978, 1990, 2001, 2005) Landsat (MSS, TM, ETM) and ASTER data were used to compare changes in grassland distribution between the current and historic floodplain. A combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a normalized difference dry index (NDDI) proved very useful in identifying and monitoring grasslands. Given the absence of historic ground data, spectral indices derived from historical satellite imagery also proved valuable as a means to understand temporal dynamics of the distribution of grasslands. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Mapping Mangroves Of Tengragiri Wildlife Sanctuary Under Barguna District Of Bangladesh Using Freely Available Satellite Imagery
AB  - Naturally grown mangrove forest is the south coastal community's green barrier from any type of hydro-meteorological hazard and disasters. South-western coastal area of Bangladesh is covered by the Sundarbans, and mid-central zone is covered by Tengragiri wildlife sanctuary which is taken as a protected area in this recent era but not mapped properly with considering different species diversification and temporal changes pattern which is required for successful co-management of this mangrove forest. This study identifies species composition, plant diseases, degradation of the mangrove forests and further focuses on mapping mangroves by conducting plotting-based primary field visit, variability analysis using different indices and cross-matching with secondary databases. Existing mangrove forest boundary's 200 m buffering with three-time series satellite imagery 2000, 2010 and 2017 is considered for further analysis. Including all buffering zone, this protected area considered 9 major classes that included four subclasses for presenting result like Baen (Avicennia officinalis), Gewa-Goran (Excoecaria agallocha, Ceriops decandra), Keora (Sonneratia apetala), Sundri (Heritiera fomes), Plantation trees Samanea Saman (Raintree), agriculture-grassland (agri-grass) and homestead settlement, sandbar and waterbody. Mapping accuracy assessment purpose automatically generated 996 points cross-matched with previously mangrove species level detailed survey results and found highest accuracy in Sundri species (70\%) and all others above 50\%. During 2000-2017, the Keora area showed the highest increase 129\% over 2000 and increasing rate 13.17 ha/yr. About 26\% Sundri and Baen-Passur increased around 13.45 ha/yr. In case of Sundri, 70\% area coverage remained intact during 2000-2017, while other 25\% classified in 2017 as Avicennia officinalis, Gewa-Goran classes. Furthermore, using refracted electromagnetic energy from various physical characteristics of plants application, four indices (NDVI, DVI, MSAVI-2, RVI) are usable where single-species-level crop density analysis has limitations, but identification of Sundri and Keora by MSAVI-2 and NDVI found significant and alternately lower accuracy values from RVI. Identification of dominant mangrove species groups as well as area gains and losses over 2000-2017 is a robust biophysical baseline for management of the sanctuary. Natural hearts of this area and working as first-step warriors against natural disasters originated from Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal; so far, it is very much required to save this forest and the coastal communities as well. The results of the study and maps will be helpful for the scientific community, planners, government-international bodies and the activists, Forest Department and the local community in effective planning, monitoring the effectiveness of co-management in conservation of the sanctuary.

TI  - Public Health For The Twenty-First Century: What Role Do Veterinarians In Clinical Practice Play?
AB  - All veterinarians, regardless of their formal job description, serve the public good and contribute to public health. The public health activities veterinarians engage in most frequently in clinical practice are in the areas of disease detection, reporting, and prevention.

TI  - The Process-Based Forest Growth Model 3-Pg For Use In Forest Management: A Review
AB  - Forests are a critical resource, and need proper management in the face of dire climatic changes facing the world today. Advances in modelling system result in the formulation of numerous forest modelling approaches to provide an estimation of forests services. One such useful and straightforward forest modelling approach is process-based modelling, relying on physiological processes and biophysical parameters of forest ecosystems. It is based on parametric calculations and allometric equations, delivering crucial outputs for forest management. The dynamic 3-PG (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) is a process-based model (PBM) based on an ecosystem physiological process-based modelling approach. The various applications and flexible nature of the 3-PG model have resulted in its adoption and utilization over several regions of the world. The 3-PGS (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth with Satellite) model is a modified and spatial version of the 3-PG model that took advantages of remote sensing & GIS (Geographical Information System) for estimation of biophysical variables like FAPAR (Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation), LAI (Leaf area index), and Canopy water content (CWC), which are tedious and laborious to calculate manually. The integration of remote sensing & GIS with PBMs offers insights to predict forest biomass and productivity at a regional level. Also, coupling of the 3-PG/3-PGS model with other modelling and statistical approaches in a GIS environment provides insights into the prediction of species distributions and potential disturbances due to climatic changes. The 3-PG model was originally designed for relatively homogenous forests; but with the recent development, the 3-PGmix has extended its use to mixed species forests. In this review, we have tried to emphasize the general overview, structure, applications, and efficacy of the process-based 3-PG model for forest management. In future, forests and their ecosystem services are expected to be rigorously influenced by climatic variations. Therefore, it is important to understand the role and effectiveness of the forest growth model 3-PG under the influence of climate change. The 3-PG model performs well for a diverse range of conditions for many forest types and species, and could be integrated with other models and approaches in order to widen its functions and applications. Areas such as Fertility Rating (FR), sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to the model inputs in the 3-PG model requires attention to remove the weaker side, and to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of model outputs. In addition, the model performance can be improved by calculating its parameters from the population of interest, rather than using default values or values from extant literature. Furthermore, high-resolution remote sensing datasets and accurate input field data could increase the accuracy of the 3-PG/3-PGS model predictions at a broad regional level. In general, the simple forest growth model 3-PG delivers practical outputs, which are directly used in forest management. Additionally, the functions and applications of the 3-PG/3-PGS/3-PGmix model could be explored to deal with the impacts of climate change on forests and to ensure the sustainable management of forests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Qualify Decision Making Through Strategic Environmental Assessment: Advancing The Resilience Of Peri-Urban Areas
AB  - The displacement between the intentions of the decision making process and the continuous changes that territories undergo, both planned and unforeseen, calls for an unused "territorial consistency" of planning. Thus, it requires widening its capacity in taking into consideration the whole decision making means overlaying on concerned territories. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) can be a reliable support to this shift. Through the case study of joint SEA of the EU funded Regional Operational Programmes 2014-2020 in Lombardy Region (IT), the contribution argues the potential role of an assessment approach based on a wide, shared and territorial based sustainability framework, drawn in order to properly face dynamic spatial scenarios. It is shaped to accompany the decision-making process and ensure a long-term link between spatial changes and single planning or programming activity. To outline spatial scenarios, all factors are supposed to determine the actual spatial dynamics and thus are considered and conceived as directly impacting the resilience and the vulnerability of territorial systems. This space-based approach results in acknowledgment of the value of Peri-Urban areas in terms of ecosystem services provided to urban areas as well as environmental, social and cultural relevance per se. While the urgent need for such a role to be recognized is apparent, the lack of ad hoc policies in Italy stands evident, also due to an unwillingness to integrate sectorial courses of action within a territorial focus. The proposed case study delivers specific sustainability conditions for the implementation phase, in order to bridge single provisions on Peri-Urban areas.

TI  - Integrating In Situ And Ocean Color Data To Evaluate Ecological Quality Under The Water Framework Directive
AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims at evaluating the ecological status of European coastal water bodies (CWBs). This is a rather complex task and first requires the use of long-term databases to assess the effect of anthropogenic pressure on biological communities. An in situ dataset was assembled using concomitant biological, i.e., chlorophyll a (Chl a) and environmental data, covering the years from 1995 to 2014, to enable a comprehensive assessment of eutrophication in the Western Iberia Coast (WIC). Given the temporal gaps in the dataset, especially in terms of Chl a, satellite observations were used to complement it. Positive relationships between Chl a 90th percentile and nitrogen concentrations were obtained. The Land-Uses Simplified Index (LUSI), as a pressure indicator, showed no relationship with Chl a, except in Galicia, but it highlighted a higher continental pressure in the Portuguese CWBs in comparison with Galician waters. In general terms, the trophic index (TRIX) showed that none of the CWBs were in degraded conditions. Nevertheless, the relatively high TRIX and LUSI values obtained for the water body in front of Tagus estuary suggest that this area should be subject to continued monitoring. Results highlighted the usefulness of satellite data in water quality assessments and set the background levels for the implementation of operational monitoring based on satellite Chl a. In the future, low uncertainty and harmonized satellite products across countries should be provided. Moreover, the assessment of satellite-based eutrophication indicators should also include metrics on phytoplankton phenology and community structure. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Measuring The Urban Particulate Matter Island Effect With Rapid Urban Expansion
AB  - Rapid urbanization has posed numerous negative impacts on the environment, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. However, quantitative investigations of the PM(2.5)concentration trends over an urban-rural gradient at the local level are still lacking. The urban particulate matter island (UPI) effect, representing the phenomenon that high particle concentrations in urban areas are gradually attenuated to surrounding areas, was adopted and modified in this paper to study the Hangzhou Bay area from 2000 to 2015. We found the following: (1) every urban area in the Hangzhou Bay area experienced rapid expansion, especially during 2000-2005; (2) more than half of the urban areas suffered UPI problems, and these urban areas had relatively high and stable UPI intensity (UPII) values, although the UPI footprint (UPIFP) values decreased with urban expansion; and (3) urban areas could be divided into three categories: plain areas, hilly areas and the junction of plains and hills, and the probability of the UPI effect varied significantly for different categories. This paper can compensate for the lack of research on the UPI effect at the local level and provide scientific evidence for air pollution control during urban agglomeration planning.

TI  - Project Grace: A Staged Approach To Development Of A Community- Academic Partnership To Address Hiv In Rural African American Communities
AB  - The HIV epidemic is a health crisis in rural African American communities in the Southeast United States; however, to date little attention has been paid to community- academic collaborations to address HIV in these communities. Interventions that use a communitybased participatory research (CBPR) approach to address individual, social, and physical environmental factors have great potential for improving community health. Project GRACE (Growing, Reaching, Advocating for Change and Empowerment) uses a CBPR approach to develop culturally sensitive, feasible, and sustainable interventions to prevent the spread of HIV in rural African American communities. This article describes a staged approach to community- academic partnership: initial mobilization, establishment of organizational structure, capacity building for action, and planning for action. Strategies for engaging rural community members at each stage are discussed; challenges faced and lessons learned are also described. Careful attention to partnership development has resulted in a collaborative approach that has mutually benefited both the academic and community partners.

TI  - Urban Sprawl And Its Impact On Land Use Land Cover Dynamics Of Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly, Ghana
AB  - In Ghana, Sekondi-Takoradi has been one of the preferred cities for many people due to the prevalence of industries, the presence of harbor, and the airport. However, the discovery of oil off the coast of the Western region, where Sekondi-Takoradi is the administrative and economic capital makes it more attractive to people in the area. This has increased the number of urban dwellers and resulted in the conversion of different and Land Use /Land Cover (LULC) forms into urban or built-up areas. Using Landsat imageries from 1991, 2002, 2008, and 2018 of Sekondi-Takoradi, together with geospatial and Shannon's entropy techniques, this paper assesses the impact of urban sprawl on land use and land use dynamics within the metropolis. Results of land use land cover change showed significant changes during the period of study. Settlement increased by 25.93% whereas water, vegetation, and bare land reduced by 0.08%, 16.00%, and 9.86% respectively. This reveals the occurrence of an unguided expansion of built-up area in the metropolis. Also, results from entropy calculations showed high entropy values ranging from 2.42 to 2.50, though the entropy values did not significantly change throughout the study. This indicates that the metropolis has been experiencing sprawl from 1991 to 2018 and thus urban development has significantly changed the land cover stratum of the metropolis. The findings demonstrate the value of spatial modeling in environmental management and urban planning. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Life Cycle Assessment Of Proposed Space Elevator Designs
AB  - The cost and design requirements for transporting satellites and payloads to space using existing orbital technology remain prohibitively high. Yet, quantitative sustainability assessments to evaluate system costs and impacts of existing and proposed orbital transportation systems have been rare. Space elevators are a proposed orbital transportation system intended to safely, gently, and inexpensively transport satellites and other payloads to and from space on a routine daily basis. This life cycle assessment (LCA) was completed to quantify, assess, compare, and suggest improvements to the potential environmental and financial performance of three proposed space elevator system designs, namely i) a One-Tether Initial Space Elevator (the base design) ii) a Two-Tether Initial Space Elevator iii) an Additional One-Tether Space Elevator. A sensitivity analysis to compare the impact of reduced utilization capacity of the space elevator system was also performed. Results indicated the Additional One-Tether Space Elevator scenario had the lowest environmental impact, while the Two-Tether Initial Space Elevator scenario had the lowest production cost per unit mass delivered to orbit. This LCA identified system elements for targeted impact reduction, e.g. operational impacts could be significantly reduced by improving the sustainability of terrestrial transportation delivery systems to the space elevator port. Sensitivity analysis results showed producer cost to be the only impact category with a direct inversely correlated response to reduced capacity; all other impacts showed less sensitivity to utilization reduction. Ultimately, the proposed space elevator design was found to be an environmentally and financially sustainable option for orbital transportation. Further application and refinement of such sustainable engineering and quantitative sustainability assessment methodologies to spacecraft, rocket, and other existing and proposed orbital transportation systems and industries is highly recommended. © 2019 IAA

TI  - Piecing Together The Data Of The U.s. Marine Aquaculture Puzzle
AB  - Aquaculture recently became the main source of global seafood production and many countries, including the United States, see potential in marine aquaculture to sustainably fill growing demand. The U.S. supports the majority of its seafood consumption through imports, and therefore identifying bottlenecks to domestic aquaculture growth is a priority at the federal and state level. Yet, one critical aspect that appears not yet addressed is the quality and accessibility of marine aquaculture data. In this study we conducted the first multi-state synthesis and comparison of the most comprehensive suite of species, volume, and value information on U.S. marine aquaculture over time, across the 23 marine coastal states. Using publicly available data sources from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), state-level solicited data that we aggregated, and data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we found strong evidence that marine aquaculture has played an increasingly important role in marine coastal states, but also uncovered numerous data gaps and discrepancies between and within these sources. In particular, we found a dearth of volumetric data and millions in missing value (USD$). We found U.S. marine aquaculture is likely much more diverse, abundant and valuable than is currently reported, but the main sources of error in any given state remain unclear. We recommend U.S. state governments adopt a standardized, digital and annual data collection program, such as the NOAA Fisheries Information Networks. Better strategic aquaculture planning, management, and research depend on accurate data, and existing digital data infrastructures provide strong opportunities for improvement. © 2022

TI  - Digital Visualisation As A New Driver Of Urban Change In Africa
AB  - Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa are growing faster than in any other part of the world, driven by expanding informal settlement (usually on the urban periphery) and the real-estate sector aiming for up-market property development. The continent currently has the highest real-estate value growth potential in the world. Much up-market property development is currently taking the form of new 'cities'-sometimes a redevelopment of an entire city (e.g., Kigali), sometimes a new city on an urban edge (e.g., Eko-Atlantic, Lagos) and sometimes a new satellite city (e.g., Tatu City, Nairobi). These projects are driven by international property development companies often in collaboration with governments and sometimes with local planning and property partners. All manifest as plans in a new way: as graphics on the websites of international consultants. Most involve no public participation and attempt to by-pass planning laws and processes. Producing these new plans (as computer generated images) are a new set of professionals: architects, planners, visualisers, advertising executives and project managers, working together in offices in global capitals of the world. Their aim is commercial. Planning in these projects is no longer shaped by the materiality of the city and attempts to achieve socio-spatial justice and sustainability. Rather planning is shaped by the circulation of graphics through a network of software programmes and marketing professionals. This article will situate Africa's new cities in theorisation of urban development and the role of urban planning through digital visualization.

TI  - Optimization Of Snow Area Discrimination Algorithm Under Different Land Cover Types In Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
AB  - The data provided by MODIS V006 version is the Normalized snow cover Index（NDSI），but the ma⁃ jority of users are often concerned with the intuitive snow cover classification results，including snow cover ex⁃ tent or snow cover rate. The National Snow and Ice Data Center（NSIDC）recommended 0. 4 is the best NDSI threshold for the global snow cover. However，the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has complex and diverse terrain and obvious snow patch characteristics，so a single NDSI threshold of 0. 4 cannot accurately distinguish the snow cover on different underlying surfaces. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau，known as the third pole of the earth，is one of the three stable snow areas in China and contains a large amount of fresh water resources. With global warm⁃ ing，the Tibetan plateau ahead of time，the snow is melting glaciers，increase，affect the rivers of water，caus⁃ ing floods，and thus affect the normal production of human life，so determining different underlying surface threshold，improve the traditional threshold value of snow overestimated underestimate phenomenon，improve the identification accuracy of snow，and then more accurate study of the Tibetan plateau snow conditions，Is par⁃ ticularly urgent. In this study，This paper takes the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as the research object. Firstly，MO⁃ DIS daily cloud-free NDSI sequence is generated and its reliability is verified. Secondly，the underlying surface is forested and non-forested areas，and the NDSI sequence of cloud removal has a good corresponding relation⁃ ship with the snow depth at the site. NDSI can accurately reflect the snow melting phenomenon of the pixel where the station is located. Determine the optimal threshold range of different underlying surface；Finally，the optimal threshold was determined by confusion matrix within the optimal threshold range. When NDSI=0. 03，the highest overall accuracy was 94. 02%. Under this NDSI，the overestimation error OE and underestimation er⁃ ror UE were 1. 21% and 4. 6%，respectively. When NDSI=0. 26 for non-forestland，overall accuracy（OA）is 94. 27%. Under this NDSI，he overestimates error（OE）and underestimate error（UE）are 0. 51% and 5. 03%，respectively. Therefore，the optimized threshold of forestland is NDSI=0. 03，and that of non-forestland is NDSI =0. 26. Because snow cover is a large scale phenomenon，the conventional observation data are mostly point scale observations. In order to avoid the limitations in the scale of conventional ground observation data，this pa⁃ per uses the high-precision Landsat 8 OLI satellite data identification results as the“truth value”and the snow discrimination results of the optimized threshold and the snow discrimination results of the traditional threshold to verify the“pixel to pixel”level. In quantitative verification，the overall accuracy（OA）of the optimized NDSI threshold to MOD10A1 V006 snow discrimination results is 84. 21%，the overestimation error OE is 5. 33%，and the underestimation error（UE）is 10. 46%. The overall accuracy（OA）of the traditional threshold for the snow discrimination results of MOD10A1 V006 is 82. 86%，the overestimation error（OE）is 1. 48%，and the underestimation error（UE）is 15. 66%. It can be seen that in the quantitative verification，the snow dis⁃ crimination accuracy of the optimized threshold is higher. At the same time，it can be seen from the qualitative verification that the new threshold and the traditional threshold are relatively good at snow recognition in the area with large area of concentrated snow. In the region with relatively scattered and broken snow，the optimized threshold can identify a large number of snow，while the traditional threshold cannot identify the same number of threshold. These results indicate that NDSI threshold optimization considering different land cover types can ef⁃ fectively improve the accuracy of snow discrimination on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau，which provides a strong support for the application f NDSI in snow recognition. It is helpful to understand the snow distribution in this area more accurately. © 2023 Science Press.

TI  - Vegetation And Fire Readiness In Main Morphological Units Of Niokolo Koba National Park (Southeast Senegal)
AB  - Bush fires are the main cause of natural resource degradation in Niokolo Koba National Park. So-called "early fires" or management fires are considered an irreplaceable tool for land management in protected areas. A synthesis of the literature and field observation reveals that plateaus and slopes are the most prone to burning. Fire proneness depends mainly on vegetation characteristics. The main vegetation types on plateaus and slopes are shrub and arborreal savannah, respectively. These savannah types are both dominated by Combretaceae in the ligneous stratum, while in the herbaceous layer species of Poaceae family dominate. The predominance and state of Poaceae in the herbaceous layer are major indicators of fire readiness. It is sought to adopt a strategy for early fire implementation that minimizes impact on natural resources. Any strategy must include an operational system for monitoring herbaceous fuel conditions. Such a system could benefit from new remote sensing technologies when combined with field measurements in the most exposed zones.

TI  - Multitemporal Analysis Of The Water Mirror Of The Jaburu I Reservoir Through Remote Sensing Tools In The Years 2013 To 2020
AB  - In regions with the influence of the semi-arid climate, water scarcity is clear, which is a consequence, among other factors, of negative precipitation scenarios that lead to prolonged droughts. Such characteristics reverberate negatively on the socioeconomic development of the society involved. In this context, water storage in dams can be considered an important strategic alternative that requires special attention in search of mitigating the water deficit in these regions. Thus, the present work aimed to carry out a multitemporal analysis of the water mirror of Açude Jaburu, located in the municipalities of Ubajara and Tianguá, Ceará, from 2013 to 2020. For this, the Normalized Index by Difference of Water (NWDI), using images from the Landsat 8 satellite, Collection 1 Tier 1, LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_RT, calibrated for Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, through bands 3 and 5, with a spatial resolution original 30 m. The main results show that the years with the greatest decline were 2014 and 2015 with 192.21 and 175.05 hectares of less water. The years 2018 and 2019 showed expansion, with 130.86 and 295.65 hectares, respectively. To evaluate the data discussed in this work in terms of correlation with rainfall in the area, the Spearman correlation test was used, which presented a p-value equal to 0.9349, assuming that there is no relationship between rainfall and the area of the mirror. of water. Further studies in the area are suggested to understand which factors can compromise the water availability in the reservoir, as well as to confirm, through larger series, if there is really no correlation between the water surface area and the amount of rainfall in the area. Finally, it was found that the remote sensing tools proved to be effective in the analysis of the water surface of the studied area, as well as having a positive potential to contribute to the proper management of surface water resources in a region with a semi-arid climate. © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Meteorologia.

TI  - Deriving The Reservoir Conditions For Better Water Resource Management Using Satellite-Based Earth Observations In The Lower Mekong River Basin
AB  - The Mekong River basin supported a large population and ecosystem with abundant water and nutrient supply. However, the impoundments in the river can substantially alter the flow downstream and its timing. Using limited observations, this study demonstrated an approach to derive dam characteristics, including storage and flow rate, from remote-sensing-based data. Global Reservoir and Lake Monitor (GRLM), River-Lake Hydrology (RLH), and ICESat-GLAS, which generated altimetry from Jason series and inundation areas from Landsat 8, were used to estimate the reservoir surface area and change in storage over time. The inflow simulated by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model from 2008 to 2016 and the reservoir storage change were used in the mass balance equation to calculate outflows for three dams in the basin. Estimated reservoir total storage closely resembled the observed data, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination more than 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. An average decrease of 55\% in outflows was estimated during the wet season and an increase of up to 94\% in the dry season for the Lam Pao. The estimated decrease in outflows during the wet season was 70\% and 60\% for Sirindhorn and Ubol Ratana, respectively, along with a 36\% increase in the dry season for Sirindhorn. Basin-wide demand for evapotranspiration, about 935 mm, implicitly matched with the annual water diversion from 1000 to 2300 million m(3). From the storage-discharge rating curves, minimum storage was also evident in the monsoon season (June-July), and it reached the highest in November. This study demonstrated the utility of remote sensing products to assess the impacts of dams on flows in the Mekong River basin.

TI  - Application Of Sebal And Markov Models For Future Stream Flow Simulation Through Remote Sensing
AB  - Watershed hydrology, including the volumes of stream flow is widely considered to be influenced by global climate change. Traditional studies using the (GWLF) model to estimate stream flows have relied on evapotranspiration cover coefficient (Kc) obtained from published references. Other factors, such as future land-use status and evapotranspiration (ET) change, are usually not considered. This study aims to improve on traditional studies by including remote sensing techniques to estimate the Kc, as well as integrating the SEBAL model, the CGCM1 model, and the Markov model to predict land-use and ET changes. The chosen study area was in the north of Taiwan. The processes include land-use classification using hybrid approach and Landsat-5 TM images, a comparison of stream flow simulations using the GWLF model with two Kc values derived from remote sensing and traditional methods, and finally the prediction of future land-use and Kc parameters for assessing the effect of land-use change and ET change. The results indicated that the study area was classified into seven land-use types with 89.09\% classification accuracy. The stream flows simulated by two estimated Kcs were different, and the simulated stream flows using the remote sensing approach presented more accurate hydrological characteristics than a traditional approach. In addition, the consideration of land-use change and ET change indeed affected the predicted stream flows under climate change conditions. These results imply that the integration of remote sensing, the SEBAL model, the CGCM1 model, and the Markov model is a feasible scheme to predict future land-use, ET change, and stream flow. Therefore, these models will improve future studies of predictions in water resource management and global environmental change.

TI  - Modelling Of Essential Fish Habitat Based On Remote Sensing, Spatial Analysis And Gis
AB  - We review the variety of existing modelling approaches applied to species habitat mapping and we discuss issues arising from the availability and nature of sampled biological data and corresponding ecological and environmental habitat descriptors, as well as the different spatial analysis approaches that are selected according to specific hypotheses. We focus on marine species habitat mapping, presenting an overview of work on modelling fish habitat carried out through a European Communities Policy-Support Action, EnviEFH 'Environmental Approach to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Designation' (2005-2008). The selection of the appropriate habitat model is dataset-specific and the resulting EFH maps are often similar in spite of using different models. Derived EFH maps are based on either environmental ranges (used as minimum and maximum environmental habitat descriptors) or probability of occurrence values. We apply model outputs to regions larger than sampled areas making use of the capacity of satellite data to cover wide areas.

AB  - Environmental concerns are growing about excessive applying nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially in oil palm. Some conventional methods which are used to assess the amount of nutrient in oil palm are time-consuming, expensive, and involve frond destruction. Remote sensing as a non-destructive, affordable, and efficient method is widely used to detect the concentration of chlorophyll (Chl) from canopy plants using several vegetation indices (VIs) because there is an influential relation between the concentration of N in the leaves and canopy Chl content. The objectives of this research are to (i) evaluate and compare the performance of various vegetation indices (VIs) for measuring N status in oil palm canopy using SPOT-7 imagery (AIRBUS Defence \& Space, Ottobrunn, Germany) to (ii) develop a regression formula that can predict the N content using satellite data to (iii) assess the regression formula performance on testing datasets by testing the coefficient of determination between the predicted and measured N contents. SPOT-7 was acquired in a 6-ha oil palm planted area in Pahang, Malaysia. To predict N content, 28 VIs based on the spectral range of SPOT-7 satellite images were evaluated. Several regression models were applied to determine the highest coefficient of determination between VIs and actual N content from leaf sampling. The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) generated the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.93). MTVI1 and triangular VI had the highest second and third coefficient of determination with N content (R-2 = 0.926 and 0.923, respectively). The classification accuracy assessment of the developed model was evaluated using several statistical parameters such as the independent t-test, and p-value. The accuracy assessment of the developed model was more than 77\%.

TI  - Carbon Storage And Sequestration Rates Of Trees Inside And Outside Forests In Great Britain
AB  - Efforts to abate climate change heavily rely on carbon sequestration by trees. However, analyses of tree carbon dynamics often neglect trees outside of forests (TOFs) and spatially detailed information about tree carbon sequestration rates are largely missing. Here we describe a new method which combines remote sensing with forest inventory data from 127 358 sites to first estimate tree age and site productivity, which we then used to estimate carbon storage and sequestration rates for all trees inside and outside forests across Great Britain. Our models estimate carbon storage and sequestration rates with R (2) values of 0.86 and 0.56 (root-mean-square errors of 70 tCO(2)e ha(-1) and 3.4 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)). They also reveal the important finding that 17\% (165.6 MtCO(2)e) of the total carbon storage and 21\% (3.4 MtCO(2)e yr(-1)) of the total carbon sequestration rate of all trees in Great Britain come from TOF, with particularly high contributions in England (24.3\% and 34.1\%), followed by Wales (12.5\% and 17.6\%) and Scotland (2.6\% and 1.8\%). Future estimates of carbon status and fluxes need to account for the significant contributions of TOF because these trees, often found in field margins and hedgerows are potentially an important carbon offset. Our novel approach enables carbon baseline assessments against which changes can be assessed at management relevant scales, improving the means to measure progress towards net zero emissions targets and associated environmental policies.

TI  - Building Visual Green Index: A Measure Of Visual Green Spaces For Urban Building
AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization, balancing the development and conservation of green space is a challenging task for urban planning and urban administrative management. Accurate measurement of green spaces in urban areas is an important source of information when evaluating the effect of urban development on green space. In this study, we used multispectral remote sensing images to extract urban buildings and green areas and developed a Building Visual Greenness Index (BVGI) to estimate the green space views from buildings. Instead of considering a single value for the entire building, BVGI values for each floor above the second floor were calculated to take into account of the dependence of BVGI on the building height. The results show that BVGI can reflect the actual green space view for residents on each floor, and BVGI is a useful index for green space measurement at a community scale. Furthermore, BVGI may provide a virtual visualization index of green space in urban planning and replace the traditional green indexes at a community scale for urban administrators.

TI  - The Cooling Effect Of Plain Afforestation In The Beijing Project And Its Remote Sensing-Based Valuation
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization, the urban heat island effect has exerted a great influence on the lives and productivity of urban residents. Many research has suggested that the cooling effect caused by vegetation and water bodies is an economic way to efficiently and substantially mitigate the urban heat island effects at a local scale. However, because the previous studies mainly concentrated on a limited number of urban parks, the past result might have a large uncertainty. Since plain afforestation was implemented in the Beijing Project from 2012 to 2014, 10,648 forest patches have been constructed, therefore providing a great sample for examining the cooling effects of artificial forests. We analyzed the cooling effects of these artificial forests using the land surface brightness temperature as an indicator of urban heat islands. For this, we used the LANDSAT-8 images of 4 September 2014 and additional information about the originally afforested patches. The artificial forests in this project decreased inbrightness temperature by 1.023°C, despitethe short afforestation period. The latter can be explained by the large young plants that were used for the afforestation, as well as the special implementation mode used. A buffer zone analysis showed that the influence of this cooling effect reached as far as 350m from the edge of the artificial forests. The strongest cooling effect was found within 100m from the forest edges, with a decrease in brightness temperature of 0.392°C.In addition, a zonal analysis showed that the artificial forests had the most significant cooling effects in the Yanqing Basin, with a cooling of 3.519°C. The smallest significant decrease, 0.111°C, was found within the 6th Ring Road. An analysis between different years showed that the landscape pattern of artificial forest patches, as well as wetland protection and construction, were important for establishing the cooling effects. According to a patch size frequency analysis, the small patches had the highest frequency, whereas the middle and small patches covered a large part of the total area. Nevertheless, the large artificial forest patches had a larger significant cooling effect compared with the small ones. According to the primary valuation, the cooling effect of this project had a value as high as 488 million CNY. Approximately 54% of this total value was caused by cooling within the forest patches, whereas cooling within the influential range from the forest patch edges caused approximately 46%.For further afforestation intended for effective mitigation of the urban heat island effects, several factors should receive careful attention. First, large artificial forest patches are preferablein terms of forest patch design. Second, for the configuration of the forest patches, two adjacent forest patches should be between 100 and 500m apart, in order to benefit from the cooling effects of the forest patches influential range. © © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Suitability Of Nasa's Black Marble Daily Nighttime Lights For Population Studies At Varying Spatial And Temporal Scales
AB  - This paper investigates the potential link between changes in NASA's Black Marble VIIRS/NPP Gap-Filled Lunar BRDF-Adjusted Nighttime Lights Daily L3 Global 500 m Linear Lat Lon Grid (VNP46A2) nighttime lights product (NTL) and human dynamics, particularly population counts and changes at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. We conducted analyses in four case studies at varying resolutions to explore the relationship of NTL data for population studies, including demographic research, disaster mitigation and adaptation planning, and infrastructure development. The analyses were conducted using different administrative geographies, including a refugee camp, a subnational region, and a country. We compared changes in population counts, density, migration, and displacement against changes in daily, weekly, monthly, and annual NTL values. Our case study results demonstrate that out-migration does not always lead to a decrease in NTL. We found that rural population decline did not correspond to a decrease in NTL. Despite significant out-migration in many rural areas NTL remained largely unchanged. NTL provided essential information on infrastructure damage in the short-term aftermath of this disaster; however, NTL alone was not correlated to the location of displaced individuals. Through news reports, we were able to corroborate the NTL changes to downtimes of the electrical systems. Monthly NTL averages were highly correlated to population counts, but a pixel-level analysis showed that the changes in NTL were primarily attributed to economic diversification. In summary, NTL is the product of several factors including demographic, environmental, economic, and political forces that shape electricity infrastructure, and we suggest that NTL data must first be parameterized with ancillary ground-level information in order to be effectively applied to population models.

TI  - Road Extraction Through Yangwang-1 Nighttime Light Data: A Case Study In Wenzhou, China
AB  - The extraction of roadways from remote sensing imagery constitutes a pivotal task, with far-reaching implications across diverse domains such as urban planning, management of transportation systems, emergency response initiatives, and environmental monitoring endeavors. Satellite images captured during daytime have customarily served as the primary resource for this extraction process. However, the emergence of Nighttime Light (NTL) remote sensing data introduces an innovative dimension to this arena. The exploration of NTL data for road extraction remains in its nascent stage, and this study seeks to bridge this gap. We present a refined U-Net model (CA U-Net) integrated with Cross-Attention Mechanisms, meticulously designed to extract roads from Yangwang-1 NTL images. This model incorporates several enhancements, thereby improving its proficiency in identifying and delineating road networks. Through extensive experimentation conducted in the urban landscape of Wenzhou City, the model delivers highly accurate results, achieving an F1 score of 84.46%. These outcomes significantly surpass the performance benchmarks set by Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the Optimal Threshold (OT) method. This promising development paves the way towards maximizing the utility of NTL data for comprehensive mapping and analysis of road networks. Furthermore, the findings underscore the potential of utilizing Yangwang-1 data as a reliable source for road extraction and reaffirm the viability of deploying deep learning frameworks for road extraction tasks utilizing NTL data.

TI  - Predict Tree Species Diversity From Gf-2 Satellite Data In A Subtropical Forest Of China
AB  - Objective: In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between remote sensing features that come from GF-2 and species diversity indices for subtropical forest in Gutian Mountain of Zhejiang Province, China. Method: We extracted the reflectance values, spectral indices, texture from GF-2 data. Random forest models were used to select variables and estimate species diversity indices. We compared the texture values that come from different window size to find the best window size for species diversity estimation. Result: Based on the random forest (RF),recursive feature elimination(RFE)was used to find small subsets of features with high discrimination levels on data sets, which provide good performance for species diversity modeling. For the multispectral(MSS)data, the best window size is 3×3, and for the panchromatic (Pan)data, the best window size is 7×7. Both texture features and spectral indices were selected for species diversity modeling and the Carotenoid reflectance index provided the best performance.The determinate coefficient and RMSE for three species diversity are 0.47 and 0.300(Shannon-Wiener diversity index),0.53 and 0.042 (Simpson diversity index),0.61 and 0.051 (Pielou evenness index),respectively. Conclusion: The result demonstrated that the GF-2 data can be used to model tree species diversity effectively. Predictive map derived from the presented method ology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest and facilitate the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies. © 2019, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

TI  - Spectral Optimisation And A Novel Lighting-Design Space Based On Circadian Stimulus
AB  - With the recent advances in photobiology research and light-emitting diode technology, lighting considering circadian effects and the potential health benefits attract much attention. In this study, we demonstrate that the common practice of spectral optimisation of light for high visual efficacy can potentially lead to very inefficient delivery of circadian stimulus, which contributes to the lack of circadian entrainment that is likely to happen in indoor environments with only electric lighting. To optimise spectra of white light-emitting diodes for circadian efficacy, a four-component colour-mixing method with explicit analytical solutions is introduced. Energy-saving up to 29% is achieved at a target circadian stimulus of 0.35, by switching from the traditional maximum-visual-efficacy strategy to a maximum-circadian-efficacy strategy. Moreover, we propose a framework of a novel lighting-design space which allows practitioners to explore the possible combinations of circadian stimulus, visual illuminance and colour temperature. Solutions are provided for scenarios where activation of the circadian system should be avoided while a reasonable visual brightness appearance is maintained. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2017.

TI  - Monitoring Matang's Mangroves In Peninsular Malaysia Through Earth Observations: A Globally Relevant Approach
AB  - Expansion of rotational timber harvesting of mangroves is set to increase, particularly given greater recognition of the economic, societal and environmental benefits. Generic and standardized procedures for monitoring mangroves are, therefore, needed to ensure their long-term sustainable utilisation. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), Perak State, Peninsular Malaysia, thematic and continuous environmental descriptors with defined codes or units, including lifeform, forest age (years), canopy cover (\%), above-ground biomass (Mg ha(-1)) and relative amounts of woody debris (\%), were retrieved from time-series data from spaceborne optical and single/dual polarimetric and interferometric RADAR. These were then combined for multiple points in time to generate land cover and evidence-based change maps according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and using the framework of the Earth Observation Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM). Change maps were based on a pre-defined taxonomy, with focus on clear cutting and regrowth. Uncertainties surrounding the land cover and change maps were based on those determined for the environmental descriptors used for their generation and through comparison with independent retrieval from other EO data sources. For the MMFR and also for other mangroves worldwide where harvesting is occurring or being considered, a new approach and opportunity for supporting management of mangroves is presented, which has application for future planning of mangrove resources.

TI  - Transnationalism And The Sôka Gakkai: Perspective And Representation Outside And Inside Japan
AB  - SÃka Gakkai, “Value Creation Society,” was founded in Japan in 1930 and grew in post-war society where poverty and diseases caused a massive swell in its ranks. Fifteen years after his first travel to North America and Brazil, where he met followers, mostly from Japanese diaspora, Daisaku Ikeda, actual president of SÃka Gakkai, founded the Nichiren Shoshu America in 1975 (renamed SÃka Gakkai International in 1991). SGI claimed in 2013 a membership of about 12 million in 192 countries. By using the diasporic network I make a first assessment that shows how SÃka Gakkai, a missionary religion, spread outside Japan and became the most successful Japanese new religious movements among non-Asian citizens. I also analyze how New Religions such as Agonsh (Agama Stra Sect), or KÃfuku no Kagaku (Happy Science) which was founded at the end of the 1970s in Japan, integrated SÃka Gakkai’s path as a model of success to influence their own politics. Since the end of the twentieth century, Agonsh has extended its activities abroad to pray for World Peace and performed numerous Goma ceremonies (fire rite to liberate souls of Dead) outside Japan. The places of ceremonies are tied to its importance during World War 2, such as the Goma held at Auschwitz in 2006 and Khabarovsk (Siberia) in 2007 where many Japanese soldiers are buried. All these rituals were broadcast in Japan via satellite. The recent acceleration of Goma’s performances conducted out of Japan (Auschwitz 2006, Khabarovsk 2007, Jerusalem 2008, Guadalcanal 2009, Pacific Ocean 2012), emphasize the eagerness of Agonsh to develop the movement inside Japan rather than overseas. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

TI  - Wetland Restoration Prioritizing, A Tool To Reduce Negative Effects Of Drought; An Application Of Multicriteria-Spatial Decision Support System (Mc-Sdss)
AB  - In recent years, large parts of arid and semi-arid areas in the world are dealing with water restrictions. In these areas, wetlands provide habitats for migratory birds and have a critical role in socio-ecological systems. Generally, in these areas, changing water-use patterns because of land-use change and water limitation because of climate change have led to the loss of wide areas of wetlands. Wetland restoration is suggested to restore the functions and values of wetlands that have been destroyed or affected by stresses. In this paper, a new application of wetland restoration prioritizing is introduced; restoration prioritizing to reduce the negative effects of drought. In this method, areas with the highest priority for restoration will be determined in a wetland destroyed because of water limitations. Multicriteria-spatial decision support system (MC-SDSS) was used to plan a scheme for Hamun wetlands restoration prioritizing in order to reduce the negative effects of drought and to restore the wetlands. This prioritization-determined areas that are valuable for Long-term water conservation, reduce the negative effects of dust storms and conserve water bird's habitats. This method was used in a wetland that is the only water resource in the middle of a wide arid plain. Because of water limitation, it is not possible to restore the hole wetland; therefore, different parts of this wetland were prioritized for restoration. Based on the results, it is possible to produce a model to determine which priority can be restored in each amount of water volume. In this way, it becomes clear for decision-makers to select areas for restoration in different volumes of water. The result of this study shows that since MC-SDSS decreases conflicts between alternatives in a decision-making process and uses their spatial situation, it is a preferred method to balance among conflicting goals. Furthermore, because spatial data are the most important parts of MC-SDSS, this paper shows the ability of remote sensing to be used in MC-SDSS method. It seems that in the future; remote sensing will have the most important role in MC-SDSS.

TI  - Triple Collocation Of Ground-, Satellite- And Land Surface Model-Based Surface Soil Moisture Products In Oklahoma-Part I: Individual Product Assessment
AB  - Improvements in soil moisture observations and modeling play a vital role in drought, water resources, flooding, and landslide management and forecasting. However, the lack of multisensor products that integrate different spatial scales (i.e., from 1 m(2) to 10(2) km(2)) is a pressing need in the management and forecasting chain. Up to date, surface soil moisture estimates could be obtained through three primary approaches: (1) in situ measurements and their interpolations, (2) remote sensing observations, and (3) land surface model (LSM) outputs. Each source of soil moisture has its own spatiotemporal resolution, strengths, and weaknesses. Therefore, their correct interpretation and application require an in-depth understanding of their accuracy and appropriateness. In this study, we explore the utility of the triple collocation (TC) method for an independent assessment of three soil moisture products to characterize their uncertainty structures and make recommendations toward a potential product merge. The state of Oklahoma is an ideal domain to test the hypotheses of this work because of the presence of marked west-to-east gradients in climate, vegetation, and soils. The three target soil moisture products include (1) the remotely sensed microwave soil moisture active passive (SMAP) L3\_SM\_P\_E (9 km, daily), (2) the physically based LSM estimates from NLDAS\_NOAH0125\_H (1/8 degrees, hourly; Noah), and (3) the Oklahoma Mesonet ground sensor network (point, 30 min). The product assessment was conducted from April 2015 to July 2019. The results indicate that, in general, Mesonet and Noah are the most reliable products, although their performance varies geographically and by land cover type, reflecting the main spatiotemporal characteristics and scope of each product. Specifically, Mesonet provides the best estimates of volumetric soil moisture with a mean Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.805, followed by Noah with 0.747. However, Noah represents the true soil moisture variation better than the interpolated Mesonet product on the mesoscale, with an averaged RMSE of 0.026 m(3) forward slash m(3). Over different land cover types, Mesonet had the best performance in shrub/scrub, herbaceous, hay/pasture, and cultivated crops with an average correlation coefficient of 0.79, while Noah achieved the best performance in evergreen, mixed, and deciduous forests, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.74. The period-integrated TC intercomparison results over nine climate divisions indicated that Noah outperformed in the central, northeast, and east-central regions. TC provides not only a new perspective for comparatively assessing multisource soil moisture products but also a basis for objective data merging to capitalize on the strengths of multisensor, multiplatform soil moisture products.

TI  - Analysis Of Forty Years Long Changes In Coastal Land Use And Land Cover Of The Yellow Sea: The Gains Or Losses In Ecosystem Services
AB  - The drastic land cover change and its impacts in the Yellow Sea have long been significant issues in terms of coastal vulnerabilities, but holistic data analysis is limited. The present study first reports 40 years long geographical changes of the Yellow Sea coasts including all three neighboring countries of China, North Korea, and South Korea. We delineated tidal flats by analysis of Landsat series satellite imageries (662 scenes) between 1981 and 2016. A total area of the Yellow Sea tidal flats has been considerably reducing for the past 36 years, from ∼10,500 km2 (1980s) to ∼6700 km2 (2010s), say ∼1% annual loss. A majority loss of tidal flats was mainly due to the grand reclamations that conducted in almost entire coast of the Yellow Sea, particularly concentrated in the 1990s-2000s. Coastal reclaimed area during the past four decades reached ∼9700 km2, including ongoing and planned projects, which corresponds to over half the area of precedent natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea. The potential carbon stocks in the eight representative regions with large scale reclamation indicated significant loss in carbon sink capacity in the South Korea's coast (∼99%), while evidenced a lesser loss from the China's coast (∼31%). It was noteworthy that the progradation of tidal flats after the reclamation in China's coast significantly reduced the loss of carbon sequestration. According to the ecosystem services valuation for the Yellow Sea, a total loss was estimated as ∼8 billion USD yr−1 with relatively high proportional loss (up to 25%) of climate regulating services (viz., carbon sequestration). Overall, huge losses in ecosystem services being provided by the Yellow Sea natural tidal flats need immediate action to prevent or at least alleviate accelerating ecological deteriorations. Finally, future conservative policy direction on coastal wetlands management has been proposed towards enhancement of marine ecosystem services. “About half of natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea disappeared primarily due to reclamation for the last 40 years, accordingly coastal carbon stocks were drastically reduced.” © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A Literature Survey Of Mr-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation With Missing Modalities
AB  - Multimodal MR brain tumor segmentation is one of the hottest issues in the community of medical image processing. However, acquiring the complete set of MR modalities is not always possible in clinical practice, due to the acquisition protocols, image corruption, scanner availability, scanning cost or allergies to certain contrast materials. The missing information can cause some restraints to brain tumor diagnosis, monitoring, treatment planning and prognosis. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop brain tumor segmentation methods to address the missing modalities problem. Based on the recent advancements, in this review, we provide a detailed analysis of the missing modality issue in MR-based brain tumor segmentation. First, we briefly introduce the biomedical background concerning brain tumor, MR imaging techniques, and the current challenges in brain tumor segmentation. Then, we provide a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art methods with five categories, namely, image synthesis-based method, latent feature space-based model, multi-source correlation -based method, knowledge distillation-based method, and domain adaptation-based method. In addition, the principles, architectures, benefits and limitations are elaborated in each method. Following that, the corresponding datasets and widely used evaluation metrics are described. Finally, we analyze the current challenges and provide a prospect for future development trends. This review aims to provide readers with a thorough knowledge of the recent contributions in the field of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities and suggest potential future directions.

TI  - Phylogeography And Demographic Inference Of The Endangered Sei Whale, With Implications For Conservation
AB  - The sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) presents a disjointed geographic distribution. Significant genetic divergence between sei whales from the North Atlantic (NA) and North Pacific (NP) have been recorded; however, limited samples from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) have precluded a global analysis. The largest recorded mass mortality event occurred in Golfo de Penas, southern Chile, providing a primary source of SH samples. A global mitochondrial DNA phylogeographic study was undertaken including 111 SH samples (98 from Golfo de Penas), and new sequences from the NP. A marked phylogeographic structure was observed between the three ocean basins' populations, with the highest phi(ST) values between NA-NP and NA-SH, and a lower but still significant value between SH-NP. This structure, and the haplotype distribution pattern, suggest a more recent separation between SH-NP and an absence of recurrent gene flow among all three populations. Only one potential migratory event was detected from SH to NA. These results support an ongoing phylogeographic differentiation between all populations, highlighting the identity of each and the importance of independent management. Therefore, each population should represent a separate management unit, which is important in the development of conservation strategies. Demographic analyses detected a recent reduction of population size in the SH and NA, but not in the NP. For all populations, estimated effective population sizes were higher than estimated census sizes. This suggests that most of the genetic diversity of pre-whaling populations is still retained; however, continued reduction in population sizes could lead to future loss of genetic diversity. This study highlights the necessity of local protection and systematic monitoring of the Golfo de Penas sei whale population. In such a remote area the use of remote sensing techniques could be a cost-effective option for evaluating the threat, periodicity and magnitude of mortalities and their effect on the local whale population. The integration of genetic and demographic approaches improves the understanding of the dynamics of populations, which is particularly useful in endangered species.

TI  - Computer Model Of Tsunami Vulnerability Using Machine Learning And Multispectral Satellite Imagery
AB  - This research aims to develop a tsunami vulnerability assessment model on land use and land cover using information on NDVI, NDWI, MDWI, MSAVI, and NDBI extracted from sentinel 2 A and ASTER satellite images. The optimization model using algorithms LASSO and linear regression. The validation test is MSE, ME, RMSE and MAE which show that the linear regression has a higher accuracy than the LASSO. The NDWI interpolation values are 0.00-(-0.35) and MNDWI interpolation values are 0.00-(-0.40) which are interpreted as the presence of water surfaces along a coast. MSAVI are values (-0.20)-(-0.35) which are interpreted as the presence of no vegetation. The NDBI interpolation values are values 0.15-0.20 which are interpreted as the presence of built-up lands with social and economic activities. While the NDVI interpolation values are 0.20-0.30 which are interpreted as the presence of vegetation densities, biomass growths from the photosynthesis process, and moderate to low levels of vegetation health. The digital elevation model ASTER analysis shows that all areas with high socioeconomic activities, low NDVI, high NDWI/MDWI, high MSAVI and high NDBI are in areas with low elevation (<10 meters) so they have a high vulnerability to tsunami waves. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

TI  - An Updated Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis Of Home-Based Exercise Programs For Individuals With Intermittent Claudication
AB  - Objective: Supervised exercise programs (SEP) are effective for improving walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) but provision and uptake rates are suboptimal. Access to such programs has also been halted by the Coronavirus pandemic. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence for home-based exercise programs (HEP). Methods: This review was conducted in according with the published protocol and PRISMA guidance. Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for terms relating to HEP and IC. Randomized and nonrandomized trials that compared HEP with SEP, basic exercise advice, or no exercise controls for IC were included. A narrative synthesis was provided for all studies and meta-analyses conducted using data from randomized trials. The primary outcome was maximal walking distance. Subgroup analyses were performed to consider the effect of monitoring. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence via GRADE. Results: We included 23 studies with 1907 participants. Considering the narrative review, HEPs were inferior to SEPs which was reflected in the meta-analysis (mean distance [MD], 139 m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 45-232 m; P = .004; very low quality of evidence). Monitoring was an important component, because HEPs adopting this strategy were equivalent to SEPs (MD, 8 m; 95% CI, –81 to 97; P = .86; moderate quality of evidence). For HEPs vs basic exercise advice, narrative review suggested HEPs can be superior, although not always significantly so. For HEPs vs no exercise controls, narrative review and meta-analysis suggested HEPs were potentially superior (MD, 136 m; 95% CI, –2 to 273 m; P = .05; very low quality of evidence). Monitoring was also a key element in these comparisons. Other elements such as appropriate frequency (≥3× a week), intensity (to moderate-maximum pain), duration (20 progressing to 60 minutes) and type (walking) of exercise were important, as was education, self-regulation, goal setting, feedback, and action planning. Conclusions: When SEPs are unavailable, HEPs are recommended. However, to elicit maximum benefit they should be structured, incorporating all elements of our evidence-based recommendations. © 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery

TI  - Beharrung Und Sozialer Wandel:Deutsche Beiträge Zur Ländlichen Soziologie In Der ‘Sociologia Ruralis’ (1960–1970)
AB  - BEHARRUNG UND SOZIALER WANDEL Dieser Beitrag stellt eine Inhaltsanalyse der deutschen Beiträge (ausschließlich der schwe12erischen und österreichischen) dar, die zwischen 1960 und 1970 in der ‘Sociologia Ruralis’ (SR) veröffentlicht worden sind. Es wurde versucht, unter dem Blickwinkel der Land ‐ Stadt ‐Soziologie soziologisch relevante Aussagen herauszuarbeiten und zu ordnen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß die in Deutschland bestehende Kluft zwischen Grundlagen‐ und Auftragsforschung sich auch auf die SR auswirkt: Sie ist in erster Linie ein Publikationsorgan der universityätsgebundenen Agrarsoziologen, während sich die außeruniversitären Wissenschaftler fast völlig aus der Diskussion zurückgezogen haben. Des weiteren konnte festgestellt werden, daß das Land ‐Stadt ‐ Kontinuum in der Regel abgelehnt wird. Alle Versuche, vielschichtige und komplexe Vorgänge wie Struktur‐ und Funktions‐wandlungen ländlicher Gebiete in einspurige Konzepte zu fassen, erwiesen sich als unzulässige Vereinfachungen. Die Unterschiede zwischen Stadt und Land verschwinden mehr und mehr; es entstehen neue Sozialformen, in welche Elemente beider Lebensbereiche eingehen. Die Entwicklung neuer spezieller Soziologien, die sich unter übergeordneten Aspekten mit den spezifischen Problemen der Regionen, der Verflechtungsbereiche, der Landnutzung und der Landwirtschaft befassen, ist erforderlich. Mit der Entwicklung von Sozialtechnologien kann die ländliche Soziologie zu einer adäquaten Politik‐Beratung vordringen. Allerdings verpflichtet die Unbestimmtheit der Grenze zwischen Wertung und Wertfreiheit den ländlichen Soziologen zur ständigen Reflexion über die Folgen seiner Arbeit. Für die sich abzeichnenden theoretischen Konzepte ‐ den interdisziplinären und den interkulturellen Ansatz ‐ stehen die empirischen Studien der deutschen ländlichen Soziologie noch aus. STATUS QUO AND SOCIAL CHANGE This article sets out to analyse the contents of the papers contributed between 1960 and 1970 to Sociologia Ruralis (SR) by German authors (with the exclusion of Swiss and Austrian). It has attempted to deduct and order sociologically relevant hypotheses from the material, starting out from the difference between rural and urban. It can be shown that the gap between basic and applied research which exists in Western Germany also comes to the fore in SR: it is first and foremost a medium for rural sociologists attached to universities, while their colleagues who do not work in universities have withdrawn almost entirely from the discussion. It can also be shown that in general the rural‐urban continuum is rejected. All attempts to comprehend multidimensional and complex changes in the structure and function of rural areas in terms of unidimensional concepts have turned out to be inadmissible simplifications. The distinctions between city and country are disappearing; new social forms appear which combine elements from both social spheres. The development is leading to new special sociologies which would deal with specific problems of the region, of economic and social integration, of land use and the agricultural economy. With the development of social technologies, rural sociology can contribute to an adequate formulation of policy. However, the uncertain boundary between valuation and value‐freedom obliges the rural sociologist to reflect at all times on the consequences of his labour. The theoretical concepts which come to the fore ‐ in the interdisciplinary and inter‐cultural appoaches ‐ have not yet been subject to empirical research by German rural sociology. STATU QUO ET CHANGEMENT SOCIAL Cet article a pour objet l'analyse des articles d'auteurs allemands* parus entre 1960 et 1970, dans Sociologia Ruralis. Il constitue une tentative de deduction et d'élaboration d'hypothèses sociologiques à partir des études faites sur la différence entre le rural et l'urbain. Il ressort de cette analyse que le fossé qui sépare les recherches fondamentales et appliquees, en R.F.A., est également présent dans la répartition des articles publicés par Sociologia Ruralis. Le premier type de recherche est l'apanage de sociologues ruraux universitaires alors que ceux qui se préoccupent du second type de recherches, sont étrangers à cette institution et sont quasiment absents du débat. Le concept de continuum «rural‐urbain« est généralement rejeté par les auteurs. Toute tentative pour appréhender les transformations multidimensionnelles et complexes des structures et des fonctions des zones rurales grâce a des concepts unidimensionnels, considérée comme une simplification abusive, est écartée. La distinction villecampagne disparak alors qu'apparaissent de nouvelles formes sociales combinant des éléments de l'un et de l'autre type. Le développement se réalise de telle manière que de nouveaux domaines s'ouvrent à la sociologie: problèmes régionaux spécifiques, intégration sociale et économique, utilisation des sols et économie rurale. Avec le développement des techniques sociales, la sociologie peut contribuer a la formulation de politiques adéquates. Cependant, l'incertitude de la frontière entre l' évaluation et l'abstention de jugements de valeur oblige le sociologue rural a se livrer a une critique permanente des consédquences de son travail. Les concepts théoriques mis en lumière dans les recherches interdisciplinaires n'ont pas encore fait l'objet d'une recherche empirique de la part des sociologues ruraux allemands.

TI  - Research And Prospect Of Intellectualized Air Traffic Management Technology
AB  - Air transport plays an important role in promoting the world economy and social development. The statistics of international civil aviation organization show that global air traffic is approximately doubled every fifteen years, and the existing air traffic navigation system is close to saturation. The existing air traffic management (ATM) systems automatically acquire and process air traffic control information for air traffic controller, through surveillance data fusion, flight data processing, meteorology and aeronautical information processing and safety nets processing. However, the limited decision-making support ability leads to the low intelligent degree of ATM system, which can't meet the need of the future development of ATM. In order to adapt to the rapid development of aviation industry in the future, some countries and organizations are committed to carrying out new technologies to solve the problems of air traffic safety, airspace congestion and flight delays. In 2004, the EU proposed the "Single European Sky ATM Research(SESAR)" program and proposed tore-plan European airspace to meet air traffic demand and improve the efficiency of ATM system. The key technologies of the program include four key areas of ATM: efficient airport operations, advanced air traffic services, optimized air traffic network services and reliable ATC infrastructure. In 2005, the United States proposed the next generation air transportation system(NEXTGEN), including ADS-B, data communication, en route automation modernization, terminal automation modernization and replacement, NAS voice system and system wide information management. In 2012, ICAO launched the aviation system block upgrade plan (ASBU). The ASBU involved four aviation performance improvement areas, including airport operations, globally interoperable systems and data, optimum capacity and flexible flights and efficient flight path. Each area consists of multiple threads and distributed in four blocks according to the implementation stage. CAAC is also implementing or planning a large number of ASBU modules to cope with the rapid development of Chinese civil aviation. The existing ATM system and its future planning mainly focus on the infrastructure construction, without enough intelligent applications. In recent years, with the support of deep learning, high performance computing and big data, artificial intelligence technology has been rapidly used in various fields. Especially, technologies of computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing have made breakthrough and rapid industrialization. Artificial intelligence, represented by deep learning, emphasizes that judgment and decision-making based on a large number of prior knowledge, which is consistent with the decision-making process of ATM. Therefore, artificial intelligence technology can promote the development of air traffic control key technologies, improve safety and the efficiency of air traffic control and reduce the workload of air traffic controller. The great benefit of the rapid development of artificial intelligence makes the intellectualized ATM a necessity. In this paper, the concept of intellectualized ATM and the overall framework of intellectualized ATM system were presented. The overall framework of intellectualized ATM includes the perception layer, network layer, platform layer, application layer and visual layer. All kinds of communication, navigation, surveillance, weather, wireless, video capture, radio frequency identification and other facilities of the perception layer offer the infrastructures for ATM. The network layer transmits information by using special line network, satellite communication network, Internet, mobile network and so on. The platform layer achieves information storage, sharing and mining by using of SWIM, cloud computing, intelligent big data mining. Application layer studies the application of artificial intelligence technology in air traffic control, airspace management, air traffic flow management, flight service, general aviation and unman ed aerial vehicle. The visual layer provides efficient and intelligent interaction through the portal, virtual visualization, intelligent UI and mobile applications. The research direction of intellectualized ATM includes intelligent ATM data processing, intelligent decision-making, air traffic control speech recognition and air traffic control robot. The intelligent ATM data processing involves various kinds of ATM data acquisition, processing, transmission, interaction and intelligent mining. Intelligent decision-making focuses on intelligent conflict management, intelligent air traffic flow management, intelligent planning and management, intelligent AMAN and DMAN, intelligent airport operation, etc. In view of the important role of ground-to-air communication in air traffic control, the intelligent simulation pilot and air traffic control safety monitoring based on automatic speech recognition should be studied. The intellectualized ATM system has the capabilities of air traffic control perception, planning, reasoning and action based on artificial intelligence. Thus, the overall framework and key technologies provide the theoretical basis and technical support for the development of intellectualized ATM system. © 2018, Advanced Engineering Sciences.

TI  - Identifying And Quantifying Benefits Of Meteorological Satellites
AB  - The Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) provides an international forum for the exchange of technical information on geostationary and polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems. In 2013, the CMGS established the Socioeconomic Benefits Tiger Team (SETT) to develop a credible methodology and common terminology for articulating the socioeconomic benefits of satellite observing systems, and to explore the most effective ways to communicate the benefits to decision makers and stakeholders. As part of its first years' activities, the SETT gathered examples of socioeconomic studies across all member organizations. This article describes key elements of these studies, and identified eight key themes that are presented. We welcome additional collaborations to identify opportunities to incorporate socioeconomic best practices, integrate these into additional or subsequent phases of work on new instruments and satellites, and develop recommendations for the way forward for the broader meteorological community.

TI  - Mapping The Value Of National Forest Landscapes For Ecosystem Service Provision
AB  - Natural landscapes provide ecosystem services that are critical to human health and society. However, as landscapes are threatened by urban development, climate change, intensive agriculture, and altered fire regimes, this negatively affects the condition of natural ecosystems and reduces the provision of these services for which there may not be viable alternatives. We report on a project to map the value of national forest lands in southern California for ecosystem service provision. Our focus is on quantifying five types of ecosystem services, water runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment erosion retention, carbon storage, and biodiversity, across an area that encompasses the four southern national forests-the Angeles, Los Padres, San Bernardino, and Cleveland. We first develop environmentally and climatically driven ecological units as a practical way to summarize information on services for resource managers. Second, we map the spatial distribution of the five services under current climate conditions and assess the spatial concordance between the five services. Third, using a conceptually straightforward approach, we prioritize the ecological units that provide the highest amount of each service and identify hotspots of ecosystem services where ecological units contain multiple services. By providing results to resource managers and the means to access and query the data, information can be used to guide decision making (e. g., prioritizing areas for conservation and restoration activities), assess the impacts of proposed activities (e. g., the impact of fuel management on ecosystem service provision), provide estimates of the value of chaparral shrublands for fire damage assessments, and help secure the long-term provision of ecosystem services across the landscape. The maps and data generated in this project provide the foundation for the next step that is calculating the economic value of these services.

TI  - Optimal Ranges Of Social-Environmental Drivers And Their Impacts On Vegetation Dynamics In Kazakhstan
AB  - Kazakhstan is part of the Eurasian Steppes, the world's largest contiguous grassland system. Kazakh grassland systems are largely understudied despite being historically important for agropastoral practices. These grasslands are considered vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and climatic variability. Few studies have examined vegetation dynamics in Central Asia owing to the complex impacts of moisture, climatic and anthropogenic forcings. A comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal changes of vegetation and its driving factors will help elucidate the causes of grassland degradation. Here, we investigated the individual and pairwise interactive influences of various social-environmental system (SES) drivers on greenness dynamics in Kazakhstan. We sought to examine whether there is a relationship between peak season greenness and its drivers – spring drought, preceding winter freeze-thaw cycles, percent snow cover and snow depth – for Kazakhstan during 2000–2016. As hypothesized, snow depth and spring drought accounted for 60 % and 52 % of the variance in the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in Kazakhstan. The freeze-thaw process accounted for 50 % of NDVI variance across the country. In addition, continuous thawing during the winter increased vegetation greenness. We also found that moisture and topographic factors impacted NDVI more significantly than socioeconomic factors. However, the impacts of socioeconomic drivers on vegetation growth were amplified when they interacted with environmental drivers. Terrain slope and soil moisture had the highest q-values or power of determinant, accounting for ~70 % of the variance in NDVI across the country. Socioeconomic drivers, such as crop production (59 %), population density (48 %), and livestock density (26 %), had significant impacts on vegetation dynamics in Kazakhstan. We found that most of the pairwise interactive influences of the drivers exhibited bi-factor enhancement, and the interaction between soil moisture and elevation was the largest (q = 0.92). Our study revealed the optimal ranges and tipping points of SES drivers and quantified the impacts of various driving factors on NDVI. These findings can help us identify the factors causing grassland degradation and provide a scientific basis for ecological protection in semiarid regions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Geological And Geomorphological Controls On Groundwater Occurrence In A Hard Rock Region
AB  - Remote sensing and GIS tools have broadly helped hydrogeologists to delineate the groundwater prospective zones for watershed development and management. The origin, movement and existence of groundwater depends on several factors such as slope, drainage density, land use, geology, lineament density and geomorphology. Based on these, the mapping and identification of groundwater potential zones were carried out in a part of Nalgonda district, Telangana, India. The regions were categorised as high, moderate and low groundwater potential, and they were validated with the groundwater levels and yield of wells located in the corresponding zones. Extensive possibility for watershed development is possible in 41 \% of the total 724 km(2) and 46 \% of the area offers moderate options. Any groundwater management project implemented in these favourable areas will bring maximum benefit. Similar studies should be considered necessary before designing a water resource development activity as it will reduce the cost on detailed field visits which are time-consuming.

TI  - Transformed Wetlands And Urban Resilience: A Case Study From Bellanwila – Attidiya Wetland Sanctuary, Sri Lanka
AB  - Urbanization is a major issue that threatens natural habitats. However, carefully planned anthropogenic activities give the opportunity to transform urban natural habitats to offer new services to cities. In this study, we assessed the impact of land-use conversions on the spatial status of Bellanwila-Attidiya wetland sanctuary in the Colombo district, Sri Lanka. The Bellanwila-Attidiya wetland provides many ecosystem services but is highly vulnerable to the rapid land use and land cover changes that comes with urbanization. Multi-temporal remote sensing images were analyzed for the years 2005, 2009, and 2015 to study the changes in land use/land cover features of the wetland. The social perception of the ecosystem services was assessed by conducting semi-structured interviews with the residents. During the study period, parts of the wetland had been transformed into residential areas (10.1%) and open water systems (8.6%). Urban expansion and the construction of a storm water management system were found to be the main causes for these changes. The community perception revealed that the wetland has deteriorated, and that the ecosystem services had been altered due to the land use/land cover changes. The anthropogenic transformation of part of the wetland into a flood retention area and the addition of infrastructure for recreational purposes have added value to the wetland complex and therefore opportunities for new ecosystem services have emerged. Our findings shed light on the need for inclusive urban planning mainstreaming community perceptions. It also highlights the benefits of transforming urban spaces into anthropogenic landscapes that blends with nature to offer ecosystem services and enhance community resilience. © 2022, Russian Geographical Society.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Assessment Of Mining Severity Within Buffer Zones Of Osun River: Implications For Drinking Water Quality, Biodiversity Protection, And Status As Unesco World Heritage Site
AB  - Osun River, a UNESCO heritage site is currently under threat to unregulated mining activity along its course. Through remote sensing techniques, this study aimed to evaluate mining severity (number and size of mine pits) which was acquired and used to quantify landscape changes and degradation in water quality (turbidity) along the river. Studies were carried out using data for years 2020-2022 covering 2-km and 5-km buffer areas of the river's watershed. High-resolution Google Earth imagery and Landsat 8 imagery (OLI) were used for land-use land-cover assessment and computation of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) respectively. The mining severity assessment for 2022 revealed a total of 32 mining pits within the 5-km buffer zone, where 21 mining pits (65.63\%) of the total mining activities occurred within the 2-km buffer zone. The severity assessment in terms of both the number of mines and the land area covered revealed an extensive physical mining activity, with severe impacts on surface water quality. The predominantly irregular shapes of the mine pits, indicated by the mean perimeter-to-area ratio ((X) over bar =0.22), linear regression (y = 0.1351x + 0.6102), and coefficient of determination (R-2=0.88), portend challenges for post-mining reclamation, including erosion control and terrain stabilization. The declining trend in the upper limit NDWI values over the 3 years, 2020, 2021, and 2022 (0.053, 0.017, and -0.084476 respectively), indicates a significant reduction in water quality, plausibly associated with the heightened mining activity within the 2-km buffer areas of the river. The escalating habitat degradation and imminent effects on drinking water quality and biodiversity health underscore the pressing implications of unchecked mining, eroding the ecological and cultural significance of the Osun-Oshogbo Sacred Grove, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Urgent governmental action is crucial to enforce mining regulations, curbing these threats, and preserving the site's ecological and cultural importance.

TI  - Tracking Small-Scale Tropical Forest Disturbances: Fusing The Landsat And Sentinel-2 Data Record
AB  - Information on forest disturbance is crucial for tropical forest management and global carbon cycle analysis. The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fast-growing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016–2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016–2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail. In addition, by fusing downscaled fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images, it was possible to produce state-of-the-art forest disturbance maps with OA values more than 87% and 96% for the small and large study areas, and detected 11% to 21% more disturbed areas than either the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-7/8 time-series alone. We found that 1.42% of the disturbed areas indentified during 2016–2019 experienced multiple forest disturbances. The method has great potential to enhance work undertaken in relation to major policies such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programmes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Land Cover And Land Use Change In The Italian Central Apennines: A Comparison Of Assessment Methods
AB  - Analyses of land-use cover changes (LUCC) are fundamental to the understanding of numerous social, economical and environmental problems and can be carried out rapidly, using either cartographic or census data. However, the trends of the two methods differ in direction and quantity. For this study, a historical and a recent remote sensing-derived map were homogenized to reduce misleading changes and to assess spatial aggregation errors. This was carried out by means of a data integration procedure based on landscape metrics, allowing cartographic and census trends to be compared. Discrepancies between data were thus highlighted, both in absolute surface value and in evolution. The methodology presented, and the results obtained, Could be employed to evaluate and improve LUCC analyses aimed at assessing landscape identity, both in the case of analyses based only on LU census data, or of those based only on LC cartographic data. This could lead to benefits for both biodiversity conservation and environmental planning on a large scale. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global Urban Land Expansion Tends To Be Slope Climbing: A Remotely Sensed Nighttime Light Approach
AB  - The slope climbing of urban land expansion (SE) has become an increasingly prevalent phenomenon, and it has resulted in unique characteristics in terms of urban form, landscape, and governance with challenges for sustainable urban development worldwide. However, relatively little concern has been given to the SE with a long time series worldwide. On the basis of urban entities extracted from Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite-like (SNPP-VIIRS-like) data, we attempted to quantify and evaluate global SE with the help of slope spectrum analysis from different scales (e.g., global, continental, national, and city scales) during the period of 2000-2020. Our study proves that urban entities not only identify physical scopes but also reflect the intensity differences of socioeconomic development, which can provide an accurate approach to evaluate the SE. We found that global urban entities increased from 157,733 km(2) in 2000 to 470,632 km(2) in 2020, representing a 1.98-fold increase. The global average slope of urban entities was on an upward trend, from 0.85 degrees by 2000 to 0.96 degrees by 2020, an increase of about 0.11 degrees. Asia, Africa, and South America have experienced an evident SE process, while North America has exhibited a slow SE trend. A remarkable phenomenon has been found in China, where rapid SE has occurred due to the country's unprecedented urbanization process. The change value of the upper limit slope of urban land and the average slope climbing index of urban land have also experienced a volatile growth trend at global, continental, national, and city scales. Our study suggests that sustainable urban development should take the SE phenomenon into considerations, and that reasonable governance policies and strategies should be formulated to address its potential impacts.

TI  - Construction And Application Of A Refined Model For The Optimal Allocation Of Water Resources — Taking Guantao County, China As An Example
AB  - The traditional optimal allocation of water resources mostly focuses on the allocation of different water supply sources to various types of water users in life, production, and ecology, and cannot reflect the differences in time and space of a certain type of water users. Therefore, this paper constructs a refined model for the optimal allocation of water resources, and further explores the optimal allocation of water resources with multiple water sources, multiple users, and multiple objectives. The main steps of the model construction are: (1) Regional gridding. The planting structure map and land use type map of the same resolution in the study area are selected and superimposed on them, the application attributes of each cell can be directly obtained. (2) Water demand gridding. On the basis of gridding in the study area, according to the application attributes of each cell, the quota method is used to predict the water demand of each cell. Then the water demand forecast result for the entire research area is obtained. (3) Water supply gridding. It is possible to reflect the types of water supply sources that a certain or a certain type of cell can accept, as well as the types of water supply sources that can be supplied by a certain type of water supply sources, by determining the types of water supply sources in the research area. The supply ranges that various water supply sources can reach, followed by the completion of the water supply grid. (4) According to the results of water demand gridding and water supply gridding, the water demand of each cell and the corresponding water supply source and water supply topological relationship are established, and the objective function is to minimize water shortage and maximize economic benefits to build a refined model for the optimal allocation of water resources.(5) The particle swarm algorithm is introduced to solve it, and the Pareto optimal solutions is obtained to determine the optimal water distribution for each cell. (6) Taking Guantao County, China as an example, the model was applied. In terms of minimum water shortage, the total water demand in Guantao County is predicted to be 118.8719 million m3 in the planning year (P = 50 %), while the total water supply is 125.2818 million m3. The water supply can meet the demand for water. In terms of financial advantages, the planned level of water Annual economic benefits will amount to 4.0865 million yuan. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Quantifying The Contribution Of Industrial Zones To Urban Heat Islands: Relevance And Direct Impact
AB  - Industrial production activities are an important source of urban heat emissions. Quantifying the contribution of industrial zones to urban heat islands (UHIs) is crucial for urban planning and management. However, few studies have explored the quantitative relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and urban industrial zones (UIZs) at the urban scale, especially the direct impact of industrial expansion or contraction on LST. Linyi City, the largest city in Shandong Province, was selected as the study area. This study aims to analyze the spatial temporal variation in the UIZs in Linyi City from 2013 to 2022, focusing on the quantitative relationship between LST and UIZs. Using remote sensing images, a novel spectral index (called the BCCSI) was constructed to identify factory buildings. The performance of the BCCSI was validated using five existing indices and Google Earth images. Over the past 10 years, the UIZ area of Linyi has increased by 137.16 km2. The UIZs in Linyi are mainly distributed in counties near the urban center, and counties with large UIZ areas are also hotspots for UIZ changes. Moreover, we found that the contraction or expansion of UIZs has obvious effects on LST. After the contraction (or expansion) of UIZs, the LST decreased (or increased) by 0.48 degrees C (0.39 degrees C). In addition, we found that there is an exponential relationship between LST and the industrial unit area (P value less than 0.01). This research is valuable for environmental assessment and fine management of industrial cities.

TI  - The Millennium Drought In Southeast Australia (2001-2009): Natural And Human Causes And Implications For Water Resources, Ecosystems, Economy, And Society
AB  - The "Millennium Drought" (2001-2009) can be described as the worst drought on record for southeast Australia. Adaptation to future severe droughts requires insight into the drivers of the drought and its impacts. These were analyzed using climate, water, economic, and remote sensing data combined with biophysical modeling. Prevailing El Ni~no conditions explained about two thirds of rainfall deficit in east Australia. Results for south Australia were inconclusive; a contribution from global climate change remains plausible but unproven. Natural processes changed the timing and magnitude of soil moisture, streamflow, and groundwater deficits by up to several years, and caused the amplification of rainfall declines in streamflow to be greater than in normal dry years. By design, river management avoided impacts on some categories of water users, but did so by exacerbating the impacts on annual irrigation agriculture and, in particular, river ecosystems. Relative rainfall reductions were amplified 1.5-1.7 times in dryland wheat yields, but the impact was offset by steady increases in cropping area and crop water use efficiency (perhaps partly due to CO2 fertilization). Impacts beyond the agricultural sector occurred (e.g., forestry, tourism, utilities) but were often diffuse and not well quantified. Key causative pathways from physical drought to the degradation of ecological, economic, and social health remain poorly understood and quantified. Combined with the multiple dimensions of multiyear droughts and the specter of climate change, this means future droughts may well break records in ever new ways and not necessarily be managed better than past ones. © 2013.

TI  - Hydrological Analysis Using Observed And Satellite-Based Estimates: Case Study Of A Lake Catchment In Raipur, India
AB  - Rainfall plays an essential role in different water management sectors ranging from industries, farming, livestock, and domestic utilization both in rural and urban areas. The surface water bodies like rivers, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs hold a huge proportion of the rainfall. However, due to spatio-temporal variability of rainfall and limited availability of meteorological stations, accurate estimation of the hydrological components such as surface runoff, evaporation, and baseflow is a challenging task. In this study, we have used hydrological information, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method to develop an empirical relationship between rainfall and runoff in the Telibandha Lake Catchment (TLC), situated in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, central India. Further, we have used Landsat derived remote sensing product, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to understand its temporal variation of water spread in the TLC over the fifteen years (2001-2015). The water spread areas are assessed by using the mean monthly NDWI data set and analyzing its seasonal and annual patterns. It is found that Telibandha Lake has a maximum depth of 2.9 m and its surface area is 0.12 km(2). Apart from that, the annual runoff is around 232.28 mm, which accounts for almost 22\% of the estimated rainfall. The monthly runoff coefficient varies from 0 to 0.25 in TLC. Both the temporal and spatial NDWI plots show that July-September months have high NDWI values in the TLC. The seasonal NDWI showed a good relationship with mean monthly rainfall data and depicts r(2) = 0.78. The findings from this study helps in determining the temporal changes of water spread within the TLC and supports in understanding the lake characteristics.

TI  - Effects Of Air Pollution Control Policies On Pm2.5 Pollution Improvement In China From 2005 To 2017: A Satellite-Based Perspective
AB  - Understanding the effectiveness of air pollution control policies is important for future policy making. China has implemented strict air pollution control policies since the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). There is still a lack of overall evaluation of the effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution improvement in China since the 11th FYP. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution control policies from 2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satellite remote sensing. We used the satellite-derived PM2.5 of 2005-2013 from one of our previous studies. For the data of 2014-2017, we developed a two-stage statistical model to retrieve satellite PM2.5 data using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD), assimilated meteorology, and land use data. The first stage is a day-specific linear mixed effects (LME) model and the second stage is a generalized additive model (GAM). Results show that the Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented in the 11th FYP period and focused on SO2 emissions control, had co-benefits with PM2.5 reductions. The increasing trends of PM2.5 pollution (1.88 and 3.14 mu g m(-3) year(-1) for all of China and the Jingjinji region in 2004-2007, p<0.005) were suppressed after 2007. The overall PM2.5 trend for all of China was -0.56 mu g m(-3) year(-1) with marginal significance (p = 0. 053) and PM2.5 concentrations in the Pearl River Delta region had a big drop (4.81 mu g m(-3) year(-1), p<0.001) in 2007-2010. The ECER policy during the 12th FYP period was basically an extension of the 11th FYP policy. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant which comprises primary particles and secondary particles such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemental carbon, etc. Since the ECER policy focused on single-pollutant control, it had shown great limitation for PM2.5 reductions. The PM2.5 concentrations did not decrease from 2010 to 2013 in polluted areas (p values of the trends were greater than 0.05). Therefore, China implemented two stricter policies: the 12th FYP on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions (APPC-KR) in 2012, and the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) in 2013. The goal of air quality improvement (especially PM2.5 concentration improvement) and measures for multi-pollutant control were proposed. These policies led to dramatic decreases in PM2.5 after 2013 (4.27 mu g m(-3) year(-1) for all of China in 2013-2017, p<0.001).

TI  - Gis-Based Impact Assessment Of Land-Use Changes On Groundwater Quality: Study From A Rapidly Urbanizing Region Of South India
AB  - This study attempts to assess the influence of changing land-use patterns on the groundwater quality of the hard rock aquifer system in the Maheshwaram watershed, near Hyderabad, India. The study area is a rapidly urbanizing region with land development progressing at a fast pace. To study the impact of this rapid urbanization and overall land-use transition, a groundwater quality index (GQI) was prepared within a geographical information system (GIS). The GQI integrates the different water quality parameters to give a final index value that can be used for spatio-temporal comparisons. The land-use transitions were closely monitored from 2003 to 2008 using multispectral satellite images. The land-use pattern has changed drastically with an increase in the built-up area at the expense of other land uses. The analysis reveals a rapid deterioration of groundwater quality related mainly to the increase in built-up land with unsewered sanitation and poultry farms. Seasonal variability of the groundwater quality was also assessed. Mean GQI decreased from 84.16 to 83.26 over a period of 5 years from 2003 to 2008, while seasonal variability of water quality increased. GQI and Seasonal Variability of water quality were integrated in GIS to yield a groundwater sustainability map, in terms of water quality. Zones of sustainable and unsustainable groundwater use were demarcated for better decision making related to municipal land allotment in this rapidly urbanizing region. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Operational Large-Area Land-Cover Mapping: An Ethiopia Case Study
AB  - Knowledge of land cover and land use nationally is a prerequisite of many studies on drivers of land change, impacts on climate, carbon storage and other ecosystem services, and allows for sucient planning and management. Despite this, many regions globally do not have accurate and consistent coverage at the national scale. This is certainly true for Ethiopia. Large-area land-cover characterization (LALCC), at a national scale is thus an essential first step in many studies of land-cover change, and yet is itself problematic. Such LALCC based on remote-sensing image classification is associated with a spectrum of technical challenges such as data availability, radiometric inconsistencies within/between images, and big data processing. Radiometric inconsistencies could be exacerbated for areas, such as Ethiopia, with a high frequency of cloud cover, diverse ecosystem and climate patterns, and large variations in elevation and topography. Obtaining explanatory variables that are more robust can improve classification accuracy. To create a base map for the future study of large-scale agricultural land transactions, we produced a recent land-cover map of Ethiopia. Of key importance was the creation of a methodology that was accurate and repeatable and, as such, could be used to create earlier, comparable land-cover classifications in the future for the same region. We examined the effects of band normalization and different time-series image compositing methods on classification accuracy. Both top of atmosphere and surface reflectance products from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were tested for single-time classification independently, where the latter resulted in 1.1% greater classification overall accuracy. Substitution of the original spectral bands with normalized difference spectral indices resulted in an additional improvement of 1.0% in overall accuracy. Three approaches for multi-temporal image compositing, using Landsat 8 OLI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, were tested including sequential compositing, i.e., per-pixel summary measures based on predefined periods, probability density function compositing, i.e., per-pixel characterization of distribution of spectral values, and per-pixel sinusoidal models. Multi-temporal composites improved classification overall accuracy up to 4.1%, with respect to single-time classification with an advantage of the Landsat OLI-driven composites over MODIS-driven composites. Additionally, night-time light and elevation data were used to improve the classification. The elevation data and its derivatives improved classification accuracy by 1.7%. The night-time light data improve producer's accuracy of the Urban/Built class with the cost of decreasing its user's accuracy. Results from this research can aid map producers with decisions related to operational large-area land-cover mapping, especially with selecting input explanatory variables and multi-temporal image compositing, to allow for the creation of accurate and repeatable national-level land-cover products in a timely fashion. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Hyperspectral Detection Of A Subsurface Co2 Leak In The Presence Of Water Stressed Vegetation
AB  - Remote sensing of vegetation stress has been posed as a possible large area monitoring tool for surface CO2 leakage from geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) sites since vegetation is adversely affected by elevated CO2 levels in soil. However, the extent to which remote sensing could be used for CO2 leak detection depends on the spectral separability of the plant stress signal caused by various factors, including elevated soil CO2 and water stress. This distinction is crucial to determining the seasonality and appropriateness of remote GCS site monitoring. A greenhouse experiment tested the degree to which plants stressed by elevated soil CO2 could be distinguished from plants that were water stressed. A randomized block design assigned Alfalfa plants (Medicago sativa) to one of four possible treatment groups: 1) a CO2 injection group; 2) a water stress group; 3) an interaction group that was subjected to both water stress and CO2 injection; or 4) a group that received adequate water and no CO2 injection. Single date classification trees were developed to identify individual spectral bands that were significant in distinguishing between CO2 and water stress agents, in addition to a random forest classifier that was used to further understand and validate predictive accuracies. Overall peak classification accuracy was 90% (Kappa of 0.87) for the classification tree analysis and 83% (Kappa of 0.77) for the random forest classifier, demonstrating that vegetation stressed from an underground CO2 leak could be accurately discerned from healthy vegetation and areas of co-occurring water stressed vegetation at certain times. Plants appear to hit a stress threshold, however, that would render detection of a CO2 leak unlikely during severe drought conditions. Our findings suggest that early detection of a CO2 leak with an aerial or ground-based hyperspectral imaging system is possible and could be an important GCS monitoring tool. © 2014 Bellante et al.

TI  - Impact Of Land Use/Cover Change On Ecosystem Service Values In The Kilombero Valley Floodplain, Southeastern Tanzania
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) attributed to natural factors and human activities has led to the loss of ecosystem services, making the quantitative valuation of ecosystem services the scientific focal pointfor sustainable development. This study assessed changes in the ecosystem services values (ESVs) due to LUCC during the period 1990-2016 in the Kilombero Valley floodplain, located in southeastern Tanzania. Moderate resolution Landsat images from 1990, 2010 and 2016 were obtained and analyzed using a random forest (RF) algorithm for classification, and ArcGIS Desktop software (version 10.2, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) for mapping to assess the LUCC. The ESVs were estimated based on the benefit transfer approach using adopted global value coefficients and modified local value coefficients. The results revealed that the aggregated ESVs of the forests, bushlands, wetlands, and water had decreased, consequently leading to a total loss of US\$ 811.5 million (26.6\%) in ESVs over the past 26 years when calculated with the modified local value coefficients to US\$ 3000.7 million (42.3\%) when calculated with global value coefficients. Moreover, the loss in the ESV was attributed to the decreased values of water regulation, climate regulation, erosion control, nutrient cyclying, habitat/refugia, and water supply, with the exception of the values of food production and biological control, which gradually increased during the study period. This study provided minimum estimates of the ecosystem service values, which willcontribute to the formulation of policy actions and strategies for sustainable management of the Kilombero Valley floodplain and inform various stakeholders on the tradeoffs involved in the use of land resources.

TI  - Quantifying Search Effort Of Moving Animals At Several Spatial Scales Using First-Passage Time Analysis: Effect Of The Structure Of Environment And Tracking Systems
AB  - 1. How and at what spatial scale(s) animals change their movements in relation to their environment is central to several topics in ecology and conservation, including foraging ecology, habitat selection and dispersal. A method (first-passage time analysis, FPT) has recently been proposed to measure changes in movements through the landscape, as an index of search effort at the pertinent spatial scales. This method seems largely applicable to an increasing number of studies using satellite, radio-tracking or global positioning system (GPS), but its limits have not yet been assessed. 2. Here I used several movement simulations to examine the ability of FPT analysis to detect area-restricted search (ARS) according to different changes in movements, different patch structures and tracking accuracy. 3. FPT analysis was able to detect changes in movements when both speed and sinuosity changed, or when the animal reacted to patch boundaries. It was also able to detect ARS within the same path at several spatial scales in patches (nested or not) of different sizes. 4. Tracking accuracy affected the detection of ARS by FPT analysis. With the widely used Argos system, a minimum of 13 locations in effective ARS was necessary to detect this behaviour; seven when velocity filtering was applied. Similarly, spatial error in location affected the estimation of the ARS scale value, but the application of velocity filtering reduced this effect. 5. Comparisons between a real GPS track and pathways simulating the Argos error showed that the time-sampling rate of locations (due to satellite-pass frequency) decreased the probability of detecting ARS at small scales (<10 km), while the spatial error decreased this probability by >50% across the whole range of scales. A velocity filter enabled significant reductions in this effect. 6. Synthesis and application. Within limits, FPT analysis is highly suitable for animal movement analysis, either to quantify habitat use, or to determine the scale most relevant for describing an ecological system or factors affecting movement decisions. In anticipation of increasing applications of FPT analysis in applied ecology, I provide recommendations for the use of the technique with several tracking methods. © 2007 The Author.

TI  - Building Probabilistic Models Of Fire Occurrence And Fire Risk Zoning Using Logistic Regression In Shanxi Province, China
AB  - Fires are a recurrent environmental and economic emergency throughout the world. Fire risk analysis and forest fire risk zoning are important aspects of forest fire management. MODIS remote sensing datasets for Shanxi Province from 2002 to 2012 were used to build a spatial logistic forest fire risk model, based on the spatial distribution of forest fires and forest fire-influencing factors, using geographic information system technology. A forest fire risk zoning study was conducted at a large temporal scale and a provincial spatial scale. The resulting logistic model of forest fire risk, built with spatial sampling, showed a good fit (p < 0.05) between the distribution of forest fires and forest fire impact factors. The relative operating characteristic value was 0.757, and a probability distribution map for forest fire was developed, using layer computing. The forest fire area of Shanxi Province was divided into zones of zero, low, moderate, high and extremely high fire risk. The influences of altitude (GC), land-use type (LT), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI) on fire events presented significant spatial variability, whereas the influences of slope and distance to the nearest path exhibited insignificant spatial variability in Shanxi Province. The influences of NDVI and LST on fire events were significant throughout Shanxi Province, whereas the influences of GC, LT and GVMI were only significant locally. Seven fire-prevention regions were delineated, based on the fire-influencing factors. Different fire-prevention policies and emphases should be taken into consideration for each of the seven fire-prone regions.

TI  - A Cluster-Based Method To Map Urban Area From Dmsp/Ols Nightlights
AB  - Accurate information on urban areas at regional and global scales is important for both the science and policy-making communities. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime stable light data (NTL) provide a potential way to map the extent and dynamics of urban areas in an economic and timely manner. In this study, we developed a cluster-based method to estimate optimal thresholds and map urban extent from the DMSP/OLS NTL data in five major steps, including data preprocessing, urban cluster segmentation, logistic model development, threshold estimation, and urban extent delineation. In our method the optimal thresholds vary by clusters and are estimated based on cluster size and overall nightlight magnitude. The United States and China, two large countries with different urbanization patterns, were selected to test the proposed method. Our results indicate that the urbanized area occupies about 2% of total land area in the US, ranging from lower than 0.5% to higher than 10% at the state level, and less than 1% in China, ranging from lower than 0.1% to about 5% at the province level with some municipalities as high as 10%. The derived thresholds and urban extent were evaluated using a validation sub-sample of high-resolution land cover data at the cluster and regional levels. It was found that our method can map urban areas in both countries efficiently and accurately. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the derived optimal thresholds are not highly sensitive to the parameter choices in the logistic model. Our method reduces the over- and under-estimation issues often associated with previous fixed-threshold techniques when mapping urban extent over a large area. More importantly, our method shows potential to map global urban extent and temporal dynamics using the DMSP/OLS NTL data in a timely, cost-effective way. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Assessment Of Inundation Susceptibility In The Context Of Climate Change, Based On Machine Learning And Remote Sensing: Case Study In Vinh Phuc Province Of Vietnam
AB  - Accurate prediction of streamflow plays an important role in water resource management and the continuous assessment of inundation susceptibility in the context of climate change plays a key role in facilitating the construction of appropriate strategies for sustainable development. So far, few studies into inundation susceptibility have explicitly incorporated the effects of climate change into their methodologies. This study aimed to assess inundation susceptibility for Vinh Phuc province in Vietnam, from 2000 to 2020, using machine learning and remote sensing. The algorithms used were support vector machine, catboost, and extratrees. A geo-spatial database of 206 inundation points and 11 conditioning factors (namely elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, distance to river, distance to road, NDVI, NDBI, rainfall, soil type, and TWI) from 2000 to 2020 was developed to be used as the input data. RMSE, MAE, AUC, and R2 were used to assess the fit of the models. The results showed that all the proposed models were a good fit, with AUC values of 0.95 and over. In general, the total area marked as very low risk or low risk has increased, with the high risk and very high-risk areas having decreased over the period studied. This change was mainly concentrated in the city of Vinh Yen where there has been strong urban growth. The models proposed in this study are a promising toolkit to assess inundation susceptibility continuously and can support decision makers involved in sustainable development. Our results highlight the benefits and consequences of planned and unplanned development. Properly planned can reduce the flood risk, while unplanned development can increase the risk. Therefore, by applying the theoretical framework in this study, decision makers or planners can build the most appropriate strategies for flood control in the context of climate change. Our approach in this study represents a theoretical framework for future research not only on inundation management but also natural hazard management, in regions around the world.

TI  - Regionalization Of The Matching Degree Of Water, Soil, And Heat Resources In Central Asia Based On Ecosystem Services Using Pso-Sofm Neural Network
AB  - Regionalization of the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources is of great significance for regional agricultural planning. The long-term unreasonable management of water, soil, and heat resources has caused regional resource shortages and environmental problems in Central Asia, which seriously threatens agricultural production in this region. However, few studies have investigated the regionalization patterns of the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources in Central Asia. In this study, the spatio-temporal patterns of four ecosystem services, including vegetation carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water supply and conservation, and biodiversity conservation, were quantified by using remote sensing data. Combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network, the regionalization of the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources was examined. The relationships among various eco-environmental factors of different matching degree zones were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation analysis. The effects of temperature and precipitation on ecosystem services in Central Asia were analyzed by using partial correlation analysis. The results showed that the ecosystem services were generally high in the southeast while low in the northwest, decreasing from the mountains to the oases and the deserts. The four ecosystem services showed different degrees of change from 2000 to 2015 in Central Asia. Areas with significantly reduced vegetation carbon sequestration and soil conservation accounted for 84.81% and 84.82% of Central Asia, respectively, and areas with significantly reduced water supply and conservation and biodiversity conservation accounted for 69.48% and 19.8% of Central Asia, respectively. However, the ecosystem services from water supply and conservation and biodiversity conservation increased in some areas. The PSO-SOFM neural network model performed well in the regionalization of the matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources in Central Asia. The matching degree of water, soil, and heat resources in Central Asia can be divided into five categories with 21 sub-categories according to the patterns of ecosystem services. At the spatial scale, there were significant differences in the ecosystem services among different matching degree zones. Precipitation was the most important limiting factor affecting the ecosystem service values and matching degree, whereas the effects of temperature and soil properties were less important. At the temporal scale, the areas with a significant positive correlation between precipitation and ecosystem services were larger. The significant effect of temperature on ecosystem service values was mainly concentrated in ecological sensitive zone of northern Kazakh steppe and semi-desert, ecological fragile zone of desert in Central Asia, ecological sensitive zone of central semi-desert in Central Asia and ecological sensitive zone of semi-desert in Badghyz and Karabil. In other regions, temperature and precipitation were not the main factors affecting ecosystem services. Changes in the ecosystem service values may be related to land use types. Combined with the ecological and geographical conditions of different matching degree zones, this study provides useful information for the development and utilization of water and land resources, agriculture and animal husbandry development, and environmental protection in Central Asia. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Anthropogenic Decline Of Ecosystem Services Threatens The Integrity Of The Unique Hyrcanian (Caspian) Forests In Northern Iran
AB  - The unique Hyrcanian (Caspian) forests of northern Iran provide vital ecosystem services for local and global communities. We assess the status and trends of key ecosystem services in this region where native forest conversion has accelerated to make way for housing and farm development. This is a mountainous forested area that is valuable for both conservation and multiple human uses including recreation and farming. It contains globally significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. A rapid, qualitative, and participatory approach was used including interviews with local households and experts in combination with assessment of land use/cover remote sensing data to identify and map priority ecosystem services in the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the interests of the beneficiaries, eight priority services (food production, water supply, raw materials, soil conservation, water regulation, climate regulation, biodiversity, and recreation) were identified and mapped. The results indicate the current typical spatial distribution of the provided services based on structural characteristics of the study landscape and their changing trends through a comparison of past, present and future land use, and land cover. Although food production and recreation have greatly increased in recent decades, the other services, in particular timber production, biodiversity, and water purification and supply are being gradually lost. The results of this study and of others elsewhere should raise awareness of ecosystem service status and trends and the value of examining these since they provide much of the information to inform natural resources policy and decision making. The declines in supply of key ecosystem services both within and outside the protected area are creating conflicts within communities as well as impacting on the integrity of the area and careful planning and conservation is required to provide win-win opportunities.

TI  - Evaluation Of Precipitation Estimates From Remote Sensing And Artificial Neural Network Based Products (Persiann) Family In An Arid Region
AB  - Accurate and continuous rainfall monitoring is essential for effective water resources management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Significant spatio-temporal precipitation variation in the UAE necessitates the use of the latest techniques to measure rainfall intensity accurately. This study investigates the consistency and applicability of four satellite precipitation products, namely PERSIANN, PERSIANN-CCS, PERSIANN-CDR, and PDIR-Now, over the UAE. Daily time series data from 2011 to 2020 were analyzed using various statistical measures and climate indices to develop the belief in the products and for their inter-comparison. The analysis revealed that the average probability of detection (POD) for PDIR and CDR was the highest, with values ranging from 0.7-0.9 and 0.6-0.9, respectively. Similarly, CDR has a better Heidke Skill Score (HSS) with an average value of 0.26. CDR outperformed its counterparts with an average correlation coefficient value of 0.70 vs. 0.65, 0.40, and 0.34 for PDIR, CCS, and PERSIANN, respectively. Precipitation indices analysis revealed that all the products overestimated the number of consecutive wet days by 15-20\%, while underestimating consecutive dry days by 5-10\%. The quantitative estimations indicate that all the products were matching with the gauge values during the wet months (January-April), while they showed significant overestimation during the dry months. CDR and PDIR were in close agreement with the gauge data in terms of maximum daily rainfall with an error of less than 10\% for both products. As compared to others, PERSIANN-CDR provided better estimates, particularly in terms of capturing extreme rainfall events and spatial distribution of rainfall. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of four PERSIANN family products based on recent daily rainfall data of UAE. The findings can provide future insights into the applicability and improvement of PERSIANN products in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - An Investigation Of Aerosol Scattering And Absorption Properties In Wuhan, Central China
AB  - Aerosol scattering and absorption properties were continuously measured and analyzed at the urban Laboratory for Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS) site in Wuhan, central China, from 1 December 2009 to 31 March 2014. The mean aerosol scattering coefficient σs, absorption coefficient σab, and single scattering albedo (SSA) were 377.54 Mm-1, 119.06 Mm-1, and 0.73, respectively. Both σs and σab showed obvious annual variability with large values in winter and small values in summer, principally caused by the annual characteristics of meteorological conditions, especially planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and local emissions. The SSA showed a slight annual variation. High values of SSA were related to formation of secondary aerosols in winter hazes and aerosol hygroscopic growth in humid summer. The large SSA in June can be attributed to the biomass combustion in Hubei and surrounding provinces. Both σs and σab showed double peak phenomena in diurnal variation resulting from the shallow stable PBLH at night and automobile exhaust emission during morning rush hours. The SSA also exhibited a double peak phenomenon related to the proportional variation of black carbon (BC) and light scattering particulates in the day and night. The long-term exploration on quantified aerosol optical properties can help offer scientific basis of introducing timely environmental policies for local government. © 2015 by the authors.

TI  - Effects Of Farm Management Practices And Environmental Factors On Bulk Tank Milk Antibodies Against Gastrointestinal Nematodes In Dairy Farms Across Canada
AB  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been used as a diagnostic tool to quantify levels of gastrointestinal nematodes in dairy cattle by measuring Ostertagia ostertagi antibodies in milk. Higher levels of O. ostertagi antibodies measured by ELISA methods, referred to as optical density ratios (ODRs), are associated with decreased milk production in dairy cattle. On-farm management practices (e.g. pasturing techniques and anthelmintic usage) can influence the exposure of cattle to nematode infections and the magnitude of acquired worm burdens. Additionally, environmental and climatic factors, such as land elevation and precipitation, may also influence the levels of gastrointestinal parasitism. This repeated cross-sectional study investigated the effect of farm management practices and surrounding environmental factors on bulk tank (BT) ODRs in herds from provinces across Canada, and further examined the potential effects of various anthelmintic treatment protocols on BT ODRs. A total of 195 herds contributed an average of 3.5 BT samples between December 2003 and April 2005. The farm management practices were recorded from a questionnaire asking producers about their pasturing methods (confined, pastured, etc.), pasture sharing practices (e.g. mixing heifers with milking cows) and anthelmintic treatments. Environmental data were downloaded online from various governmental databases (e.g. Natural Resources Canada, Statistics Canada, Environment Canada, etc.). Statistical models, accounting for repeated measures (multiple BT ODRs for each farm) and for clustering of farms within a region (province or ecoregion), were used to analyze environmental and farm management data. Overall, the greater the exposure that heifers and milking cows had to pasture, the higher the levels of anti-parasite antibodies detected in BT samples. Treating the entire herd or treating milking cows at calving reduced BT ODR values. Farms in areas with higher number of rainy days, higher normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, and lower land surface temperatures (LSTs), were also likely to have higher BT ODRs. Seasonal variation was such that late summer and early fall, when parasite load was at its highest, yielded larger BT ODRs. Due to the high clustering effect at the herd level, factors at the herd level (e.g. pasturing methods, anthelmintic administration) had a higher potential impact on bulk-tank measurements than the herd's surrounding environmental factors.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Variations In Normalized Difference Vegetation Index In Cuba
AB  - Vegetation spectral indexes have been one of the most effective ways to assess the properties of plant cover and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been one of the most used. Our objective was to describe spatial and temporal differences of the NDVI in Cuba, according to types of vegetation and land use. The temporal analysis was divided into multiannual and annual. The index values were sampled using 10 000 random points, classified according to land use, plant formation, and altitude. Samples were taken from 23 protected natural areas, which presented the largest area of terrestrial surface. The index had a global average of 0.702 ± 0.198, with 71% of the values above 0.60. The areas of anthropogenic uses showed index values 10% lower than natural vegetation. The forest formations had values greater than 0.8, except for mangroves. Protected areas showed different index values, concerning their management and extension category. The covers used can serve as a basis for studies on the distribution of vegetation and fauna in Cuba. © 2020 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evidence-Based Alignment Of Conservation Policies With Remote Sensing-Enabled Essential Biodiversity Variables
AB  - Nature conservation policies require up-to-date and accurate biodiversity monitoring. Innovative synoptic information products such as Remote Sensing-enabled Essential Biodiversity Variables (RS-enabled EBVs) could complement field observations in biodiversity monitoring. It is not clear however, how these scientific remote sensing products can be utilized for policy reporting. Agreement on the monitored geographic extent (area size and scale), as well as biodiversity attributes (composition, structure, and function), may provide a common'point of departure' for policymakers and the scientific community to develop and further improve monitoring. In this study, biodiversity indicators of 10 nature conservation policies and 50 RS-enabled EBVs were compared using non-parametric tests (chi-square and Mann-Whitney U). Our main finding is that policy indicators and RS enabled EBVs are very similar in the spatial extent they address (mapping scale). However, most policy indicators are related to ecosystem structure while most of the RS-enabled EBVs are related to ecosystem function and ecosystem structure. RS-enabled EBVs have added value in monitoring of biodiversity, especially when looking at ecosystem functioning. Information on ecosystem functioning and structure provides evidence needed as input for policy development and management of biodiversity. However, to make this happen, a stronger focus on ecosystem functioning and structure with appropriate variables is needed, in policy requirements and targets.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations And Factors Of Air Quality In Urban Central China During 2013–2015
AB  - Spatiotemporal behaviors of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and trace gases (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) in Hefei during the period from December 2013 to November 2015 are investigated. The mean annual PM2.5 (PM10) concentrations are 89.1 ± 59.4 µg/m3 (118.9 ± 66.8 µg/m3) and 61.6 ± 32.2 µg/m3 (91.3 ± 40.9 µg/m3) during 2014 and 2015, respectively, remarkably exceeding the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) grade II. All trace gases basically meet the requirements though NO2 and O3 have a certain upward trend. Old districts have the highest pollution levels, followed by urban periphery sites and new districts. Severe haze pollution occurs in Hefei, with frequent exceedances in particulate matter with 178 (91) days in 2014 (2015). The abnormal PM2.5 concentrations in June 2014 attributed to agricultural biomass burning from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS) wildfire maps and aerosol optical depth (AOD) analysis. PM2.5 is recognized as the major pollutant, and a longer interspecies relationship is found between PM2.5 and other criteria pollutants for episode days as compared to non-episode days. The air pollution in Hefei tends to be influenced by local primary emissions, secondary formation, and regional transport from adjacent cities and remote regions. Most areas of Anhui, southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, and western Shandong are identified as the common high-potential source regions of PM2.5 . Approximately 9.44 and 8.53 thousand premature mortalities are attributed to PM2.5 exposure in 2014 and 2015. The mortality benefits will be 32% (24%), 47% (41%), 70% (67%), and 85% (83%) of the total premature mortalities in 2014 (2015) when PM2.5 concentrations meet the CAAQS grade II, the World Health Organization (WHO) IT-2, IT-3, and Air Quality Guideline, respectively. Hence, joint pollution prevention and control measures need to be strengthened due to pollutant regional diffusion, and much higher health benefits could be achieved as the Hefei government adopts more stringent WHO guidelines for PM2.5. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Malaria Indicator Surveys Demonstrate A Markedly Lower Prevalence Of Malaria In Large Cities Of Sub-Saharan Africa
AB  - Background: One in eight sub-Saharan Africans now lives in a city with a population greater than 750,000. Decision makers require additional evidence regarding the burden of malaria in these large cities. This paper presents results from analysis of existing data from nationwide household surveys measuring malaria parasitaemia by microscopy among children six to 59 months of age in 15 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Methods. Geo-coordinates for each survey cluster were used to determine the distance from the cluster to the centre of each of 16 large cities with populations greater than 750,000. Geo-coordinates of each site within 25 km of the centre were entered into Google Earth to obtain a satellite image of the location and determine whether it was within the boundaries of the metropolis. In the case of two countries for which survey geo-coordinates were not available, clusters located in an additional four large cities were identified based upon their designated district. Data from all sites within city boundaries were pooled together and compared to data from all rural sites within 150 km of the city centre or in the same zone of malaria endemicity. Results: Of the 20 large cities, only in Ouagadougou were more than 10% of children found to have a malaria infection. The prevalence was less than 5% for 16 of these cities. Apart from Antananarivo where both the large city and the comparison rural communities were parasite-free, the prevalence in each of the large cities was 0 to 40% of that found among children living in rural communities within 150 km of these cities or within the same zone of malaria endemicity. In 14 of the 20 large cities, all of the children living in 75% or more of the clusters were malaria parasite-free. Conclusions: Existing data from malaria indicator surveys can be used to document the substantially lower prevalence of malaria in specific large cities. These findings will help policy makers, public health programmers and clinical workers in each country to develop and promote malaria control strategies that are suited to large cities as well as to those living in smaller communities. © 2013 Pond; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Urban Land Cover And Ecosystem Service Changes Based On Sentinel-2a Msi And Landsat Tm Data
AB  - Sustainable development in metropolitan regions is challenging in the light of continuous urbanization. Remote sensing provides timely and reliable information on urban areas and their changing patterns. This study's objectives are to evaluate the contribution of Sentinel-2A (S-2A) data to urban ecosystem service mapping and to investigate spatial ecosystem service characteristics with landscape metrics through a novel method. Service pattern changes between 2005 and 2015 are mapped for Beijing, China. Landscape metrics are used to qualitatively evaluate urban ecosystem service provision bundle changes. S-2A and Landsat TM data are segmented and classified with SVM, distinguishing three artificial and four natural classes based on ecosystem function. Spatial characteristics influencing ecosystem services are quantified with seven landscape metrics. Beijing's urban development is characterized by reduction in agricultural areas in the urban fringe in favor of built-up areas, urban green space, and golf courses. A transformation of old suburban agglomerations into urban green space can be observed. The planar increase in urban areas is accompanied by the creation of managed urban green space. Service bundles based on land cover classes and spatial characteristics decreased more than 30% for bundles that represent food supply, noise reduction, waste treatment, and global climate regulation. Temperature regulation/moderation of climate extremes, recreation/place values/social cohesion, and aesthetic benefits/cognitive development are least affected. This new approach of extending the ecosystem service concept through integration of spatial characteristics of ecosystem service provisional patches through landscape metrics is believed to give a more realistic appraisal of ecosystem services in urban areas. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - A Novel Densenet-324 Densely Connected Convolution Neural Network For Medical Crop Classification Using Remote Sensing Hyperspectral Satellite Images
AB  - In the past few decades, importance of the medicinal Crops is extending to a large extent due to its benefits in treating life-threatening diseases. Medicinal Crop has excellent medicinal properties on its roots, stem, and leaves to prevent human and animal health. Particularly detection and identification of the Crop classes are effectively carried out using hyperspectral images as discrimination of the target feature or objects is simple and it contains rich information containing the spatial and temporal details of underlying the land cover. However, Crop classification using machine learning architectures concerning spectral characteristics obtained on the anatomical features and morphological features. Extracted features towards classification lead to several challenges such as large spatial and temporal variability and spectral signatures similarity between different objects. A further hyperspectral image poses several difficulties with changes in illumination, environment, and atmospheric aspects. To tackle those non-trivial challenges, DenseNet-324 Densely Connected convolution neural network architecture has been designed in this work to discriminate the crop and medical Crop effectively in the interested areas. Initially, the Hyperspectral image is pre-processed against a large number of noises through the employment of the noise removal technique and bad line replacement techniques. Pre-processed image is explored to image segmentation using the global thresholding method to segment it into various regions based on spatial pieces of information on grouping the neighboring similar pixels intensity or textures. Further regions of the image are processed using principle component analysis to extract spectral features of the image. That extracted feature is employed to ant colony optimization technique to obtain the optimal features. Computed optimal features are classified using Convolution Neural Network with a hyper parameter setup. The convolution Layer of the CNN architecture process spatial, temporal, and spectral feature and generates the feature map in various context, generated feature map is max pooled in the pooling layer and classified into crops and medicinal Crop in the SoftMax layer. Experimental analysis of the proposed architecture is carried out on the Indiana Pines dataset using cross-fold validation to analyze the representation ability to discriminate the features with large variance between the different classes. From the results, it is confirmed that the proposed architecture exhibits higher performance in classification accuracy of 98.43% in classifying the Crop species compared with conventional approaches. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - A Spatial Framework For Targeting Urban Planning For Pollinators And People With Local Stakeholders: A Route To Healthy, Blossoming Communities?
AB  - Pollinators such as bees and hoverflies are essential components of an urban ecosystem, supporting and contributing to the biodiversity, functioning, resilience and visual amenity of green infrastructure. Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how habitat suitability models (HSM) incorporating remote sensed vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies, providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight ‘win-win’ opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a ‘pollinator pledge’. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more attractive city to live, work and invest in. © 2017

TI  - Intelligent Irrigation And Automation
AB  - Nowadays, the optimal use of water and its efficient management is the most important challenge in the agricultural sector in many countries. Modern methods have been adopted for irrigating greenhouses and agricultural lands due to the importance of water in agriculture. Agricultural lands and greenhouses can be irrigated at the lowest cost and manpower under smart irrigation systems. Currently, smart irrigation systems can be the best option because of the concerns that most farmers have. There are various techniques that can be implemented through various forms such as the use of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, neural network, fuzzy logic, and automation. Intelligent irrigation systems regulate irrigation planning without human intervention, in accordance with the climate and soil moisture. These programs and controllers significantly improve the efficiency of water use in irrigation, both outdoors and indoors, such as greenhouses. Intelligent irrigation controllers automatically modify the watering program to the real circumstances of the agriculture, in contrast to traditional irrigation controllers, which work according to a standard and predefined timetable. Each of these main techniques is intended to minimize the need for human interaction and effort. Although each of these approaches has benefits and drawbacks of its own, how each is used sets it apart from the others. This chapter’s goal is to evaluate the actions made to enhance the utilization of water resources. A greater capacity for water storage has also been demonstrated via sophisticated real-time irrigation planning, management, and optimization. The irrigation sector is beginning to deploy remote sensing networks and communication sensors, which is anticipated to increase water use efficiency. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Saeid Eslamian and Faezeh Eslamian; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - The Expansion Of Intensive Agriculture And Ranching In Brazilian Amazonia
AB  - Agriculture in Amazonia has often provoked controversy, given the tremendous ecological value of the region's environment. First with ranching, and now with the soybean boom, tractors and cattle have marched across lands that for millennia supported only closed moist forest, resident ecosystems, and dispersed indigenous peoples. The present chapter considers this expansion, focusing on the Brazilian portion of the basin. Its premise is that effective Amazonian policy must be grounded on an understanding of the region's agriculture. The chapter pursues its objectives by first addressing the development initiatives that created the preconditions for Amazonia's current agricultural economy. The region is remote and has therefore required sustained government intervention to release its potential. The policy discussion is followed by descriptions of cattle ranching and soy farming. For each, market settings and trajectories of expansion are presented. Although these sectoral descriptions are data rich, they do not provide a conceptual framework for analyzing the environmental impacts of evolving market conditions. To accomplish this, the chapter invokes the classical land use model of von Thunen to explain Amazonian land cover dynamics in relation to soy-cattle linkages. It addresses these dynamics with remote sensing data from Mato Grosso, Para, and Rondonia, and then discusses scenarios of agricultural advances on the forest. Conclusions follow, considering possible policy responses to deforestation, and the social context of agricultural intensification, with special attention to the issues of land tenure security and distributional equity.

TI  - Analysis Of The Characteristics And Ideas Of Ancient Urban Land-Use Based On Gis And An Algorithm: A Case Study Of Chang'an City In The Sui And Tang Dynasties
AB  - As ancient cities are spaces that represent the development of civilization, it is worth exploring and studying their characteristics and conceptions of land use. In this regard, the focus has turned to the issue of how to achieve the efficient mining of massive urban remote sensing data through human-computer collaboration. In this paper, a new intelligent method of analyzing urban land use characteristics and their cultural significance is proposed; it is feasible, effective, accurate, manageable, and portable. The method is based on a geographic information system (GIS) and a specific algorithm. The city plan was calibrated with the help of satellite remote sensing images and sites. By constructing the "urban element area acquisition and analysis model", various operations for areas in the city plan were realized, including an area value calculation, land use structure calculation, area modulus analysis, area ratio analysis between areas, and determination of the cultural significance of numbers and ratios. Taking the Sui and Tang dynasties capital city of Chang'an as an example, we found the existence of a set of urban planning techniques through area modulus (standard area units) for the first time; it took the market area as the modulus A and the area of Daxing Palace as the expanded modulus 2A, made the area of important areas in the city an integer multiplied by the modulus value (for example, the overall scope of the city is 100A, the rectangular urban area is 90A, and the small city area is 10A), and made the key values and numerical ratios have a cultural significance (such as 4.5, 5.5, 10, 25, 30, 100, 12:10, 1.618:1, 9:5, 45:1, 2:1), reflecting the planning and design concept of the capital city, into which the ancient Chinese deliberately integrated "number, shape and meaning". In addition, we carried out supplementary verification with the Roman city of Timgad and the Japanese city of Heijo-kyo, discovering that they also have design methods for area planning. We believe that land use planning can better meet the practical needs of urban resource distribution. Compared with urban form design, it might have chronological precedence. By setting the area modulus and the modulus value of each area, the grid-shaped city achieves the rational distribution of land and the establishment of order in an efficient way, and this thought and operation method greatly contributed to the advancement of ancient civilizations.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Distribution Of No2 In China Based On Refined 2dcnn-Lstm Model Retrieval And Factor Interpretability Analysis
AB  - With the advancement of urbanization in China, effective control of pollutant emissions and air quality have become important goals in current environmental management. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as a precursor of tropospheric ozone and fine particulate matter, plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry research and air pollution control. However, the uneven ground monitoring stations and low temporal resolution of polar-orbiting satellites set challenges for accurately assessing near-surface NO2 concentrations. To address this issue, a spatiotemporal refined NO2 retrieval model was established for China using the geostationary satellite Himawari-8. The spatiotemporal characteristics of NO2 were analyzed and its contribution factors were explored. Firstly, seven Himawari-8 channels sensitive to NO2 were selected by using the forward feature selection based on information entropy. Subsequently, a 2DCNN-LSTM network model was constructed, incorporating the selected channels and meteorological variables as retrieval factors to estimate hourly NO2 in China from March 2018 to February 2020 (with a resolution of 0.05 degrees, per hour). The performance evaluation demonstrates that the full-channel 2DCNN-LSTM model has good fitting capability and robustness (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 10.93), and further improvements were achieved after channel selection (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 6.84). The 10-fold cross-validation results indicate that the R-2 between retrieval and measured values was above 0.85, the MAE was within 5.60, and the RMSE iwas within 7.90. R-2 varied between 0.85 and 0.90, showing better validation at mid-day (R-2 = 0.89) and in spring and fall transition seasons (R-2 = 0.88 and R-2 = 0.90). To investigate the cooperative effect of meteorological factors and other air pollutants on NO2, statistical methods (beta coefficients) were used to test the factor interpretability. Meteorological factors as well as other pollutants were analyzed. From a statistical perspective, PM2.5, boundary layer height, and O-3 were found to have the largest impacts on near-surface NO2 concentrations, with each standard deviation change in these factors leading to 0.28, 0.24, and 0.23 in standard deviations of near-surface NO2, respectively. The findings of this study contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of NO2 and provide a scientific basis for formulating targeted air pollution policies.

TI  - Current Approaches To Diagnosis And Treatment Of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ And Future Directions
AB  - The presentation and treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has changed substantially over the years. While previously an incidental pathologic finding in more advanced, palpable tumors, the institution of screening mammography has repositioned this disease entity as one largely diagnosed as a non-palpable lesion, often prior to any invasive disease. As DCIS is a precursor to invasive carcinoma, evolution in the approach to treatment has followed in the footsteps of that for invasive disease, including breast conservation therapy, adjuvant radiation, and use of antihormonal therapy. Survival outcomes for DCIS are very high and more recent literature has investigated tailoring therapeutic approaches to avoid overtreatment. Two important areas of ongoing clinical debate concerning overtreatment include use of preoperative MRI and the role of adjuvant radiation. The heterogeneity of the disease makes it difficult to differentiate lesions that would benefit from more aggressive treatment from those in which overtreatment could be avoided. Clinical characteristics, such as histologic appearance, age at diagnosis, and margin status at tumor excision have been established as moderate predictors of disease recurrence, but none has provided strong enough evidence as to guide consensus decisions on adjuvant therapy. Continuing research seeks to define the genetic and molecular characteristics that can predict disease course and serve as the potential targets for novel therapeutic agents. While several markers have shown promise in differentiating tumor aggressiveness, there is still much to be discovered about the precise mechanisms of disease progression and how this can be applied clinically to optimize treatment. © 2017

TI  - Soil Erosion Risk Assessment And Spatial Mapping Using Landsat-7 Etm+, Rusle, And Gis-A Case Study
AB  - This paper discusses the application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in conjunction with LANDSAT-7 ETM+ remote sensing data, and geographical information system (GIS) to the spatial mapping of soil erosion risk in Jhagrabaria Watershed Allahabad, U.P., India. Soil map and topographical data were used to develop the soil erodibility factor (K), and a digital elevation model (DEM) image was used to generate the topographic factor (LS). The cover-management factor (C) was developed based on vegetation, shade, and soil fraction images derived from spectral mixture analysis of a LANDSAT Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (LANDSAT-7 ETM+) image, and support practice factor (P) was developed by crossing operation between land use/land cover classification map and slope map. Assuming the same climatic conditions in the study area, the rainfall-runoff erosivity (R) factor was not used. The value of K for the study area lies between 0.25 and 0.485, LS values were less than 1.4, and C and P values were less than 1. A soil erosion risk map with five classes (very low, low, medium, medium high, and high) was produced based on the simplified RUSLE within the GIS environment and was linked to land use/land cover (LULC) image to explore the relationships between soil erosion risk (SER) and LULC distribution. The results indicated that the land use/land cover (LULC) having the most succession and mature vegetation are in low-erosion-risk areas, while the barren and fallow lands are usually associated with high-to medium-erosion-risk areas. The spatial maps of the SER has been generated that can be utilized in the policy matter and planning for the watershed studied. This research also implied that the remote sensing and GIS tools and techniques provide the highly promising and important tools for evaluating and mapping soil erosion risk in the Jhagrabaria Watershed.

TI  - Mapping Urban Socio-Economic Vulnerability Related To Heat Risk: A Grid-Based Assessment Framework By Combing The Geospatial Big Data
AB  - Heat-related risk due to climate change increases the socio-economic vulnerability in the metropolitan area worldwide. Although many studies have conducted on heat associated vulnerability assessment at various scales, a holistic grid-based framework with the available, multi-source geospatial data remains undetermined. This paper describes an effective method for assessing the socio-economic vulnerability related to heat risk at gird scale by using census data, remote sensing and point of interest (POI) data. The integrated Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index (SEVI) is constructed by considering three dimensions of the demographic vulnerability (DVI), economic vulnerability (EVI) and infrastructure vulnerability (IVI) based on Sensitivity Exposure-Adaptive capacity framework. A total number of 4807 grids in Hangzhou city of China is involved in the vulnerability analysis. The Monte Carlo method is subsequently employed to quantify the sensitivity of assessing result. Further, we examine the regional spatial heterogeneity and clustering of vulnerability in urban area. The results reveal that all vulnerability index (DVI, EVI, IVI, and SEVI) demonstrate a similar spatial pattern, and the high vulnerability grids are concentrated in urban center. Sensitivity analysis exhibit that the vegetation coverage and availability of medical resources are the key influencing factors that cause a greater variability in SEVI values. In the context of urban grid management, this study contributes new method on identifying the spatial heterogeneity of vulnerability associated with heat stress, which can provide more targeted spatial information to decision makers for optimizing local urban heat vulnerability management strategies.

TI  - Species Richness, Extent And Potential Threats To Mangroves Of Sarangani Bay Protected Seascape, Philippines
AB  - Mangroves form one of the most vital tropical ecosystems that support many species and surrounding communities. The Sarangani Bay Protected Seascape (SBPS) in the south of Mindanao Islands in the Philippines is home to a large number of mangrove species, which have not been fully explored. We updated the list of true mangrove species for SBPS from 10 to 24 by integrating the results of our survey and other past mangrove assessments. A practical spatial analysis approach was used to estimate the current mangrove forest extent of SBPS at 514 ha, as compared to 479 ha and 332 ha in 1998 and 2016, respectively, from other independent reports. Mangrove cover was negatively related to built area, cropland, bare ground, rangeland and total human population, but positively related to the number of fishing boats and total tree cover. In addition, we identified other potential anthropogenic threats to mangroves and categorised them into forest clearing or adoption of mangrove-friendly aquaculture and revitalising degraded mangrove forests outweigh their constraints. Our work provided a locally relevant understanding of the potential causes of mangrove loss and the values of human actions in mangrove dynamics, which will contribute to reliable and informed decision-making for the conservation of mangrove species and restoration of mangrove forests in SBPS.

TI  - Impact Of The December 2004 Tsunami On Soil, Groundwater And Vegetation In The Nagapattinam District, India
AB  - The tsunami of 26 December 2004 struck the Nagapattinam District, Tamil Nadu, India. Sea water inundation from the tsunami caused salinization problems for soil and groundwater in coastal areas of the district, and also induced salt injuries in crops. To document the recovery of the agricultural environment from the tsunami, we conducted observations of the soil, groundwater, and vegetation. Soil electrical conductivity increased sharply after the tsunami, but returned to pre-tsunami levels the following year. Groundwater salinity returned to pre-tsunami levels by 2006. These rapid rates of recovery were due to the monsoon rainfall leaching salt from the highly permeable soils in the area. MODIS NDVI values measured before and after the tsunami showed that vegetation damaged by the tsunami recovered to its pre-tsunami state by the next rice cropping season, called samba, which starts from August to February. From these results, we conclude that the agricultural environment of the district has now fully recovered from the tsunami. Based on the results, we have also identified important management implications for soil, groundwater, and vegetation as follows: 1) due to the heavy monsoon rainfall and the high permeability of soils in this region, anthropogenic inputs like fertilizers should be applied carefully to minimize pollution, and the use of green manure is recommended; 2) areas that were contaminated by sea water extended up to 1000 m from the sea shore and over pumping of groundwater should be carefully avoided to prevent inducing sea water intrusion; and 3) data from a moderate resolution sensor of 250 m, such as MODIS, can be applied to impact assessment in widespread paddy field areas like the Nagapattinam District. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Landscape Partitioning By Nocturnal Rodent Assemblages In The Llanos De Ojuelos, In Mexico's Central High Plateau
AB  - Aim The Llanos de Ojuelos in Mexico's Central High Plateau supports unique Opuntia scrublands and the southernmost Chihuahuan grasslands. Although human activities have modified strongly its landscape and impacted its biodiversity at an unknown scale, such impacts are poorly known. We aimed at understanding how nocturnal rodent species distributed across the landscape and formed assemblages and on the role and integration of the different habitats at the landscape level. Location The study was carried out at 43 sites in a study area of approximately 3350 km 2 in the Llanos de Ojuelos. Methods During the Spring of 2008, we surveyed nocturnal rodents, through live-trapping. We redefined habitat classes based on log-linear multinomial regressions of rodent captures. Species rarefaction curves and true alpha, beta and gamma diversities were calculated for the different habitat classes. A map of the different habitats was constructed based on Landsat imagery. Results We captured 458 individuals of 20 rodent species. Multinomial regressions caused the merger of 11 a priori defined habitat classes into 7. Leguminous scrub and mixed nopaleras, both secondary habitats, had the highest alpha and gamma diversity values. Closed arboreal nopaleras and grasslands had the highest within-habitat variability (D-1(beta)) and the lowest area coverage. Within-habitat D-1(beta) was larger than landscape D-1(beta), because of the great overlap in rodent assemblage composition between the habitats. Main conclusions There are no 'typical' rodent assemblages per habitat class, but they are organized loosely and have fuzzy borders. Rodent community organization was highly species-centred. At the landscape level, secondary habitats have a profound effect on rodent diversity and should be included in management schemes for biological conservation. The most endangered habitats seem to be the closed arboreal nopaleras and grasslands. Any conservation efforts must consider their conservation and an increase in the size of remaining patches.

TI  - Assessing Forest Growth Across Southwestern Oregon Under A Range Of Current And Future Global Change Scenarios Using A Process Model, 3-Pg
AB  - With improvements in mapping regional distributions of vegetation using satellite-derived information, there is an increasing interest in the assessment of current limitations on forest growth and in making projections of how productivity may be altered in response to changing climatic conditions and management policies. We utilised a simplified physiologically based process model (3-PG) across a 54000 km(2) mountainous region of southwestern Oregon, USA, to evaluate the degree to which maximum periodic mean annual increment (PAI) of forests could be predicted at a set of 448 forest inventory plots. The survey data were pooled into six broad forest types (coastal rain forest, interior coast range forest, mixed conifer, dry-site Douglas-fir, subalpine forest, and pine forest) and compared to the 3-PG predictions at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). We found good agreement (r(2) = 0.84) between mean PAI values of forest productivity for the six forest types with those obtained from field surveys. With confidence at this broader level of integration, we then ran model simulations to evaluate the constraints imposed by (i) soil fertility under current climatic conditions, (ii) the effect of doubling monthly precipitation across the region, and (iii) a widely used climatic change scenario that involves modifications in monthly mean temperatures and precipitation, as well as a doubling in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These analyses showed that optimum soil fertility would more than double growth, with the greatest response in the subalpine type and the least increase in the coastal rain forests. Doubling the precipitation increased productivity in the pine type (> 50\%) with reduced responses elsewhere. The climate change scenario with doubled atmospheric CO2 increased growth by 50\% on average across all forest types, primarily as a result of a projected 33\% increase in photosynthetic capacity. This modelling exercise indicates that, at a regional scale, a general relationship exists between simulated maximum leaf area index and maximum aboveground growth, supporting the contention that satellite-derived estimates of leaf area index may be good measures of the potential productivity of temperate evergreen forests.

TI  - Introducing Spatially Distributed Fire Danger From Earth Observations (Fdeo) Using Satellite-Based Data In The Contiguous United States
AB  - Wildfire danger assessment is essential for operational allocation of fire management resources; with longer lead prediction, the more efficiently can resources be allocated regionally. Traditional studies focus on meteorological forecasts and fire danger index models (e.g., National Fire Danger Rating System-NFDRS) for predicting fire danger. Meteorological forecasts, however, lose accuracy beyond 10 days; as such, there is no quantifiable method for predicting fire danger beyond 10 days. While some recent studies have statistically related hydrologic parameters and past wildfire area burned or occurrence to fire, no study has used these parameters to develop a monthly spatially distributed predictive model in the contiguous United States. Thus, the objective of this study is to introduce Fire Danger from Earth Observations (FDEO), which uses satellite data over the contiguous United States (CONUS) to enable two-month lead time prediction of wildfire danger, a sufficient lead time for planning purposes and relocating resources. In this study, we use satellite observations of land cover type, vapor pressure deficit, surface soil moisture, and the enhanced vegetation index, together with the United States Forest Service (USFS) verified and validated fire database (FPA) to develop spatially gridded probabilistic predictions of fire danger, defined as expected area burned as a deviation from "normal". The results show that the model predicts spatial patterns of fire danger with 52\% overall accuracy over the 2004-2013 record, and up to 75\% overall accuracy during the fire season. Overall accuracy is defined as number of pixels with correctly predicted fire probability classes divided by the total number of the studied pixels. This overall accuracy is the first quantified result of two-month lead prediction of fire danger and demonstrates the potential utility of using diverse observational data sets for use in operational fire management resource allocation in the CONUS.

TI  - Forecasting Tidal Marsh Elevation And Habitat Change Through Fusion Of Earth Observations And A Process Model
AB  - Reducing uncertainty in data inputs at relevant spatial scales can improve tidal marsh forecasting models, and their usefulness in coastal climate change adaptation decisions. The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs - average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass - from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially. Improving information for coastal modeling will support planning for ecosystem services, including habitat, carbon storage, and flood protection. © 2016 Byrd et al.

TI  - A Robust Technique For Mapping Vegetation Condition Across A Major River System
AB  - Ecologists need to develop tools that allow characterization of vegetation condition over scales that are pertinent to species' persistence and appropriate for management actions. Our study shows that stand condition can be mapped accurately over the floodplain of a major river system (ca 100,000 ha of forest over 1600 km of river)-the Murray River in southeastern Australia. It demonstrates the value of using quantitative ground surveys in conjunction with remotely sensed data to model vegetation condition over very large spatial domains. A comparison of four modelling methods found that stand condition was best modelled using the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) method (R (2) = 0.85), although there was little difference among the methods (R (2) = 0.77-0.85). However, a subsequent validation survey of condition at new locations showed that use of artificial neural networks had substantially higher predictive power (R (2) = 0.78) than the MARS model (R (2) = 0.28). This discrepancy demonstrates the value of using several modelling approaches to determine relationships among vegetation responses and environmental variables, and stresses the importance of validating ecological models with predictive surveys conducted after model building. The artificial neural network was used to produce a stand condition map for the whole floodplain, which predicted that only 30\% of the area containing Eucalyptus camaldulensis stands is currently in good condition. There is a downstream decline in stand condition, which is related to more extreme declines in flooding, due to water harvesting, and drier climate found in the Lower Murray region. Rigorous surveying and modelling approaches, such as those used here, are necessary if vegetation health is to be effectively monitored and managed.

TI  - An Assessment Of The Aboveground Phytomass And Carbon Levels Of The Forests Of Northern Telangana, India, Using A Geospatial Technique
AB  - An assessment of aboveground phytomass and carbon levels was conducted in the South-Central region of India, in the Telangana State, situated on the high Deccan Plateau. The study is based on field observations at 30 sites using cluster sampling. The sites were selected on homogeneity maps prepared using satellite data of forest cover type maps, forest cover density maps, normalized difference vegetation indices and maps of administrative boundaries. Field observations such as forest types, canopy cover, species, girth and plant height were made for assessing basal area, bole volume, biomass and carbon, first for each tree, then for each plot and then for the entire region. The basal area varied from 0.09 to 40.94 m2/ha, and the phytomass ranged from 0.07 to 174.69 t/ha. The total phytomass in the study area was about 6709.623 t, with a mean value of 859.10 t/ha per site (i.e. 250 × 250 m). The predicted carbon was 5.02 million tons (Mt) (standard deviation [SD] 9.542) against the total phytomass of 10.46 Mt (SD 19.878) for the study area. These data can provide essential information for helping to establish forest policies that support a more sustainable development of local forest resources, as well as for structuring forest management working plans. Key policy insights The study reveals the observed and predicted biomass and carbon of northern Telangana, India. The key purpose of the study is to determine the biomass and carbon content of northern Telangana, in light of the Kyoto Protocol. For the study area, the predicted carbon is 5.02 Mt against the total biomass of 10.46 Mt. The forest density, phytomass and carbon maps are the first of their kind at a landscape scale for the Telangana State of India. These data help to assess and inform forest policies, which contribute towards the sustainable development of forest resources through preserving the ecological integrity of this landscape. © 2020 Biodiversity Conservancy International.

TI  - Impact Of Urban Expansion On Land Surface Temperature In Fuzhou, China Using Landsat Imagery
AB  - Seven Landsat images were used to assess urban expansion and the corresponding thermal characteristics in Fuzhou City, China between 1985 and 2015. The urban surface thermal patterns were investigated by retrieving land surface temperature using a single-window algorithm based on atmospheric calibration. The built-up area doubled from 1985 (10.6 %) to 2015 (23.4 %), mostly from cropland conversions in the urban fringe, and was closely associated with population increase (R2 = 0.93), gross domestic production GDP (R2 = 0.97), and fixed asset investments (R2 = 0.9139), illustrating the contributions of socioeconomic factors to rapid urban expansion. The daytime heating effect (heat source) in urban areas was strongly related to urban expansion, with a high percentage of an impervious surface usually associated with a high surface temperature. The average range over which wetlands affected built-up area, farmland, and road was 381, 321, and 347 m, respectively. The area of influence on construction land and road was 151 and 11 km2, respectively, whereas the average value for farmland was 147 km2. The area of wetland influence decreased during the study period, and therefore one explanation for the increase in the urban heat island (UHI) in Fuzhou City was the weakened cooling effect of wetland. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Long-Term Exposure And Health Risk Assessment From Air Pollution: Impact Of Regional Scale Mobility
AB  - Background: The negative effect of air pollution on human health is widely reported in recent literature. It typically involves urbanized areas where the population is concentrated and where most primary air pollutants are produced. A comprehensive health risk assessment is therefore of strategic importance for health authorities. Methods: In this study we propose a methodology to perform an indirect and retrospective health risk assessment of all-cause mortality associated with long-term exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) in a typical Monday to Friday working week. A combination of satellite-based settlement data, model-based air pollution data, land use, demographics and regional scale mobility, allowed to examine the effect of population mobility and pollutants daily variations on the health risk. A Health Risk Increase (HRI) metric was derived on the basis of three components: hazard, exposure and vulnerability, utilizing the relative risk values from the World Health Organization. An additional metric, the Health Burden (HB) was formulated, which accounts for the total number of people exposed to a certain risk level. Results: The effect of regional mobility patterns on the HRI metric was assessed, resulting in an increased HRI associated with all three stressors when considering a dynamic population compared to a static one. The effect of diurnal variation of pollutants was only observed for NO2 and O3. For both, the HRI metric resulted in significantly higher values during night. Concerning the HB parameter, we identified the commuting flows of the population as the main driver in the resulting metric. Conclusions: This indirect exposure assessment methodology provides tools to support policy makers and health authorities in planning intervention and mitigation measures. The study was carried out in Lombardy, Italy, one of the most polluted regions in Europe, but the incorporation of satellite data makes our approach valuable for studying global health. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Hydrologic And Water Quality Integration Tool: Hydrowamit
AB  - A spatially distributed and continuous hydrologic model focusing on total maximum daily load (TMDL) projects was developed. Hydrologic models frequently used for TMDLs such as the hydrologic simulation program-FORTRAN (HSPF), soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), and generalized watershed loading function (GWLF) differ considerably in terms of spatial resolution, simulated processes, and linkage flexibility to external water quality models. The requirement of using an external water quality model for simulating specific processes is not uncommon. In addition, the scale of the watershed and water quality modeling, and the need for a robust and cost-effective modeling framework justify the development of alternative watershed modeling tools for TMDLs. The hydrologic and water quality integration tool (HydroWAMIT) is a spatially distributed and continuous time model that incorporates some of the features of GWLF and HSPF to provide a robust modeling structure for TMDL projects. HydroWAMIT operates within the WAMIT structure, developed by Omni Environmental LLC for the Passaic River TMDL in N. J. HydroWAMIT is divided into some basic components: the hydrologic component, responsible for the simulation of surface flow and baseflow from subwatersheds; the nonpoint-source (NPS) component, responsible for the calculation of the subwatershed NPS loads; and the linkage component, responsible for linking the flows and loads from HydroWAMIT to the water quality analysis simulation program (WASP). HydroWAMIT operates with the diffusion analogy flow model for flow routing. HydroWAMIT provides surface runoff, baseflow and associated loads as outputs for a daily timestep, and is relatively easy to calibrate compared to hydrologic models like HSPF. HydroWAMIT assumes that the soil profile is divided into saturated and unsaturated layers. The water available in the unsaturated layer directly affects the surface runoff from pervious areas. Surface runoff from impervious areas is calculated separately according to precipitation and the impervious fractions of the watershed. Baseflow is given by a linear function of the available water in the saturated zone. The utility of HydroWAMIT is illustrated for the North Branch and South Branch Raritan River Watershed (NSBRW) in New Jersey. The model was calibrated, validated, and linked to the WASP. The NPS component was tested for total dissolved solids. Available weather data and point-source discharges were used to prepare the meteorological and flow inputs for the model. Digital land use, soil type datasets, and digital elevation models were used for determining input data parameters and model segmentation. HydroWAMIT was successfully calibrated and validated for monthly and daily flows for the NSBRW outlet. The model statistics obtained using HydroWAMIT are comparable with statistics of HSPF and SWAT applications for medium and large drainage areas. The results show that HydroWAMIT is a feasible alternative to HSPF and SWAT, especially for large-scale TMDLs that require particular processes for water quality simulation and minor hydrologic model calibration effort. © 2008 ASCE.

TI  - Mapping Lulc Dynamics And Its Potential Implication On Forest Cover In Malam Jabba Region With Landsat Time Series Imagery And Random Forest Classification
AB  - Pakistan has an annual deforestation rate of 4.6% which is the second highest in Asia. It has been described by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that the deforestation rate increased from 1.8–2.2% within two decades (1980–2000 and 2000–2010). KPK (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Pakistan’s northwestern province, holds 31% of the country’s total forest resources, the majority of which are natural forests. The Malam Jabba region, known for its agro-forestry practices, has undergone significant changes in its agricultural, forestry, and urban development. Agricultural and built-up land increased by 77.6% in the last four decades, and significant changes in land cover especially loss in forest, woodland, and agricultural land were observed due to flood disasters since 1980. For assessing and interpreting land-cover dynamics, particularly for changes in natural resources such as evergreen forest cover, remote sensing images are valuable assets. This study proposes a framework to assess the changes in vegetation cover in the Malam Jabba region during the past four decades with Landsat time series data. The random forest classifier (RF) was used to analyze the forest, woodland, and other land cover changes over the past four decades. Landsat MMS, TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite images were used as inputs for the random forest (RF) classifier. The vegetation cover change for each period was calculated from the pixels using vegetation indices such as NDVI, SAVI, and VCI. The results show that Malam Jabba’s total forest land area in 1980 was about 236 km2 and shrank to 152 km2 by 2020. The overall loss rate of evergreen forests was 35.3 percent. The mean forest cover loss rate occurred at 2.1 km2/year from 1980 to 2020. The area of woodland forest decreased by 87 km2 (25.43 percent) between 1980 and 2020. Other landcover increased by 121% and covered a total area of 178 km2. The overall accuracy was about 94% and the value of the kappa coefficient was 0.92 for the change in forest and woodland cover. In conclusion, this study can be beneficial to researchers and decision makers who are enthusiastic about using remote sensing for monitoring and planning the development of LULC at the regional and global scales. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Land Use And Land Cover Change Prediction Using Ann-Ca Model
AB  - Land cover changes are characterised by the loss of natural resources, the loss of forests to urban development or the loss of agricultural areas to urban growth. This study applies the artificial neural network (ANN) method in cellular automata (CA) modelling to predict the changes, pattern and transition matrix of land use and land cover (LULC) changes for three decades with 10-year intervals: 1995-2005, 2005-2015 and 2015-2025. The maps for 1995, 2005 and 2015 obtained from Landsat 8 images are classified using the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm with overall accuracies of 86%, 84% and 80%, respectively. Then, the prediction of LULC for 2025 is made after using the real map to satisfactorily validate the predicted map for 2015 derived from the map of 1995-2005, with the correctness percentage of 82.86 and the overall Kappa coefficients of 0.75. The forest cover shows a high decrement in the first 10-year period (44.87%). This trend is in line with the increasing areas of LULC for oil palm cultivation and urban development until 2025. Stable transitions can be observed from the ANN-CA model transition matrix, with values of 0.644, 0.541 and 0.787 transitions in 1995-2005, 2005-2015 and 2015-2025, respectively, for the forest area. For the urban area, the transition has been observed as 0.595, 0.736 and 0.954 in 1995-2005, 2005-2015 and 2015-2025, respectively. Meanwhile, oil palm only shows a stable transition of land-use changes in the second 20-year period, 2005-2015 with 0.606 and 2015-2025 with 0.843. The simulation of LULC changes in this study using the ANN-CA modelling can be a useful decision-making support tool to gauge the sustainability of urban area expansion, agricultural cultivation and production, as well as conservation of the remaining forest areas. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

TI  - Application Of A Gis-/Remote Sensing-Based Approach For Predicting Groundwater Potential Zones Using A Multi-Criteria Data Mining Methodology
AB  - This study integrates the application of Dempster-Shafer-driven evidential belief function (DS-EBF) methodology with remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to analyze surface and subsurface data sets for the spatial prediction of groundwater potential in Perak Province, Malaysia. The study used additional data obtained from the records of the groundwater yield rate of approximately 28 bore well locations. The processed surface and subsurface data produced sets of groundwater potential conditioning factors (GPCFs) from which multiple surface hydrologic and subsurface hydrogeologic parameter thematic maps were generated. The bore well location inventories were partitioned randomly into a ratio of 70\%(19 wells) for model training to 30\% (9 wells) for model testing. Application results of the DS-EBF relationship model algorithms of the surface- and subsurface-based GPCF thematic maps and the bore well locations produced two groundwater potential prediction (GPP) maps based on surface hydrologic and subsurface hydrogeologic characteristics which established that more than 60\% of the study area falling within the moderate-high groundwater potential zones and less than 35\% falling within the low potential zones. The estimated uncertainty values within the range of 0 to 17\% for the predicted potential zones were quantified using the uncertainty algorithm of the model. The validation results of the GPP maps using relative operating characteristic curve method yielded 80 and 68\% success rates and 89 and 53\% prediction rates for the subsurface hydrogeologic factor (SUHF)- and surface hydrologic factor (SHF)-based GPP maps, respectively. The study results revealed that the SUHF-based GPP map accurately delineated groundwater potential zones better than the SHF-based GPP map. However, significant information on the low degree of uncertainty of the predicted potential zones established the suitability of the two GPP maps for future development of ground-water resources in the area. The overall results proved the efficacy of the data mining model and the geospatial technology in groundwater potential mapping.

TI  - Analysing The Spatio-Temporal Patterns Of Vegetation Dynamics And Their Responses To Climatic Parameters In Meghalaya From 2001 To 2020
AB  - Quantification of the spatio-temporal trends in vegetation dynamics and its drivers is crucial to ensure sustainable management of ecosystems. The north-eastern state of Meghalaya possessing an idiosyncratic climatic regime has been undergoing tremendous pressure in the past decades considering the recent climate change scenario. A robust trend analysis has been performed using the MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1) data (2001–2020) along with multi-source gridded climate data (precipitation and temperature) to detect changes in the vegetation dynamics and corresponding climatic variables by employing the Theil-Sen Median trend test and Mann–Kendall test (τ). The spatial variability of trends was gauged with respect to 7 major forest types, administrative boundaries and different elevational gradients found in the area. Results revealed a large positive inter-annual trend (85.48%) with a minimal negative trend (14.52%) in the annual mean NDVI. Mean Annual Precipitation presents a negative trend in 66.97% of the area mainly concentrated in the eastern portion of the state while the western portion displays a positive trend in about 33.03% of the area. Temperature exhibits a 98% positive trend in Meghalaya. Pettitt Change Point Detection revealed three major breakpoints viz., 2010, 2012 and 2014 in the NDVI values from 2001 to 2020 over the forested region of Meghalaya. A consistent future vegetation trend (87.78%) in Meghalaya was identified through Hurst Exponent. A positive correlation between vegetation and temperature was observed in about 82.81% of the area. The western portion of the state was seen to reflect a clear correlation between NDVI and rainfall as compared to the eastern portion where NDVI is correlated more with temperature than rainfall. A gradual deviation of rainfall towards the west was identified which might be feedback of the increasing significant greening observed in the state in the recent decades. This study, therefore, serves as a decadal archive of forest dynamics and also provides an insight into the long-term impact of climate change on vegetation which would further help in investigating and projecting the future ecosystem dynamics in Meghalaya. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - A Comparison Of Urban Heat Islands Mapped Using Skin Temperature, Air Temperature, And Apparent Temperature (Humidex), For The Greater Vancouver Area
AB  - Apparent temperature is more closely related to mortality during extreme heat events than other temperature variables, yet spatial epidemiology studies typically use skin temperature (also known as land surface temperature) to quantify heat exposure because it is relatively easy to map from satellite data. An empirical approach to map apparent temperature at the neighborhood scale, which relies on publicly available weather station observations and spatial data layers combined in a random forest regression model, was demonstrated for greater Vancouver, Canada. Model errors were acceptable (cross-validated RMSE=2.04°C) and the resulting map of apparent temperature, calibrated for a typical hot summer day, corresponded well with past temperature research in the area. A comparison with field measurements as well as similar maps of skin temperature and air temperature revealed that skin temperature was poorly correlated with both air temperature (R2=0.38) and apparent temperature (R2=0.39). While the latter two were more similar (R2=0.87), apparent temperature was predicted to exceed air temperature by more than 5°C in several urban areas as well as around the confluence of the Pitt and Fraser rivers. We conclude that skin temperature is not a suitable proxy for human heat exposure, and that spatial epidemiology studies could benefit from mapping apparent temperature, using an approach similar to the one reported here, to better quantify differences in heat exposure that exist across an urban landscape. © 2015.

TI  - Trends Of Resistance To Antimicrobials Recommended Currently And In The Past For Management Of Gonorrhea In The Apex Std Center In India And Comparison Of Antimicrobial Resistance Profile Between 2002-2006 And 2007-2012
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae jeopardizes public health and continues to spread out to currently recommended and older antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance provides essential clues toward the modification of treatment guidelines. The aim of the study was to determine gonococcal AMR profile and trends between 2007 and 2012 and to evaluate any change in AMR profile in comparison with published trends in 2002 to 2006. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 261 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from consecutive patients between 2007 and 2012 was determined for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefpodoxime) and azithromycin by the disk diffusion technique and the Etest method. P value was determined using χ2 test for comparisons of trends between the 2 periods. Results: In comparison of AMR trends between 2002-2006 and 2007-2012, penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains increased significantly from 21.2% to 47.9% (P < 0.0001), 13.6% to 25.3% (P = 0.0002), and 78% to 89.7% (P = 0.0001), respectively. An insignificant increase from 2.4% to 4.2% (P > 0.05) in decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and 0.8% to 1.5% (P > 0.05) for azithromycin resistance was observed. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin over both the periods, except for one isolate in 2002. Conclusions: The study highlights that there is a continuous increase in resistance to previously recommended antibiotics despite their disuse for treatment. The increase in number of strains with decreased susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin resistance, currently recommended for management of gonorrhea, is of serious concern. These trends should be monitored continuously to change antibiotic policy. Copyright © 2015 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association All rights reserved.
