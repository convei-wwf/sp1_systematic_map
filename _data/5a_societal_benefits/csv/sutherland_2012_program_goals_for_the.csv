1,"the analysis concludes that international partnerships represent a strong potential partner for certain science missions with greater potential value delivery than currently-prioritized efforts with defense stakeholders and concludes that weather and land-use missions, in addition to climate missions, should be given highest priority; water, human health, and solid earth missions should be given lower priority based on each science category’s potential for delivering value to the entire stakeholder network."

10,earth science decadal survey stakeholder value network analysis achieving the vision of the decadal survey: a formal interagency planning and review process should be put into a science & technology advisory body should periodically review the status of place that focuses on effectively implementing the committee the earth observation program and should continually reassess key assumptions recommendations and sustaining and building the knowledge and from the decadal survey.
10,the advisory body should use sophisticated stakeholder information systems for the next decade and beyond. (pp. 3e16) analysis and system architecture modeling tools to recommend changes to the program based on the updated progress and key assumptions.

(pp. 3e10) commercial data users, including mission cost-sharing, development of new commercial markets for data, and commercial licensing agreements for data access."
10,additional recommendations from stakeholder value network analysis:  nasa & noaa should prioritize cooperative efforts with international partners over cooperation with the department of defense or other federal agencies.
10,investing resources to cooperate with international partners provides the strongest feedback loops to deliver value to the entire stakeholder network and return value to nasa & noaa.
10, nasa & noaa should seek some cooperation with other federal agencies for missions related to human health & security and solid earth hazards & natural resources.
10,"these missions return relatively less value to nasaa & noaa than weather, climate change, and land-use missions."
10,"partners for these missions might include usgs, department of energy, national institutes of health, environmental protection agency, or center for disease control."
10," nasa should provide funding and other resources to support the development of low-cost, reliable medium-lift launch vehicles by commercial industry."
10,the potential retirement of the delta ii launch vehicle and the excess cost of using larger launch vehicles are major issues currently facing nasa.
10,a commercially available medium-lift launch vehicle would generate signiﬁcant value to nasa/noaa and the entire stakeholder network.
10," nasa & noaa should investigate the use of marketing, branding or other means to inform recipients of knowledge and users of earth observation-derived products and services that the information originated with nasa & noaa earth observation missions."
10,"in long value chains involving multiple stakeholders, it may be difﬁcult or impossible to know that a particular value ﬂow is part of a chain that originated with an output from nasa & noaa."
10,"keeping the public, beneﬁciaries, and advocacy groups more aware of nasa & noaa’s programs will help increase public support for favorable policy direction and funding for nasa & noaa in the future."
