6,"has limitations in retrieving the very high winds in hurricanes and typhoons due to system design and resolution, and the impact of rain (brennan et al., in press)."
6,"however, in tcs undergoing extratropical transition (e.g., jones et al., 2003), quikscat can provide valuable information on both the cyclone’s inten- sity and wind field size, as the coverage of heavy rainfall is typically reduced near the location of maximum winds."
6,the broad geographic coverage of quikscat osvw often provides the only consistent source of information for the analysis of 34-kt and 50-kt wind radii in tcs that are not sampled by aircraft reconnaissance (figure 3).
6,these wind radii are critical figure 3.
6,"thirty-four knot wind radii (blue line) as indicated by quikscat in a pass over hurricane for defining ship avoidance areas and katrina (2005), with available ship and buoy observations (yellow barbs indicate wind speed in kt). helping to refine the placement of coastal the accuracy of the quikscat analysis of the 34-kt radii in this situation provides forecasters with the confidence to use quikscat for tropical cyclone 34-kt and sometimes 50-kt wind radii deter- warnings."
6,"emergency management offi- mination, especially in the open ocean where ship and buoy observations are sparse. cials often require that evacuation prepa- rations be completed by the time that the 34-kt winds reach the local coastline."
6,"the detection and location of surface circulation centers is another important use of quikscat data, which have been used as justification to both initiate advi- sories for incipient cyclones and declare cyclones that no longer have well-defined centers dissipated."
6,"however, errors in the automated quikscat wind solution, particularly in tcs, often require manual analysis of directional ambiguities for operational center fixing applications (e.g., brennan et al., in press)."
6,"accurate tc center fixes are critical to deter- mining the tc’s initial position and motion, which are important for accu- rate tc track forecasting."
6,"additionally, information on the location of the tc figure 4."
6,the broad swath of quikscat winds allows forecasters to examine the character of swell generation regions in cyclones.
6,"also, despite frequent errors in tropical cyclone (tc) surface center relative to the cyclone’s center location in the automated quikscat solution, manual analysis of directional ambigui- organized thunderstorm activity is vital ties can be performed to locate the tc centers using all the possible quikscat solutions."
6,this tool has been essential for detection and center location of pacific tcs not sampled by aircraft to accurate satellite-derived intensity reconnaissance flights.

7,forecasters use quikscat wind fields to determine potential swell generation associated with tcs as shown in the left image of figure 4.
7,"in this example, forecasters can estimate fetch lengths, average wind speed, and dispersion pattern for swell."
7,"the use of quikscat at nhc has increased steadily since 2000, and has now reached the point where quikscat is mentioned in 15–20% of nhc’s trop- ical cyclone discussions in the atlantic and east pacific basins (figure 5)."

7,"prior to quikscat, it was very difficult to obtain any information on wind intensity and coverage during these events."
7,"using quikscat data, a multi-year climatology of gale- and storm-force tehuantepec events was constructed (brennan et al., 2007), allowing nhc marine forecasters to identify forecast model biases and issue more accurate and timely warnings for these events."
