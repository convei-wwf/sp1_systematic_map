1,the potential usability and benefits of seasonal climate forecasts (scf) to help inform decision- making processes is widely accepted.
1,"however, the practical use of scf in europe is still fairly recent and, as such, current knowledge of the added benefits of scf in supporting and improving decision-making is limited."
1,this study is based on research conducted to co-develop a semi-operational climate service prototype – the land management tool (lmtool) – with farmers in south west regions of the uk.
1,the value of the scf provided to the farmers was examined to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farmers’ decisions during the winter months of 2015/2016.
1,"the findings from the study point to the need to explore and develop (new) research methods capable of addressing the complexity of the decision-making processes, such as those in the farming sector."
1,"the farmers who used the scf perceived it as useful and usable as it helped them change and adapt their decision-making and thus, avoid unnecessary costs."
1,"however, to fully grasp the potential value of using scf, farmers emphasised the need for the provision of scf for longer periods of time to allow them to build trust and confidence in the information provided."
1,this paper contributes to ongoing discussions about how to assess the use and value of scf in decision-making processes in a meaningful and effective way.

2,this study is based on research conducted under the eu euporias project (see www.euporias.eu) where a semi- operational climate service prototype – the land manage- ment tool (lmtool) – was co-developed with farmers in the southwest region of the uk.
2,the scf were jointly co- developed and provided to the farmers to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farm- ers’ decisions during the winter months of 2016.
2,"this pa- per aims to contribute to wider discussions on the usability and value of climate information, such as scf, in decision- making and how to assess it in a meaningful way."
2,"the next section briefly describes the lmtool, sect. 3 explains how the use and value of scf was studied in the context of the tool developed, and sect. 4 presents main challenges and re- flections from the analysis performed regarding the use and value of scf to support the farmers’ decisions."
