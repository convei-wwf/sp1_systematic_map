2,norris mesoscale weather networks can provide improved weather information to agricultural producers.
2,"this technology can potentially improve production decisions, reduce irrigation and pesticide inputs, and reduce weather-related losses."
2,developing a mesoscale network to disseminate real-time mesoscale weather information requires a substantial investment.
2,"in addition, there are costs associated with maintenance of the system and distribution of the information available."
2,"while public funds may be available to support initial development of the system, there may be less public support for maintaining the system and subsidizing users' access to the information."
2,"this study uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of oklahoma farmers and ranchers, as one set of potential users, to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information."
2,the results indicate that agricultural producers are willing to pay only a modest fee for improved weather information.
2,"gross sales, irrigation, and past weather losses are among the factors shown to significantly impact willingness to pay."
2,"key words: contingent valuation, decision aids, mesoscale weather information introduction flooding in the midwest during 1992 and 1995 underscores how weather contributes to the overall risk faced by farmers and ranchers."
2,"precipitation and other climatic variables affect a producer's decisions regarding input timing and usage, irrigation scheduling, and market- ing decisions."
2,producers also assess current wind conditions in order to apply chemicals safely or to undertake controlled burning activities.
2,weather conditions directly affect producers' income and profitability.
2,advances in technology have made it feasible to improve the quality of weather information and interpreted weather information products.
2,a good example is the develop- ment of mesoscale weather networks.
2,this new technology provides more timely and accurate weather information by using a denser network of observation points and more frequent observations.
2,"however, access to these improved weather information networks will be more expensive than current weather information sources."
2,"in 1990, researchers in oklahoma began work on a $2.7 million mesoscale weather network which is referred to as ""mesonet."""
2,"the annual costs of maintaining and operating the mesonet system have been estimated to be between $500,000 and $700,000."
2,"because mesonet offers important data for a number of public uses, several public sources are expected to assist with financial support for the system."
2,"however, user fees are also expected to provide support for the system."
2,the development and support of agricultural decision aids based on the mesoscale data also depend on projected user fee revenues.

3,"the important question raised by the developers of mesonet w producers could be expected to pay in user fees to receive interpreted weather data, and weather information-related decisi have documented the theoretical value of good weather information (katz, murphy, and winkler; tice and clouser; sonka et al."

3,"however, there has been little previous resea agricultural producers (and other decision makers) to pay for improv in a michigan study, over half of the respondents to a survey indicated that timely weather information had a monetary valu although these producers may have been indicating their weath they were not asked about their willingness to pay for weather and dugas found that, on average, texas producers were willing to p weather information and from $24/month to $1 18/month for perf depending on how far in advance the forecasts were provided. designed as a contingent valuation of willingness to pay and th measurement of willingness to pay as ""a pragmatic attempt to e usefulness of weather information provided to texas farmers"" previous studies have documented the usefulness of weather in producers, none have used the contingent valuation method to o of farmers' willingness to pay for weather information as a measur weather data."
3,this study fills that gap.
3,while the mesonet dev information presented a unique opportunity to apply the contingent study faced both time and financial constraints.
3,"thus, the study als to determine whether the contingent valuation method can provide time and resources are limited."
3,"synoptic versus mesoscale weather data agricultural producers receive weather information from a va television, radio, weather scanners, newspapers, other producer (mcnew et al.)."
3,in most states the weather information available and through the u.s.

4,"358 december 1995 journal of agricultural and resource economics advantage of a mesoscale network in providing more localized weather infor be realized when the time between observations can be measured in minutes rather than hours, that is, real-time or near real-time reporting."
4,mesoscale networks record weather events which would be missed by synoptic observations (fujita).
4,"a mesoscale network can also supply agricultural users with new variables such as solar radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture, and wind gusts (important for spraying and controlled burning) which, due to differentials in local conditions, are not meaningful when provided on a synoptic scale."
4,"in the longer run, mesoscale information can be used to establish local climatological data bases which can be used to determine variables such as first and last frosts, rainfall patterns, and other information which helps to determine the feasibility of specific agricul- tural enterprises in a given area (thomson)."
4,"mesoscale weather data also provide potential for improving weather forecasts, although the development of mesoscale-based forecasts has been hampered by inadequate data availability and computer resources (smith et al.)."
4,"like many improvements in technology, the development of mesoscale weather networks is costly."
4,"a mesoscale network requires a large number of stations, high quality automated measuring systems, and the computer capabilities to compile and analyze the data (thom- son)."
4,realizing the full benefits of improved mesoscale weather information and forecasts will also require that new systems be developed to disseminate information to users in a timely fashion (smith et al.).
4,"despite the potential benefits of a mesoscale weather network, agricultural producers will incur costs, in terms of time and money, in gaining access to this improved weather data."
4,"the oklahoma mesoscale network because of oklahoma's diverse climate, currently available (synoptic) weather data often do not reflect the local conditions faced by agricultural producers."
4,rainfall varies from 16 inches in the western portion of the panhandle to over 54 inches in the southeastern region.
4,"elevations range from 300 feet above sea level in the southeast to over 4,900 feet in the western panhandle."
4,"crop and forage varieties range from gulf-coastal, warm-season types to cool-season varieties."
4,irrigated crop production is substantial in several regions while dryland crop production occurs throughout the state.
4,cattle production systems range from extensive cow/calf operations in eastern and central oklahoma to small-grain grazing of stocker cattle in the wheat-producing areas and intensive feedlot operations in the western panhandle (mcnew et al.).
4,"because of this variability in climate and agricultural enterprises, oklahoma provides an ideal location to assess the benefits of a mesoscale network."
4,"the oklahoma mesoscale network, which was officially dedicated in march 1994, consists of 1 1 1 automated observing stations with an average separation of 19 miles."
4,"the stations record 15 weather parameters at five-minute intervals and relay the information to a base station located in the oklahoma climatological survey in norman, oklahoma."
4,"the base station employs a mainframe computer to compile, analyze, and check the information from the various stations."
4,weather data and weather information products are then distributed to paid subscribers via computer networks and computer bulletin boards.
4,"the oklahoma mesonet also provides the opportunity to develop ""value-added"" weather information products which are based on the mesoscale weather data."
4,"an irrigation sched- uling program, for example, determines potential evapotranspiration values based on 1 5- minute weather data averages, the stage of crop development, and soil wetness."

6,"if zu and ziu and upper limits of the ith interval, the corresponding log-likelihood functio (2) lnl = ¿{ln»(z/ll)-*(z//)]}."
6,the maximum likelihood approach was used for this study to estimate willingness to pay for mesoscale weather data and to determine characteristics of producers which might be used to identify those producers particularly interested in accessing mesoscale weather data.
6,"a lognormal distribution for willingness to pay was used, and parameter estimates were obtained using limdep's grouped data procedure (greene)."
6,the independent variables included in the maximum likelihood model are defined in table 1 .
6,"farm or ranch characteristics hypothesized to increase interest in mesoscale weather information and thereby increase a producer's willingness to pay include cotton, peanut or alfalfa production, and a high level of past weather-related losses."
6,cotton producers might value weather information more highly than other farmers.
6,soil temperature is an important factor in the timing of cotton planting.
6,the number of degree days before the first frost in the fall is also an important yield and quality determinant.
6,peanut production is another high input crop affected by weather conditions.
6,peanut producers would be expected to have a strong interest in spraying conditions and in plant disease and insect models.
6,alfalfa hay is another example of a high value crop where good drying conditions are essential at the time of harvest.
6,alfalfa is also susceptible to insects and plant diseases which are exacerbated by weather conditions.
6,gross sales is hypothesized to be positively related to willingness to pay for weather information.
6,the relationships between willingness to pay and total acreage and willingness to pay and number of crops are difficult to predict.
6,"generally, one might expect producers with larger operations to exhibit a higher willingness to pay."
6,"however, in oklahoma, producers with larger acreages tend to focus on production of wheat and cattle, while the producers with smaller acreages may grow crops, such as peanuts or vegetables, which are this content downloaded from 128.111.196.204 on mon, 29 apr 2024 22:43:51 +00:00 all use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

8,"362 december 1995 journal of agricultural and resource economics demonstrated willingness to pay for management, marketing, and weather i this reason, these individuals might be expected to be more willing to pay f the other hand, these subscribers already have access to a wide variety of w information and forecasts."
8,farming experience and higher education levels are hypothesized to increase willingness to pay for weather information since farmers who have been farming longer would be more aware of weather risk and more highly educated farmers would be more capable of applying additional information.
8,the expected difference between full-time and part-time farmers with respect to willingness to pay is ambiguous.
8,part-time farmers are obviously less reliant on farming income and are therefore less susceptible to weather risk.
8,"on the other hand, they may have less time available for management and, consequently, might have a higher willingness to pay for decision aids."
8,farmers with heavier debt loads are expected to have a higher willingness to pay for weather information since they have less capacity to absorb weather-related losses.
8,survey design data to estimate the empirical model of willingness to pay for mesonet access was obtained from a mail survey of oklahoma producers.
8,the division of agricultural sciences and natural resources at oklahoma state university maintains a list of 1371 producers who have agreed to respond to surveys on particular topics.
8,"although weather data collection was not one of the topics agreed to by the participating producers, a sample of 508 was selected from the list to obtain representation from cotton, peanut, alfalfa, wheat, and diversified-crop and livestock producers."
8,"in addition, a sample of 137 irrigated-crop pro- ducers was selected from the 5,959 producers holding current irrigation permits."
8,"since the survey population consisted of producers who had previous links with oklahoma state university or producers with irrigation permits, it is likely biased toward larger, higher income operations."
8,"however, this sample is representative of types of producers who would be targeted to subscribe to mesonet."
8,survey design followed guidelines set out by dillman.
8,the survey questions were designed to be understandable to agricultural producers.
8,researchers and extension special- ists who routinely survey producers on other topics reviewed the survey format and wording.
8,the survey was pretested by county agents and a small group of producers.
8,the survey instruments were constructed in booklet form and mailed to recipients with a cover letter describing the purpose of the survey and a return postage-paid envelope.
8,"because of time and money constraints, follow-up mailings of the survey form were not made to nonrespon- dents."
8,surveys were received by 623 producers and surveys were returned by 175 producers.
8,"thus, not counting undeliverable surveys, the response rate was 28%."
8,'the list was compiled in 1989 using names of farmers and ranchers submitted by county extension staff.
8,a preliminary survey of the producers revealed the areas about which they would be willing to respond.
8,subjects of surveys regularly conducted in the state using this list include cropland- and pasture-leasing rates and custom hire rates.
8,the most recent other survey effort using this list (cropland- and pasture-leasing rates) obtained a 32% response rate.
8,"mitchell and carson have observed that response rates for mail surveys used in contingent value studies are generally quite low, with some response rates below 20% reported in the literature."
8,the low response rates raise questions about how the results of analyses using the survey data can be interpreted and expanded to aggregate values.
8,the response rate for this study could have been increased with the follow-up mailings recommended by dillman.
8,"however, time and financial constraints precluded that follow-up."
8,"although the response rate for this study equals or exceeds that reported in a number of studies, the implications of the low response rate for interpretation and expansion of results are addressed in a later section."

9,"the average annual gross income was approximately $154,000."
9,the average proportion of gross income needed to service long-term debt (a measure of producer's ability to bear risk) was approximately 20%.
9,the majority of the respondents either owned or had access to a computer.
9,"however, less than 7% had ever used a computer bulletin board service."
9,thirty-four percent of the respondents subscribed to an agricultural information service.
9,"based on the published fees for the information services selected, most of these producers are paying around $30/month for agricultural information."
9,"on average, the respondents also paid $73/year for agricultural magazines."

13,"for the raw data/value-added combination model, sales, irrigation, and weather-related losses were found to significantly impact willingness to pay."
13,"the relationships of sales, irrigation, and weather-related losses to willingness to pay were again positive, as expected."
13,the impact of sales is again slight.
13,"irrigators bid about $0.76 per month higher than nonirrigators, and an increase of one point in the percentage of crop sales lost due to weather would mean a bid of $ 1 .40 more per month for the value-added information."
13,the coefficients for crop acres and number of crops were significant at the 0.15 and 0.16 levels.
13,"while the negative crop acres coefficient suggests that the diversification effect of larger acreages reduces the perceived value of weather data as a risk management tool, a positive coefficient on number of crops suggests the opposite."
13,"for the raw data/value-added model, the production of peanuts, cotton, or alfalfa did not significantly impact willingness to pay."
13,this was somewhat surprising since much of the proposed value-added weather information addresses problems and needs specific to those producers.
13,results from the maximum likelihood models were used to calculate mean and median willingness to pay for the raw weather data and the value-added information.
13,mean willingness to pay for the raw weather data was $5.83 per month (with a standard error of 0.58); the median was $4.05.
13,respondents indicated that they would pay only slightly more for the value-added weather information; the mean willingness to pay for both raw data and value-added information was $6.55 per month (with a standard error of 0.84).
13,"the median willingness to pay estimate for the raw data/value-added model ($3.85) was slightly lower than for the raw data model; this occurred because of the number of observations included in the raw data/value-added regression with a zero bid which were excluded, as protest bids, from the raw weather data model."
13,the cv method can also be used to estimate the aggregate value of the system.
13,mesonet's developers are interested in the aggregate willingness-to-pay estimate because it represents the value of the system to agricultural producers.
13,"if public funds were to be used instead of user fees, officials would require information on the value of the system to justify the expenditure of public funds."
13,the aggregate willingness-to-pay estimate also provides an upper limit on the proportion of annual operating and development costs which can be recovered from agricultural user fees.
13,"the actual revenue which could be collected would be less than the calculated aggregate value, unless the mesonet developers could implement a system of perfect price discrimination which captured all consumer surplus."
13,"based on alternatives for aggregating mean willingness to pay which have been applied in the literature (loomis; mitchell and carlson), a range within which the aggregate value this content downloaded from 128.111.196.204 on mon, 29 apr 2024 22:43:51 +00:00 all use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

14,"to calculate an upper bound on the value of agricultural users' willingness to pay, the mean willingness to pay estim study could be aggregated over the population of commercial agricultural produ in oklahoma) (u.s."
14,dept. of commerce).
14,the implicit assumption is that the non have the same willingness to pay as the survey respondents.
14,on the conservative end bound could be obtained by assuming that the proportion of commercial produ to pay for mesonet access is equal to the proportion of the survey sample that a willingness-to-pay questions.5 this would imply a zero willingness to pay for n dents.
14,when the survey respondents are not representative of the population su also necessary to adjust for this bias in the calculation of aggregate values.
14,"be demographic characteristics of the mesonet survey respondents were virtually the population of commercial producers (table 2), no adjustment was made conservative and optimistic assumptions about the willingness to pay of the nonresp the value of the raw mesonet weather data was calculated between $29,374 an per month."
14,"for the raw data/value-added information combination, aggregat calculated to lie between $34,943 and $186,364 per month."
14,"conclusions despite the perceived usefulness of weather information and the impact of weather on farm income and profitability, agricultural producers do not appear to be willing to pay significant fees to access improved weather information."
14,"results indicate that, on average, producers are willing to pay $5.83 per month for raw mesoscale weather data and $6.55 per month for the raw data plus value-added weather-related products."
14,"given that the cost to operate and maintain the basic mesonet system is expected to be $500,000 to $700,000 per year, the anticipated income from user fees could cover as much as half of those costs, using the conservative estimate of aggregate willingness to pay for the raw weather data."
14,"the range of aggregate willingness to pay calculated for the raw data was $29,374 to $162,422 per month ($352,488 to $1,949,064 per year)."
14,"the value of the basic system to other users such as radio and tv stations, weather forecasters, and emergency information network operators may justify public investment in the program."
14,"however, it is unlikely that public investment could be justified (or obtained) to develop agriculture-specific products which benefit a single category of users."
14,"given agricultural producers' low willingness to pay for mesoscale weather information and decision aids, it also does not appear that the costs of developing and supporting these value-added decision aids can be recovered from agricultural user fees."
14,"results show that the value-added products would earn only an additional $5,569 to $23,942 per month from the user fees."
14,"the survey respondents clearly are not as optimistic as the mesonet developers in assessing the potential savings from using the mesonet system to eliminate unnecessary pesticide applications, reduce irrigation expenditures or identify more profitable crop 5to avoid overstating the upper bound, the population of 29,638 commercial producers was adjusted downward by the proportion of respondents who gave a protest bid."
14,"thus, for example, 6% of the population was not included for calculation of aggregate willingness to pay for the raw data, because the true demand for the data by the protest bidders is unknown."
14,"to calculate the conservative lower bound, only 17% of the population was used to calculate the aggregate willingness to pay for the raw data -that proportion of the sample responding to the willingness-to-pay question but not giving a protest bid."

15,"however, their stud in addition, they asked producers about their willingness assuming current weather information was not available. their willingness-to-pay decisions in the context of existing s the study results do provide some encouragement in ide to whom initial subscription efforts could be targeted."
15,irr gross farm income appear to be the best initial target aud of significance of past weather losses also suggests that weather-related losses are likely to be effective in encour improved weather information.
