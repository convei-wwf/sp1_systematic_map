9,the model has endoge- by enso events but also increase social welfare from water trans- neous prices and can apply three-stage decision trees to evaluate ferring activities.
9,it should be noted that such a value of enso the economic impacts of enso events on a regional water market information is the maximum value since the enso information is as well as evaluate the economic beneﬁt when such enso informa- assumed to have been perfectly predicted. tion is provided correctly.
9,"last, the empirical results of this study indicate that the enso events would cause nt$ 146 million eco- nomic damage in the northern taiwan water market, however, 6."
9,conclusions and policy implications the damage could be substantially mitigated through water man- agement when enso forecast information is provided.
9,a water the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the economic im- management strategy based on transferring water among different pacts of enso on the regional water markets in taiwan and then to groups is simulated in this paper.
9,the simulation results show that evaluate the information value of the effect of enso on this regio- water transferring activities could potentially increase social wel- nal water market through water management.
9,when the correct fare by as much as nt$ 370 million in this regional water market.
9,"enso information is provided, the water transferring strategy could be applied to mitigate the impact of enso on the regional economy."
9,three major ﬁndings are obtained.
9,"the ﬁrst one is that acknowledgements the effects of an el niño year on the precipitation in the northern taiwan region are positive during spring season, while la niña this work was partially supported by national science council causes negative effects on spring rainfall in this region."
9,such esti- of taiwan.
9,we do appreciate two anonymous reviewers and editor mation results have important policy implications for water supply for their valuable comments and suggestions.
