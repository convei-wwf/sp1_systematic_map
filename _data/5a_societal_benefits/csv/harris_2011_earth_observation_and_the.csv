1,in this context a public good has two main characteristics: non-rivalry and non- excludability.
1,"in their most common digital format, earth observation data can appear to be both non- rivalrous and non-excludable."
1,"however, it is not the digital medium itself which controls the ‘public- ness’ of a good but the conditions of access to that good."
1,"this paper explores the meaning of the concept of public goods in an earth observation context by, ﬁrst, examining public good theory and related concepts of categories of goods and, second, applying the concepts to nine earth observation missions, programmes and data."

3,"buchanan refers to a process of extending ownership rights to different groups of people so that only accredited consumers or users are permitted access to the good [16], and he proposed that a theory of clubs or club goods could “move one step closer to closing the awesome samuelson gap between the purely private and the purely public good” in support of a concept of a continuum of publicness where few qualify as purely private or purely public [17]."
3,"furthermore, buchanan asserts that few goods can be non-rivalrously enjoyed by groups of inﬁnite size e the original samuelson condition for pure publicness e yet many goods share elements of publicness in their consumption."

3,the landscape of goods discussed in this paper mapped on the two axes of buchanan are of burgeoning importance in earth observation and rivalry and excludability.

3,as membership numbers grow the per-swim cost decreases as unchanged or ﬁxed costs are borne by more users.
