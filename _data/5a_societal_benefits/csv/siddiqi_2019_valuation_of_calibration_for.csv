17,"summary remarks  value of calibration can be quantified with a conceptual 'data value chain’ that models the system from data acquisition to applications and decisions  three different methods were shown for quantifying impact and value of calibration – effective data acquired (eda), that quantifies data quality and quantity over regions of interest over a mission lifetime, can be used for mission design and trades studies and / or for optimizing calibration station locations – error analysis with analytical modeling can be used for quantifying impacts on data processing, computation of indices etc. – decision analysis methods, with comparing difference in value of decisions with information (and quality of information as represented by false positive and negative error rates) can be used to quantify impact of calibration on human decisions that affect socioeconomic outcomes 16"
