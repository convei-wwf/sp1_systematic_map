1,"wc iilid that if an optima; cotltroi policy is used under uncertainty, the eventual resolution of uncertainty has high value relative to current research budgets, and resolving uncertainty about the costs of warming is nearly as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming."
1,"in addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resnlution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program."
1,"on the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertamty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty, the benefit of early resoiution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater."
1,introduction and summary whi!
1,"e there is great disagreement about what policies, if any, are appropriate responses to the threat of global warming, there is fairly general agreement on the need for research to improve our understanding of the warming problem."
1,"nevertheless, there has been relatively little quantitative analysis of the value of information about global warming.’"

2,"in this paper, we use the carbon emissions trajectory assessment (ceta) model to investigate the value of information about global warming."
2,ceta is an economic growth and energy use mad?
2,"1 that also incorporates representations of greenhouse gas accumulation, global mean temperature rise, and the adaptation/damage cost associated with this temperature rise.”"
2,we begin our investigation of the value of information with a brief presentation of optimal policy for the central case parameter assumptions of the model.
2,this is followed by results indicating the sensitivity of optimal policies to variations in key parameters.
2,"if optimal policy changes signifi- car;ltly as a result of variation in a particular parameter, the value of information about that parameter is likely to be hith."
2,"continuing our investigation of the value of information, we use ceta in a simple decision tree framework to estimate the value of information about a few key model parameters."
2,"based on the sensitivity results, the key parameters on which we focus in this paper are those relating to the extent of warming and the costs of warming. 14 central issue concerns the choice of emissions control policy under uncertainty."
2,"in the standard decision analysis approach under uncertainty, the policy is set so as to maximize expected net benefits."
2,"however, the global warming problem is being considered in a highly political context involving governments of many countries with differing perspectives and interests."
2,"in this context, emissions control policies chosen in the absence of good information may be far from the optimal policy."
2,"thus we present results assuming both that the policy under uncertainty is optimc:‘, and that the policy is arbitrarily chosen in the political process, if policy under uncertainty is chosen to maximize expected net benefits, our results suggest that the value of information can be up to hundreds of billions of dollars; numbers of this magnitude justify devoting serious attention to resolving uncertainties."
2,"while the value of information is greatest for information regarding the potential warming anticipated from a given increase in co, concentration, the value of information regarding the future damage costs of warming and of adaptation to warming is nearly as great."
2,"since research budgets are now directed primarily at resolving scientific urcertainties like that about the extent of potential warming, it would appear that budgets for research on impacts and adaptation are relatively under-funded.3 although reso’r\gg uncertarnty produces a iarge benefit relative to not resolving cnccrtainty. the bencti!"

3,global warmbg uncevtainries 13 instead of 20 years from now is roughly 27: of the overall benefit of resolving uncertainty.
3,"this result is due to the fact that the optimal energy use policy in our model would be about the same over the next couple of decades, for any resolution of uncertainty about the key model parameters."
3,"however, by the middle of the next century, optimal energy use policies will become more sensitive to the key model parameters."
3,"consequently, the benefits of acceler- ating uncertainty resolution by 20 years w.ould blc much higher later on."
3,if the emissions control policy under uncertainty is assumed to be arbitrarily chosen in a real world politica!
3,"process, there is obviously a wide variety of possible policies that might result."
3,we consider two such policies: no emissions reductions and an emissions limit at the 1990 level.
3,"if these emissions control policies would be chosen under uncertainty, while optimal policies would be used once urrccr!"
3,"ainty is resoived, the value of resolving uncertainty now instead of twenty years from now is much greater - specifically, if the arbitrsry policy under uncertainty were to be no emissions reduction, the benefit of resolving uncertainty is an order of magnitude greater; and if the arbitrary policy were to be an emissions limit at the 1990 level, the benefit is three orders of magnitude greater."
3,"ceta model results and sensitivities as a prelude to using the ceta model to estimate the value of information, this section briefly describes the model, discusses our low, central, and high case values for key model parameters, shows model results for our ‘central case’ parameter value assumptions, and presents a brief summary of the sensitivity of the model’s results to variations in key parameters."

3,the results in this paper are obtained using an updated version of ceta.
3,"in the new version, the utility function is population times the logarithm of consumption per capita, instead of simpij the logarithm of consumption."
3,"the new utility function tends to increase marginal utility of consumption in the future relative to marginal utility of consumption now, because population grows over time."
3,"in addition, we now use a carbon cycle model aticpted from maier-reimer and hasselmann (198% in which carbon emissions fall into five classes with differing a:mospheric lifetimes of two years to infinity; before we had used a single class with a lifetime of 233 years."

4,"in the production submodel, energy, labor, and capital inputs are used to produce output which is then allocated to consumption, investment, energy costs, and damage costs of warming."
4,"because energy costs (and energy technology choices) are con- sidered together with warming damage costs, the time paths of coz emissions and carbon taxes in our model reflect an optimal balancing of the cost of emission reduction and the benefit of reduced global warming."

4,"we associate the label ‘low’ with the parameter value that implies warming is less of a problem, and ‘high’ with the value that implies warming is more of a problem."
4,"while we frequently are able to rely on some authority in setting the central case value, we typically can only offer our own rough estimates for the low and high case values; we think of the latter as 5 and 95 percent points on subjective cumulative probability distributions."

5,"thus, many para- meters in ceta play a role in determining future emissions."
5,in the following paragraphs we identify those we believe to be most important.’
5,the autonomous energy efficiency improvement rate (aeei) is the most important determinant of energy use per unit of gross production.

6,"teisberg, global warming uncertainties other cost of control related parameters include those affecting the cost of reducing future emissions."
6,there are two main ways in which future emissions may be reduced.
6,these are through energy conservation and through substitution of carbon-conserving energy for carbon-intensive energy.
6,"the more important mechanism in ceta is substitution, particularly of the non-electric backstop technology (which is carbon-free) for synthetic fuels made from coal (which are very carbon intensive)."
6,thus the price of the non-electric backstop technology is a key parameter affecting the cost of reducing future emi.ssions.

6,though the electric backstop is quantitative!
6,"y less important than the non-electric backstop, it remains a significant parameter affecting the cost of reducing future emissions, for the electric backstop price, we use low, central, and high cases of 37.5, 50, and 62.5 mills per kilowatthour."

6,"the carbon cycle is a complicated and poorly understood system by which cq2 emissions produce elevated atmospheric co; concentrations over decades or centuries follc,wing the emissions."
6,"in ceta, we represent the carbon cycle using the simple response fuflction estimated by maier-reimer and hasse!"
6,mann (1987).
6,"this response function, which summ’arizes the behavior of a coupled ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle model, effectiucly divides new carbon emissions into five classes, each with 8. different atmospheric lifetime ranging from infinity to two years."
6,total atmospheric co2 over time is thee the sum of atr;lospheric co2 across these five classes.
6,"our central case uses the ma&r-reimer and hassel.man co1 class fractions (0.13, 0.20, 0.32, 0.25, 0. lo), associalc-19 with lifetimes of infinity, 363, 74, 17, and 2 years, respectively."
6,"for our high case, we retain the same lifetimes, but change the fractions to: 0.16, 0.30, 0.32, 0.115,0.05."
6,"for our low case, we change= the fractions to; 0.08, 0.19, 0.32, 0.35, 0.15."
6,"associated with a given concentration of co, in the atmosphere is an equilibrium global mean surface temperature rise, or ‘potential warming’ from co,."
6,"commonly, predictions of warming arc: presented in term; of the potential warming expected from a doubled atmospheric co2 concentration - e.g. a warming of 3°c may result from doubled co1 concentration."

7,peck and tj.
7,"teisherg, global warming urrcertainties 77 potential warming function of co1 concentration, thus, we represent uncertainty about potential warming in terms of the potential warming function benchmark."
7,"we use 3°c as our central case, 1°c as our low case, and 5°c as our high case.6 in addition to cqz, there are other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming."
7,"among the more important are methane (ci-i,), nitrous oxide (iv@), and chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs)."
7,"also, there is a certain amount of co2 emissions which is due to deforestation and is independent of the energy sector."
7,"in ceta, we treat the emissions of these greenhouse gases as exogenous."
7,our central case for exogenous gas emissions in ceta is roughly consistent with ipcc scenario b.’
7,"to explore the implications of uncer- tainty about warming attributable to exogenous gases, ;ye sirr,-,:y d&k low and high ziiasions case= which are 50% and 150%, respectively, of the central case."
7,actual temperature will rise slowly to the equilibrium level implied by the concentration of coz (and other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere.
7,"in ceta, this is represented by a temperature rise in each time period that is proportional to the difference between the potential temperature in that time period and the actual temperature in the preceding time period."
7,we refer to the proportionality factor as the annual temperature adjustment rate.
7,"in our central case, we assume the annual temperature adjustment rate is 2”/,."
7,"* for the low and high cases we use l:/, and 10x, respectively."
7,great uncertainty surrounds the adaptation/damage cost function.
7,"in ceta, this function can be represented in a variety of ways."
7,"for example, it can depend on the level of temperature, or its rate of change, or both."
7,"also, there is vide latitude to choose its functiona!"
7,"for purposes of exploring the impiications of uncertainty, we use an adaptation/damage function that is defined on the level of temperature rise, rather than on its rate of change.’"

8,"note that the darslage function above shifts upward over time with growth in the labor force, l, (which is expressed in efficiency units to reflect future productivity growth); this specification reflects the idea that willingness-to- pay to avoid warming effects will grow with population and income."
8,"in the above function, the scaling parameter, ct, is set so that damages are a certain percentage of gross production, at 3°c of temperature rise we refer to this damage percentage at 3°c as the adaptation/damage percent, and use it as one parameter representing uncertainty about the damage cost of temperature rise."
8,"for our central case, we assume that the adaptation/ damage percent is 2. lo for our low and high cases we use 0.5% and 3.5x, respectively."
8,"we also imdentify the adaptation/damage power parameter, a, as important. l1 f:or our central case, we choose a power of 2, and for our low and high cases we choose powers of 1 and 3, respectively."
8,2.h.3.
8,cast and benefit related parametew the labor force growth rate (in efficiency units) is a key parameter which drives future potential production as well as affecting damage costs; thus this parameter affects both the costs and benefits of emission reductions.
8,"our central case labor growth rates use the emf-13, dssumpttons to the year 2 100."
8,"after 2 100, we assume that growth slows from roughly 2% per year in 2100 to 0.25% per year starting in 2150."
8,our low case is 75”!
8,"of the central case growth rates, and our high case is 125% of the central case rates."
8,"a second important parameter, the utility discount rate, also affects both the cost and benefit of emission reduction."
8,the discount rate affects the cost of reduction in our model because current protiuction decisions affect future production possibilities.
8,"this dependence is due to the existence of exhaust- ible resources in the model, and to assumptions that prevent excessively rapid changes up or down in technology use rates over time."
8,the discount rate affects the benefit of emission reduction because of the lcng time delay between emission reduction and the effect of that reduction on temperature.
8,"“this is based on the work of nordhaus (1990a). who presents an estimate of damage for the us (one-quarter of one percent of gdp), and offers a guest that the inclusion of non-quantified costs and extension of the estimate to the world as a whole might increase it to one or two percent of world gross production."
8,"“in earlier work, we identified the power of the damage function as a key parameter affecting the optimal co, emissions reduction policy - see peck and teisberg (1992a)."

10,"in the non-electric sector, there are two major transitions: the switch from oil and gas to coal-derived synthetic fuels around 2050, and the switch from coal- derived synthetic fuels to the backstop around 2150."
10,fig. 3 presents the carbon emissions path for the central case.
10,"carbon emissions rise gradually at first, then dip slightly around 2040 as the electric backstop comes on line."
10,"beginning in 2060, emissions rise to a peak of about 45 billion tons per year before ultimately returning to pre-1990 levels by 2200."
10,the surge in emissions beginning in 2060 is due to the transition from oil and gas to coal-derived synthetic fue!
10,sj and the subsequent drop in emissions is due to depletion of the coal resource base supporting the synthetic fuels industry.
10,fig. 4 shows the path of atmospheric coz concentration for the central case.
10,"concentration rises steadily until 2150, and then begins a gradual decline to the end of the time horizon shown."
10,the initial rise in conccnt- ration occurs because new carbon emissions are being produced faster than the natural processes of the carbon cycle can remove carbon from the atmosphere.
10,"however, ~:5the carbon emissions rate starts to fall beginning in 2140, the rate of carbon removal begins to exceed the rate of new emissions, causing the atmospheric concentration to begin a slow descent."
10,fig. 5 shows the path of temperature for the central case.
10,"temperature rises steadily throughout the time horizon shown, reachrng a level of about 6.5”c (over pre-industrial) by the year 2200."
10,"it is noteworthy that tempera- ture rises steadily even though co, concentration is declining by the latter part of this time period."
10,actual temperr?
10,"ture responds with a long lag to concentration, and this accounts for the falitire of temperature to turn dowi before the last year shown in the figure."
10,fig. 6 presents the carbon tax path for the central case.
10,the carbon tax begins at about $10 per ton and rises monotonically to about $160 per ton by 2200.
10,the rise in the tax rate is attributable to rising temperature and the quadratic relationship between temperature and damage assumed as our central case.
10,"however, the carbon tax does not rise high enough to make the carbon-free non-electric backstop technology competitive with synthetic fuels, and the backstop takes over only as a result of i;xhaustion of the coal resource base."
10,"12 to reduce the volume of information we need to report for the sensitivity cases, we present sensitivities in terms of the carbon emissions and carbon tax at two points in lime."

13,"third, the insensitivity of optimai carbon taxes in both 2030 and 2ioo implies that the marginal benefit of emission reduction function is relatively flat across the range of optimal emissions changes induced by variation in the cost of comrol parameters."
13,next consider the benefit of control related parameters.
13,"as before, optimal emissions arc insensitive to parameter variation in 2030, but not in 210u.13 here, however, optimal carbon taxes are sensitive to ,variation in the benefit of control parameters, both in 2030 and in 2100."
13,the latter result is not surprising since benefit of control parameter variations directly change the marginal cost of emissions.
13,"briefly, we note that the above results have implications for the relative merits of tax vs. quantity instruments for controlling emissions under “there are two reasons for the difference in sensitivity of optimal emissions b\qtween 2030 p v clean and inexpensive oil and 2100."
13,"re early time frame, there is heavy rehanse on relativ..!, and gas and it makes sense to use these resources regardless of how uncertaintier may be resolved."
13,"in the later time frame, oil and gas is exhausted, but the non-electric backstop technology is available on a large scale and this technohlgy allows carbon emissions to be reduced at constant unit cost by displacing carbon intensive synthetic fuels."

14,"teichrg, global warming uncertainties uncertainty."
14,"i4 s p ecifically, the insensitivity of optimal carbon taxes to variations in cost of control parameters indicates that the marginal benefit of control function is fairly flat; and the insensitivi:: of optimal emissions in 2030 to variations in benefit of control param?"
14,tcrs indicates that the margina: cost of control function is quite e;eep: at least in this early time frame.
14,"if the benefit of control function is flat relative to the cost of control function, a tax policy will generally be the preferable control instrument, when there is uncertainty about cost of control related parameters."
14,"on the other hand, when there is uncertainty about benefit of control related parameters (but the cost of control is known), tax and quantity instruments are equivalent, since either can be set so as to produce exactly the same quantity of emissions."
14,"in exploring the value of resolving uncertainty, we focus on uncertainty in benefit of control related parameters."
14,"we do this because our model is well suited to determining optimal quantity policies (i.e. carbon limits) under uncertainty, but not well suited to determining optimal carbon taxes under iinr~rt9intrr by to benefit of control parameter . d rpsiri&ng rxr ..irqlysis uncertainty, we know that the optimal quantity policies we find are equivalent to the corresponding optimal tax policies."
14,"whereas, if we applied our analysis to cost of control parameter uncertainty, we could find ‘optimal’ carbon limits, even though these represent a policy which is inferior to some other policy employing carbon taxes."
14,there is an additional reason for restricting our attention to uncertainty about benefit of control related parameters.
14,"our analysis assumes that an uncertain parameter is initially unknown, and then becomes known all at once at a specified later date."
14,"however, the cost of control parameters by nature become known in other ways that are not well represented by this analytical approach."
14,"specifically, the aeei and the labor growth rate both are perfectly known for past time periods, and uncerta.in for future i:riods, within the model time horizon; resource base estimates are progressively improved over time as a result of production and new exploration; and the two backstop costs may be uncertain until the first date the backstop technologies become available, but after this date these costs are perfectly known for the rest of the time horizon (unless one assumes that these costs continue to change over time according to some stochastic process - but stch a specification would also be outside the bounds of what we can handle using ceta in a simple decision tree framework). l5 14these observations are based on results in weitzman (1974)."
14,“varicus forms of p r og ressive resolution of uncertainty could be modeled using stochastic dynamic programming.
14,"however, such an approach would be impractical unless ceta were simplified to reduce the number of state variables now represented in the model."
14,see peck et al. 11980) for an application of .ctochastic dynamic programming to determine jointly optimal emission control and learnmg policies when damages ckz:oend on a discharge stock.

15,"teisherg, global warming uncertainties 85 the results in table 2 also suggest the subset of benefit related parameters that are of most interest, and which we cnoose to focus on in the next sections."
15,"looking at 2100, the pararneter with the greatest effect on optimal emissions is the warming rate per co1 doubling, and the parameter with the secc;rd greatest efiect is the damage function power."
15,the damage function percent parameter also induces a significant change in optimal emissions.
15,thus we choose to focus in the next sections on the warming rate (a parameter related to climate) and on the two parameters that together define the damage function (parameters related to impacts and adaptation costs).
15,"estimating value of information if optimal policies are used decision analysis provides a general paradigm for calculating the econ- omic value of information.16 in this paradigm, information is valued as the difference between (1) the expected value obtained if the state of the world is k.nown before a policy must be adopted, thereby allowing a potentially different policy to be applied in every possible state of the world, and (2) the expected value obtained if a single policy must be adopted (without knowledge of the state of the world) and then applied across all possible states of the world."
15,"the first expected value is generally higher than the second, since the policy in the first case may be tailored to the actual state of the world."
15,"mathematically, the expected value of perfect information (evpi) can be expressed as follows: evpi=cpi. maxk’(p s) max cpi’~(p,si) (2) i [ pi i’ i]- p [ i where ,_s’=state of world i, pi = probability of state i, p = uniform policy across all states, ."
15,"p’= tailored policy for each state i, v= value function of policy, state."
15,"using decision tree diagrams, the expected value of perfect information can be repr’esented as the difference in the value of two decision trees."
15,these trees are illustrated in fig.
15,"in the upper tree, uncertainty about the state of the world is resolved first, and then a potentially different ,?"
15,oli:y is chosen depending on the state of the world.
15,"in the second tree: the policy is chosen first, and then uncertainty about the state or’ the world is resolved."
15,"anne and richels (1991b) characterize this difference using the phrases ‘lcdrn, then act’ and ‘act, then learn.’"
15,while the above approach to valuing information is conceptually sinn there are numerous challenges in applying it to the global warming problem.

16,"first, there is a very large number of uncertainties involved in global warming."
16,"second, available assessments of parameter uncertainties are typi- cally limited to possible ranges at mos.,t while information on distributional shapes and possible correlations among uncertain parameters is not avail- able."
16,"third, perfect information rarely becomes available all at once - instead, there is a continuing process of updating ‘best estimates’ over time as information is developed.’"
16,"’ finally, even without uncertainty, modeling of global warming is computationally demanding, since warming involves complex natural and human systems over a time scale measured in centuries."
16,"in the face of these difficulties, we adopt certain simplifications in this paper."
16,"first, based on results in the previous section, we limit our consider- ation to three key parameters affecting the benefits of emission reductions."
16,these are the extent of warming per coz doubling and the leiel and power parameters of the warming damage function.
16,"second, for most of our analysis we treat each parameter in turn as the only uncertain parameter, and represent its probabiiity distribution using tl.rec points, with probabili- ties l/6, 2/3, l/6 for the low case, centsai case, ara i-iigkhcase, respectively.’"
16,"8 however, we do conduct an experiment to explore the implications of joint uncertainty about morp, than one parameter."
16,"for this experiment, we simplify our problem even further by assuming that the two parameters are “see peck et al. (1989) for tin analysis of optimal emission control with progressive updating of information."
16,“‘this is consistent with the approach suggested by miller and rice (1983) to best represent a normally distributed random varitihle. usirlg a ihree point distribution.

17,the basic ceta model is specified as a constrained non-linear optimiza- tion problem with both the objective function and some constraints non- linear.
17,"to determine optimal policies under uncertainty, this basic problem is augmented to solve a set of parallel problems, each representing a different state of the world (e.g. the high, central, and low parameter value outcomes, for uncertainty about only one parameter)."
17,"each parallel problem has its own complete set of variables and constraints, indexed by the stat+ of the world."
17,"in addition, the objective function is re-specified as a probab:lity weighted sum of the presel;t value utilities obtained in each state of lthe world."

17,"first, in fig. 8, we show the optimal paths of emissions if the warming rate is known now."
17,"notice that optimal emission paths for a1ternatir.e values of the warming rate begin to diverge immediateiy, although the divergence is quite small until the oil and gas resource base becomes depleted around 2050."
17,"after oil and gas is depleted, a choice must be made between using synthetic fuels derived from coal or the carbon-free non-electric backstop technology."
17,"if the warming rate is l”c, synthetic fuels are chosen, and the coal resource base is exhausted over the subsequent 1% years."
17,"if the warming rate is 3°c rather than 1°c: synthetic fuels are still chosen, but the rate of depletion of the coal resource base is modestly slowed, resulting in emissions that are delayed, but otherwise similar to those for the 1°c warming case."
17,"if the warming rate is sc, the use of synthetic fuels is curtailed, particularly after 2080; as a result, optimal cq, emissions are significantly lower in this state of the world."

20,table 4 shows the gross value of information now vs. never for the three parameters we consider in this paper.
20,notice that the value of information is greatest for the wa:minp rate parameter.
20,"hov:l:ver, the adaptation/damage function parameters have a tot.11 value of information which is nearly as high. us resolving uncertainty about the impacts of warming appears to be about as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming."
20,"yet, 95”,, of the l’s global warming research budget is presently devoted to resolving physic~i uncertainties such as that surrounding the potential and only 5’*, is devoted to resolving uncertainties about cts, rn~tigatio~~ strategies, and adaptation costs.”"
20,this relative ce may not be justified.“’
21,table 4 also shows a ‘totab.’ whit ner:ds to be iiiihpeh2d cautiously. believe that it significantly understates the actual total value of information about the warming problem.
21,"this is the case, most obviously, hecause there is a large n’.mber of other uncertain paraineters whose values of information are not included in the total reported in table 4."
21,"in addition, results ‘es,‘; report in the next section suggest that when two or more parameters are simultaneously treated as uncertain, the value of resolving uncertainty about all of them is greater than the sum of the values of resolving uncertainty about each of them treated in turn as the only uncertainty."
21,"table 5 shows the value of perfect information now, assuming that the same information would otherwise become available in twenty years."

21,relative to the gross values of information reported in table 4.
21,the results in table 5 thus suggest that there is not a high premium attached to immediaie resolution of global warming uncertainties.
21,we believe that the low premium on immediate resektion of global warming uncertainties is due to the short run insensitiv3y of optimal decisions to alternative parameter values.
21,"in general, when optimal policies are roughly the same regardless of how uncertainties arc resolved, there is iittle economic benefit derived from resolving uncertainties."
21,"in the global warming problem, policies in the short run (20 or even 40 years) are not sensitive to parameter values."
21,we believe that: this insensitivity in the near term is the result of reliance during this period on inexpensive and relatively clean oil and gas - it makes sense to use this resource regardless of whether uncertain global warming parameters take on high or low vaiues.
21,"although optimal emissions policies are relatively insensitive to parameter values in the short run, this is not true indefinitely."
21,"by the year 2100, for exampk, optimal politics are significantly different for different parameter values."
21,"thus we should anticipate that the premium on early resolution of uncertainty would tend to increase over time, if uncertainty remains unre- solved."

24,"while it is difficult to forecast what kind of emissions reduction policy might emerge from the political process, the policy that emerges is unlikely to be the optimal one.lh we consider two possible suboptimal policies that might emerge: one is a policy of no emissions reduction before uncertainty is resolved, and the other is a policy of iimiting emissions to the 1990 level until uncertainty is resolved."
