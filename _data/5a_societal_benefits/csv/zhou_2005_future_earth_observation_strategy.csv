1,introduction a.
1,"intelligent earth observing strategy from the early simple missions to the sophisticated large the envisioned fieos is a space-based architecture for satellite missions, a lot of facts have demonstrated that the dynamic and comprehensive on-board integration of earth measurements from the earth observing system constitute a observing sensors, data processors and communication critical input when applying remote sensing technology for our systems."
1,"the implementation strategies suggest a seamless societal benefit in such as enhancing human health, safety and integration of diverse components into a smart, adaptable and welfare; alleviating human suffering including poverty and robust earth observation satellite system to enable illness [14]; protecting the global environment, e.g., global simultaneous, global measurements and timely analyses of the warming; dust storm; and reducing losses of life and property earth’s environment for a variety of users (fig."

1,"in order to further improve our ability to monitor, each eo satellite is equipped with a different sensor for understand and predict changes to the our environment, and collection of different data and an on-board data processor that enhance our understanding of the complex working of the enables it to act autonomously, reacting to significant earth system, including its weather, climate, oceans, measurement events on and above the earth."
1,"they atmosphere, water, land, geodynamics, natural resources, collaboratively work together to conduct the range of ecosystems, and natural and human-induced hazards, new functions currently performed by a few large satellites today earth observation strategy has continuously been presented for through the use of high performance processing architectures easily protecting our home planet and more efficiently and and reconfigurable computing environments [1], [3-4]."

2,"user requests are routed to specific are frequently happened in our home planet, resulting in instruments maximizing the transfer of data to archive severely losing a large number of life and property, and facilities on the ground and on the satellite."
2,such an earth imposing a large burden on society [13].
2,"for example, on 26 observing system allows measurement from in situ, air borne december 2004, 00:58:53 utc, an 9.0 magnitude earthquake or space based sensors to be multiple practical usage that can occurred on the seafloor near aceh in northern indonesia, help in making critical decisions for societal benefits. causing a huge tsunami wave, hitting the coasts of indonesia, malaysia, thailand, myanmar, india, sri lanka, maldives and even somalia in africa, resulting in over 280,000 people lost their lives."
2,"the town of lhoknga, near the capital of banda aceh, was completely destroyed by the tsunami."
2,it has been demonstrated that the losses of life and property from natural and human-induced disaster can be reduced through analysis of earth observing data.
2,"however, not all of disasters, such as tsunami, earthquake can so far be warned and predicted in advance, consequently, scientists have spent enormous efforts to exhaustively find thread of these complex natural phenomena from earth observing fig."

2,event-driven earth observation disasters.
2,"unfortunately, little progress has been made due to the optimum earth observing system to meet the specific the lack of adequate measurements and the depth with which needs and mandates on specific and achievable societal we fully understand the physics of these phenomena [9]."
2,the benefits never stops.
2,a called event-driven observation in current measurements and observations largely can not meet fieos has been presented [18].
2,the operational mode is that the demands of the disaster analysis.
2,"for example, scientists each eo sensing system independently collects, analyzes and need worldwide dem (digital elevation model) data with 1 m interprets data using its own sensors and on-board processors. resolution for tsunami and flood analysis, and dem data with when a sensing system detects an event, e.g., a forest fire, the 10 m resolution for earth crust deformation analysis. sensing-satellite rotates its sensing system into position and the envisioned fieos demonstrates a prospective in alters its coverage area via adjusting its system parameters in cooperative operation of global coverage."
2,the implementation order to bring the event into focus [13].
2,"meanwhile, the of fieos will bring a more timely dissemination of sensing-satellite informs member-satellites, and the member- information through web-based observing system for satellites adjust their sensors to acquire the event, resulting in monitoring, predicting, risk assessment, early warning, a multi-angle, -sensor, -resolution and -spectral observation mitigating, and responding to hazards at local, national, and analysis of the event."
2,"these data sets are merged to a regional, and global levels."
2,"for example, the traditional earth geostationary satellite according to the changes detected. observing systems are not capable of collecting high- meanwhile, the geostationary further processes the data to resolution (less than 3 meter) multispectral data in a specific develop other products, e.g., predictions of fire extend after 5 wildfire area at a repeat cycle of 15 minutes, while the fieos days, weather influence on a fire, pollution caused by a fire, has networked ground-based, air-based and space-based three- etc."
