1,numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments.
1,"the studies use a wide variety of methods and generally ﬁnd a large range of beneﬁts, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies."

1,the framework serves two purposes.
1,one is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science.
1,the second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data.
