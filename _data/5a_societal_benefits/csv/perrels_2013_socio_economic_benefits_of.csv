1,there is a rising interest around the world for a better understanding of the economic and social value added of weather services.
1,national hydro-meteorological services and international cooperative bodies in meteorology have ever more to justify their use of public budgets.
1,"furthermore, the development of hydro- logical and meteorological services is to a large extent steered by expectations regarding the eventual benefits of the envisaged new developments."
1,"this article provides a compact overview of the impediments for uptake of socio-economic benefit (seb) studies, methods and results of seb studies to date."
1,it also discusses some pitfalls and crucial steps to enhance a broader uptake of seb studies.
1,1 introduction seb) of the wmo working group on public service deliv- ery will soon publish a report on social-economic benefit as- sessment of weather services in which is explained what can the national meteorological and hydrological services be the purposes and approaches and how a seb study can (nmhss) in europe have been steadily improving their fore- be organised.
1,the main message of that report is to “grasp cast skills and expanding their environmental and climate the benefit of showing the benefits”.
1,"in this article, based on services (nurmi and brockmann, 2007), but face nonetheless that report, we will briefly discuss impediments, methods and major challenges."
1,"public budgeting is tight and only seems to pitfalls, and results. get tighter."
1,a growing range of media through which weather information is provided blurs the position of nmhss in pub- lic and commercial weather service provision.

2,the first phase of value added creation – 12 of the responding nmhss (i.e. 57 % of those (va1) represents the activities in the nhmss and commer- running surveys) try to estimate the user benefits cial weather service providers.
