6,"foreword as gravitationally bound beings, humanity has long dreamed of soaring into the atmosphere and beyond to gaze down upon the earth, our home, both out of curiosity and an instinctive desire to better know our place in the world."
6,"thanks to human ingenuity, we have realized this possibility."
6,"while only a select few have had the privilege to experience this unique viewpoint ﬁrst-hand, earth observation satellites have opened all of our eyes and, in the process, made us acutely aware of the importance of our planet’s environment."
6,"geostationary satel- lites in particular—in addition to supporting telecommunications, positioning, broadcasting, and surveillance—provide unique and important insights into the dynamics of the earth’s environment and climate."
6,"while these beneﬁts are well recognized, earth observations also provide intangible and philosophical beneﬁts."
6,"their views remind us that we are all global citizens of planet earth, living together in a fragile ecosystem that requires our utmost care and respect, urging international peace and cooperation."
6,"earth observations are usually discussed in the context of science, but in this volume we explore the political aspects, driven by a desire to understand the interplay between environmental policy and technical developments in earth observation."
6,"this volume covers ﬁndings ﬁrst presented at a november 2015 workshop held in tokyo, japan, on “assessing the impact of satellite earth observation on society and policy.”"
6,"the contents explore policy-relevant satellite observations in a number of key areas, as well as the coordination and governance of earth-observing systems required to maximize their contribution to solving a range of environmental problems. vii"

8,"advisory board and project members international advisory board workshop assessing the impact of satellite earth observation on society and policy 9–10 november 2015 tokyo, japan summary of conclusions an international advisory board recently met in tokyo with the overarching goal of assessing the impact of satellite earth observation on society and policy.1 a series of roundtable discussions invited perspectives from experts to understand how earth observations contribute to environmental and other policymaking, and how space agencies establish links between their programs, scientiﬁc advances, industrial innovation, and societal well-being."
8,"at the closing of the workshop, the advisory board concluded with the following key ﬁndings from the two days of meetings: 1."
8,"earth observations provide a unique window and perspective on our world, serving the betterment of all humankind by supporting policies aimed at sustainably managing natural and societal resources on an ever more populous, affluent, and interconnected planet earth. – for example, earth observations can make an important contribution to addressing some of the world’s greatest health risks including air pollution, water contamination, lack of sanitation, and risks related to increasing urbanization."
8,"1 the advisory board was convened in support of the project “study on methods for assessing the impact of satellite observations on environmental policy”, funded by the japan science and technology agency (jst), and jointly carried out by the national institute of information and communications technologies (nict), keio university, institute for global environmental strategies (iges), and the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa). ix"
9,x advisory board and project members 2.
9,earth observations should be regarded as critical societal infrastructure.
9,"there is strong evidence that publicly open earth observations are making positive, cost-effective contributions to solving a variety of high-priority environmental and societal problems. – studies on the socioeconomic beneﬁts of improved global earth observation systems show that the beneﬁts outweigh the costs by orders of magnitude when subject to a free and open data policy."
9,"the european copernicus program, for instance, is expected to return beneﬁts to taxpayers valued 10 times higher than the costs."
9,there is a need to develop appropriate institutions in the ﬁeld of earth observation through a process to ensure that the observations and pre- diction systems are comprehensively exploited for policymaking with full engagement of all stakeholders and end-users. – the u.s.
9,(decadal survey) and european (copernicus) experiences provide ﬁne examples of the beneﬁts of “all-of-government” processes in deﬁning satellite missions.
9,"at the global level, initiatives for greenhouse gases, for- ests, and other areas are being developed to support contributions to policy."
9,"japan, together with its international partners, should identify and ﬁll emerging gaps in next-generation space missions to guarantee full real- ization of all societal beneﬁts of earth observations derived from long-term continuity. – the lack of a systematic, long-term plan for satellite environmental obser- vation missions by the japanese space plan is of particular concern."
9,"there is a changing paradigm for earth observations, with non-governmental groups launching satellites, and with the growing pop- ularity of small satellites, drones and crowd-sourcing/citizen science cam- paigns, which are associated with the rapid development of data technology and applications. – the increasing number of rapid-response, cost-effective and high-performance satellite missions, together with the possibility of exploiting “big-data”, provides opportunities, as well as challenges, for enhanced global earth observations."

21,part i background and introduction
22,chapter 1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving oran r.
22,young and masami onoda 1.1 introduction large-scale environmental problems have become prominent byproducts of the interactions between human activities and the biophysical settings in which they occur.
22,"some of these problems, such as the destruction of tropical forests, arise in areas within the jurisdiction of individual states but have consequences (e.g., bio- diversity loss, climate change) that are regional to global in scope."
22,"other problems, including the seasonal thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer, occur in areas that lie beyond the jurisdiction of nation states."
22,"still others, like marine dead zones, originate in areas within the jurisdiction of individual states but can spread and have impacts on areas outside these jurisdictional boundaries."
22,"in all these cases, efforts to come to terms with the relevant problems require international (often global) responses that call for transboundary cooperation and, more often than not, even- tuate in the development of regulatory arrangements designed to limit or even prohibit the human actions that give rise to the problems."
22,"in recent decades, international environmental regimes have arisen to address problems of this sort."
22,"these institutional arrangements provide governance systems designed to address a variety of issues ranging from atmospheric problems like acid rain or the seasonal thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer, marine problems like o.r."

23,"onoda oil pollution from offshore platforms and tankers, to terrestrial problems like desertiﬁcation in drought-stricken areas or tropical deforestation.1 regimes have met with varying degrees of success, attributable to many factors."
23,"but in all cases, a necessary condition for making progress is the acquisition of the data and infor- mation needed to grasp the fundamental character of the problems themselves and to support the activities of those responsible for administering the provisions of the resultant regimes."
23,one increasingly important source of data for addressing environmental prob- lems is satellite earth observation.
23,"in many cases (e.g., for monitoring global ozone depletion or tropical deforestation), there is simply no alternative for consistently tracking changes in environmental conditions at a global scale, frequent time interval, and ﬁne spatial resolution."
23,"for example, while it is possible in principle to track deforestation in an area like the amazon basin from the ground, satellite earth observation data provide a far more effective and efﬁcient way to acquire an accurate picture of the scope of the problem."
23,"earth observations have shown great potential for generating global scientiﬁc information related to various environmental issues, but they have not yet been fully incorporated as a measurement tool in the monitoring processes of environ- mental regimes."
23,"despite the call for more data and information for decision-making, a considerable disconnect remains between the policy needs and the data and information supply from satellite observations."
23,"to help close this gap, it will be important to identify the roles of satellite earth observations and to consider how to manage the activities involved in acquiring and applying data, in order to enhance the contributions of these observations to solving problems."
23,"the main goal of this book is to investigate methodologies for assessing the roles and impacts of satellite earth observations in addressing environmental problems and, in the process, to contribute to thinking about broader questions relating to the interfaces among science, technology, policy, and society."
23,"we consider the development of earth observation systems and the efforts being made to link societal needs and global policy demands to them in china, europe, japan, and the united states, as well as the prospects for cooperation among key agencies in each of these states (or consortia of states in the case of europe)."
23,the book also attempts to identify generic models that might prompt governments and organizations to consider the connection of science and technology—in particular satellite earth observation—to society and policy.
23,"we assess existing arrangements (e.g., the group on earth observations, geo) for coordinating the efforts of the producers of earth observation data (e.g., national space or environmental agencies) and the users of the data (e.g., government agencies, researchers, ngos, and businesses)."
23,"in addition, we consider whether there is a need to create a more highly developed governance system covering satellite observations that would deal with interactions between producers and users of satellite observations, and to develop a system of rules and procedures applicable to the activities of all those active in this realm."

24,1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 5 1.2 the nature and scope of satellite earth observations2 remote sensing is a relatively new term that arose in the 1950s–1960s in the u.s.3 it refers to “the acquisition of information about an object without physical contact” (colwell 1983).
24,"humans employ remote sensing all the time, as our eyes detect the light reflected by objects beyond our reach."
24,"earth observation by remote sensing involves the measurement of electromagnetic energy reflected from or emitted by the earth’s surface (or atmosphere), together with the establishment of relationships between the remotely sensed measurements and some phenomena of interest on the earth’s surface (or within the atmosphere) (mather 1999)."
24,the terms earth observation and remote sensing are used interchangeably in most parts of this book.
24,"while remote sensing encompasses the technical methods and the technology, the term earth observation places emphasis on the purpose of the activity."
24,"the principal concern of the chapter is with the use of remote sensing, but we also include methods of global monitoring that employ technologies other than remote sensing, such as satellite navigations and communications (e.g., automatic identiﬁcation systems (ais) of vessels)."
24,the electromagnetic wavelengths typically utilized for remote sensing of the earth’s surface/atmosphere range from the ultraviolet to microwave regions of the spectrum (fig.
24,useful information can be extracted from remote-sensing data because different types of objects on the earth’s surface (or in the atmosphere) tend to have different electromagnetic reflectance/emittance properties.
24,"that is to say, they have different spectral characteristics."
24,"it is possible to identify many types of objects based on their spectral signature, i.e., their unique reflectance/emittance properties in some speciﬁc regions of the electromagnetic spectrum."
24,"in order to measure these signatures, satellites carry scanners and charged coupled devices (ccds) that collect digital data and transmit it by radio back to earth."
24,"because the data recorded by these sensors are digital, they can be manipulated in various ways to derive useful information from the spectral measurements."
24,remote-sensing data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum con- vey different types of information about the earth’s land/water surface or atmo- sphere.
24,"images acquired in the visible to intermediate, or shortwave, infrared wavelengths (typically called “optical” remote-sensing data) are often used for the monitoring of vegetation and other types of objects on the ground or atmosphere (e.g., clouds) that have distinctive colors."
24,"multispectral optical sensors, which measure reflected solar radiation over a few (1 to approx. 30) relatively broad 2 for further technical introductions to remote sensing and earth observation technology, see short (2008), colwell (1983), mather (1999)."
24,3 short (2008) indicates that the term “remote sensing” had been coined in the mid-1950s by ms.

25,"1.1 strength of reflection and radiation of electromagnetic waves from plants, earth, and water in each wavelength (jaxa 2016a, b, c, d) portions of the optical spectrum, can differentiate between some types of objects on the surface/atmosphere."
25,"hyperspectral optical sensors, which take measurements over many more (approx. 30 to several hundred) narrower portions of the spectrum, can discriminate between even more types of objects, but hyperspectral satellite imagery is still not yet widely available globally."
25,"images acquired in the thermal infrared spectrum can provide information on the surface temperatures of objects and are often used to monitor the health of crops (e.g., leaf water content) or detect forest ﬁres."
25,images acquired in different parts of the microwave spectrum can be used to monitor various vegetation/soil/water parameters.
25,"for example, short wavelength microwaves emitted from an active microwave satellite (e.g., a synthetic aperture radar (sar) satellite) are easily scattered by top surface materials (e.g., plant leaves in vegetated areas or the top of the soil layer in bare areas), providing useful information related to these materials (e.g., plant leaf area index (lai) or top soil moisture)."
25,"longer wavelength microwaves emitted by active microwave satellites can penetrate through these surfaces and provide other types of useful information (e.g., plant stem volume or subsurface soil moisture)."
25,"analysis of sar images acquired at different time periods also allows for the measurement of surface deformations (e.g., land subsidence/uplift) or changes in water levels."
25,"unlike visible and infrared satellite sensors, active microwave sensors are able to acquire information on the earth’s surface regardless of cloud cover."
25,"passive microwave sensors measure radiation emitted by the earth’s surface at microwave wavelengths, and can be used to monitor soil moisture, snow melt, sea ice, sea surface temperatures, temperature proﬁles of the atmosphere, water vapor, ozone distribution, and precipitation."
25,"finally, light detection and ranging (lidar) satellite data involve transmission of coherent laser light from the sensor and ranging to determine the height of objects on the earth’s surface (e.g., ground elevation, water depth, vegetation/building heights) or the abundance of different particles in the atmosphere, depending on the wavelength of the emitted laser."
25,"other types of remote-sensing data for earth observation exist, but the contributions in this book focus mainly on the types of data described here."
26,1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 7 other speciﬁcations of satellite remote-sensing instruments that have important implications for their environmental monitoring capabilities are the spatial and temporal resolutions at which they image the earth.
26,"as might be expected, the spatial resolution of remote-sensing data describes the level of spatial detail of the data."
26,the spatial resolution of the imagery generally determines the minimum size of objects that can be detected by the sensor.
26,"for example, an object that is at least 1 m wide and 1 m long can be separated (resolved) theoretically from its sur- rounding objects in an image with a spatial resolution of 1 m or ﬁner."
26,"commercial satellites today can produce images with very high (i.e., ﬁne) spatial resolutions, 0.5 m or better."
26,the temporal resolution of remote-sensing data describes the time interval at which images are acquired over the same location.
26,"some satellites, typically those that acquire lower spatial resolution images (approx. 250 m or coarser, e.g., terra/aqua modis, himawari-8) can image the entire globe daily, while other satellites that acquire higher spatial resolution images (approx. 30 m or ﬁner, e.g., landsat 8, sentinel-2a) may only collect images of the same location every few weeks."
26,"in summary, earth observation by satellite remote sensing provides a powerful tool for monitoring various features of the earth’s environment not only because of the wide range of measurements that can be performed, but also because of the high frequency and large area for which data can be acquired."
26,"the digital era has made it possible to perform, store, analyze, and share data globally in a way that no one could imagine half a century ago."
26,"available technology allows earth observation data to be disseminated widely, and the need is stronger than ever to devise ways to put the data to work in meeting societal challenges."
26,"1.3 applications of satellite earth observations as a point of entry into the analysis of the links between earth observations and public policy, we provide some examples dealing with atmospheric co2 moni- toring, marine observations, and forest observations."
26,later chapters include more detailed accounts of these cases and link them to speciﬁc policy issues.

27,"anticipating the policy needs of their governments, space agencies have been developing missions in recent years to provide detailed global measurements of various greenhouse gases."
27,"gosat, the ﬁrst satellite designed speciﬁcally to monitor greenhouse gases from space, provides critical information on atmospheric co2 trends, as it is able to provide global, column-averaged co2 concentrations every three days, and has been monitoring long-term trends since its launch in 2009."
27,"in addition to gosat, nasa’s orbiting carbon observatory-2 (oco-2) has been collecting data operationally since september 2014."
27,"oco-2 is the ﬁrst nasa mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric co2 with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its accumulation in the atmosphere."
27,oco-2 is able to generate a global product every 16-days showing column-averaged concentrations of co2 in the order of a few kilometers in resolution.
27,"in combination with chemical transport modeling and image compositing techniques, highly detailed global maps have been developed which clearly show periodic daily fluctuations of atmospheric co2 over key sources and sinks (fig."
27,"in the future, it is possible that near-real-time monitoring of co2 from space may be available to support all phases of environmental policy, including deﬁnition, monitoring, and enforcement."

28,"missions such as envisat (past), sentinel-1, radarsat-2, terrasar-x, and cosmo-skymed are used in combina- tion with other sources of data, including optical satellite imagery and satellite-based ais, to identify events and deduce responsibility."
28,"ksat’s system has been employed by customers all over the world, from national authorities to the offshore oil and gas industry, for self-monitoring, early spill detection, legal defence (in the case of false accusations), identiﬁcation of polluters, regulatory compliance, and documentation of baseline conditions (ksat 2016)."

29,such impact assessments are crucial inputs for legal proceedings and damage claims.
29,1.3.2.3 red tides red tides are algal blooms (phytoplankton) that occur naturally given certain combinations of environmental conditions.
29,they are sometimes intensiﬁed by increased nutrient loading and temperature increases arising from human activities such as agricultural fertilization and coastal industrial activity.
29,harmful algal blooms (habs) produce toxins that are dangerous to marine life and humans.

32,"however, they do not provide a more systematic account of the variety of roles that satellite observations can play in this realm."
32,"in this section, we tackle this challenge directly, presenting a simple taxonomy of the major roles that satellite observations can play in addressing environmental prob- lems."
32,this taxonomy offers an overview of the range and diversity of the contri- butions that satellite observations can make.
32,it also provides a roadmap for those desiring to identify speciﬁc roles that can be subjected to more detailed analysis.
32,table 1.1 provides a framework for thinking more systematically about roles for satellite observations.
32,"the table draws attention to environmental problems dealing with atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial systems."
32,"to some extent, these distinctions are artiﬁcial."
32,"runoff of pesticides and fertilizers used in terrestrial farming opera- tions, for example, is the principal source of marine dead zones."
32,"tsunamis are marine phenomena, but they cause terrestrial environmental problems when the resultant tidal waves make landfall with destructive force."
32,"nevertheless, it is helpful to begin with these distinctions in order to construct an overview of the roles of satellite earth observations."

33,"the fundamental dis- tinction separates roles that center on the supply of information, roles that involve the provision of emergency assistance, and roles that contribute to the achievement of compliance."
33,"here, too, the boundaries are not watertight."
33,"monitoring trends in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere, for example, may prove helpful for those interested in the extent to which major countries are taking the steps needed to implement their ndcs under the terms of the 2015 paris agreement regarding climate change."
33,"nevertheless, the categories included in the table do point to differences in purposes and in targets of observation that are important when it comes to the administration of earth observation systems."
33,"1.4.1 identify to begin with, satellite earth observations can play critical roles in assembling the data needed to detect large-scale environmental problems, monitor shifts in the status or severity of these problems over time, and assess the success of concerted efforts to solve them."
33,"in some cases, the problems are largely unknown prior to observations from satellites."
33,"in the case of deforestation in the amazon basin, for instance, ground-based data were available to document local occurrences of destructive practices, but no one was able to grasp the extent of deforestation prior to the advent of remote-sensing images (national research council 1998)."
33,in other
34,"1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 15 cases, satellite observations played a role in conﬁrming the existence of a problem ﬁrst identiﬁed by other means."
34,"the seasonal thinning of the stratospheric ozone layer, for example, was identiﬁed initially through ground-based observations made by british antarctic survey scientists located at halley bay, but satellite observa- tions were able to verify these measurements and document the full scope and severity of the problem."
34,"in such cases, satellite observations can alter policy agendas by introducing and highlighting the signiﬁcance of issues that did not exist previously as policy concerns, whether or not the problems had already come into existence in biophysical terms.4 1.4.2 monitor once an environmental problem is identiﬁed, it becomes important to monitor the evolution of the problem over time."
34,satellite observations can play two distinct roles in this regard.
34,one role involves monitoring trends in key variables without reference to policy interventions.
34,the use of satellite observations to track shifts in seasonal maxima and minima in the extent of sea ice in the arctic basin or seasonal maxima and minima in the extent of dead zones in the gulf of mexico exempliﬁes this role.
34,the other role centers on tracking progress toward fulﬁlling goals included in international treaties or agreements.
34,"this role is referred to as “systematic observations” in the ozone and climate change treaties (united nations 1985a, b, 1992a, b)."
34,this is not a matter of measuring compliance on the part of individual actors.
34,"rather, the critical concern is to contribute to determining whether the creation and implementation of an international regime is making a difference with regard to the status of the relevant problem."
34,"for example, are the so-called ozone holes over the polar regions becoming more or less severe over the course of time?"
34,"are glaciers retreating and, if so, is the rate of retreat increasing?"
34,is the rate of desertiﬁcation in sub-saharan africa or in northwestern china accelerating or slowing over time?
34,"in each case, the challenge is to explore links between the operation of a regime and observed trends in relevant biophysical phenomena."
34,4 litﬁn (1995) stated that the discovery of the antarctic ozone hole (published in the journal nature by josef farman of the british antarctic survey in its paper about severe ozone depletion in the antarctic and a strong correlation between cfc concentrations and ozone losses) was “ofﬁcially ignored” in the international negotiations for the montreal protocol.
34,"however, “the ozone hole, signalling a dangerously high probability of ecological disaster, precipitated a sense of crisis conductive to the precautionary discourse eventually sanctioned in montreal”, and “once the hole’s existence was conﬁrmed by nasa satellite data, the race was on to explain it.”"
34,"however, the hole was unexplained until aircraft based measurements could link the hole to cfcs, and thus, the fact that the hole remained unexplained until after the montreal protocol was signed, indicates that “scientiﬁc ignorance, rather than scientiﬁc knowledge, set the stage for international cooperation”."

35,"onoda 1.4.3 assess going a step further, satellite observations can play an important role in evaluating the effectiveness of international agreements at solving the problems leading to their negotiation."
35,the goal of the 2015 paris agreement is framed in terms of temper- ature increases at the earth’s surface.
35,"but to achieve this goal, it will be essential to limit increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
35,satellite observations will play an essential role in assessing trends in these concentrations.
35,"similarly, the program known as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (redd+) focuses on initiatives to provide developing countries with incentives to reduce emissions from forested lands or to increase areas devoted to forests."
35,satellite observations will play an important role in assessing the performance of this program over time.
35,the point here is not to document (non-)compliance with rules or obligations on the part of individual members of international regimes.
35,"rather, the emphasis is on evaluating the performance of the regime as a whole over time, with the objective of deter- mining whether there is a need to adjust or reformulate the regime going forward in the interest of solving the relevant problem."
35,1.4.4 assist a different type of role for satellite observations involves provision of assistance regarding matters like early warning and search and rescue.
35,this role encompasses a range of more practical contributions in situations involving natural or anthro- pogenic disasters.
35,the international charter on space and major disasters aims at providing a uniﬁed system of space data acquisition and delivery to those affected by natural or man-made disasters through authorized users.
35,each member space agency has committed resources to support the provisions of the charter and is thus helping to mitigate the effects of disasters on human life and property by responding to requests from afflicted countries for imagery.
35,"one of the latest applications involved the flood that occurred in sri lanka on may 17, 2016."
35,satellite obser- vations can play major roles in providing early warning regarding the occurrence of tidal waves produced by tsunamis and the tracks of hurricanes and tornadoes.
35,"a well-developed space-based system would have been able to provide signiﬁcant early warning in the case of the december 26, 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami, an event that is estimated to have killed over 300,000 people."
35,similar comments are in order regarding search and rescue.
35,aiss using low earth orbit satellites sometimes in combination with observation imagery are capable of tracking ships at sea in real time and guiding rescuers to the site of maritime disasters on an efﬁcient basis.
35,"on an operational basis, meteorological services provided by geostationary and other satellites around the world provide a successful model of internationally coordinated and shared information services using"
36,"1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 17 satellites for weather forecasting and management of extreme weather, as well as for climate monitoring services."
36,"1.4.5 comply taking the next step, satellite observations become more sensitive because they focus on the extent to which individual subjects (both states and non-state actors) comply with requirements and prohibitions rather than on systemic concerns, such as the size of ozone holes or rates of desertiﬁcation."
36,"aiss, for example, can identify the precise location of ships at sea and access relevant databases to determine whether a given ship is in possession of an up-to-date certiﬁcate or license to operate in the relevant area (e.g., a polar certiﬁcate issued in accordance with the international maritime organization’s new rules for ships operating in polar waters)."
36,"recent advances are likely to allow satellites to make an accurate deter- mination of whether a ship is engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (iuu) ﬁshing, even in cases where the operators of a ship have turned off their transponder in an effort to avoid detection."
36,remote sensing may provide the only way to document the occurrence and the extent of illegal logging in remote areas such as the islands of borneo and kalimantan.
36,"several countries have started to make regular use of satellite data for their national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions (by observing forest areas as carbon sinks); the information will be used for self-reporting according to the obligations included in the paris agreement (united nations 1992a, b, 1997, 2015)."
36,innovations in the technology underlying satellite observations are occurring regularly.
36,"if the proposition that such obser- vations constitute a legitimate compliance mechanism is widely accepted, inno- vations that are targeted to this role of satellite observations are likely to be forthcoming."
36,1.5 coordination mechanisms there have been several multilateral initiatives to coordinate the various national earth observation programs and policies.
36,"among these are intergovernmental programs, including the global world weather watch (www) (world meteorological organization 2016) and earthwatch (united nations environment programme 2016),5 informal voluntary groups or partnerships such as the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos), the global earth observation 5 the global resource information database (grid) under the framework of earthwatch inte- grates satellite remote sensing data and data collected by the global environment monitoring system (gems)."

37,"onoda system of systems (geoss), and a number of other initiatives."
37,the earliest efforts of multilateral coordination in remote sensing were with meteorological satellites.
37,"the www, the principal activity of the world meteorological organization (wmo), is a cooperative program for collecting, processing, and disseminating meteorological data from satellites and other sources, aiming to maximize the utilization of meteorological data from satellites."
37,the coordination group for meteorological satellites (cgms) meets annually to coordinate technical standards among satellite operators.
37,intergovernmental agencies afﬁliated with the un play a signiﬁcant role in these initiatives for multilateral coordination of earth observation and research for the protection of the environment.
37,"among these are the world climate research programme (wcrp), which studies physical aspects of climate change, and future earth, which operates under the auspices of the international council for science (icsu)."
37,"the intergovernmental oceanographic commission (ioc), un environment programme (unep), the un educational, scientiﬁc, and cultural organization (unesco), and the wmo also help in planning these international research efforts."
37,"funding agencies, such as the international group of funding agencies for global change research (igfa) and what is now known as the belmont forum, also play an important role."
37,"to respond to the need for long-term climate monitoring, the global climate observing system (gcos) was established as a user-driven operational system capable of providing the comprehensive observations required for monitoring the climate system; detecting and attributing climate change; assessing impacts of, and supporting adaptation to, climate vari- ability and change; application to national economic development; and research to improve understanding, modeling, and prediction of the climate system (gcos 2016).6 the global ocean observing system (goos) is a permanent global system for observations, modeling, and analysis of marine and ocean variables to support operational ocean services worldwide (goos 2016)."
37,a central purpose of these research programs is to inform and influence national policies and international agreements on environmental management.
37,"in the ﬁrst instance, coordination is a matter of avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts and ensuring that there are no gaps in coverage regarding key roles played by satellite observations."
37,"at the same time, it is important to agree on rules and procedures (e.g., format standardization, data principles, and sometimes joint pro- gram planning), allowing for healthy competition among earth-observing programs to encourage the flow of innovations that can expand the capacity of space agencies to play constructive roles in dealing with a variety of environmental problems."
37,"coordination is also a matter of linking the contributions of a variety of earth observation instruments, including ocean buoys, meteorological stations and bal- loons, seismic and global positioning system (gps) stations, remote-sensing satellites, computerized forecasting models, and early warning systems (group on earth observations 2008)."
37,"for most of the roles identiﬁed in the preceding section, 6 the gcos is sponsored by: the wmo, unesco and its ioc, unep, and icsu."
38,1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 19 there is a need to integrate data coming from multiple sources to achieve the clearest and most detailed picture of the targets of earth observations.
38,"many environmental agreements contain provisions for research and systematic observations, monitoring, or scientiﬁc research cooperation."
38,"the 1985 vienna convention for the protection of the ozone layer expressly mentions satellite measurement (united nations 1985a, b)."
38,"the world summit on sustainable development held in johannesburg in 2002 adopted a plan of implementation, which includes several proposals on actions for satellite earth observation, global mapping, and integrated global observations (united nations 2002)."
38,"at the same time, efforts to identify the adequacy of global observations for tracking climate change (gcos 2003)7 were carried out by gcos and have been reported to the cop of the unfccc."
38,the u.s. took the initiative to host the ﬁrst ministerial earth observation summit in washington d.c. in 2003.
38,"in response to a call from the group of eight leading industrialized countries of june 2003 (g8 2003), the third earth observation summit took place in brussels in february 2005, initiating the formation of the geoss."
38,geo is a voluntary partnership of governments and international organizations.8 it provides a framework for these partners to develop new projects and coordinate their strategies and investments.
38,geo …links existing and planned earth observation systems and supports the development of new ones in cases of perceived gaps in the supply of environment-related information.
38,it aims to construct a global public infrastructure for earth observations consisting in a flexible and distributed network of systems and content providers.
38,(international institute for sustainable development 2015) geo has taken a leading role in coordinating efforts to build geoss.
38,"at its 12th plenary session, held in mexico city in november 2015, geo entered its second decade and adopted a new strategic plan covering the decade from 2016 to 2025 (for more details see chap."
38,"1.6 the governance of earth observation systems as satellite observations have taken on expanded roles in responding to the pro- vision of emergency assistance, the operation of compliance mechanisms, and the assessment of regime performance, the need to move beyond simple procedures to coordinate the activities of producers of earth observation data has come into focus."
38,consider the following development in this context.
38,"in november 2014, skytruth, oceana, and google announced the launch of global fishing watch, a public tool utilizing spacequest ais data and algorithms developed by analyze corp to 7 hereinafter: gcos second adequacy report."
38,"8 some regard geo as being technically an intergovernmental meeting but virtually a small-scale intergovernmental organization, see: aoki (2006)."

39,"onoda identify and display ﬁshing activity worldwide.9 turning to hypothetical but entirely realistic scenarios, consider a case in which spacequest, a private com- pany, launches a satellite on a russian rocket with the intention of deploying an ais system to monitor compliance with the rules articulated in the imo’s polar code for ships operating in polar waters and to provide relevant data to govern- ments in the countries where the ships are registered or where there are ports the ships are likely to enter."
39,"or, to take another example, consider a partnership in which the european space agency (esa) joins forces with australia to track and ultimately apprehend a vessel registered in panama that is thought to be harvesting patagonian toothﬁsh illegally in waters subject to the management regime estab- lished under the terms of the convention on the conservation of antarctic marine living resources (ccamlr)."
39,"as these examples suggest, we are moving into a realm regarding the role of satellite observations in addressing environmental problems that takes us beyond the efforts of consortia of producers like geo."
39,"we are now dealing with a complex mix of private companies, public agencies, and public/private partnerships."
39,"the private companies are interested in selling their services to a variety of users that may include academic, commercial, governmental, and non-governmental cus- tomers."
39,"this is certainly reasonable in principle, though it may require focused and careful efforts to iron out differences among participants regarding the proper division of labor between private sector actors (e.g., spacequest or google earth) and public sector players like nasa, esa, or jaxa and many other existing and emerging space agencies around the world."
39,"note also that the relevant partnerships may involve representatives of inter- governmental organizations responsible for administering international regimes, such as the imo and the secretariat of ccamlr."
39,"while the imo does not have the capacity to operate earth-observing satellites of its own, it does have the authority to make and interpret international rules pertaining to various aspects of the design, construction, and operation of commercial vessels."
39,"as the toothﬁsh example sug- gests, there may be cases in which it is important to coordinate the efforts of providers of earth observations not only with the activities of states (e.g., australia) keen on improving compliance with international rules but also the responses of states (e.g., panama) that may be less enthusiastic about the application of the rules to actors operating under their jurisdiction (e.g., vessels registered in panama)."
39,another important observation regarding the roles of satellite observations in addressing large-scale environmental problems is that these roles are normally instrumental.
39,"as our taxonomy of roles indicates, we are concerned with matters like the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, the growth of marine dead zones, and the destruction of tropical forests."
39,satellite observations cannot solve these problems.
39,but they can play a variety of supporting roles that are helpful to those responsible for coming to terms with these problems. 9 http://globalﬁshingwatch.org/.
40,1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 21 this makes it clear that there is a need for close cooperation between those seeking to implement or administer issue-speciﬁc regimes and those responsible for the operation of earth-observing systems.
40,"it is possible, in principle, to launch satellites dedicated to the concerns of speciﬁc regimes and operated under the auspices of each regime."
40,"but arrangements of this sort are unlikely to become commonplace, for several reasons."
40,operating earth-observing satellites requires material resources and trained personnel that are not available to most of those responsible for the administration of issue-speciﬁc regimes.
40,there is no prospect that this will change in the foreseeable future.
40,"in addition, there are cases in which a satellite or a set of satellites can provide data responsive to the needs of two or more issue-speciﬁc regimes."
40,"under the circumstances, a key issue of governance will center on arrangements designed to ensure compatibility between the needs of the users of satellite observations and the activities of the providers of these data."
40,needed in this con- nection are what commentators on environmental governance call regime com- plexes (oberthür and stokke 2011).
40,such complexes are sets of institutional arrangements that deal with the same issues or with overlapping issues but that are not related to one another in a hierarchical manner.
40,"in such cases, it becomes important to work out, either formally or informally, a set of practices governing the interactions among the elements of the complexes."
40,there are examples of such arrangements that may offer insights to those con- cerned with the roles of earth-observing systems.
40,"the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), for instance, is a body operating under the auspices of wmo and unep (agrawala 1998)."
40,"it provides scientiﬁc assessments that feed into the work of the unfccc, but it is not subject to the authority of the cop of the unfccc."
40,"the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ipbes) operates under the auspices of unep, the un development programme (undp), the un food and agriculture organization (fao), and unesco (díaz 2015)."
40,"it provides scientiﬁc input in response to requests from decision-makers, especially those responsible for the administration of international governance systems like the convention on biological diversity."
40,the situation regarding earth-observing systems is more complex (see chap.
40,but it is easy to identify some of the key issues arising in the relevant regime complexes.
40,consider the following examples.
40,at the center of these arrangements lie relationships between the providers and users of earth observation data.
40,it is therefore essential to consider the terms of trade between upstream providers and downstream users.
40,should earth observa- tions be supported by public funds and made available to all (or all certiﬁed) users on an open access basis?
40,what is the role of private providers in such settings?
40,can users make contracts with providers to meet the needs of users on an ongoing basis under terms agreed upon for varying lengths of time?
40,what are the incentives for providers to develop technological innovations that can improve the services they are able to supply to users of satellite observations?
40,are there issues regarding the protection of privacy or proprietary information that need to be addressed in the production and dissemination of satellite

41,onoda observations that can help to solve environmental problems?
41,"with current satellite technology, it is possible to obtain images of activities occurring on the earth’s surface with a very high resolution."
41,"using google earth, for instance, it is possible to obtain detailed views of individual houses located on a particular street within a speciﬁc community."
41,additional technological advances will make it possible to reveal even more details regarding the activities of various actors.
41,this is good news in some respects.
41,"for example, providers or disseminators of satellite images now say that they can identify ﬁshing vessels even when they have their transponders turned off and determine whether they have nets in the water in violation of the rules governing speciﬁc areas or seasons.10 but it may be feasible to place certain restrictions on the acquisition of satellite images in order to protect privacy, without diminishing the usefulness of the relevant data for the imple- mentation of speciﬁc regimes."
41,"to take a concrete example, it is possible to deter- mine whether a commercial vessel operating in polar waters has a certiﬁcate that is valid under the terms of the polar code without tracking the movements of the vessel continuously in real time and seeking to determine its cargo."
41,should we be concerned about dangers relating to the misuse of earth obser- vation data for purposes that are unrelated to solving environmental problems?
41,"the same data, especially in the case of very high resolution data, can be used to address environmental problems and for military purposes."
41,"today, not only do many countries have space programs, but very high resolution data are also openly available through the expanding global market."
41,many countries operating earth observation satellites or that have private businesses operating satellites are aware of the risk of these data being used against their security interests.
41,"therefore, in many cases, regulations are adopted to control the acquisition of very high-resolution satellite data."
41,"as experience in the realm of arms control makes clear, the danger that satellite observations will be misused for purposes that threaten national security is a real concern in all cases."
41,"although this problem seems less serious when it comes to addressing large-scale environmental problems, it would be a mistake to assume that there is no reason to be alert to concerns of this sort."
41,"such issues concerning data rights, security, and privacy have been dealt with for decades through what is commonly called earth observation data policy."
41,"as difﬁcult as it is to tackle these problems effectively, the overall message of this section is that we need to consider a transition from a continuing concern with coordination to a new awareness of the need for governance in the use of satellite observations to help in solving environmental problems."
41,"the activities of groups like geo and ceos, which focus on coordination among producers of earth observation data, will continue to be important; they may well become increasingly important."
41,"but it will be necessary to supplement these efforts with an appropriate set of rules and practices addressing issues that arise in interactions between 10 see howard (2015) for a report on the development of a collaboration involving skytruth, oceana, and google."
42,"1 satellite earth observations in environmental problem-solving 23 producers and users and, more speciﬁcally, in the contributions of satellite obser- vations to the work of a range of issue-speciﬁc regimes addressing atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial problems."
42,"as a preliminary response to this need, efforts are taking place around the world to demonstrate the socioeconomic beneﬁts of earth observations."
42,space agencies and governments are faced with increasing pressure to plan space programs on evidence-based studies of anticipated societal beneﬁts from investments in earth observation systems.
42,"such efforts should have in view the transition they want to achieve, which is to reach a world where satellite obser- vations provide the data and information that meet the needs of policymakers through a set of rules and institutions that allow this to happen."
42,the key to moving from technology driven r&d to societal beneﬁts depends on whether or not this transition happens.
42,"1.7 architecture of the book the three substantive sections of this book contain a series of chapters that explore methodological issues relating to the development of policy-relevant satellite observations in a number of issue areas, the organization of agencies engaged in this work in both national and international settings, and the coordination and governance of earth-observing systems to maximize their contributions to solving a range of environmental problems."
42,part ii on a study on methods for assessing the impact of satellite observations on environmental policy (japan) describes the work of the japanese policy and earth observation innovation cycle (peoic) project.
42,it includes a case study of the roles that satellite observations have played in supporting efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer.
42,"part iii turns to national and regional expe- riences in the u.s., europe, and asia."
42,"in addition to the experiences of nasa, esa, and jaxa, it includes assessments of the uk earth observation policy, the french earth observation strategy, the chinese earth observation programme, and a speciﬁc case on greenhouse gas observation from space."
42,part iv deals with international initiatives and efforts to use satellite observations in coming to terms with issues of international signiﬁcance.
42,"speciﬁc topics include the experience and plans of the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), space forum and geoss."
42,"applications considered relate to the uses of satellite observations in dealing with matters of public health, the implementation of redd +, and other global initiatives relating to the protection of forests and wetlands."
42,part v on prospects and conclusions includes chapters that are more forward-looking regarding the roles of satellite observations in solving large-scale environmental problems.
42,chapter 16 focuses on future directions in institutional and organizational arrangements.

49,"kasai et al. governments are often the basis of their budgetary allocations to governmental space missions, with the goal being that satellite missions will lead to scientiﬁc ﬁndings that better inform decision-makers."
49,we know from experience that such cases happen.
49,our purpose here is to show quantitative evidence of the relationship between observation data and policy.
49,"in japan, there is a growing demand to set mission goals for publicly funded satellite missions based on societal or policy outcomes."
49,"however, at present there are very few studies assessing the actual impacts of satellite earth observations on policy."
49,"the japanese government typically decides on the funding for satellite earth observation missions through a one-way planning approach, where the scientiﬁc results/advancements from a mission do not fully contribute to the next step of the innovation process."
49,the authors of this chapter think that this lack of analysis— either retrospective or prospective—of the impact of earth observations on envi- ronmental policy is one reason why japan’s earth observation programs lack consistent and continuous planning.
49,the goal of this research therefore is to develop methods for quantitative and objective assessment of the impact of satellite earth observations on environmental policy.
49,"for this purpose, the research project members have proposed the concept of a “policy and earth observation innovation cycle” (peoic)."
49,satellite data are used to produce information and intelligence leading to strategy and the formation of policy.
49,"ultimately, the outcome effect of the policy is monitored and this infor- mation feeds into the next cycle of scientiﬁc and technological innovation."
49,the immediate goal of the project is to propose methodology options for japan to perform such an assessment for better system planning in the future.
49,"the long-term goal beyond this project is to build a society where there is such a working cycle, which could be a key to developing the road map to future earth (2016)."

50,2 policy and earth observation innovation … 33 fig.
50,2.1 proposed “policy and earth observation innovation cycle” 2.1.2 project outline there are a number of studies that address the contributions or beneﬁts of satellite remote sensing technologies to society and the relationship with policy (booz and company 2011; pricewaterhousecoopers llp 2006; williamson et al.
50,2002; macauley 2009; and others).
50,these studies range from public reports to policy or economic analysis.
50,"in a broader context, the relationship between science and policy has been an important area of the study on state behaviors, in governance, or in the constructivist approaches in international relations."
50,we know that publicly funded satellite missions are commonly designed to meet the policy requirements that affect resource allocation.
50,"on the other hand, we also know that environmental policy agendas are set by scientiﬁc ﬁndings."
50,"our inves- tigation on the impact of satellite earth observations on environmental policy has led us ultimately to the question of the role of science and policy and the inter- actions between the two, and whether evidence of such interactions could be identiﬁed in a quantitative manner."
50,"however, the lack of an approach to integrate policy, science, and technology seems to lead to a discrepancy between the two domains, causing inefﬁciencies in the system."
50,"if there is a way to identify and possibly quantify the data and information flow from science to policy, it should be possible to identify the existing gap and analyze the reason for its existence, leading to possible solutions to reconcile this discrepancy."
50,"based on these hypotheses, the project attempts to develop a tracking technique to link the currently disconnected ﬁelds of satellite earth observation and envi- ronmental policy."
50,the project further attempts to bridge the gap between policy and the development of science and technology research.
51,kasai et al.
51,"our project started by developing a methodology for such an assessment by bringing together groups of specialists in different ﬁelds, including space and environmental law and policy, satellite engineering, and informatics."
51,"first, different phases of the policy process where satellite observations could have had an impact were identiﬁed through a document review; then text mining was performed to quantitatively assess if and how earth observations had an impact on policy."
51,"the project comprises three components: the policy component, led by prof."
51,"setsuko aoki of keio university, the assessment methodology component, led by dr."
51,"masami onoda of the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa), and the statistical analysis component led by prof."
51,yasuko kasai of the national institute of information and communications technology (nict).
51,the overall project leader is prof.
51,kasai of nict.
51,the project was granted funding for three years (2013–2016) by the japan science and technology agency (jst) research institute for science and technology for society (ristex).
51,"2.1.3 methodology and results first, our project conducted a survey to review the relevance of published literature related to each component of the research project, with the objective of developing a method to clarify the extent of the contributions of science, technology, and satellite data to policy through the assessment of literature and documents."
51,"the survey included a broad array of studies, from legal and institutional methods to economic methods (cost effectiveness analysis), and other literature on space and remote sensing policy and technology in general."
51,the survey further focused on studies done in the u.s. and europe that relate to satellite earth observation and its impact on society in broad terms.
51,"the main ﬁndings were that: u.s. governmental earth observation missions are mainly designed based on a survey of scientiﬁc requirements [i.e., the decadal survey for earth science (nrc 2007)] in coordi- nation with budget priorities; the european global monitoring for environment and security (gmes) program, now called copernicus, was established based mainly on (operational) end user requirements and a prospective cost–beneﬁt analysis of the program; very few policy documents or literature include speciﬁc references to satellite missions, instruments, or other details; existing studies focus on the socioeconomic beneﬁts more than how satellite earth observation impacts policy; the only closest methodology that used document analysis found during the survey was by macauley (2009), which comprised an analysis on the use of landsat data through searches of peer-reviewed scientiﬁc papers."
51,"this survey demonstrated the limitations of assessing the impact of satellite data on policy by using data from document analysis, in that there were only a limited number of sample documents that could be used for the analysis."
51,"we also found that even if it is possible to analyze the relationship between satellite data and science, the relationship between science and policy is not a straightforward issue and is very difﬁcult to quantify because of the many complicated factors involved."
52,"2 policy and earth observation innovation … 35 in parallel, the project analyzed the case of satellite observations and the ozone regime, namely the convention for the protection of the ozone layer (united nations 1985) (hereinafter the ‘vienna convention’) and the protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer (united nations 1987) (hereinafter the ‘montreal protocol’)."
52,the case was chosen because it is a successful example of an environmental agenda where satellite observations are said to have played a major role and was viewed as an ideal case study for retrospective quantitative analysis.
52,"for this effort, keio university’s group researched the impact of satellite data on the amendment processes of the montreal protocol, using documents related to the meeting of the parties (mop) and how satellite missions and instruments are mentioned in those documents."
52,a team from the national institute for informatics (nii) worked with a team from jaxa and the institute for global environmental strategies (iges) to develop a “dictionary” using the database of earth observation missions developed by the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos).
52,the dictionary was then used to analyze how satellite data are being used in scientiﬁc papers and the public media (newspapers).
52,the nii research group worked with the nict group to develop a document-sharing platform for analyzing the relevance between datasets from policy and from satellite observations.
52,all groups worked together to populate the database for the platform.
52,"using this platform, the case study on ozone gathered a number of policy-related documents, namely those documents from the conference of parties to the vienna convention and the meeting of the parties of the montreal protocol, and scientiﬁc resources such as the ozone assessments by the world meteorological organization (wmo) and the un environment programme (unep)."
52,the documents were digitized and made available for electronic searching and mining.
52,the details of this work are described in the following sections.
52,"this methodology is thought be adaptable to other issues, such as climate change or arctic ocean navigation, in order to identify the role(s) of satellite data in those policy areas."
52,"2.1.4 international advisory board and future prospects as the project developed, the members decided that the idea of environmental governance could be a meaningful addition to existing research on earth obser- vation beneﬁts."
52,"since cost–beneﬁt analysis has been one of the most commonly used methodologies for assessing the beneﬁts of earth observations in several countries/regions, it was thought that if we couple this with an institutional approach involving the role, rights, and duties of stakeholders, we might be able to establish a working cycle of policy and science."
52,"in order for earth observations and prediction systems to be used comprehen- sively for decision-making, a process must be established involving all stakeholders and end users."
52,"if we regard earth observations as a tool to achieve the role of monitoring within the international governance system for the environment,"
53,kasai et al. appropriate institutions must be developed to achieve optimum use of earth observations for environmental monitoring.
53,"to pursue this path, the project established an international advisory board chaired by prof."
53,oran r.
53,young and composed of experts in socioeconomic studies and earth and remote sensing sci- ences from around the world.
53,"a workshop was held in november 2015 in tokyo, inviting the advisory board members to speak to the public as well as to participate in a workshop on the experiences of their different countries, regions, or organi- zations and how japan could pursue its studies."
53,"taking into account such developments, the peoic project in its last year (2015–2016) started an effort to compile and categorize the present work of earth observations beneﬁts assessments around the world, and to develop criteria and recommendations for realizing an “innovation cycle.”"
53,"the project has asked advisory board members to submit contributions based on their own experience, using the template made for this study, and advise on how recommendations could be developed."
53,"further, profs."
53,oran r.
53,young and olav schram stokke added some perspectives on a future “earth observation regime complex.”
53,the following sections describe in detail the research conducted by each team.
53,"section 2.2 addresses the work on the policy component led by keio university to analyze the ozone regime and the use and impact of satellite earth observations on the policy for the protection of the stratospheric ozone layer, extending this to the climate change regime."
53,section 2.3 by nict and nii describes how data mining techniques were adopted to track the flow of information from satellite earth observations to policy.
53,"finally, sect."
53,2.4 provides some conclusions for the project.
53,"2.2 protection of the ozone layer and climate change 2.2.1 purpose and methodology of the case study in 1938, chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) were discovered to be ideal chemicals for use as refrigerants, propellants and solvents, leading to their widespread use in many applications."
53,"however, molina and rowland (1974) published ﬁndings suggesting that cfcs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, which would result in severe consequences for humans and the earth’s ecosystems if left unchecked."
53,"the issue became a controversial topic of intense discussion in the scientiﬁc community and the ﬁndings were contested by the chemical industry, which denied the relationship between ozone depletion and cfcs."
53,"for example, du pont’s congressional testimony said “the chlorine-ozone hypothesis is at this time purely speculative with no concrete evidence… to support it” and “if creditable scientiﬁc data… show that any chlorofluorocarbons cannot be used without a threat to health, du pont will stop production of these compounds.”"
53,"later it was also found that increased ozone in the troposphere is the third largest cause of global warming, only eclipsed by co2 and ch4."
53,around the end of the
54,"2 policy and earth observation innovation … 37 twentieth century, it was also proven that global warming directly increases ozone transport from the stratosphere to troposphere, further increasing total ozone con- centration, especially in mid-latitudes (wmo 1988a, b; ipcc 2001)."
54,"a series of scientiﬁc ﬁndings suggested that it would not be enough nor efﬁcient just to stop the ozone depletion resulting from human activities, but that an international regime to protect and preserve the appropriate climate status must be carefully constructed and maintained through global cooperation."
54,"such environmental and climate changes had been studied and supported by model simulations based on laboratory experiments, ground-based observations (especially those of dobson and brewer using spectrophotometers), and aircraft and balloon observations."
54,"however, satellite data constituted the only direct evidence of ozone layer destruction in the stratosphere as well as the increased transport and circulation of ozone between the stratosphere and upper parts of the troposphere (wmo 1988a, b)."
54,ozone depletion in the stratosphere occurs by recombination with atomic oxygen (o + o3 !
54,"2o2), catalyzed by many atmospheric species such as oh, ho2, no and no2, or cl and clo."
54,satellite data provide convincing evidence that the international community can use to inform the necessary joint measures required to combat the situation.
54,data in the form of images are partic- ularly impactful and tend to garner more attention and raise awareness of the international society.
54,"this is evidenced in the conﬁrmation of molina and rowland’s 1974 hypothesis, which suggested that cfcs were destroying the stratospheric ozone layer."
54,the total ozone mapping spectrometer (toms) on nimbus-7 and the solar backscatter ultraviolet (sbuv) instrument on noaa-9 conﬁrmed this hypothesis when they found striking evidence of an antarctic “ozone hole” phenomenon in 1986 (nasa ozone watch 2013).
54,"in 1977, the code of conduct for the ozone layer was adopted and the coordinating committee on the ozone layer (ccol) was established."
54,"in the late 1970s, the u.s. began to ban the use of cfcs, but european countries opposed similar bans due to the cost of alternatives and a claimed lack of evidence."
54,"many developing countries also opposed such measures, fearing repercussions to their industrial development."
54,"although industry strongly denied the link between cfcs and ozone depletion, the issue came to be discussed more frequently and canada, sweden, and norway followed the lead of the u.s., enacting national legislations to ban the use of cfcs."
54,"in 1980, unep recommended that states should freeze or reduce the production and use of cfcs."
54,"finally, in 1985, the vienna convention was adopted, acting as a framework for international efforts to protect the ozone layer."
54,"however, the vienna convention does not include any legally binding reduction goals for cfcs."
54,these targets are instead laid out in the accompanying montreal protocol adopted in 1987.
54,"today, the montreal protocol is arguably cited as: “the single most successful international agreement to date,” as stated by mr."
54,"koﬁ anan, the former secretary general of the united nations."
54,"this mechanism successfully eliminated the use of human-made ozone depleting substances (ods) by january 1, 2010."
54,it has been
55,kasai et al. proven that the stratospheric ozone layer is now recovering (united nations environment programme 2010).
55,"while it is difﬁcult to isolate the contribution of satellites, as scientiﬁc facts are identiﬁed using multiple approaches, this chapter studies whether satellite data had an influence on the decisions made during the implementation of the montreal protocol."
55,"for this purpose, sects."
55,2.2.2 and 2.2.3 present the contents and devel- oping obligations provided for in the montreal protocol and its later amendments.
55,section 2.2.4 explores whether a series of satellite instruments provided substan- tially important information on which a series of amendments to the montreal protocol were made.
55,"if this is answered in the afﬁrmative, it would strengthen the basis for accelerating the development of earth observation satellites through increased international cooperation."
55,"conversely, if the answer is in the negative, it may suggest that there is room to reconsider the role of satellite earth observations in support of climate policy."
55,2.2.2 major obligations of the vienna convention/montreal protocol system as an international regime to protect the ozone layer the vienna convention deﬁnes the general obligation of the parties to take appropriate measures to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting from human activities that have been modifying the ozone layer (united nations 1985).
55,"parties to the convention agreed to cooperate by means of systematic observations, research and information exchange, as well as assessment of the effect of human activities on the modiﬁcation of the ozone layer."
55,"the main scientiﬁc issues recognized in the vienna convention were: i. the modiﬁcation of the ozone layer would result in a change in the amount of solar ultraviolet radiation having biological effects (uv-b) that reaches the earth’s surface and the potential consequences for human health, for organisms, ecosystems, and materials useful to mankind; and, ii. the modiﬁcation of the vertical distribution of ozone could change the tem- perature structure of the atmosphere and the potential consequences for weather and climate."
55,"it was, therefore, speciﬁed in annex i of the vienna convention that research into the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere would be conducted by means of not only laboratory studies and ﬁeld measurements but also “instrument develop- ment, including satellite and non-satellite sensors for atmospheric trace constituents, solar flux and meteorological parameters.”"
55,"likewise, it was planned that a global ozone observing system of tropospheric and stratospheric concentrations of source gases for the hox, nox, clox, and carbon families would be constructed as an integration of satellite and ground-based systems."
55,the following gases were
56,"2 policy and earth observation innovation … 39 speciﬁed in annex i of the vienna convention as those to be monitored by the above-mentioned global ozone observing systems: carbon monoxide (co), car- bon dioxide (co2), methane (ch4), non-methane hydrocarbon species from carbon substances; nitrous oxide (n2o) and nitrogen oxides (nox) from nitrogen sub- stances; halogenated alkanes including ccl4, cfcl3 (cfc-11), cf2cl2 (cfc12), c2f3cl3 (cfc113), c2f4cl2 (cfc114), ch3cl, chf2cl (cfc22), ch3ccl3, and chfcl2 (cfc21); cf3br (sources of brox) and hydrogen (h2) in bromine sub- stances; and hydrogen (h2) and water (h2o) in hydrogen substances."
56,"note that the vienna convention only determined the kinds of gases to be monitored, not those to be reduced and ultimately eliminated for the consumption for each member state."
56,the montreal protocol explicitly designates the ods that will be eliminated from production (united nations 1987).
56,this protocol also provides for a grace period for developing countries due to the small amounts of ods they emitted and their low capacity for developing alternatives to ods.
56,"annex a of the 1987 montreal protocol provides for the following substances: group i chemicals (cfcl3 (cfc-11), cf2cl2 (cfc-12), c2f3cl3 (cfc-113), c2f4cl2 (cfc-114), c2f5cl (cfc-115)), to be eliminated after january 1996; and, group 2 chemicals (cf2brcl (halon 1211), cf3br (halon-1301) and c2f4br2 (halon 2402)) to stop after 1 january 1994."
56,"the conference of the parties (cop) held pursuant to the vienna convention may adopt additional protocols and any party may also propose amendments to the vienna convention and to future protocols, taking “due account, inter alia, of relevant scientiﬁc and technical considerations.”"
56,the mechanisms to counterattack the abundance of ods in the atmosphere by the vienna convention/montreal protocol include a dynamic process to upgrade and modify the parties’ obligations in accordance with new scientiﬁc ﬁndings.
56,"in fact, as portrayed in the next section, the montreal protocol has been amended several times in response to the assess- ment of scientiﬁc ﬁndings."
56,"in addition, further funding mechanisms were intro- duced to assist developing countries in the process."
56,"this chapter will not address the capacity-building aspects of the ods reduction strategy, but will focus on the relationship between the scientiﬁc ﬁndings, especially those obtained by satellite monitoring, and the change of obligations imposed on parties to the montreal agreement (197 parties as of april 2016)."
56,"considering the number of united nations member states (193 as of april 2016), it can safely be said that the vienna convention/montreal protocol regime represents one of the most established international regimes today."
56,2.2.3 dynamic obligations of ods elimination 2.2.3.1 amendments and adjustments of the montreal protocol new scientiﬁc ﬁndings have led to changes in the obligations of the montreal protocol.
56,"since entering into force in 1989, the montreal protocol has been"
57,kasai et al. amended ten times through two kinds of changes: narrow “amendments” and methodological “adjustments”.
57,the former means adding a new ods to the list of substances to be eliminated.
57,"as this makes the montreal protocol more stringent than the original version, ﬁnancial mechanisms have also been created to alleviate the burden on developing countries."
57,the mop to the montreal protocol adopted amendments to the protocol four times.
57,"they are generally known by the names of the city where the annual mop was held: the london amendment (adopted in 1990, entered into force in 1992), the copenhagen amendment (1992, 1994), the montreal amendment (1997, 1999), and the beijing amendment (1999, 2002)."
57,"as the traditional international technique is applied for the amendment, amended versions of the montreal protocol are applicable only to those states that have ratiﬁed them."
57,"as of april 2016, all 197 member states of the montreal protocol have ratiﬁed all four amended versions."
57,"“adjustment” refers to the acceleration of the reduction and elimination schedule in the production, consumption, and transfer of controlled substances that have already been designated in the original montreal protocol and its amended versions."
57,"adjustments are possible if a two-thirds majority in the mop is achieved, unless consensus is reached without a vote, and resulting adjustments are automatically applicable to all parties."
57,adjustment becomes effective 6 months from the date of the notiﬁcation by the depositary.
57,"the montreal protocol has been adjusted six times as of april 2016: london (1990, 1991), copenhagen (1992, 1993), vienna (1995, 1996), montreal (1997, 1998), beijing (1999, 2000), and montreal (2007, 2008)."
57,2.2.3.2 ods added and accelerated through amendments and adjustments london amendment and adjustment: the ﬁrst amendment to the montreal protocol was agreed upon by the second mop held in london.
57,"this amendment entered into force 2 years later, in 1992."
57,"this amendment required a halt to the consumption or production of chemicals including a variety of cfcs, including carbon tetrachloride (ccl4) and trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) after january 1, 1996 (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1990)."
57,"more speciﬁcally, the following ods were added: f3cl (cfc-13), c2fcl5 (cfc-111), c2f2cl4 (cfc-112), c3fcl7 (cfc-211), c3f2cl6 (cfc-212), c3f3cl5 (cfc-213), c3f4cl4 (cfc-214), c3f5cl3 (cfc-215), c3f6cl2 (cfc-216), c3f7cl (cfc-217), ccl4, and c2h3cl3 (1,1,1-trichloroethane)."
57,"the second mop also adopted an accelerated schedule for the implementation of the cfcs (cfc-11, -12, -113, -114, -115) and halons (halon-1211, -1301, -2402), thus replacing art. 2, paras. 1 and 2 with art."
57,2a (cfcs) and art.
57,2b (halons) of the montreal protocol.
57,copenhagen amendment and adjustment: the fourth mop held in copenhagen in 1992 added the following controlled substances: hydrobromofluorocarbons (hbfcs) and ch3br (methyl bromide) (united nations
58,2 policy and earth observation innovation … 41 environment programme ozone secretariat 1992).
58,"the same mop succeeded in a further adjustment that accelerated the schedule of controlling the following sub- stances: cfcs, halons, other fully halogenated cfcs, cccl4 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform)."
58,"vienna adjustment: while no amendment was accomplished in the seventh mop held in vienna in 1995, another adjustment was successfully decided, which became effective in 1996."
58,"the vienna adjustment accelerated the controlling schedule of hcfc and methyl bromide (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1996a, b)."
58,"implementing the reduction ahead of schedule with respect to the following substances was also agreed upon vis-à-vis developing countries: cfc, halon, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) that had been previously only been the obligation of developed countries (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1996a, b)."
58,"montreal amendment and adjustment: the ninth mop held in montreal in 1997 did not add new substances to be eliminated; instead, the amendment banned the trade of methyl bromide between the parties and non-parties, as well as pro- viding further trade restrictions on new, used, recycled, and reclaimed controlled substances (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1997a, b)."
58,"the adjustment accelerated the schedule of controlling methyl bromide, etc."
58,"(united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1997a, b)."
58,"beijing amendment and adjustment: the 11th mop held in beijing in 1999a, b agreed that hcfcs and bromochloromethane (ch2brcl) would be included as controlled substances (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1999a, b)."
58,it also banned the import and export of ch2brcl from and to non-parties.
58,"another adjustment agreed in this mop was the accelerated imple- mentation of the cfcs, halons, other fully halogenated cfcs and methyl bromide to the level of the basic domestic needs for developing countries (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 1999a, b)."
58,"montreal adjustment: no further changes to the obligations were decided for an 8-year period, but it was then decided at the 19th mop in montreal in 2007 to accelerate the control schedule of hcfcs for developing countries (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 2007)."
58,"efforts for further amendments: since mop21 (2009), several countries have been proposing a freeze on hfc consumption and production."
58,"if adopted, such a freeze would be applicable to developed countries at ﬁrst and then grad- ually to developing countries (united nations environment programme 2009)."
58,"this has been proposed because hfcs, originally developed as alternatives to ods, have now been demonstrated to have a high global warming potential (united nations environment programme 2015)."
58,"ongoing debate has discussed whether this falls under the mandate of the montreal protocol, as hfcs are not ods."
58,"either way, this fact only reinforces the importance of scientiﬁc ﬁndings and a holistic approach."

59,2.2.4 satellite instruments used for ozone monitoring 2.2.4.1 satellite observations before the montreal protocol we seek to determine if satellite observations since the 1970s have had any influence on the choice of the substances speciﬁed in the montreal protocol and each amendment or adjustment thereof.
59,the aim of this section is to study if there is a potential link to be found between satellite monitoring and the adoption and changing of international policy instruments.
59,satellite measurements of total ozone started when the infrared interferometer spectrometer (iris) and backscatter ultraviolet (buv) instruments on nimbus-4 were launched in 1970 (wmo 1981).
59,"major instruments used in the 1970s included buv, which continued to monitor for the next 7 years; the previously mentioned sbuv and toms, launched in 1978; tiros operational vertical sounder (tovs) on tiros-n; limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (lims) on nimbus-6; stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment (sage) on aem-2; and the upper atmosphere research satellite (uars)."
59,"most of the instruments/satellites were used to monitor the concentration of co2, o3 and no2."
59,"sage (since 1979) and sage-ii (since 1984) measured o3, no2 and h2o; and the solar mesospheric explorer (sme) (launched in 1981) measured o3, o3 photodissociation rates, temperature, h2o, thermal emissions, and no2 (wmo 1985a, b)."
59,"until the late 1970s, atmospheric tides were just a theory to be veriﬁed by observation."
59,"the results of laboratory and ground-based experiments into the concentration of ozone in the middle and upper atmosphere also differed from one experimental technique to another, highlighting the need for direct, consistent, and comparable measurements."
59,the scientiﬁc community anticipated the use of satel- lites for such measurements.1 stratospheric circulation and the exchange of con- stituents between the troposphere and the stratosphere started being measured in the late 1970s.
59,"as early as 1981, the scientiﬁc community pointed out that newly introduced satellite observations considerably reduced the geographical limitations on mea- suring total ozone (wmo 1981)."
59,"remote sensing by satellite also contributed to recording large-scale, slowly varying disturbances, which provided a picture of the global mean distribution of ozone and its variations with a wide coverage (wmo 1981)."
59,"climatology literature in the early 1980s stated that there was compelling evi- dence that the composition of the atmosphere was changing and some recent satellite monitoring, e.g., that of the vegetation index of plant activity in 1982, had been effective in precisely identifying the situation (wmo 1985a, b)."
59,"it was emphasized that the continued development of baseline measurements for co, 1 it is stated in one wmo report that “[o]ne of the major difﬁculties encountered in the literature of estimating global total ozone variations is that there is no unique way to estimate such changes from the given ground-based data set” (wmo 1985a, b)."
60,"2 policy and earth observation innovation … 43 ch4, n2o, co2, and halocarbons were vital, and the already accomplished global coverage by nimbus-7 toms ozone column measurements, stratospheric and mesospheric sounder (sams) and lims data from nimbus-7, and stratospheric sounding unit (ssu) data from tiron-n showed promise for the investigation of chemistry exchange processes (wmo 1985a, b)."
60,"in addition to the sbuv and toms measurements, sage and sage-ii measured o3, no2, and h2o; and the sme measured o3, o3 photodissociation rate, temperature, h2o, thermal emission, and no2."
60,"for the future, it was proposed that “[a] satellite-borne co sensor, operating for extended periods (*years), could help enormously.”"
60,"by the mid-1980s it was proven that the changing composition of the atmo- sphere influenced ozone depletion and that continued development of baseline measurements for co, ch4, n2o, co, and halocarbons (ch-11, ch-12, ccl4, etc.) was vital to understand future ozone states."
60,"while it may be said that satellite monitoring—in particular the global scale image of the ozone hole—played an important role in advancing ozone manage- ment policy to the extent that this helped the adoption of the vienna convention, it is fair to conclude that it was one of several techniques used to measure ozone concentration up until the mid-1980s."
60,"there is no evidence that satellite data by itself aided the decisions related to the concrete obligations of the montreal protocol (e.g., which speciﬁc substances to eliminate), though it can be said that scientiﬁc assessment by that time was a major source of information on which the drafting of the montreal protocol was based."
60,"2.2.4.2 after the montreal protocol: amendments and adjustments in 1998, just 1 year after the adoption of the montreal protocol, the wmo pub- lished another two-volume report of the international ozone trends panel 1988 (wmo 1988a, b)."
60,the contents of this report differed greatly from the one pub- lished 3 years earlier.
60,the most distinguished difference was the increased number of explanations of satellite-borne instruments and their use in measuring aerosol variations.
60,"it is even concluded in the report that: “either the ground-based or the satellite system could be assumed to be the standard, and the other system the one of uncertain quality to be tested against it” (wmo 1988a, b)."
60,"sensors such as sbuv are less susceptible to aerosol effects from ground-based natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions, and are regarded as highly efﬁcient in detecting aerosol abundance (wmo 1988a, b)."
60,"according to the report, there was extensive obser- vation of trends in source gases including halocarbons such as ccl3f, ccl2f2, ch3ccl3, ccl4, other chlorocarbons, bromocarbon species, no, ch4 and trace gases influencing tropospheric ozone and hydroxyl radical concentrations."
60,they were sometimes observed directly and other times indirectly via connected chem- ical processes.
60,some of the cfcs and hcfcs were added in the 1990 london amendment and some of the cfcs and halons were in the london adjustment.
60,"comparing the observed gases with those speciﬁed in the london amendment, it can be said that satellite monitoring had an impact on ods control decisions."
61,kasai et al.
61,2.2.5 circumstantial evidence?
61,"reports from sap and orm the scientiﬁc assessment panel (sap), established in accordance with art. 6 of the montreal protocol, assesses the status of the ozone layer and relevant atmospheric science issues."
61,"technical and scientiﬁc assessments reported to the parties at least every 4 years demonstrate: i. the increased importance of scientiﬁc evidence for the amendment and adjustment of the montreal protocol; and, ii. the increased importance of satellite monitoring among observations (wmo/unep 2016)."
61,"the relationships between scientiﬁc assessment and protocol amendment/ adjustment are seen in a chart from wmo/unep (2010), which is reproduced as table 2.1."
61,the contents of each scientiﬁc assessment of stratospheric ozone mostly correspond to the subsequent amendment/adjustment of the montreal protocol (wmo/unep 2014).
61,"table 2.1 relationships between scientiﬁc assessment and protocol amendment/adjustment (wmo/unep 2010) year/policy scientiﬁc assessment process 1981 the stratosphere 1981: theory and measurements 1985 (vienna atmospheric ozone 1985 convention) 1987 (montreal protocol) 1988 international ozone trends panel report: 1988 1989 scientiﬁc assessment of stratospheric ozone: 1989 1990 london amendment and adjustments 1991 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 1991 1992 methyl bromide: its atmospheric science, technology, and economics (assessment supplement) 1992 copenhagen amendment and adjustments 1994 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 1994 1995 vienna adjustments 1997 montreal amendment and adjustments 1998 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 1998 1999 beijing amendment and adjustments 2002 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 2002 2006 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 2006 2007 montreal adjustments 2010 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 2010 2014 scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 2014"
62,"2 policy and earth observation innovation … 45 likewise, as the chart in the executive summary of the scientiﬁc assessment of ozone depletion: 2010 clearly shows, satellite observations are clearly of increased importance in the total assessment (wmo/unep 2010)."
62,"in addition to the sap reports, ozone research managers (orm), established at the occasion of the ﬁrst cop of the vienna convention in 1989, communicate scientiﬁc reports of ozone status every 3 years, 6 months before the respective cop (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 2016)."
62,"unlike the sap reports, orm reports include national reports."
62,"examinations of each national report from 2002 (ﬁfth meeting) to 2014 (ninth meeting) show that the states have increasingly relied on satellite earth observation for monitoring the ozone situa- tion.2 the key sensors used by reporting states include toms on nimbus-7, meteor-3, adeos, and earth probe; sbuv on nimbus-7, -9, -11, -14, -16, -17, -18, -19; sciamachy on envisat; omi on eos-aura; tes on eos-aura; gome-2 on metop-a and metop-b; sam ii on nimbus-7; sage ii on aemb and erbs; mls on uars and eos-aura; haloe on uars; poam ii on spot-3 and poam iii on spot-4; osiris and smr on odin, sage-iii on meteor-3 m; mipas and gomos on envisat; ace on scisat; and hirdls on eos-aura (wmo 2016)."
62,"of these, the toms instrument is the most frequently cited."
62,"all of these sensors can measure o3, no2, so2, hcho, bro and ocio, and monitor various areas of the world."
62,the missions are complementary and provide ozone measurement continuity from the initial toms/sbuv missions that had a signiﬁcant impact on the early stages of decision-making in international ozone policy.
62,"drawing from all the wmo national reports from 2002–2014, the sap reports, and other ozone monitoring techniques, it is clear that satellite monitoring has played an important role in the amendments and adjustments to the montreal protocol (levelt et al."
62,2006; gebhardt et al.
62,2014).
62,"2.2.6 tentative conclusions and way forward as a tentative conclusion, our comparison of the scientiﬁc and technical literature with the texts of the montreal protocol and subsequent amendments/adjustments suggests that the results of scientiﬁc assessments determine the ods identiﬁed in the montreal protocol and its amendments/adjustments."
62,our research also suggests that there is a growing role for satellite observations.
62,"therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that satellite data, alongside other scientiﬁc evidence, have jointly determined the montreal protocol obligations."
62,"2 as archived satellite data has been used by reporting states, satellite instruments referred to by those states could be historical."
62,"examples are the toms sensor on nimbus-7 and meteor-3 (1978– 1994) as well as adeos and earth probe (1996–2006), which were mentioned even in the ninth orm report in 2014 by brazil, chile, china, indonesia, mongolia, norway, turkey and usa (unep 2014)."
63,kasai et al.
63,satellite earth observations may have a long-term role to play in other policy studies.
63,one such example could be the challenges posed by the changing arctic environment.
63,arctic sea ice needs to be monitored for safe ship navigation.
63,"current global warming trends may be causing arctic sea ice shrinkage, making arctic waterways more easily navigable without icebreaker ships."
63,this could generate new issues related to the exploitation of natural resources in previously pristine areas.
63,"however, international and national laws in this area are inconsistent, and the arctic council has had to play a primary role in governance in order to establish inter- national policies in areas where natural conditions are rapidly changing."
63,the eight member states of the arctic council are the coastal states of the arctic.
63,the member states decide most of the rules.
63,"other states have interests in this area (such as japan, china, and korea), but they are only allowed to become observer states and cannot participate directly in the rule-making process."
63,"in this situation, a state with highly advanced technology can contribute to policymaking by providing the scientiﬁc data necessary for arctic research."
63,"japan carries out many research projects, such as the green network of excellence (grene) arctic climate change research project and the arctic challenge for sustainability (arcs) project led by the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology (mext)."
63,japan operates two satellites capable of supporting this issue: i.
63,"ibuki, the greenhouse gases observing satellite (gosat) led by jaxa, the ministry of the environment (moe), and the national institute for environmental studies (nies), is the ﬁrst satellite designed speciﬁcally to observe co2, ch4, and other greenhouse gases to monitor their status/inventory; and, ii."
63,"gcom-w, led by jaxa, provides unique information for monitoring the size of arctic sea ice."
63,"another powerful tool would be precise weather forecasting in the arctic, whereby multiple satellites observe water vapor, clouds, snow, and raindrops with a temporal– spatial resolution of about 1 h and in the order of 1–2 km (not only horizontal but also vertical) using terahertz (thz) microwave passive sensors."
63,thz technology would enable the use of mini-satellites for these multi-satellite observations.
63,the data resulting from japanese research would be recognized as important scientiﬁc knowledge and might contribute to the protection and effective use of the arctic.
63,"2.3 a quantitative approach for linking policy and satellite earth observation using text mining techniques 2.3.1 introduction at ﬁrst glance, policy or decision-making and satellite earth observation belong to entirely different ﬁelds."
63,"however, there is a commonality if we focus on the reports"
64,2 policy and earth observation innovation … 47 and publications that contain information from both of these areas.
64,this section describes a text mining technique to quantify possible linkages between decision-making and satellite earth observation.
64,text mining retrieves high quality information from text data using statistical and mathematical techniques.
64,"in the mid-1980s, labor-intensive manual work was the primary approach to text mining."
64,advances in computing technology over the past few decades have allowed the automation of text mining methods and the development of many useful computer-coded tools.
64,"text mining is now widely applied in many ﬁelds, not only in science but also in marketing, for example for the design of new products using information from customer surveys."
64,natural language processing (nlp) techniques are essential.
64,nlp is the analysis of human language so that computers can understand natural languages as human do.
64,"with the assistance of human experts, nlp techniques are capable of providing a way to verify the detected relationship across different text collections."
64,below we describe an investigation into the role of satellite earth observation in the decision-making process for the montreal protocol.
64,a quantitative linkage between the decision-making process and satellite earth observation is then described.
64,2.3.2 role of satellite earth observation in policy decisions for the montreal protocol the reports of the mop to the montreal protocol were used as the documents that represent the policy decision-making process.
64,"as described above, the montreal protocol has been updated through several amendments and adjustments."
64,"these amendments and adjustments are discussed and determined by the mop, whose reports have been published every year from 1990."
64,one basic and commonly used approach in text mining involves counting the number of times a word occurs.
64,we performed a morphological analysis that assigns a part of speech for all words in 25 mop reports between 1990 and 2014.
64,"only nouns, verbs, and adjectives were extracted from the mop reports because other less meaningful words, such as articles “the” or “a”, function as noise in this analysis."
64,we used the stanford log-linear part-of-speech tagger (toutanova and manning 2000; toutanova et al. 2003) for the morphological analysis.
64,figure 2.2 shows an example result of the morphological analysis in this study.
64,"to unify words with different notations, such as “satellite” and “satellites,” plural nouns were converted to the singular."
64,verbs were converted to the base form.
64,"linking verbs, such as “am”, “are”, and “be”, were omitted from the documents."
64,abbreviations and fully spelled words were also uniﬁed into abbreviations.
64,"for example, “hy- drofluorocarbon (hfc)” was converted to “hfc”."
64,all capital letters in the documents were converted to lower case.
65,kasai et al.
65,2.2 an example of the morphological analysis in this study.
65,the original sentence is quoted from decision vcviii/2: recommendations adopted by the ozone research managers at their seventh meeting (united nations environment programme ozone secretariat 2008) we focused on the word “satellite” to investigate how satellite earth observation is dealt with in the mop.
65,the word “satellite” appeared 19 times in all of the 25 mop reports.
65,"all of the words “satellite” were used in relation to satellite earth observation in the mop reports, so we may take the word “satellite” as being representative of the topic of satellite earth observation."
65,figure 2.3 shows the number of occurrences of the word “satellite” in the mop reports over time.
65,"the results showed that the word “satellite” appeared 13 times in 2008, so we focused on this year."
65,"to investigate the topic in which the word “satellite” is used, we selected the sentences that include the word “satellite” and the sentences immediately before and after."
65,we then extracted the words that appeared more than ﬁve times in the selected sentences.
65,"to extract signiﬁcant words from those in the selected sen- tences, we introduced a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) method to quantify the signiﬁcance of a word."
65,the basic goal of tf-idf is to quantify the signiﬁcance of each word in a document.
65,"in this study, we employed a tf-idf deﬁned by gamon et al. (2005) as follows."
65,here w and d represent the indexes of the word and document.   1 þ log tfw;d  logðndoc =dfw þ; tfw;d  1 tf -idfw;d ¼ ð2:1þ 0; tfw;d ¼ 0 a detailed explanation of tf-idf is described below.
65,"the simplest approach when assigning the signiﬁcance of the word w in document d is to count the number of occurrences, which is called term frequency (tfw,d)."
65,"in this equation, tfw,d is mod- iﬁed to be 1 + log(tfw,d)."
65,"however, the raw tf value is not enough to quantify the signiﬁcance of the words because it is impossible to distinguish those words that"
66,2 policy and earth observation innovation … 49 fig.
66,2.3 number of occurrences of the word “satellite” (nsatellite) in the mop reports from 1990 to 2014.
66,the words in the square box are those that appear more than ﬁve times in the selected sentences around the word “satellite” appear in all documents from those that appear only in a few.
66,"if the tf values of these words are equal, the signiﬁcance should be different."
66,"for example, the word “meeting” appears many times in the mop reports but the signiﬁcance of the word “meeting” should be low."
66,"to solve this problem, the idea of document frequency (df) is introduced."
66,the document frequency is deﬁned as the number of documents that contain the word w.
66,"the signiﬁcance of a word should be high when the df value is low, thus the inverse document frequency (idf) of a word scaled with the total number of documents ndoc is introduced."
66,"in this study, the value of idf for the word w is calculated by log(ndoc/dfw)."
66,"the value of tf-idfw,d is calculated by tfw, d  idfw."
66,here each mop report is treated as one document.
66,"the ﬁve most signiﬁcant words determined by tf-idf were “satellite”, “orm”, “gap”, “seventh” and “obser- vation”."
66,"the word “orm” means the ozone research managers (orm), which include government atmospheric research managers and government managers of research related to health and environmental effects of ozone modiﬁcations."
66,the orm meeting reviews ongoing national and international research and makes recommendations for future research and expanded co-operation between researchers in developed and developing countries for consideration by the conference of the parties to the vienna convention (table 2.2).
66,"in the seventh orm meeting held in 2008, a problem with the nasa aura satellite mission was discussed."
66,the aura satellite is equipped with four instruments to observe ozone and ozone-related species in the stratosphere and troposphere.
66,"the aura satellite and its predecessor nasa satellites, such as the upper atmosphere research satellite (uars) and nimbus series, have been continuously observing the earth’s atmosphere."
66,"the problem was that some of the instruments might have stopped operating anywhere between 2008 and 2010, resulting in a serious gap in the long-term monitoring of ozone since the 1970s."
66,"fortunately, the aura satellite is"

67,"as a consequence, there has been no serious gap in the long-term satellite monitoring of ozone."
67,we emphasize that the mop in 2008 also raised this problem and mentioned the importance of long-term monitoring using satellites.
67,it is clear that satellite earth observation plays a role in policy decisions by providing data on long-term trends of atmo- spheric substances.
67,2.3.3 quantifying the correlation between policy and satellite earth observation the montreal protocol has been updated through amendments and adjustments.
67,"any discussion of amendments and adjustments should be based on scientiﬁc evidence, such as long-term trends of ozone and species related to ozone."
67,"we therefore have focused on the discussion phase for amendments and adjustments to quantify the correlation between policy, or decision-making, and satellite earth observation."
67,"the mop has recently focused on hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs), a signiﬁcant non-ods alternative to cfcs, which have, however, now been shown to have signiﬁcant global warming potential."
67,"since the latter half of the 1990s, global warming and climate change have joined ozone depletion as major issues on the global environmental agenda."
67,"in 1997, the kyoto protocol to the un framework convention on climate change (unfccc) was adopted and entered into force in 2005."
67,the protocol aims to provide speciﬁc goals for international efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
67,the phasing out of hfc production and con- sumption was ﬁrst proposed by several countries at mop21 (2009).
67,figure 2.4a shows the number of occurrences of the word “hfc” (nhfc) in the mop reports over time.
67,the adoption of the kyoto protocol in 1997 triggered a rapid increase in nhfc in 1998.
67,"after the phasing out of hfcs was proposed in 2009, nhfc rose to over 150 in 2014."
67,the increasing ratio (ir) of the word “hfc” was the largest among the substances appearing in the mop reports.
67,table 2.3 shows the ﬁve words with the highest ir values in the mop reports.
67,"in this study, the value of ir for the word w (irw) was deﬁned as follows."

68,the lower panel of fig.
68,2.4a shows the time trend of nhfc in the sap reports published from 1991 to 2014.
68,"in 2010, nhfc increased to about 500, which is consistent in terms of time with the proposal of hfc phase out at mop21 in 2009."
68,figure 2.4b shows the correlation between the probabilities of occurrences of the word “hfc” (phfc) in the mop and sap reports.
68,the value of phfc is calculated by nhfc divided by the total number of words (nall).
68,the value of phfc was averaged during the time interval of the sap
69,kasai et al. report publications.
69,"this ﬁgure shows a positive correlation of phfc between the mop and sap reports, with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.75."
69,"although we could not identify from this analysis whether science drives policy or vice versa, this does demonstrate a certain connection between policy and science."
69,as described in sect.
69,"2.3.2, the role of satellite earth observation is to provide decision-makers information on the long-term trends of atmospheric substances."
69,satellite observations of hfcs were ﬁrst reported in 2012 using the atmospheric chemistry experiment fourier transform spectrometer (ace-fts) onboard the scisat-1 satellite (harrison et al.
69,2012).
69,the long-term trend of hfcs derived from satellite earth observations might accelerate further amendments covering hfc production and consumption.
69,2.3.4 conclusion the correlation between policy and satellite earth observation was investigated for the montreal protocol using basic text mining techniques.
69,we utilized several methods and found that correlations by trend analysis with temporal sequences were the best approach to assessing satellite observations and the montreal protocol.
69,"tracing the word “satellite” in the mop reports, our analysis suggested that satellite earth observation plays a role in policy through the provision of data on long-term trends in atmospheric substances."
69,a certain correlation (correlation coefﬁcient of 0.75) was shown using the word “hfc” for temporal trends in the text from mop and sap reports.
69,"to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst investigation of whether satellite earth observations have an impact on policy using text mining techniques."
69,more in-depth investigations are needed to provide a more detailed understanding.
69,2.4 conclusions from the study of the policy and earth observation innovation cycle the research project entitled “policy and earth observation innovation cycle” began in november 2013.
69,the objective was to identify why satellite earth observations are needed in the context of global environmental policymaking.
69,"satellite earth observations provide useful information for agriculture, resource exploration, industry, and numerous other applications."
69,"meteorological satellites are perhaps the most prominent, facilitating weather forecasting."
69,questions remain over the use of satellites for environmental monitoring—who are the public users other than research scientists and are the data obtained pro- viding societal beneﬁts consistent with the taxpayers’ investment?
69,it appears that a
70,2 policy and earth observation innovation … 53 quantitative answer has yet to be developed as a rationale to support the use of satellites for environmental observations.
70,the functions of satellite observations can be categorized according to their spatiotemporal resolutions.
70,figure 2.5 presents a summary of satellite usage by spatiotemporal scale.
70,it is clear that environmental satellite observations are cur- rently used for long-term trends and global problems.
70,we therefore analyzed global policy in our study.
70,the purpose of the peoic project was to ﬁnd a method for the quantitative evaluation of the impact of satellite earth observations on policy.
70,"planning for satellite observations to address environmental issues—such as ozone depletion, global warming, and air quality—has always been part of policy, such as the montreal protocol, the unfccc and the climate and clean air coalition."
70,we have attempted to provide quantitative evidence of the effect of satellite observa- tions on policy by using a mathematical method.
70,the process of the project was: 1.
70,deﬁne the general system of the peoic as shown in fig.
70,2.1 in sect.
70,2.1 (led by yasuko kasai with the assistance of prof.
70,yoshifumi yasuoka).
70,perform an intensive survey of past evaluation methods for several satellite observations (led by masami onoda).
70,the survey identiﬁed the limitations of assessing the impact of satellite data on policy using document analysis.
70,only a limited number of sample documents can be used for such analysis.
70,"it was also found that even if it is possible to analyze the relationship between satellite data and science, the relationship between science and policy is not straightforward and is difﬁcult to quantify due to the many complicated factors involved."
70,select the target policy (all team members).
70,"we selected an example of a pre- viously successful policy, namely the montreal protocol."
70,satellite observation is fig.

71,"deﬁne the flow between the montreal protocol and the scientiﬁc data, including satellite earth observations (all team members)."
71,"we conﬁrmed that scientiﬁc observations, including satellite measurements, have different roles in the pol- icymaking process."
71,there was an increase in the number of scientiﬁc papers and satellite operations (as shown in fig.
71,2.6) after the montreal protocol was agreed in 1987 in a bid to understand the reality and mechanisms of ozone depletion.
71,our study demonstrated that the agreement of the montreal protocol in 1987 resulted in increased satellite launches.
71,determination of the documentation used in policy and scientiﬁc research (all members).
71,this task was very important for our approach and it took more than one year to deﬁne the documentation.
71,figure 2.7 demonstrates the scope of this task with an organizational map of the vienna convention and montreal protocol (prepared by setsuko aoki).
71,wmo/unep scientiﬁc assessments of ozone depletion were also used.
71,"in-depth evaluation of the policy and scientiﬁc documentation, as summarized in sect."
71,2.2 (setsuko aoki).
71,we conclude that the results from scientiﬁc assessments determine the ods to be eliminated in the montreal protocol and its amendments/adjustments.
71,it seems that satellite data alongside other scientiﬁc evidence jointly determined the obligations of the montreal protocol system.

80,macauley 3.1.1 national space policy of the u.s.
80,"the u.s. policy for earth observation is set out in the national space policy of the united states of america (executive ofﬁce of the president 2010), and includes an emphasis on expanding and identifying international cooperation opportunities."
80,"the policy states in its introduction that: “the united states hereby renews its pledge of cooperation in the belief that with strengthened international collaboration and reinvigorated u.s. leadership, all nations and peoples—space-faring and space-beneﬁting—will ﬁnd their horizons broadened, their knowledge enhanced, and their lives greatly improved.”"
80,the goals of the policy include: “expand inter- national cooperation on mutually beneﬁcial space activities to: broaden and extend the beneﬁts of space; further the peaceful use of space; and enhance collection and partnership in sharing of space-derived information.”
80,"in the section on international cooperation, the policy advocates open access to earth observation data by pro- moting “the adoption of policies internationally that facilitate full, open, and timely access to government environmental data.”"
80,"the policy further states that “depart- ments and agencies shall identify potential areas for international cooperation that may include, but are not limited to: space science; space exploration, including human space flight activities; space nuclear power to support space science and exploration; space transportation; space surveillance for debris monitoring and awareness; missile warning; earth science and observation; environmental moni- toring; satellite communications; global navigation satellite systems (gnss); geospatial information products and services; disaster mitigation and relief; search and rescue; use of space for maritime domain awareness; and long-term preser- vation of the space environment for human activity and use.”"
80,"in the section environmental earth observation and weather, the policy stresses the use of international partnerships to help sustain and enhance weather, climate, ocean, and coastal observation from space."
80,3.1.2 national plan for civil earth observations the u.s.
80,"national plan for civil earth observations (national science and technology council, executive ofﬁce of the president 2014) deﬁnes a new framework for constructing a balanced portfolio of earth observations and observing systems."
80,"this framework classiﬁes earth observation activities according to two broad categories—sustained and experimental—based on the duration of the anticipated federal commitment: – sustained observations are deﬁned as measurements taken routinely that federal agencies are committed to monitoring on an ongoing basis, generally for 7 years or more."
80,these measurements can be for public services or for earth system research in the public interest.
81,"3 innovation in earth observations as a national strategic … 65 – experimental observations are deﬁned as measurements taken for a limited observing period, generally 7 years or less, that federal agencies are committed to monitoring for research and development purposes."
81,"these measurements serve to advance human knowledge, explore technical innovation, and improve services, and in many cases may be ﬁrst-of-their-kind earth observations."
81,"based on this framework and the results of the earth observation assessment (eoa),1 the national plan establishes the following rank-ordered priorities: 1."
81,continuity of sustained observations for public services 2.
81,continuity of sustained observations for earth system research 3.
81,continued investment in experimental observations 4.
81,planned improvements to sustained observation networks and surveys for all observation categories 5.
81,"continuity of, and improvements to, a rigorous assessment and prioritization process."
81,action 72 of the plan states: “maintain and strengthen international collaboration.
81,the global nature of many earth observations and the value of these observations to u.s.
81,"government decision-makers require u.s. agencies to carry out their missions through collaboration with foreign agencies, international orga- nizations, and standards/coordination groups."
81,"through international collaboration, u.s. agencies leverage foreign data and scientiﬁc expertise to improve their understanding of remote areas, such as the open ocean and polar regions, and to characterize global atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial phenomena."
81,"in addition, collaboration with international partners helps to minimize unnecessary redundancy in the collection of earth observations, and ensures the effective use of limited resources."
81,"u.s. agencies also work closely with the department of state and other agencies to provide associated scientiﬁc and technical support for u.s. foreign policy, security, economic, and environmental interests.”"

82,"3.1.4 decadal survey for earth science and applications from space the so-called “decadal survey” (national academy of sciences 2007) is based on the request of nasa, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa)/national environmental satellite, data, and information service (nesdis), and the u.s."

82,the last decadal survey for earth science and applications from space was published in 2007 (national academy of sciences 2007).
82,the decadal survey for 2017–2027 is now ongoing.
82,"in the current survey, its “prioritization of research activities will be based on the committee’s consideration of identiﬁed science priorities; broad national operational observation priorities as identiﬁed in u.s. government policy, law, and international agreements (for example, the 2014 national plan for civil earth observations) and the relevant appropriation and authorization acts governing nasa, noaa, and usgs; cost and technical readiness; the likely emergence of new technologies; the role of supporting activ- ities such as in situ measurements; computational infrastructure for modeling, data assimilation, and data management; and opportunities to leverage related activities including consideration of interagency cooperation and international collabora- tion…the survey committee will work with nasa, noaa, and usgs to understand agency expectations of future budget allocations and design its rec- ommendations based on budget scenarios relative to those expectations."
82,"the committee may also consider scenarios that account for higher or lower than anticipated allocations…the committee may also identify potential interagency and international synergies; proposed augmentations to planned international missions; and adjustments to u.s. missions planned, but not yet implemented.”"
82,"the use of earth observations for policy include a variety of areas such as: agricultural crop production, atmosphere–ocean coupled general circulation models (with co2 damages being quantiﬁed and the dollar value of damage being applied to the cost of new appliances for purposes of establishing minimum energy"
83,"3 innovation in earth observations as a national strategic … 67 efﬁciency standards in the u.s.), direct input to the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), the application of gravity recovery and climate experiment-data assimilation system (grace-das) to the u.s."
83,"drought monitor weekly mapping process, weather projections and forecasts; near real-time adaptive management or identiﬁcation of deviation in long-term trends; and cyber infrastructure."
83,the aforementioned assessments and surveys rely upon various methods to judge impact and rank priorities.
83,earth observation projects almost always provide information as their primary output.
83,"if decision-makers who are the primary users of the project’s output are available to assist, then value of information (voi) methods can be used (nasa earth science applied sciences program 2012)."
83,"3.2 quantifying the economic value of information voi methods, which are primarily prospective, measure how new information changes a decision-maker’s prior beliefs about uncertainties and the value the decision-maker would derive from the resulting change (nasa earth science applied sciences program 2012)."
83,voi is a concept that enables the integration of the economic value of satellite data into economic analyses.
83,the idea that information has value in both a statistical and a pragmatic sense dates back at least to the 1950s.
83,"in recent years, interest in the economic voi has taken center stage."
83,"in the ﬁeld of space studies, this refers to innovations in the technologies that collect information; this is the new information provided by the growing number of earth-orbiting satellites, an area where recent applications of voi methods are critically important for informing investment in satellite networks (laxminarayan and macauley 2012)."
83,"the following are voi principles that are relevant for earth observation: – information has value if it can either make a current choice more secure and conﬁdent or if it can reveal a different choice as better than the current choice; – information may lead to recognition that there is more uncertainty than initially thought; – information has value even if it introduces more uncertainty (it reveals that what was thought to be certain may not be); – perfect information may not be worth the cost of acquisition; – some attributes of information may confer more value than others (e.g., spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution; accuracy, precision, and other statistical properties of the distribution of information); – information tends to have value if it enables an action or a decision; – information, once acquired, is available at low additional cost, and one person’s use may not preclude another person’s use."
83,some information is about goods and services for which no prices exist.

90,friedl 4.2 earth science and applications one of nasa’s agency-wide goals is to “advance understanding of earth and develop technologies to improve the quality of life on our home planet” (nasa 2014).
90,"nasa’s earth science program supports fundamental and applied research on the earth system, discovering new insights about the planet and the complex interactions within the earth system."
90,"using the vantage point from space, global perspectives enable nasa to pro- vide a broad, integrated set of high-quality data covering all parts of the planet."
90,"nasa shares this unique information openly with the global community, including members of the science, government, industry, education, and policy-maker com- munities (nasa 2014)."
90,"within nasa earth science, its applied sciences program is a dedicated effort to promote innovative and practical uses of earth observations."
90,the program supports applied research and applications projects to enable near-term uses of earth observations that inform organizations’ decisions and that build key capa- bilities in the earth science community and broader global workforce.
90,projects are carried out in partnership with private and public-sector organizations to achieve sustained uses and beneﬁts from earth observations.
90,"the program addresses technical and human barriers to the use of new data and tools, creating new knowledge about effective methods and processes for applying earth science (e.g., hossain 2014)."
90,"4.3 inform decisions within the scientiﬁc community, the identiﬁcation of the human role in and impacts on the earth system have grown signiﬁcantly."
90,"there are clear human dimensions to physical and biological parameters, such as air quality conditions and land use patterns."
90,with this recognition have come numerous efforts supporting greater integration of natural and social sciences.
90,a u.s.
90,"national academy of sciences report sug- gested efforts “to facilitate crosscutting research focused on understanding the interaction among the climate, human, and environmental systems …” (nrc 2009)."
90,the future earth initiative stemmed from the proposal for “a new contract between science and society in recognition that science must inform policy to make more wise and timely decisions …” (icsu 2012).
90,"in the u.s., the obama administration directed u.s."
90,federal agencies in 2015 to factor the value of ecosystem services into federal planning and decision-making (omb 2015).
90,the u.s.
90,"global change research program’s (usgcrp) 2012 strategic plan also included an objective on greater integration with social, behavioral, and economic sciences (usgcrp 2012)."
91,4 beneﬁts assessment of applied earth science 75 this integration also offers signiﬁcant opportunities to improve decision-making.
91,"knowledge from the decision sciences, economics, and other social sciences can support ways to better incorporate earth observations into analyses used for policy and business management decisions."
91,"notably, the usgcrp’s strategic plan introduced a goal focused on informing decisions for the ﬁrst time in the usgcrp’s history."
91,the language of policy and business management is often an economics-based lexicon.
91,the integration will require adjustments within the nat- ural science and earth observation communities (mooney 2013).
91,"however, the integration can help the earth observation community gain skills to articulate its value and improve its support to decision-making."
91,it is with these trends that nasa has supported signiﬁcant efforts to quantify the socioeconomic beneﬁts of earth observation applications and build familiarity within the earth observation community.
91,"4.4 socioeconomic beneﬁts of earth observations as suggested, national and international organizations are placing greater emphasis on the beneﬁts achievable from applications of earth observations."
91,"the determi- nation of speciﬁc societal and economic impacts, especially quantitatively, can be challenging, yet these determinations are critical to the value proposition of earth observations and to induce greater use."
91,nasa earth science and its applied sciences program have supported numerous studies to assess and document the beneﬁts of earth observations for decision-making.
91,nasa has and continues to advance analytic techniques and quantitative methodologies for determining socioeconomic impacts across a range of themes.
91,some of the socioeconomic studies that the applied sciences program has sponsored include • disasters: volcanic ash and aviation safety; • water: improving water quality management; • health: malaria early warning using earth observations; • drought: value of information for the u.s.
91,"drought monitor; • ecosystems: fisheries management and pelagic habitats; • air quality: enhancements to the bluesky emissions assessment system; • wildﬁres: beneﬁts of bluesky for smoke management and air quality; and, • air quality: earth observations and the environmental protection agency’s (epa) airnow system."
91,the following are summaries of two project-impact studies that the applied sciences program has sponsored; the information is paraphrased from the authors’ reports and also appeared on the program’s website.
92,friedl 4.4.1 earth observations and air quality air pollutants can cause signiﬁcant short-term- and long-term effects to human health.
92,the u.s.
92,"epa operates the airnow air quality system, which health ofﬁcials use to alert the public about hazardous pollution."
92,"a nasa-sponsored project pursued the use of aura, aqua, and terra data within the epa airnow air quality system."
92,"by incorporating the earth observa- tions into airnow, epa could expand the system’s coverage to reach millions of people not currently covered by the network of ground-based air quality monitors."
92,"in the project’s economic impact report, the analysis involved two approaches: face-to-face interviews in three case study locations (denver, colorado; atlanta, georgia; and kansas city, missouri) to assess the public value or community-level beneﬁts and analysis of cost savings from the use of satellite data instead of installing new monitors to provide air quality information for public health deci- sions to populations in currently unmonitored locations."
92,the study found that the addition of satellite data could provide daily particulate matter information to 82% of people living in currently unmonitored locations (approximately 15 million people); the study estimated that the capability repre- sents a value of about usd 26 million.
92,the three case studies also identiﬁed nonmonetary value and beneﬁts.
92,"interviewees reported reduced adverse health impacts on sensitive populations resulting from more accurate air pollution warnings and health alerts, and increased public viewing and understanding of air quality maps on airnow because of greatly increased spatial coverage."
92,"they also reported increased media use of airnow air quality maps resulting from expanded geographic coverage; more comprehensive air quality stories available to the media because of improved geographical representation of pollutant transport resulting from unusual events; and better communication with the public about the spatial distribution of air pollution, especially in sparsely monitored areas, resulting in better public under- standing of these issues."
92,"4.4.2 volcanic ash, earth observations, and aviation safety large volcanic eruptions can eject ash to heights at which commercial aircraft normally fly."
92,"volcanic ash can cause damage to engines and fuselages, making it necessary to reroute, delay, or cancel flights to protect aircraft and ensure passenger safety."
92,the international aviation community uses information and warnings from nine volcanic ash advisory centers (vaac) on the location of volcanic ash.
92,"in 2010, iceland’s eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted, sending volcanic ash into european airspace and canceling flights."
92,"european vaacs had not used aura data, and a nasa-sponsored project team developed and delivered data products within"
93,4 beneﬁts assessment of applied earth science 77 days of the eruption.
93,european ofﬁcials used the aura products in their determi- nations of which airspace to open.
93,an impact analysis analyzed the beneﬁts of the project and vaac’s use of aura data.
93,"one part focused on the beneﬁts from use following the eyjafjallajökull eruption, and one part focused on a global estimate of average annual beneﬁts."
93,"the analysis team used data on flight cancelations and revenue losses due to eyjafjallajökull, historical frequencies of aircraft damage from volcanic ash, and aircraft repair costs."
93,"the team estimated how much the aura data would reduce the uncertainty about the level of ash threat, determining a risk-adjusted value of the observations."
93,"overall, the analysis found that the satellite data reduced the proba- bility of an aircraft experiencing a volcanic ash incident by approximately 12%."
93,the team estimated that use of the data following the eyjafjallajökull eruption saved usd 25–72 million in avoided revenue losses due to unnecessary delays and avoided aircraft damage costs.
93,"if the data had been used from the beginning of the incident, an estimated additional usd 132 million in losses and costs might have been avoided."
93,the team extrapolated the risk-adjusted results globally to estimate the potential annual impact from the use of earth observations by vaacs.
93,"accounting for annual frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, the team estimated an expected value of up to usd 10 million annually."
93,"4.5 sustainable development goals these efforts to measure the impacts of earth observations on decision-making mirrors and aligns with other endeavors globally to use data to advance social, economic, and environmental progress."
93,most notable are the united nations’ sustainable development goals.
93,"in 2015, the united nations endorsed transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, a global development agenda for all coun- tries and stakeholders to use as a blueprint for progress on sustainability."
93,"the 2030 agenda speciﬁcally calls for new data acquisition and exploitation of a wide range of data sources to support implementation, including a speciﬁc reference to earth observations and geospatial information."
93,"thus, the 2030 agenda represents a key opportunity for earth observations to play insightful roles in monitoring targets, planning, and tracking progress that can contribute toward achieving the goals."
93,the long-term collection of data on the goals provides worldwide opportunities to produce examples and further develop analytic methods on the socioeconomic beneﬁts of earth observations.
94,friedl 4.6 conclusion earth observations are often one of many sources of information that are used in decision-making activities.
94,"the articulation of the speciﬁc impact from earth observations on a decision can be challenging to substantiate fully, yet the pursuit has both intellectual and strategic beneﬁts."
94,"similarly, a familiarity with the terms and methods of the social and economic sciences provide the earth observation community with greater opportunities and audiences."
94,the global community has made signiﬁcant strides in the past decade to begin tapping satellite data for the purposes of policy and management decisions.
94,"thus, further efforts to determine and document earth observations’ impacts in socially and economically meaningful terms can support broader efforts to employ the data, seek additional data, and lead to additional advances and further societal beneﬁts."

96,"chapter 5 esa’s earth observation strategy and copernicus josef aschbacher in 2015, esa adopted a new esa earth observation strategy 2040."
96,the former strategy had been written some 20 years ago and was closely linked to the concept of the living planet programme.
96,"with the earth observation envelope programme (eoep) and the earthwatch mechanism, the strategy overcame the approach of running isolated, one-off missions."
96,"the advent of copernicus, discussed in more detail below, was a key factor in the decision to prepare an updated strategy."
96,"esa’s earth observation strategy 2040 covers the period from 2015 to 2040, with an interim progress review scheduled for 2025."
96,"the new strategy builds upon existing elements, but also takes into account new developments and boundary conditions."
96,"it responds to societal challenges such as food, water, energy, climate, and civil security, while fully embracing the novel opportunities of the ict revolution."
96,"cloud-based access to earth observation data, for the beneﬁt of all levels of society, is a central element."
96,"according to the new strategy the vision of esa is to enable the maximum beneﬁt of earth observation for science, society and economic growth in europe, served by european industry."
96,"esa will implement this vision through its earth observation programmes, working in close cooperation with member states, the eu, eumetsat and european industry within the widest interna- tional framework."
96,"the strategy sees esa in an enabling, facilitating, and leading role, taking account of the strategies, objectives, and activities of the other earth observation stakeholders in europe."
96,it also recognizes that: “economic factors are of increasing importance in decision-making” and attaches great importance to the service industry.
96,"the esa earth observation strategy 2040 is implemented through a number of programmes that are dedicated to both scientiﬁc (eoep, earthwatch, climate change initiative) and operational demands (copernicus, metop, meteosat)."

97,"aschbacher copernicus is a case in point, illustrating many of the concepts mentioned above."
97,"copernicus, previously known as the global monitoring for environment and security (gmes) programme, is the most ambitious earth observation programme to date."
97,"it will provide accurate, timely and easily accessible information to improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure civil security."
97,"in essence, copernicus will help to shape the future of our planet for the beneﬁt of all."
97,"copernicus consists of a complex set of systems that collect vast amounts of data from multiple sources, including earth observation satellites and in situ sensors (e.g., ground stations, airborne/seaborne instruments) and provides users with reliable and up-to-date information through a set of services related to environ- mental and security issues."
97,"these services fall into six main categories: land management, the marine environment, atmosphere, emergency response, security, and climate change."
97,"the european commission (ec), acting on behalf of the european union (eu), is responsible for the overall initiative, setting requirements and managing the services."
97,"the copernicus space component features a new family of dedicated satellites, called sentinels, speciﬁcally for the operational needs of the copernicus program."
97,"the sentinels provide a unique set of observations, starting with the all-weather, day and night radar images from sentinel-1a, launched in april 2014."
97,sentinel-1b followed in april 2016.
97,"sentinel-2a and sentinel-2b, launched in june 2015 and in march 2017, deliver high-resolution optical images for land services."
97,"sentinel-3a, launched in february 2016, provides data for services relevant to the ocean and land."
97,sentinel-4 and -5 will provide data for atmospheric composition monitoring from geostationary and polar orbits respectively.
97,"sentinel-6 will carry a radar altimeter to measure global sea-surface height, primarily for operational oceanography and climate studies."
97,"in addition, the sentinel-5 precursor mission will reduce data gaps between envisat (in particular the sciamachy instrument) and the launch of sentinel-5."
97,"the copernicus space component is managed by esa and serves users’ satellite data available through the sentinels and other copernicus contributing missions at national, european, and international levels."
97,"as the architect of the space component, esa coordinates satellite data delivery."
97,"the ground segment, facilitating access to satellite data, completes the copernicus space component."
97,policy makers and public authorities are the main users of copernicus.
97,"information supplied by copernicus is used to develop environmental legislation and policies or to make critical decisions in the event of an emergency, such as a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis."
97,copernicus is a prime example of successful cooperation between the eu and esa in space matters and it marks the transition from scientiﬁc to operational earth observation for the environment and civil security.
97,"it is a quantum leap in terms of coverage, data volume, revisit frequency, and long-term availability of satellite data."
97,the full integration of operational users into the information chain is at the heart of copernicus.
97,"copernicus is also a model for the future evolution of the eu-esa relationship, and there are important synergies."
97,the r&d and space infrastructure management
98,5 esa’s earth observation strategy and copernicus 83 expertise of esa can help fulﬁll eu policy requirements.
98,the ec can integrate space and its applications into relevant sectorial policies and deliver the necessary funding.
98,the socioeconomic impact of earth observation has become a key argument to justify european investments.
98,"for copernicus, independent studies conducted by price waterhouse coopers and booz & allen have shown that, on average, eur 1 invested in copernicus leads to an economic beneﬁt of up to eur 10 due to better decisions, more efﬁcient policy implementation, as well as savings due to better preparedness in case of natural disasters (espi 2011)."
98,"former vice-president of the ec, antonio tajani, estimated that copernicus would create up to 83,000 jobs in the eu by 2030."
98,"as another example, the european association of remote sensing companies (earsc) estimates the economic value generated by the use of satellite imagery in supporting winter navigation in the baltic sea to be between eur 24 million and eur 116 million per annum alone."
98,copernicus illustrates the various economic potentials of space.
98,"classical busi- ness opportunities arise across the whole spectrum of the value-added chain, from development and manufacturing (upstream) to operations and services (down- stream)."
98,"however, the commercial potential of space also exists at a higher level."
98,"by providing platforms and infrastructure for information exchange and informed decision-making, space applications contribute to better governance, more efﬁcient use of resources, and increased competitiveness."
98,"furthermore, space utilization can yield evidence for long-term processes that increase knowledge and understanding as a basis for responsible action."
98,this aspect of space is especially relevant to tackling the challenge of climate change.
98,"reducing the impact of climate change will not only lead to economic savings, it will also allow countering societal challenges caused, for example, by droughts or food shortages, which are one of the prime causes of migration."
98,"last but not least, space activities create beneﬁts that are not always quantiﬁable in ﬁnancial indicators, but that are tangible in providing better global information about the earth’s state and threats to its environment and people, thereby enhancing citizens’ safety and quality of life."
98,"there is another aspect of copernicus relevant to the economic potential of earth observation, namely the issue of data and information policy."
98,"in fact, the beneﬁts mentioned above will only occur on a large scale if access to space-based data and information is full, free, and open, as in the case of copernicus."
98,the issue of the data policy for copernicus as a public endeavor touches upon the question of handling public sector information (psi).
98,"in principle, there are two ways of handling psi that is meant for release—it can either be sold or given away for free."
98,data and information created by publicly owned infrastructure holds considerable value.
98,"however, this does not mean that it is economically wise to commercialize the data."
98,the example of landsat—a u.s. satellite program that had its data policy changed to free and open access in 2008—shows that the utilization of space-based information and its commercial exploitation increase signiﬁcantly when it is supplied at no cost.
98,"in 2011, over 100 times more landsat data was downloaded than in 2007."
99,aschbacher a study by earsc shows that the same effect can be expected for copernicus (earsc 2012).
99,free and open access to sentinel data boosts economic activity and raises public tax income.
99,"these beneﬁts, though time delayed, will outweigh the income that could have been generated by selling the data instead."
99,it should be recalled that raw data holds little commercial value.
99,the value is created/increased by value-added products and services derived from the raw data —another motivation for providing the raw data for free to support the development of such products/services and to increase industrial competence within this sector.
99,young entrepreneurs need an open data policy to develop innovative businesses.
99,"without an open data policy, returns will be much lower and barely recover investment costs."
99,"to sum up these economic considerations, the copernicus program’s success depends on the widest possible availability and use of copernicus data and infor- mation."
99,"without free and open access and a long-term commitment to data avail- ability, companies and users would not have invested in integrating the program into their services."
99,"beyond economic considerations, there are a number of other reasons why a free and open data policy has been adopted for copernicus."
99,"firstly, in general the eu itself advocates free and open access models to favor innovation, as demonstrated in its 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, or in the psi and infrastructure for spatial information in the european community (inspire) directives, which aim to ensure the widest possible dissemination of environmental information held by public bodies."
99,"moreover, the two directives share the objective of enhancing the transparency and availability of public data."
99,"in addition, copernicus is the european contribution to global earth observation system of systems (geoss), which is based on the principle of free exchange of crucial satellite data and information."
99,"furthermore, numerous (international) organizations, for example the world climate research programme (wcrp) or the european science foundation (esf), have voiced their strong advocacy of free and open data policies."
99,"looking outside europe, the u.s., china, and russia grant free and open access to satellite data."
99,"since the provision of data to users takes place within an open world market, protection of european data would not have stopped others offering and sharing their data."
99,"instead, it would have simply increased the dependency of scientists and value adders on non-european data."
99,this would have been a strategic setback for europe.
99,"last but not least, member states, who invested signiﬁcantly in establishing the space component, also advocated for a free and open data policy."
99,local govern- ments and public bodies echoed the sentiment.
99,"accordingly, after some discussion, an overall copernicus data and information policy based on the concept of free and open access was decided through the ec’s delegated regulation (eu) no. 1159/2013, supplementing regulation (eu) no."
99,911/2010.
99,the overall copernicus data and information policy enshrines the principles that had already been established for the sentinel satellites.
99,"the key elements are that there are no restrictions, neither on the use (commercial and"
100,"5 esa’s earth observation strategy and copernicus 85 noncommercial) nor on users (be they european or non-european); that a free version of any dataset is available on the relevant dissemination platform; and that data and information are available worldwide, without limitation in time."
100,the fao forest resources assessments (fra) of 2015 used landsat and not sentinel-2 data due to the uncertainty around the copernicus data policy at the time of decision.
100,other similar programs would not have invested in either the ground segment or data assimilation strategies without guaranteed access.
100,"there are market segments of space-based earth observation where commercial models apply, for example in the data range of a resolution better than two meters (e.g., terrasar-x, cosmo-skymed, or pleiades)."
100,"the sentinels, however, do not cover this market segment."
100,"if in the future a sentinel (e.g., for security purposes) addresses such a market segment, the free and open data policy will have to be reviewed."
100,it should be stressed that a free and open data policy does not need to endanger commercial business models of earth observation data providers.
100,this is demon- strated by the case of guyana.
100,"despite having full terrain coverage from public data sources, guyana also requires and purchases coverage from commercial sources to obtain higher resolution data for forest inventories."
100,"sentinel data are very important for guyana, but it continues to use complementary commercial data."
100,copernicus is now a tangible reality with ﬁve sentinels in orbit and more to follow soon.
100,"the volume of disseminated data is huge and rapidly growing, with more than 74,000 users registered on the sentinel scientiﬁc data hub and more than 24 petabytes of data having been downloaded."
100,"the copernicus services are in place or about to reach their full performance, with excellent user uptake."
100,"one can conclude that the right decisions have been made—copernicus is up and running, it puts europe at the forefront of operational earth monitoring, and it delivers all kinds of beneﬁts to citizens in europe and around the world."

102,chapter 6 earth observation—uk perspective and policy martin sweeting 6.1 observations providing scientiﬁc evidence to support decision-making observations of the physical and built environment are of critical importance to every country.
102,"since these environments are directly tied to national wellbeing, prosperity, and security, robust observing systems are vital for understanding, managing, and forecasting environmental change."
102,the uk is no exception to this and it is important to capitalize on such observations to support decision-making in government with accurate and timely scientiﬁc evidence for the greatest public beneﬁt.
102,"knowledge of the consequences of urban and rural development on the quality of life, as well as the efﬁciency of business, can only be gained through compre- hensive, continuous, and fresh observational data derived from a wide variety of sensors and sources."
102,"comprehensive environmental observation also requires sys- tems that can be applied to various timescales, from short-lived events that need to be monitored on an hourly or daily basis to long-term climate and geological changes."
102,"robust, continuous and accurate data are required to help the uk government make evidence-based decisions about the effects of climate change and their possible mitigation."
102,"these observations need to be assured over the long-term so that they can provide information on trends such as the rate of the global rise in sea level, the contribution of greenhouse gases and the effect of air trafﬁc on the solar radiation budget."

103,sweeting 6.2 challenges for uk society and role of observations the uk faces a number of speciﬁc challenges: a growing and ageing population necessitating urban development and improved infrastructure services; a shift from traditional industries to an information-based economy that requires ubiquitous communications; increased severity of impact and frequency of natural events; and a need for actionable knowledge to counter the threats posed by terrorism.
103,"the need to adapt to the changing environment necessitates the monitoring of a growing range of parameters that feed into increasingly sophisticated models, using infor- mation derived from observation data to provide a more comprehensive picture on which government departments can base strategic, policy, and tactical decisions."
103,"these decisions will have signiﬁcant impact on the uk economy, as well as the health and safety of its citizens."
103,"there are, however, a number of challenges in capitalizing on these almost overwhelming streams of sensor data."
103,"exponentially growing databases need to be stored, processed and transformed into concise information products that are useful for knowledge-based decision-making across government, industry, and business."
103,"signiﬁcant variations in prevailing uk climate conditions are already affecting housing, agriculture and livestock, and the reliability of transport."
103,the uk obser- vation policies and planning aim to address both monitoring these near-term phe- nomena and long-term trends.
103,"an understanding of the impact upon the uk of climate changes occurring beyond our shores is, of course, necessary and relies upon observations that are global and long-term, with international standards of interoperability so that data can be shared and used globally."
103,environmental observation from space is a fast-moving ﬁeld.
103,"sensor and instrument technologies are developing rapidly, along with the platforms to carry them, especially the recent deployment of constellations of smaller, lower cost satellites and/or networks of sensors alongside larger multi-instrument platforms."
103,"combined with tremendous advances in storage and data-processing capabilities, there are unprecedented opportunities for space-borne instruments to enhance our understanding of the dynamic environment."
103,"however, to take best advantage of these advances the uk sees that there is an urgent need for an integrated, coordi- nated, and sustained international climate observing system."
103,"6.3 new technologies and opportunities there are new techniques emerging and on the horizon that will dramatically change the ﬁeld of earth observation, both in technological capability and the need for new policies and, possibly, legal frameworks."
103,"constellations comprising hundreds of highly capably small satellites (such as those proposed by google, facebook, spacex, urthecast, oneweb), operating alongside conventional large-scale science observatory missions, will provide agile"
104,6 earth observation—uk perspective and policy 89 global monitoring with a variety of rapidly developed sensors on a greatly expanded scale and persistence.
104,possibly the most signiﬁcant change may come from automated sensors con- nected to the internet for real-time data as part of the ‘internet of things’.
104,"this, coupled with the wider use of opportunistic data from systems not originally designed for environmental observation (hand-held devices, cars, aircraft, etc.), could result in an entirely new dimension to data gathering, creating both high spatial and temporal observations."
104,"the emergence of crowd sourcing and ‘citizen science’, when combined with authoritative data sources, could provide unprece- dented feedback on the effectiveness of policy and timely evidence of environ- mental impact."
104,these developments will cause an avalanche of data.
104,"cloud computing techniques will be employed for the effective processing, storage, and dissemination of the observations and enable to powerful data mining and cross-correlation on a scale almost unimaginable hitherto."
104,"however, it is critical to move these new technologies from research to operational deployment in a timely manner."
104,"the resulting information base will provide policy makers with unprecedented opportunities for extracting actionable knowledge to respond to near-real-time events, such as floods and pollution, as well as longer duration trends, such as tracking sea level rise and the shrinking of polar ice caps and forests."
104,"planning for the future is based on understanding the past, the present, and trends."
104,"forecasts and planning data are intended to provide consistent and timely information to gov- ernmental and commercial planners to reduce uncertainty in multiple sectors, e.g. transport, agriculture, insurance, energy, and healthcare."
104,"6.4 the national and international contexts potential policy and economic beneﬁts of observing systems are tied to national interests and priorities, but some policy and legal aspects of environmental observing systems have regional or global implications and can only be addressed in an international context."
104,"many international agreements and undertakings depend on high quality, fresh, geospatial, and environmental data."
104,"the uk is a relatively small island but, whilst it has its own speciﬁc concerns, it is inevitably affected by phenomena beyond its shores."
104,"for example, data with high spatial and temporal resolution on a regional basis are needed to assess air quality, attribute the source of air pollution, and identify pollution transport mechanisms to identify speciﬁc regional problems and to monitor for compliance with treaties on climate, strato- spheric ozone depletion, etc."
104,"the uk approach is to recognize that contributions by all forms and sources of observations, both national and international, are needed and that, if treated coherently, the value of this whole is greater than the sum of the parts."
104,the uk
105,sweeting therefore contributes substantially to international observing programmes (e.g.
105,copernicus) whilst also supporting national applications through the harwell applications catapult to provide better and easier access to data and the assurance of data continuity that are essential for entrepreneurs and small to medium-sized enterprises (smes) to commit to developing information products and services.
105,"thus, there is a growing realization and move towards dissolving data barriers and sharing public and private observational data between government departments, institutions, and commercial entities, thus encouraging a pan-government appreci- ation of the beneﬁts of observations and cooperative exploitation for policy and action."
105,"with the right observation infrastructure, skills base, and international partnerships, the information gathered from these systems can drive social policy and economic growth."
105,"6.5 the importance of sustained funding and stakeholder dialogue the uk government understands that sustaining services and research and making the necessary advances in monitoring and forecasting in the future requires stable long-term funding, accompanied by wise policies governing observation methods."
105,"the improved understanding of the natural environment, together with enhanced predictive capability in weather, climate and related hazards, create opportunities for industry and business in this developing global market."
105,"there are, however, new policy challenges brought about by these advances."
105,"the increased ubiquity, coupled with spatial and temporal resolution, raises ques- tions associated with individual privacy."
105,non-state rather than institutional players may soon dominate observation data banks and their exploitation for commercial beneﬁt may give rise to conflicts of interest.
105,"increasing ease and affordability of access to the space environment will bring into question present export policies, shutter control policies and drive regulations regarding orbital debris."
105,the growth in capability of commercial uk small satellites for optical earth observation and radar remote sensing has driven the uk space agency to develop a national earth observation policy for the ﬁrst time.
105,"to ensure that these critical issues are addressed and the best use of environ- mental observations is made for national interests, the uk understands that there is a clear need for continuing dialogue between government stakeholders, industry, business and the academic/expert community."
105,"this dialogue should address the need for effective, efﬁcient exploitation of existing systems and evaluate opportu- nities for new capabilities for environmental monitoring."
105,it is important to capitalize on environmental observations to support decision-making in government with accurate and timely scientiﬁc evidence for the greatest public beneﬁt.
106,"6 earth observation—uk perspective and policy 91 6.6 an example of novel international collaboration on earth observation led by the uk in 2002, the uk formed and led the international disaster monitoring constellation (dmc), a wide-area satellite surveillance system based around a constellation of small earth observation satellites speciﬁcally to provide daily revisit anywhere in the world to assist in the monitoring, assessment, and mitigation of natural and man-made disasters."
106,"the constellation comprised satellites contributed by different nations (algeria, china, nigeria, spain, turkey, uk), each built and launched by sstl in the uk."
106,a total of seven microsatellites and one minisatellite carrying 600 km wide-swath medium-resolution (*20 metres gsd) imagers have been launched into the same 686 km polar sun-synchronous orbit and manoeuvred so that they are equidistant around that orbit.
106,this ensures that the wide imaging swaths provide the rapid revisit capability.
106,"each satellite is owned and operated in orbit by a different country and orga- nization and used to meet their individual national earth observation needs; how- ever, the constellation has been coordinated by sstl, through dmcii ltd, to be able to provide rapid imagery in response to activations of the international charter or directly to stricken areas of the constellation members."
106,members of the con- stellation also exchange data to be able to gain the beneﬁts of a constellation of multiple satellites whilst only having to fund a single satellite.
106,"as disasters occur relatively infrequently, the excess capacity of the satellites was used extensively for monitoring agriculture, water and land resources, mapping, pollution, deforestation, and desertiﬁcation, as well as providing data to commercial users."
106,"the 600 km wide imaging swath provided users with immediate large-area views, rather than having to be built up from a mosaic of scenes collected on different dates, sometimes weeks or months apart with a variety of lighting conditions."
106,"the wide swath is also a major advantage for disaster monitoring/relief operations; for example, the entire area of the indian ocean basin that was affected by the tsunami in 2004 was mapped by dmc satellites in less than 2 weeks, enabling comprehensive analysis of the worst-hit areas and the queuing of higher resolution (but limited swath) satellites from other charter contributors to assess in greater detail."
106,"for this reason, in addition to the wide-area payload, the ﬁfth satellite in the series was equipped with a much higher resolution camera that permitted objects as small as 4 m on the ground to be distinguished and to provide more detailed follow-up observations of smaller areas (up to 24 km in extent), which were identiﬁed as being of particular interest through the analysis of the medium-resolution data."
106,"subsequently, in 2011 and in 2015, more capable min- isatellites with resolutions down to 1 m ground sample distance alongside improved medium-resolution wide-swath imagers were added to the dmc."
106,the dmc proved to be a highly effective and novel form of partnership in earth observation using small satellites.

108,"satellite earth observations can beneﬁt many areas of society, including environment and resources management, agriculture and food security, transport, air quality and health, risk management, and security."
108,"since the start of the spot program, the french government has encouraged the use of satellite earth observations for public policy needs and downstream appli- cations."
108,"in response, the french national centre for space studies (cnes) initiated an iterative dialog with policy makers, scientiﬁc communities, and industrial partners in order to support feasibility and demonstration studies as well as improve data accessibility, tools, and expertise."
108,"today, newspace1 highlights the crucial role that space-based assets can play to meet population needs."
108,it provides new opportunities for earth observation to contribute to economic growth and jobs creation.
108,1 newspace is a dynamic for the commercialization of low earth orbit (leo) satellites.

109,accounting for the return focuses on the applications and services downstream.
109,"in order to maximize return, cnes now considers ex ante identiﬁcation of the socioeconomic beneﬁts of earth observation for public policy users and space-based service providers as a requirement for all projects engaged in the frame of the french programme d’investissement d’avenir (pia)."
109,7.2 assessing the beneﬁts of satellite earth observation for public policies: a focus on environmental and maritime policies convincing policy makers to make increased and more effective use of space-based earth observation data and products requires robust beneﬁt and cost assessments that compare earth observation solutions to existing frameworks.
109,a clear under- standing of the value chain and actors is critical.
109,quantitatively assessing the beneﬁts of space-based earth observation is challenging because different multi- discipline approaches are needed for each case.
109,"several other issues also have to be addressed in order to motivate policy makers to invest in space-based earth observation: space asset continuity, data and product accessibility, reliability, performance, and affordability are all relevant concerns."
109,facilitating access to space earth observation data is a key issue.
109,"efforts are ongoing to facilitate access to scientiﬁc data hubs, e.g., form@ter,2 aeris (collating ether and icare),3 and aviso.4 copernicus sentinel data and processing facilities are also made accessible via plateforme d’exploitation des produits sentinel (peps).5 spot world heritage data are made accessible through theia.6 convinced that space earth observation could be a promising tool for the implementation and control of public policies, the french ministry of environment (medde) and ministry of overseas territories (dgom) have intensiﬁed their relationship with cnes to facilitate the integration of satellite earth observation information and their decision-making systems."

110,"thanks to spot’s multi-scale, long-term information series and high temporal resolution, rapid mapping, and change detection information can also be provided to risk management actors (civil security and health departments)."
110,such value-added products can also be used to anticipate damages.
110,it is expected that this earth observation information can provide policy makers with major beneﬁts.
110,"anticipating copernicus data availability, medde elaborated plansat7 to identify space earth observation contributions for directorates in charge of prevention and risks (dgpr), energy and climate (dgec), infrastructures- transport and maritime (dgitm), town and country planning-lodging and nature (dgaln), fishery and aquaculture (dpma) and civil aviation (dgac)."
110,"in 2011, medde and cnes signed a master agreement to implement actions."
110,quantifying the beneﬁts of using space earth observation within a domain is a signiﬁcant undertaking.
110,"the method used by medde and cnes to assess the beneﬁts of the implementation and control of public policies was based on the concept of demonstration-comparison-feedback, with and without space earth observation assets."
110,"assessments were undertaken for various monitoring and control issues in policy areas such as soil-use, infrastructure monitoring, coastal erosion, and natural hazard management."
110,quantitative assessments of the beneﬁt of space earth observation necessitates the clariﬁcation of value chains in each domain and determination of the “value” of space-based earth observation information within each segment of the chain.
110,"input from space earth observation experts, economists, social sciences experts, and policy makers is mandatory."
110,cnes has also initiated discussions on space earth observation value in the frame of a new group that gathers social sciences experts.
110,"long-term sharing of common deﬁnitions and methods are conducted by cnes, medde, and industrial partners within le comité de concertation etat industrie sur l’espace (cospace) in cooperation with commissariat général à l’investissement (cgi)8 and direction générale des entreprises (dge).9 7 plansat is the medde master plan that identiﬁes space-based earth observation beneﬁts and needs for each directorate: http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/le-plan-d-applications. html."

111,"needs are speciﬁc, depending on the geographical situation and on the geo-political challenges of the overseas territories located in the tropics, arctic, or antarctic."
111,the direction générale des outre-mer (dgom) is in charge of coor- dinating the efforts of the different ministries involved in the implementation and control of public policies overseas.
111,the beneﬁt assessment of space earth observation was conducted within the frame of a demonstration-comparison-feedback process.
111,the relationship between dgom and cnes was initiated in response to illegal ﬁshing in french guyana.
111,cnes facilitated access to expertise at collecte localization satellites (cls) and supported a feasibility study for which satellite optical and radar sensors were combined to provide maritime security authorities with adapted products for information and decision-making.
111,"in 2013, convinced that satellite earth observa- tion was a promising tool, dgom and cnes decided to cooperate on a long-term basis and a master agreement was signed."
111,sargassum algae surveillance is one of the concrete actions for which a beneﬁt assessment is ongoing.
111,"medde, dgom, and the ministry of health collaborated to establish an appropriate response to the health, environmental, and economic problems caused by the decomposition of algae around the beaches of martinique and guadeloupe."
111,"in the frame of their master agreement, dgom asked cnes to evaluate the possibility and cost of implementing a space-based sargassum algae surveillance system."
111,a feasibility study was initiated with the objective of evalu- ating the ability of satellite earth observation to detect sargassum algae and to evaluate the suitability of sentinel tasking for an operational service.
111,the cls facilities vigisat10 and mobydrift11 were run using free satellite earth observa- tion data from landsat-8 (optical) and sentinel-1 (radar).
111,"discussions were initiated with direction de l’environnement et de l’aménagement du littoral (deal) martinique and guadeloupe to understand the operational constraints and infor- mation needs, in order to provide them with adapted information products."
111,"thanks to this study, the dynamic of the sargassum algae drift along martinique and guadeloupe was characterized."

112,"the health impacts of so2 vapor coming from sargassum algae decomposition is difﬁcult to estimate, but will increase global damage and economic losses."
112,these are key elements for assessing the beneﬁts of using space-based earth observation information in early warning information systems for sargassum algae.
112,"7.3 assessing the downstream economy of space-based earth observation: challenges, methods and first results growing demand for satellite earth observation from policy makers contributes to the justiﬁcation for the development of next-generation earth observation satellites."
112,growing demand for value-added products will contribute to the development of downstream service providers.
112,"policy makers and administrations will be able to procure adapted products and services, initiating a virtuous economic loop."
112,a healthy space-based earth observation service provider ecosystem can be considered an indicator of the beneﬁts of public investment in space.
112,its contri- bution to the global economy and employment is to be evaluated.
112,"with increasing awareness of the potential economic beneﬁts of space-based earth observation and the downstream service provider industry, governments have been investing in business development programs, for example, the uk catapult and french boosters initiatives."
112,"however, assessing the impact of these investments is a challenge, as no common methodology has been identiﬁed by the space sector or economists."
112,"for this reason, cnes motivated dge to join discussions in the frame of the oecd space forum."
112,"cnes has also initiated several actions to assess the french space-based earth observation sector, evaluating ﬁnancial value, and the impact of government investment toward downstream services."
112,7.3.1 towards a methodology for assessing the economy of the downstream space-based earth observation sector the economy of the upstream space industry is surveyed regularly.
112,"market reports are available addressing the launcher, satellite, and ground segments, but such reports do not exist for the downstream space-based earth observation sector."
113,lafaye determining any impact requires a clear view of the domain to be evaluated.
113,"so, the ﬁrst question is what to count as part of the space earth observation downstream sector."
113,this introduces some further questions: 1.
113,what is the perimeter of the downstream space earth observation sector?
113,"the delineation between upstream and downstream is not clear, nor accepted by the traditional actors."
113,"moreover, new players coming from the ict sector do not present themselves as space earth observation service providers but just as service providers."
113,what is the service taxonomy to be used?
113,there is no common classiﬁcation for space-based earth observation services.
113,"reading through catalogs of space-based earth observation service promoters and/or providers shows that taxonomies of service vary depending on the community addressed (scientiﬁc, agencies, industry, etc.)."
113,"for a given service, how should the importance of the space earth observation data contribution be evaluated alongside other sources of information?"
113,service offerings are increasingly a combination of many sources of information.
113,insider knowledge is often required to appreciate the exact contribution.
113,"is the service operational or not, and is it delivered on a commercial basis?"
113,how should public organizations be considered when they could have com- mercial activities?
113,"discussions are ongoing in the frame of the oecd space forum, which con- tributes to common deﬁnitions."
113,"segmentation into three space segments was pro- posed, setting up perimeters related to space activities, products, and services (fig."
113,"as a member of the oecd space forum, cnes has supported several studies in order to assess the impact of public investment on the development of the down- stream space-based earth observation sector."
113,"this work has been conducted in the frame of cospace, in coordination with groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales (gifas) and dge."
113,the ﬁrst issue was to establish awareness of the french downstream space-based earth observation sector.
113,"a mapping of french organizations with activities that are either linked with, or directly using, space earth observation was established (magellium 2014)."
113,"following analysis, a segmentation of actors was proposed and french space-based earth observation service providers were identiﬁed."
113,"secondly, an estimate of the ﬁnancial value for this sector in france was established."
113,this approach promotes raised awareness of the ﬁnancial soundness of the sector and establishes a useful reference.
113,revisiting these studies regularly will make the assessment of the impact of public investment in the downstream space-based earth observation sector possible.

116,promoters of space-based earth observation have to answer questions about service and cost beneﬁts for users.
116,pertinent answers can only be given after an iterative cross-sensitization process that raises the awareness of both sides.
116,"long-term cooperation in the frame of master agreements has proven its efﬁciency, providing both partners with a framework they can refer to in order to align actions, evaluate progress, and coordinate efforts."

119,chinese decision-makers have realized the important role that earth observations have in effective and efﬁcient management of earth resources and reduction of disaster losses.
119,"in fact, earth observation technologies have a special role in promoting sustainable economic and social development in all countries."
119,"before the year 2000, the major civil earth observation satellite projects in china were limited to meteorological missions and the china–brazil earth resources satellite (cbers)."
119,investments were limited and developments were slow.
119,"in 2007, china (represented by 13 of its ministries) released a 10-year plan for the china integrated earth observation system at the group on earth observations (geo) ministerial summit in cape town, south africa."
119,"the document outlined, for the ﬁrst time, a prototype system of the chinese earth observation program."
119,"at almost the same time, the national medium- and long-term plan for science and technology development (2006–2020) proposed 11 key science and technology areas and 68 priority themes to be addressed in the next 15 years."
119,"of these, 25 themes in eight key areas are directly related to earth observations."
119,"in addition, the 11th national five-year development plan initiated 16 national key research projects, of which three are related to earth observation science and technology."
119,these developments highlight that earth observation technologies are now recog- nized as major public goods that are urgently required in multiple areas.

126,"onoda japan’s focus on creating a uniform measure from space was driven by the kyoto protocol adopted in december 1997 at cop3, almost 20 years before the paris agreement."
126,the greenhouse gases observing satellite (gosat) became the world’s ﬁrst satellite designed exclusively to observe ghg.
126,it has been oper- ational since launch in 2009.
126,"the mission is jointly promoted by the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa), the japanese ministry of the environment (moe), and the japanese national institute for environmental studies (nies)."
126,"the administrative, technical, and scientiﬁc bodies working together on this mission have been a unique and highly effective scheme for achieving its goals."
126,the primary objectives of gosat are to estimate emission and absorption of ghgs on a subcontinental scale and to assist environmental administration in evaluating the carbon balance of the land ecosystem and in making assessments of regional emission and absorption.
126,"gosat measures the concentrations of co2 and ch4, the two major ghgs."
126,"the technical mission targets are to (1) observe columnar co2 and ch4 concen- trations at 100–1000 km spatial intervals, with 1% relative accuracy for co2 and 2% for ch4, during the kyoto protocol’s ﬁrst commitment period (2008–2012) and (2) reduce subcontinental scale co2 annual flux estimation errors by half (kasuya et al."
126,2009).
126,"gosat complements the approximately 320 existing ground and airborne co2 observation points with 56,000 further points around the globe, signiﬁcantly enhancing the observation network capability and providing consistent global data over a long period."
126,"9.2 data products and recent results gosat carries the thermal and near-infrared sensor for carbon observation (tanso), which is composed of two subunits: the fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and the cloud and aerosol imager (cai)."
126,the data from fts and cai are processed and used together to calculate column abundances of co2 and ch4 and to estimate sources and sinks as well as the three-dimensional distributions of co2 and ch4 concentrations using a global atmospheric tracer transport model.
126,"gosat observational data are processed at the gosat data handling facility (dhf) of nies and the data products are distributed to general users through the gosat data product distribution website (gosat user interface gateway, guig)."
126,the gosat dhf collects the speciﬁc point observation requests from qualiﬁed researchers and the observation requests of nies and transfers them to jaxa.
126,jaxa coordinates all observation requests to prepare the satellite operation plan.
126,the fts and cai data are received and processed into level 1b (l1b) data at jaxa tsukuba space center.
126,these data are then transferred to the gosat dhf.
126,"the gosat dhf also collects the reference data (e.g., meteorological information) necessary for higher level processing."
126,"using the reference data, the fts observa- tions are processed into column abundances (level 2, l2), spatially interpolated"
127,"9 greenhouse gas observation from space 113 monthly global distributions of column abundance (level 3, l3), sources and sinks (level 4a, l4a), and three-dimensional distributions of co2 and ch4 (level 4b, l4b)."
127,reference data used for validating the products are also stored in the dhf.
127,gosat products are distributed through the guig.
127,l1b data contain radiance spectra converted from raw data acquired by the satellite.
127,the higher level products from l2–l4 store retrieved physical quantities such as the atmospheric columnar concentrations of co2 and ch4.
127,"users will be able to search and order these products using the guig (https://data.gosat.nies.go.jp/) by the end of 2016 or using the gosat data archive service (gdas, http://data2.gosat.nies.go.jp/) after january 2017."
127,"to improve data quality, we updated the algorithm used for the estimation of xco2 and xch4 [column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (the ratio of the total amount of targeted gas molecules to the total amount of dry air molecules contained in a vertical column from the ground surface to the top of the atmosphere) for co2 and ch4] and validated the retrieved values by comparing them to high-precision ground-based measurements."
127,"using these l2 values, higher level data products such as monthly estimates of co2 and ch4 regional fluxes were obtained."
127,"based on these flux estimates, concentrations of co2 and ch4 in three-dimensional space were simulated."
127,these data have been made available to the public as gosat l4a (flux estimates) and l4b (three-dimensional concentration distributions).
127,"gosat data collected and archived for more than 6 years, can be used to map the seasonal variations and annual trends of xco2 and xch4 on regional and global scales."

128,"the results, announced on september 1, 2016, demonstrated for the ﬁrst time the possibility of using satellite observations to monitor and verify the emissions reported by countries, even at relatively small scales."

129,"developed jointly by jaxa, moe, and nies, gosat-2 is a continuation of the gosat mission with upgraded obser- vation capabilities to meet the increased information demands of, for example, the paris agreement."
129,"gosat-2/tanso-fts-2 will also have full pointing capability, allowing cloud avoidance and targeted observations of large emission sources."
129,gosat-2 will be able to observe carbon monoxide as a new observation target and aerosol pollutants such as pm2.5 or black carbon in the atmosphere.
129,"japan has submitted to the ipcc a proposal for guidelines on the use of satellite data for verifying or validating carbon inventories, which may contribute to worldwide efforts to monitor the state of the global carbon cycle and the effect on the earth’s atmosphere and to help countries achieve their obligations."
129,"while satellite data cannot be expected to immediately replace existing methods, the possibility of applying satellite data to national inventories, or in the report and review process, is becoming more realistic."
129,"as the sink and source distribution of co2 can be evaluated by the inhomo- geneity of atmospheric concentration using diagnostic models, for accurate evalu- ation it is essential to enhance the current observation network, especially in areas where observations are sparse."
129,"filling the existing spatial observation gaps would improve the quality of information and understanding of the long-term and general status of climate change, thus reducing the uncertainty of the scientiﬁc basis of treaties."
129,"over the long term, satellite observations might contribute to evaluating the sink and source distribution of co2 at a precision satisfactory to verify treaty effec- tiveness over long timeframes."

132,"this progress is linked to various policy mechanisms, both in terms of program development and the utility of remote sensing results and applications."
132,this article discusses some important aspects of current issues related to earth observation policies.
132,"10.2 development of national satellite earth observation programs jaxa has operated 20 earth observation satellites in total, four of which (gosat, gcom-w, gpm, and alos-2) remain operational in 2016."

133,"10.1 national earth observation work plan identiﬁed seven new governmental priorities: positioning, remote sensing, communication/broadcasting, space science, human space activity, space solar power, and space transportation."
133,the spc also determined the national earth observation work plan (cao 2016) shown in fig.
133,"geostationary meteoro- logical satellites (the himawari series), greenhouse gas observation satellites (the gosat series), and advanced optical and sar imaging satellites for earth surface monitoring have been approved."
133,"there is, however, currently a serious gap in capability after 2022 for other remote sensing categories, though it should be noted that the scp will begin investigating a plan for a gcom-w follow-on mission from the 2016 ﬁscal year."
133,"in contrast, other countries have been very active in planning new earth observation missions."
133,"there are now more than 150 satellites planned to contribute to global climate change and environmental initiatives, such as the european commission (ec) copernicus program, the un global framework for climate services (gfcs), and others."
133,"in this situation, it is important to have a strategic vision and satellite build program for the 2020–2040 period."
133,"a new trend for this period will be a close collaboration between space agencies and weather/climate agencies, illustrated by the collaboration between esa and the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites (eumetsat) in the copernicus program, and the collaboration between nasa and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) in the joint polar satellite system (jpss) program."
133,china and korea are also very actively planning capabilities for this period.
134,10 japanese satellite earth observation: status and policy issues 121 it is therefore a matter of urgency for japan to reinforce its national earth observation satellite planning to support the growing challenge of understanding and contributing to solutions for global climate change and other related environ- mental problems.
134,there has been no high-level national platform in the cabinet ofﬁce for professionals to discuss and manage such huge requirements and to chart the path for the development of capabilities.
134,a subcommittee for earth observation under the spc should be established.
134,another important activity for enhancing national earth observation planning in japan is to strengthen the bottom-up planning by academic organizations.
134,"from 2014, the science council of japan (scj) established the earth observation sub-committee under the earth and planetary science committee."
134,"in 2013, the remote sensing society of japan started a task force sub-committee for dis- cussion of future space development."
134,the task force now comprises more than 20 societies/associations.
134,the scj and task force discussions and commendations indicate that national earth observation satellite missions have contributed to research and social services and that japan should continue to develop various applications for cutting-edge science and service of society.
134,it is important to also note the high citation index and h-index of scientiﬁc papers related to earth observation satellites.
134,figure 10.2 shows the ‘dream’ roadmap toward 2050 proposed by the scj (2014).
134,"it is signiﬁcant to ﬁnd that the research community identiﬁes a need for earth observations across all periods to inform scientiﬁc investigations and provide services for society, in areas such as cloud and climate systems, as well as disaster prevention, among others."
134,"related issues for making observations useful are development of various systems to enable maximum use of observation data and models for climate projections, accurate forecasting of severe weather phenomena for disaster prevention, and other applications, as raised also by the international council for science (icsu) future earth initiative."
134,"one of the future directions is to build combined applications of earth observation and earth system modeling, including human dimensions and associated high performance computer infrastructure (hpci)."
134,"there are many requirements for sustained earth system observations from space, necessitating strong international coordination through groups such as the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos), geo, and the world meteorological organization (wmo)."
134,"at the same time, space agencies must strive to reduce costs, extend mission lifetimes, and seek effective collaboration with the business sector."
134,"such efforts can help humanity achieve affordability of sustained and critical observations of the earth from space, for both research and societal applications."

136,10 japanese satellite earth observation: status and policy issues 123 10.3 development of earth observation products and applications mitigation of and adaptation to the changing climate and environmental problems will continue to be a priority application of national earth observation programs.
136,"the ec’s copernicus program, which aims to secure operational earth observation satellite data for climate and other services, is a good example."
136,another feature is the emergence of open and free earth observation data policies that promote climate services and businesses for social applications.
136,japanese efforts to actively use earth observation data to address societal problems are not strong.
136,"in response, jaxa has enhanced the multi-satellite research activities of the earth observation research center (eorc) in important areas such as disaster prevention, ocean monitoring, water cycle/resource man- agement, atmospheric monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, climate system/radiative process studies, ecosystems, agriculture, and public health (fig."

137,nakajima monitoring sea surface temperature (sst) and sea ice coverage using amsr-2 (gcom-w imaging radiometer) is useful for weather forecasting and climate projections.
137,"the global satellite mapping of precipitation (gsmap) initiative produces a high-precision, high-resolution global precipitation map using data from multiple satellites, including microwave imagers and the core radar instrument of the global precipitation measurement (gpm) mission."
137,"satellite monitoring systems have proven especially useful during serious natural disasters, such as the flooding of the kinu river, increased volcanic activity in the hakone mountains, and the kumamoto earthquake."
137,"as a result, japanese society is increasingly interested in satellite monitoring."
137,it is important to recognize that improved communication and data dissemination networks have ampliﬁed this interest.
137,"long-term time series of emissions of various short-lived atmospheric compo- nents can be obtained by integrating atmospheric chemistry transport models with such space technologies as ozone monitoring instruments (omi), microwave limb sounders (mls), tropospheric emission spectrometers (tes), and measurements of pollution in the troposphere (mopitt) (miyazaki et al."
137,2015).
137,column loadings of long-lived greenhouse gases (llghgs) have also been observed by gosat and oco-2.
137,this has increased our ability to accurately monitor global llghg emissions from human activities and to take collective action for their reduction through unfccc mechanisms such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (redd+) for car- bon monitoring and attribution.
137,"a recent study (turner et al. 2015), for example, showed that the u.s."
137,environmental protection agency (epa) inventory of methane was underestimated in the north american continent.
137,shortening the cycle of data assimilation and inversion will change the strategy for controlling the enforcement of llghg emissions and air pollutants subject to control by the unfccc and the climate and clean air coalition (ccac).
137,such accelerated construction of the emission inventory can yield new strategies for building co-beneﬁts for climate and public health by combining monitoring data and atmospheric chemistry modeling.
137,observations using the l-band sar instruments palsar and palsar-2 have enabled jaxa to undertake accurate global-scale forest monitoring.
137,"one example, 1200 km2 of observations over brazil from 2009 and 2014 (by alos and alos-2, respectively) revealed a total deforestation area of 25 km2 for the region of interest."
137,alos-2 has also observed the crustal movement of the hakone area caused by volcanic activity and landslides from the earthquakes in nepal and kumamoto.
137,data have been provided to local governments and authorities (in support of dis- aster response actions) through national channels and the international charter on space and major disasters.
137,recent progress in sar technology has even made it possible to monitor sub- sidence of reclaimed land.
137,time series interferometry quantitatively visualizes deformation that reveals subsidence area over monitored structures.
137,the results
138,10 japanese satellite earth observation: status and policy issues 125 show good agreement between interferometry and ground measurement data within 11.5 mm root mean square error.
138,such a capability can lead to new infrastructure management and city planning services.
138,"this feature is especially important for japan, as authorities work to investigate and replace old infrastructure developed in the high growth period of the 1960s and 1970s."
138,"10.4 conclusions there is a global trend of expanding earth observation satellite program planning for the 2020–2040 period, but japanese plans for this period are not well estab- lished."
138,the space work plan in the category of other remote sensing is not yet determined beyond 2022 as shown in fig.
138,"this category includes important satellites from which useful data are obtained for cloud microphysics, earth radi- ation budget, vertical stratiﬁcation of atmospheric constituents, and others to improve earth system and environmental models."
138,it is therefore necessary to enhance japan’s national earth observation program planning process to prepare and contribute to solutions for changing global climate and environmental prob- lems.
138,"at the same time, japan should further connect satellite earth observation with advanced modeling and societal services in order to attain maximum use of earth observation systems."
138,"through this connection, comprehensive satellite data analyses will become more feasible and useful, not only for short-term weather forecasting and long-term global warming projection, but also for medium-term forecasting such as for seasonal weather change and agriculture."

149,"in the twenty-ﬁrst century, societies are confronted with a multitude of challenges in their efforts to manage the earth system."
149,these global challenges range from multi-hazard disasters and new infectious diseases to basic food and energy security on a warming planet.
149,"dealing with such a confluence of possible global-scale failures involves highly complex planning, coordination, and international cooperation (walker et al. 2009); this will only progress effectively and efﬁciently if private and public policies are based on reliable information and sound science."
149,particularly distressing in this context are the continued deﬁciencies in basic global observations and information-processing infrastructure to monitor and document many of the important ongoing global changes with sufﬁcient accuracy.
149,information paucity remains an obstacle to understanding major earth system processes.
149,"in this decision-making context, collective efforts to manage the earth system are in danger of being erratic and the result of competing interests rather than based on decisions informed by robust scientiﬁc analysis."
149,"while international conventions on the environment and security are today the main drivers of global earth observations, the resulting space and in situ observing instruments are far from optimally structured, deployed, or used when considered in light of the value of the decisions that are at stake."

150,obersteiner et al.
150,currently the most pertinent example of high-impact decision-making informed by science that would greatly beneﬁt from an enhanced observing system is con- nected to the ongoing controversy around the interpretation of the mandate of the un framework convention on climate change (unfccc) for stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
150,"although the global climate observing system (gcos) is already considered to be advanced in its implementation, the beneﬁt of reducing uncertainty in climate predictions by even better informed models through an improved gcos justiﬁes further invest- ment."
150,"the incremental annually recurring cost of implementing the gcos is estimated to be in the range of 600–700 million usd, which can be compared to the average annual incremental climate mitigation cost for the next 20 years in the energy system, amounting to some 300 billion usd per annum (rao 2009)."
150,"at the two un earth summits, it was realized that complex earth processes can be adequately measured to support environmental decision-making only by linking and coordinating current observing systems."
150,"since then, a number of earth observation summits have been held, resulting in the establishment of the inter- governmental geo at the third occasion."
150,geo provides the platform for coordi- nating observation strategies and investment in support of decision-making in nine sbas (see sect.
150,4.1.2.1).
150,"prioritization of coordinating actions and investments to build a joint geoss necessitates an integrated assessment of the prospective economic, social, and environmental beneﬁts."
150,we have therefore developed methodologies and analytical tools—following a beneﬁt chain concept (geobene 2016)—and applied them to assess the societal beneﬁts of investments in improving the geoss across the nine sbas.
150,"the basic idea is that the costs incurred by an incremental improvement in the observing system—including data collection, interpretation, and information sharing—will result in beneﬁts through information cost reduction or better informed decisions."
150,the resulting incremental societal beneﬁt is judged against the incremental cost of production.
150,"since in many cases there are large uncertainties in the estimation of costs and particularly the beneﬁts, it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms."
150,"therefore, order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost–beneﬁt rela- tionships can help guide investment decisions."
150,there are generally two source categories for cost reductions in information delivery from building the geoss.
150,the ﬁrst relates to cost reduction from economies of scale of a global or large observing system vis-à-vis the currently prevailing patchwork system of national or regional observing systems.
150,"for example, the costs of national forest carbon assessments aimed at policies of avoided deforestation typically amount to 100–500 usd per km2, yielding carbon stock estimation uncertainties of between 10–20%."
150,a similar precision achieved by one consistent global forest observatory could be realized at much lower costs of some 10–100 usd per km2 (böttcher et al.
150,2009).
150,"the second source of cost reduction from geoss relates to economies of scope, which emerge when observing systems are combined."
150,the geo-wiki project
151,12 the value of global earth observations 139 (fritz et al. 2009) combines human sensors (a global network of volunteers) with satellite images to improve global land information.
151,"substantially improved assess- ment of land resources are of particular importance, for example, for the currently hotly debated estimation of indirect land use effects of biofuel policies (searchinger et al."
151,2009).
151,"we estimated that the opportunity cost of avoiding deforestation, thereby minimizing indirect land use effects, to differ on the order of 50% depending on which estimates of cropland availability are used, as taken from different state-of-the-art yet insufﬁciently accurate land cover maps (fritz et al."
151,2009).
151,"economies of scale and scope are not only about leveraging cost reduction, but also accrue from increased beneﬁt generation from integrating observing systems."
151,"quantifying beneﬁts, often of a “public good” nature, proves a signiﬁcant chal- lenge."
151,"in a local case study in the little karoo of south africa, we investigated the beneﬁts of improved land cover information, of the type to be expected from geoss, for local-scale ecosystem service monitoring for the parameters presented in fig."
151,"using precolonial ecosystem service levels as a reference point, the assessment demonstrated substantial differences in current ecosystem service levels when measured using local-scale ground-truthed data associated with geoss systems versus national-scale non-ground-truthed data."
151,"the former ﬁnds substantial declines in ecosystem service levels of between 18–44% of precolonial levels, concurring with other local studies that highlight the extreme decline in ecosystem services in the little karoo region, while the latter paints a much rosier—but forage production pre colonial levels of ecosystem services 100 current levels using geoss data current levels using non- 75 geoss data 50 erosion control carbon storage 25 0 tourism viewsheds water flow fig."
151,"12.1 measuring changes in ecosystem services from precolonial times until the present day using geoss (local scale, ground-truthed) and non-geoss (national scale, non-ground-truthed) scenarios of data availability."
151,the current levels are reflected as a percentage of the precolonial levels for each ecosystem service.
151,higher levels of ecosystem service degradation are identiﬁed in the geoss scenario revealing more degradation from precolonial levels (100%).
151,improved information on the actual degree of degradation (geoss levels) improves decisions and generates beneﬁts such as avoided losses from floods.

152,obersteiner et al. incorrect—picture of almost intact systems providing ecosystem services at near precolonial levels (10–15% declines).
152,"applying the beneﬁt chain concept, we compare the costs of geoss-type data of some 12,000 usd to the incremental beneﬁts of more accurate information on current ecosystem service condition."
152,"however, due to the limited development of procedures for quantifying the eco- nomic beneﬁts of improved environmental information, the case study currently relies on proxies such as the costs of wrong decisions (including restoration costs of approximately 1100 usd per hectare) and flood costs (which in 2006 totaled 40 million usd damage in this region)."
152,the geoss also improves the degree of accuracy with which information is provided.
152,"although many studies assume more information is valuable, in reality this is not always the case."
152,a study on prevention of potentially harmful algae blooms in the north sea indicated that an early warning system with a considerable probability of a false warning (type-ii error of some 20%) has no value (bouma et al.
152,2009).
152,managing the interlinked challenges of global change will require an increasing flow of information about developments in the global environment and the world’s societies that interact with it.
152,"international agreements, as well as national man- agement strategies, will be on weak footing unless relevant data streams are established with the foresight to support decision-making and the science that underpins it."
152,"with national contributions to geoss—a global public information good—now increasingly under pressure due to overall budget constraints and investments in observation infrastructure not keeping pace with the foreseeable demand for information, demonstrations of the potential beneﬁts to global societies as well as of the impacts of failed international cooperation are a matter of increasing urgency."
152,this is because implementation of global earth observation assets and earth system models require signiﬁcant time from the development of technology and methods to their operational deployment.
152,"our assessment found that in the majority of case studies, the societal beneﬁts of improved and globally coordinated earth observation systems were orders of magnitude higher than the investment costs."
152,a strong coordinating institution is required to ensure that an integrated architecture takes full advantage of the increased beneﬁts and cost reductions achieved by international cooperation.
152,"furthermore, boundary organizations interfacing between the science community and users such as businesses, and governmental and nongovernmental organiza- tions have to be an integral part of an enhanced observation strategy in support of global change management."
152,continuous and comprehensive monitoring of the earth carries the potential for major advancements in global change science.
152,"not only will science generate more robust knowledge through data assimilation into increasingly integrated earth system models, new scientiﬁc ﬁelds will also arise."

155,"while sustainable management, planting, and rehabilitation of forests can conserve or increase forest carbon stocks, deforestation, degradation, and poor forest management result in reductions."
155,"according to estimates from the global forest resources assessments (fra) of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations (fao) (fao 2016), global forest biomass stocks decreased at an estimated average rate of 2.5% per year during the period 1991–2015, with about 2% resulting from deforestation and 0.5% from forest degradation (federici et al."
155,2015).
155,the large contribution of greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation—in particular from non-annex-i (developing) countries—is recog- nized in international climate negotiations.

156,rosenqvist • enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
156,"countries participating in redd+ (on a voluntary basis) are required to report their national estimates of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from signiﬁcant redd+ activities to the unfccc on a biennial basis, following an agreed transparency framework for measurement, reporting, and veriﬁcation (mrv) (united nations climate change secretariat 2014)."
156,"they are requested to utilize intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) guid- ance and guidelines and to establish national forest monitoring systems (nfms) to estimate anthropogenic emissions and removals, using a combination of remote sensing and ground-based data."
156,"the potential of remote sensing technology to support unfccc was ﬁrst assessed more than a decade and a half ago (rosenqvist et al. 2003), recognizing the signiﬁcant potential of satellite-based techniques to monitor the state and changes of forest and land cover over extensive areas."
156,"operational uptake of the technology has been slower than anticipated, with relatively few developing countries using satellite data as a tool for national forest monitoring in the ﬁrst decade following the assessment (the most prominent exception being brazil)."
156,the inertia of major space agencies and satellite data operators in recognizing and responding to the opportunity was probably at least part of the reason for the slow progress.
156,restricted/commercial data policies in particular have long been a key obstacle to widespread operational uptake of the technology.
156,"the us decision in 2008 to release all landsat satellite data for unrestricted use was a major game-changer for earth observation, prompting other countries to realize the advantages of free and open data access."
156,many developing countries are now actively engaged (through redd+) and are making use of ever-increasing remotely sensed datasets thanks to global systematic acquisition strategies and free and open access to a number of key earth observation satellites.
156,such data assist in deﬁning the extent of human activity causing emis- sions and removals from forest lands including historical impacts in the develop- ment of forest reference [emission] levels (frels/frls).1 13.2 gfoi goals and objectives the global forest observations initiative (gfoi) has been established to facilitate the supply and use of earth observation data to countries as part of developing national forest monitoring systems for the purposes of redd+.
156,"through collabo- rative action, the initiative seeks to foster forest monitoring and assessment that is 1 benchmarks are expressed in tonnes co2 equivalent per year for assessing each country’s per- formance in implementing redd+ activities."
157,"13 earth observation support to the un framework … 145 robust, reliable, and achievable at reasonable cost and supports planning for national development priorities including climate change mitigation and adaptation."
157,gfoi was founded under the intergovernmental group on earth observations (geo).
157,"first initiated as a demonstration activity—the forest carbon tracking (fct) task—in 2008, the ﬁrst gfoi implementation plan was approved by the geo plenary in 2011, followed by long-term governance arrangements established in 2013."
157,"the gfoi is led by a lead team consisting of fao, ceos, australia,2 norway3 and the u.s.,4 with support from other governments and institutions."
157,"it beneﬁts from advisory committees with representatives from the unfccc, the ipcc ghg inventory program, the world bank forest carbon partnership facility (fcpf), global observation for forest cover and land dynamics (gofc-gold), and various other institutions and experts."
157,gfoi sets out to facilitate widespread implementation of redd+.
157,"it aims to support countries that are developing and implementing nfms and associated emissions mrv systems to take full advantage of earth observation technology, by encouraging the use and assuring sustained availability of satellite observations required for forest monitoring; engaging space agencies and satellite data providers; developing methods and protocols on the combined utilization of remotely sensed and ground data for transparent assessment and reporting; developing capacity building programs to provide sustained assistance and guidance; and promoting directed research and development on high priority topics where further develop- ment is needed (e.g. forest degradation, above-ground biomass, satellite data synergy)."
157,reporting greenhouse gas emissions and removals to the unfccc is the responsibility of the countries that voluntarily opt to participate in redd+.
157,"gfoi aims to support countries developing their national forest monitoring systems, not to conduct monitoring on their behalf."
157,countries are engaged on equal terms and hold full ownership over their nfms and associated capacities.

158,rosenqvist 13.3 achievements and challenges 13.3.1 data coordination the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos) coordinates civil space-borne observations of the earth and leads the gfoi data coordination component.
158,a dedicated space data coordination group for gfoi (sdcg) was established by ceos and charged with developing and coordinating the satellite data acquisition strategies required in support of countries participating in redd+.
158,a key strength of sdcg is the broad support and active participation it enjoys from the national space agencies and data providers that are operating the key satellite missions of relevance for redd+ (table 13.1).
158,restricted data policies and inconsistent data archives have long been major obstacles to operational utilization of satellite data over national scales (reiche et al.
158,2016; rosenqvist et al.
158,2003).
158,"in order to avoid creating a dependency on com- mercial satellite data for reporting, sdcg primarily focuses, as a matter of prin- ciple, on the coordination of freely available, sharable, and accessible global data."
158,"data from the us landsat series is currently most commonly used by countries, with data from the european sentinel satellite constellation—also publicly open— expected to grow in importance as the satellites (ﬁrst unit launched in 2014) and ground segment become fully operational."
158,"as an indication of the signiﬁcance of these open data policy missions, sdcg is jointly chaired by usgs and esa."

159,13 earth observation support to the un framework … 147 agencies with semi-commercial or public–private partnership (ppp) missions also contribute to gfoi by making data available to the gfoi r&d program (see sect.
159,13.3.4).
159,"as all aspects of national forest monitoring cannot be fully addressed solely with landsat and sentinel-type data, including priority redd+ topics still in the research realm, the additional information provided by the very-high resolution and long-wavelength radar sensors operated by these agencies can often be part of the solution."
159,sdcg is not primarily about data provision per se.
159,one of its main functions is to support ceos with strategic solutions to better meet the requirements of redd+ reporting.
159,redd+ countries commonly face different challenges compared to other users that ceos agencies traditionally aim to support.
159,"these challenges include poor internet connectivity, limited data processing capacity, and incomplete data archives, made more challenging by the possible requirement to handle large vol- umes of data covering national territories at a high temporal frequency."
159,sdcg actively promotes the implementation of systematic satellite data acquisition strategies to ceos agencies to assure that all forested regions on the earth are covered with sufﬁcient temporal frequency and with as many different sensor types as possible.
159,"to address internet infrastructure issues and reduce data complexity, sdcg is, in collaboration with fao and a number of pilot countries, developing cloud-based processing and analysis solutions and storage of preprocessed ready-to-use satellite data (also referred to as analysis-ready data, ard) in seamless “data cubes”."
159,"it is hoped that novel concepts such as these will contribute to reducing the current obstacles to the uptake and application of satellite data in redd+ countries and increase their ownership of the process, and they can also be expected to provide innovative solutions on how space agencies can handle the increasing amount of satellite data more efﬁciently in the future."
159,13.3.2 methods & guidance documentation the gfoi methods & guidance documentation (mgd)5 provides methodological advice on the joint use of remotely sensed and ground-based data to estimate and report greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with forests in a manner consistent with the greenhouse gas inventory guidance from the ipcc.
159,"this is required by decisions of the unfccc for voluntary implementation of redd+ activities.6 5 available in english, french and spanish at http://www.gfoi.org/methods-guidance/."
159,6 the redd+ activities as listed in the cancun agreements (unfccc decision 1/cp.16 para 70) are: (a) reducing emissions from deforestation; (b) reducing emissions from forest degradation; (c) conservation of forest carbon stocks; (d) sustainable management of forests; (e) enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
160,148 a.
160,"rosenqvist the document is written by a team of internationally renowned experts and stakeholders specializing in forest information systems and the observations underpinning those systems, as well as experts in the assessment of forest carbon emissions and removals."
160,the mgd is complementary to the ipcc good practice guidance (gpg) and the gofc-gold redd sourcebook (gofc-gold 2015).
160,"the second edition of the mgd, entitled integrating remote sensing and ground-based observations for estimation of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in forests: methods and guidance (mgd) from the global forest observations initiative, was released in 2016."
160,the mgd is available for free from the gfoi website.
160,"the mgd has been well received by both participating redd+ countries and key stakeholders and has contributed to: • building a bridge between the decisions of the unfccc and operational decisions made by countries opting to estimate ghg emissions and removals from redd+ activities; • systematically describing how ipcc emissions inventory methods can be used to make redd+ estimates, activity by activity, using a combination of remotely sensed and ground-based data; • deﬁning a foundation for consistent methodological advice, training, technical support, and communication provided to countries through gfoi engagement; • providing a link to freely available satellite data sets (via the gfoi space data coordination component); and, • communicating redd+ country methodological requirements and data needs to the research and development community."
160,"a key to success for the mgd has been the close linkage (facilitated by gfoi) to the relevant policy, implementation, funding, methodology, and research orga- nizations involved in the redd+ process (e.g."
160,"unfccc, ipcc, world bank, silvacarbon, nicfi, un-redd, and gofc-gold)."
160,interactions between these key redd+ support agencies combined with government partners working bilat- erally on redd+ initiatives have enabled the mgd to respond to redd+ coun- tries’ methods and guidance needs.
160,"additionally, feedback from users on the utility of the mgd (received through fao and silvacarbon capacity building workshops) has led to a number of innovations designed to address the challenges of effectively communicating technical guidance in a dynamic and rapidly emerging sector to a multilingual global audience with speciﬁc national needs."
160,these innovations include: • publication of rapid response guidance modules that expand on guidance pre- sented in mgd in topical areas such as forest reference emission levels and the use of global data sets; and
161,"13 earth observation support to the un framework … 149 • release of reddcompass, a web application providing access to the mgd in an interactive online framework (gfoi 2016)."
161,"reddcompass enables users to progressively work through the key themes, concepts, and actions of redd+ nfms for mrv, gaining access to a suite of gfoi methods and guidance, space data resources, training materials, and tools along the way."
161,"the mgd builds on the foundation of the ﬁrst edition and enhances and extends guidance on institutional arrangements, the use of global data sets, forest reference emission levels, safeguards, integration methods, extended systematic statistical advice on emission and removal factors and activity data, and reporting and veri- ﬁcation requirements and processes."
161,all methods and guidance materials and supporting references and tools are available through redd compass.
161,13.3.3 capacity building the gfoi capacity building component provides the interface between gfoi and the redd+ countries that are its target users.
161,the us silvacarbon program manages the capacity building component of gfoi in collaboration with fao/un-redd.
161,silvacarbon implements capacity building efforts at both national and regional levels.
161,"at national levels, it works with countries to develop country-speciﬁc work plans ranging from technical assistance to intensive technical training sessions, workshops, and study tours."
161,they are provided by experts from the u.s.
161,"silvacarbon institutions, and often in collaboration with other gfoi organizations and afﬁliated partners from industry and academia."
161,"the regional work plans are developed to reach out to a larger number of countries that share some common attributes or interests (e.g. in central america, the andean amazon region, central africa and south/southeast asia)."
161,they typically include activities such as hands-on or showcase workshops on a range of topics related to monitoring and managing forest and terrestrial carbon in the regions.
161,"fao, through un-redd, supports national redd+ readiness efforts in partner countries through direct support to the design and implementation of un-redd national programs, as well as through complementary support to national redd+ actions through common approaches, analyses, methodologies, tools, data, and best practices."
161,both silvacarbon and fao have an active presence in partner countries and are well positioned to serve as links between countries and the other compo- nents of gfoi as they relate to capacity building needs.
161,both use and promote the gfoi mgd in training events and in turn provide comments and feedback from country representatives to the mgd team.
161,"there is also close cooperation with the data coordination component, to report user needs to ceos space agencies and data providers, as well as to prepare and provide satellite data for training and nfms development."
162,150 a.
162,rosenqvist long-term engagement is a prerequisite to building and maintaining technical capacity in a region.
162,"workshops are never one-time events, but undertaken on a regular basis over several years and on a range of specialized topics."
162,"in the americas region for example, silvacarbon events often engage the same core group of participants from the relevant organizations in the countries, which gradually build up sustained capacity on different aspects of the redd+ process."
162,"importantly, the events also stimulate personal and institutional networking between participants and organizations in the region."
162,regional collaboration and support is of mutual beneﬁt for all parties.
162,there are naturally huge challenges in building up capacity in a large number of countries in a relatively short period of time and with ﬁnite stafﬁng and ﬁnancial resources.
162,sustained in-country engagement is in most cases not feasible.
162,"the level of basic technical infrastructure and competence—including familiarity with earth observation techniques—can also vary greatly between countries and regions, posing an additional difﬁculty to regional capacity building efforts."
162,"language is still a complication, despite publication of the mgd in three languages."
162,"while work- shops in the americas region are commonly undertaken partly or fully in spanish, most training events in africa and asia are undertaken in english."
162,"from an organizational point of view, both silvacarbon and fao/un-redd are independent undertakings, with objectives, timelines, and budgets formally separate from gfoi."
162,"coordination between silvacarbon, fao, and the different gfoi components facilitates the success of the gfoi capacity building component in helping increase the use and awareness of earth observation techniques for the redd+ process."
162,"in 2016, gofc-gold (with the support of the forest carbon partnership facility) started coordinating training workshops with silvacarbon and the fao."
162,such joint efforts improves the cost-efﬁciency of the activities.
162,"13.3.4 research and development coordination the gfoi r&d coordination (rdc) component is led by the gofc-gold land cover ofﬁce, with support from esa."
162,"the rdc component covers focused r&d actions addressing immediate needs for nfms, rather than more long-term, basic research activities in the forest monitoring domain."
162,the primary objective of the rdc component is to support the mgd component by advancing select topics of priority for redd+ implementation to reach a technical readiness level sufﬁcient for inclusion in the mgd.
162,the rdc component also supports the development of training materials.
162,"key research needs have been prioritized in a peer-reviewed report (gfoi 2013), addressing priority r&d topics such as methods for mapping forest degradation and particular forest types (e.g. mangrove, peat forests, wood- lands), vegetation biomass estimation, and satellite sensor synergy."
163,"13 earth observation support to the un framework … 151 to capitalize on the signiﬁcant forestry-related research that is already underway worldwide, the rdc component is engaged in two main activities: the organization of dedicated expert workshops and the management of an r&d program for gfoi."
163,the expert workshops are typically focused on one or two selected priority topics and seek to identify the main obstacles to their widespread/operational implementation.
163,"in case the challenges are related to satellite data (e.g. lack of adequate time series, cost of data, or sensor shortcomings), comments and rec- ommendations are channeled back to ceos and sdcg."
163,"for challenges of a methodological nature, the workshops provide opportunities to pool capacity and brainstorm alternative solutions."
163,sdcg coordinates access to a wide range of public and commercial test data for high value research areas to support experts in the development of new solutions.
163,the rdc is set up to engage external research groups and help focus their activities towards the gfoi priority r&d topics and dedicated country needs.
163,"it is supported by the sdcg space agencies, which provide dedicated satellite data— also from commercial and ppp missions—to progress priority research and development of related novel earth observation techniques."
163,the main challenge to gfoi r&d is ﬁnancial.
163,"gfoi funds are limited to management and coordination only, with no budget allocation to support r&d per se."
163,"this leads to reliance on external r&d efforts, which may only partly overlap with the goals and timelines of the gfoi."
163,"nevertheless, recent research calls (e.g."
163,innovators from esa) have been based on the recommendations from the rdc component.
163,one can anticipate more research calls will be based on the gfoi activities in the future.
163,the rdc setup with expert workshops and a “data-for-research” r&d program is a solution that nonetheless has proven valuable.
163,"13.4 conclusions the gfoi constitutes an example of how earth observation data can be used to support multilateral environmental agreements (mea), such as the unfccc, or the new sustainable development goals (sdgs)."
163,"while it is too early to assess the full impact of gfoi on redd+ implementation, the initiative is certainly in a good position with active participation by developing countries and multilateral organi- zations, including those providing funding."
163,"with the backing and active engage- ment of ceos space agencies, key organizations and stakeholders engaged in redd+, national governments, and technical and scientiﬁc experts on remote sensing and forestry, circumstances can hardly get better."
163,the stars are aligned.
163,it is now or never to prove the worth of earth observation.

167,"johnson et al. reference levels (frels) (unfccc 2013b), which are required for countries to receive results-based payments for redd+ activities (unfccc 2010)."
167,"a frel is a projected level of greenhouse gas emissions (or removals, which are considered negative emissions), given in tons per year for a speciﬁc timeframe in the future."
167,"it is calculated based on historical emissions from one or more of the redd+ activities of (a–e) above, with adjustments based on national circumstances permitted when justiﬁed."
167,the frel serves as a baseline to measure a country’s performance in mitigating climate change in the forest sector.
167,"speciﬁc method- ologies for calculating historical emissions and generating frels are not stipulated in unfccc decisions, which provides flexibility by allowing for differences in national circumstances/capacities and for frels to be improved over time as national capacities and data quality/quantity increase (unfccc 2011)."
167,"however, at cop15, parties agreed that the historical emissions must be calculated using a combination of remote sensing (rs) and ground-based forest carbon inventory (gbfci) approaches (unfccc 2009)."
167,"the earth observation data are typically processed using rs image-processing techniques (e.g., supervised classiﬁcation and change detection algorithms) to map forest changes over time, while the resultant emissions from these changes are estimated using the gbfci data (intergovernmental panel on climate change 2006)."
167,"after calculating the historical emissions, future emissions are then projected as the ﬁnal step of generating the frel."
167,"various modeling approaches exist for projecting future emissions and some common approaches include: the use of the historical average emissions rate (i.e., assuming no change in future emissions), temporal regression modeling using historical emissions data (with or without other nonspatial data that reflect the drivers of historical emissions), and spatiotemporal modeling using historical emissions data (with or without other nonspatial data) as well as spatial data that reflect the drivers of historical emissions (e.g., slope maps, locations of roads, etc.)"
167,(busch et al.
167,2009; huettner et al.
167,2009).
167,"apart from its use for generating national/sub-national frels, earth observation data are also being used for redd+ implementation at the individual site or project level, and many redd+ projects are ongoing or already completed in voluntary carbon trading markets."
167,"the development of redd+ projects for these voluntary carbon trading markets was spurred by a decision from the 13th cop in 2007, which encouraged redd+ demonstration activities and invited developed coun- tries to mobilize resources to support these efforts (unfccc 2007)."
167,"to assure the quality of redd+ projects, various certiﬁcation schemes have been established, with the veriﬁed carbon standard (vcs) being one of the largest certiﬁers of projects selling credits into the forest carbon markets (hamrick and goldstein 2015; mcdermott et al."
167,2012).
167,"in contrast to the frels, for vcs-certiﬁed redd+ projects there are detailed methodological requirements on how the future emis- sions levels (hereafter referred to as “baselines” to differentiate them from frels) can be projected."
167,"for example, vcs methodologies for generating baselines of emissions from unplanned future deforestation and/or forest degradation (dd) require that the future rate of dd in the project area be estimated based on the"
168,"14 quantitative assessment of the earth observation … 157 historic rates of dd in an area where the agents and drivers of deforestation as well as the soil type/slope/elevation are similar to those found in the project area (e.g., in a larger “reference area”) (veriﬁed carbon standard 2013), so earth observation data of the “reference area” are needed to generate the baseline."
168,"from this discussion, it is clear that earth observation data are essential for developing frels and baselines at the national/subnational and project levels, respectively."
168,"thus, the earth observation derived historical emissions estimates and the projections of future emissions must be accurate to ensure the contributions of redd+ activities to climate change mitigation are correctly quantiﬁed."
168,"the earth observation data quality (e.g., spatial resolution of the data) has a direct impact on the accuracy of the historical forest maps used to estimate emissions (hilker et al. 2009), while the accuracy of some modeling approaches for projecting future emissions (e.g., regression models) will also be affected by the earth observation data quantity (number of historical forest maps produced)."
168,"for these reasons, it is necessary to assess the quality and quantity of earth observation data being used, as well as how the data are being used, to really understand the contribution of earth observation to the implementation of redd+."
168,14.1.2 objectives this study had two main objectives.
168,the ﬁrst was to better understand the quality and quantity of earth observation data being used for redd+ at the national/subnational and project levels.
168,"new sources of earth observation data are becoming available every year, so it should be possible to increase the quality and quantity of the data used for redd+ frels/baselines over time."
168,"to evaluate the quality and quantity of the earth observation data currently being used at the country and project levels, we computed four metrics related to the spatial and temporal resolution and scale of the data."
168,"a previous study (johnson et al. 2016) performed a similar analysis based on the earth observation data used by the six countries that submitted their proposed frels by the end of 2015, but in this chapter we expand the scope of analysis to include nine additional countries (those that submitted their proposed frels in 2016) as well as 15 redd+ projects."
168,the second objective was to understand whether or not the earth observation data quality and quantity were determining the types of redd+ activities and modeling approaches used to generate frels/baselines.
168,"for this, we computed two additional metrics related to methods used for frel/baseline generation: the number of redd+ activities assessed by earth observation data for frel/baseline generation and the level of complexity of the model used to project future emis- sions."
168,"the types of activities that earth observation data can be used to accurately estimate historical emissions for, as well as the level of complexity of the model used to project future emissions, are both affected by the earth observation data"
169,158 b.a.
169,"johnson et al. quality and quantity, so we hypothesized that countries/projects using higher quality and quantity earth observation data should be assessing historical emissions from more redd+ activities and also using more complex models to project future emissions."
169,"if this is not the case, some factors other than the earth observation data quality and quantity may be the primary determinants of the redd+ activities assessed and/or the models selected to project future emissions."
169,"14.2 methods 14.2.1 data as of april 2016, 15 countries have submitted reports for technical review to the unfccc secretariat containing the details of their proposed frels.1 the reports contain detailed information on the earth observation data that countries used to estimate historical emissions as well as the approaches they used to project future emissions from the historical data."
169,this information was used to calculate the six metrics in this study.
169,"at the project level, similar information was obtained for a sample of 15 vcs-veriﬁed redd+ projects (veriﬁed carbon standard 2016a)."
169,"tables 14.1 and 14.2 list the countries that have submitted their proposed frels to the unfccc as of april 2016, as well as the locations of the 15 sample vcs-veriﬁed redd+ projects."

172,"finally, for countries/projects that used multiple earth observation data sources (e.g., because ﬁner spatial resolution data became available in more recent years), the value reported for eq."
172,14.4 was that of the coarsest resolution data set because this data set limits the ﬁnest-scale changes that can be detected over the entire historical assessment period.
172,"after calculating these metrics, median values were computed to show the typical quality and quantity of earth observation data being used at the national/subnational and project levels."
172,"in addition to the four earth observation data quality/quantity metrics, two additional metrics were calculated to assess how the earth observation derived historical emissions were used for frel/baseline generation: #activities number of redd þ activities assessed by earth observation ð14:5þ data for frel=baseline generation model complexity level of complexity of the model used to project future ð14:6þ emissions some countries/projects assessed historical emissions for multiple redd+ activities using earth observation data, but did not include all of them in their frel/baseline due to an unacceptable level of estimation uncertainty, so the value reported for eq."

172,"14.6, we assigned ordinal values to the different modeling approaches for projecting future emissions (described in sect."
172,4.4.1) based on the quantity of earth observation data they can incorporate to project future emissions.
172,the historical average modeling approach was assigned a value of “1” because it can be calculated using only 2 years of earth observation derived data: a map from the starting year and another from the ending year of the historical assessment period.
172,"the temporal regression modeling approach was assigned a value of “2” because increasing the timeframe and #maps can increase the model’s prediction accuracy (e.g., r2 value)."
172,"finally, the spatiotemporal modeling approach was assigned a value of “3” because increasing the timeframe and #maps and incorporating ancillary spatial data sets (which may also be derived from earth observation data) can increase the model’s prediction accuracy."
172,"other approaches for projecting future emissions have not been used thus far for frel/baseline generation, although some frels/baselines were slightly modiﬁed to account for anticipated changes in deforestation drivers (e.g., by including a multiplier to increase the projected future emissions)."

173,14.2.3 comparison of metric values at national/subnational and project levels as discussed in sect.
173,"4.4.1, there are typically more speciﬁc guidelines that must be followed at the project level compared to at the national/subnational level."
173,"to assess whether this resulted in signiﬁcant differences in the values of any metrics, we compared the metric values at the two different levels using the nonparametric wilcoxon rank sum test (p < 0.05) (wilcoxon 1945)."
173,this test was selected because the metric values were not parametric (values at the project level are determined at least in part by the methodological guidelines that vary depending on a project’s location).
173,chile was excluded from this comparison because its data quantity was not uniform (varied by region).
173,"14.2.4 relationship between earth observation data quality/quantity and methods used for frel/baseline generation to evaluate the relationship between earth observation data quantity (timeframe and #maps) and the #activities and model_complexity, we performed ordered logistic regression modeling at both the national/subnational level and the project level."
173,"the earth observation data quality (spatial_res) was excluded from this regression modeling because it was uniform for all countries and projects, as dis- cussed later in sect."
173,4.4.3.1.
173,"the full regression model for each dependent variable is: #activities  timeframe þ #maps ð14:7þ and, model complexity  timeframe þ #maps ð14:8þ in regards to model_complexity, at the national/subnational level a simple logistic regression model was used because the dependent variable had only two values (1 or 2)."
173,"to explain #activities and model_complexity at the national/subnational and project levels, respectively, we selected the best among four different regression models: a null model (no explanatory variables), a model using only timeframe, a model using only #maps, and a full model using both timeframe and #maps."
173,model selection was done based on the akaike information criterion (aic) (akaike 1974; crawley 2005).
173,aic is a measure of the relative goodness of ﬁt of a statistical model and allows for comparisons among nested models.
173,it is calculated
174,"14 quantitative assessment of the earth observation … 163 considering the tradeoff between the bias and variance in model construction, and given by: aic ¼ 2k  2 lnðlþ ð14:9þ where k is number of model parameters and ln (l) is the log-likelihood for the statistical model."
174,the model with the lowest aic value has the highest quality among the models compared.
174,"for more information on aic, readers are referred to a recent review article by aho et al."
174,(2014).
174,"as the number of samples was relatively low at both analysis levels in our study, we tested the signiﬁcance of the potential logistic regression models using the parametric bootstrap approach."
174,"bootstrapping entails randomly drawing (with replacement) from the samples to construct a “bootstrapped” set with the same size as the original sample size (some of the original samples may be drawn more than once or not at all in the bootstrapped set), and it is often used to calculate the bias and standard error of a model (efron and gong 1983)."
174,"in this study, the #activities or model_complexity of each nation/subnation or project were drawn from for the bootstrapping and we calculated the differences between the log-likelihood of the bootstrapped logistic regression model and that of the null model."
174,we performed the bootstrapping 1000 times and compared the log-likelihood difference for the bootstrapped data set with that of the original data set in each iteration.
174,the logistic regression model results were considered to be signiﬁcant if the log-likelihood difference for the bootstrapped data was smaller than that of original data set in more than 95% of the iterations.
174,all of the statistical analyzes in this section and in sect.
174,4.4.2.3 were conducted using r 3.2.5.

174,"at the national/subnational level: • %mapped ranged from 22%–100% with a median value of 100%; • timeframe ranged from 8–22 years with a median value of 13 years; • #maps ranged from 2–15 with a median of 3.5; • spatial_res was 30 m for all countries (all used landsat data, although some countries also used higher resolution imagery);"

175,"at the project level, one of the four methodologies listed below (veriﬁed carbon standard 2016b) were used in all of the 15 projects: vm0006 methodology for carbon accounting for mosaic and landscape-scale redd projects vm0007 redd+ methodology framework (redd-mf) vm0009 methodology for avoided ecosystem conversion vm0015 methodology for avoided unplanned deforestation as can be seen in fig."
175,"14.1, there were some clear differences in the earth observation data quality/quantity between projects using different methodologies."
175,"as one example, the vm0015 projects all used three maps, while the vm0009 projects used between six and eight maps."
175,"however, for the projects in general: • %mapped was always 100%; • timeframe ranged from 9–26 years with a median of 13 years; • #maps ranged from 2–15 with a median of 3; • spatial_res was always 30 m; • #activities ranged from 1–2 with a median of 1; and • model_complexity ranged from 1–3 with a median value of 2."
175,"regarding the test of correlation between timeframe and #maps, we found that the two metrics were not signiﬁcantly correlated at either the national/subnational or project levels (p < 0.05, spearman’s rank correlation test; scatterplot shown in fig."

176,there were no dif- ferences in earth observation data quality (all used 30 m resolution data).
176,"in terms of earth observation data quantity, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the timeframe or #maps (p < 0.05, wilcoxon rank sum test)."
176,"in terms of how the data were used, there was no signiﬁcant difference in #activities (p < 0.05, wilcoxon rank sum test), while model_complexity at the project level was signiﬁcantly higher than that at national/subnational level (p < 0.05, wilcoxon rank sum test)."
176,"14.3.3 relationship between earth observation data quality/quantity and methods used for frel/baseline generation results of the regression analyses indicated that #activities and model_complexity were not well explained by the earth observation data quantity (table 14.3), as the aic values were lowest for the null models in all cases."
176,"due to the high uniformity of model_complexity at the national/subnational level (all countries except peru had the same value, as shown in table 14.1), regression analysis could not be done at this level for this variable."
176,"for the other cases, the full model was worst at explaining both #activities and model_complexity at the project level, but was second best at explaining #activities at the national/subnational level."
177,166 b.a.
177,"johnson et al. parametric bootstrap tests also showed that the models that included the earth observation data quantity variables (full models, and models with either timeframe or #maps) did not explain signiﬁcantly better than the null models (p < 0.05)."
177,14.4 discussion and conclusions the results provide an overview of the earth observation data quality/quantity being used for redd+ at the national/subnational and project levels.
177,"most coun- tries and projects have covered 100% of the county/project area using earth observation data, used a historical assessment period of at least 13 years, produced at least three maps over the assessment period, and used 30 m spatial resolution data."
177,"synthetic aperture radar (sar) data are often suggested as a complementary data source to optical data for forest monitoring and redd+ (reiche et al. 2016) (but have not been used thus far for redd+), and free approx. 30 m resolution sar data sets have become available in recent years (e.g., 25 m resolution alos palsar-1/-2 mosaic data from 2007), so if the median values calculated are considered as minimum requirements then palsar-1/-2 mosaic data could be used as a complementary data source starting from the year 2021."
177,"the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos) provides a searchable online database with details of the past, current, and future earth observation satellite missions of its member agencies, which could further aid these types of searches (committee on earth observation satellites 2016)."
177,"it should be noted that aside from the metrics calculated, other metrics could be computed to obtain even more information on earth observation data quality/quantity."
177,"comparing the data/methods used at the national/subnational and project levels, it was found that quality and quantity of the earth observation data used at the two levels did not differ signiﬁcantly despite the fact that projects covered smaller areas (and thus are likely to be easier to acquire and process earth observation data for)."
177,"the methodological guidelines at the project level may have somewhat constrained these differences (e.g., methodology vm0015 states that the historical assessment period should be no more than 10–15 years, so even if earth observation data for a longer period are available and easy to acquire, they cannot be used)."
177,the number of redd+ activities assessed using earth observation data at the two levels was also not signiﬁcantly different.
177,"however, the level of model complexity was sig- niﬁcantly higher at the project level than at the national/subnational level, and this was likely due to the stricter methodological requirements at the project level and possibly the greater ease of acquiring/managing/processing ancillary spatial and nonspatial data at the project level (due to the smaller scale)."
177,"in terms of the relationship between earth observation data quality/quantity and the methods used to generate frels/baselines, we found that neither the data quality (all countries/projects used 30 m data) nor the data quantity were strong determi- nants of the number of redd+ activities considered for frels/baselines nor the level of complexity of the models used to project future emissions."
177,although a larger
178,"14 quantitative assessment of the earth observation … 167 sample size would of course give higher conﬁdence to the analysis (there is a chance that the null model was selected by aic because of the limited sample size), the results of this study generally suggest that countries/projects are selecting which redd+ activities to consider and which modeling approaches to use based on factors unrelated to earth observation data quality/quantity."
178,"in regards to the number of activities considered, it is likely that countries/projects are focusing their efforts for now on the redd+ activity (or the few activities) responsible for the highest level of greenhouse gas emissions, which is typically deforestation, even if enough data are available for assessing other activities."
178,"in regard to the modeling approach selected for projecting future emissions, while there are strict requirements on the models that can be used at the project level, there is great flexibility at the national/subnational level, so it is possible that countries have other motivations besides model prediction accuracy for their selection of a particular modeling approach."
178,"for example, a country may opt for a model that predicts higher levels of future emissions to make it less likely that their actual future emissions exceed these predicted levels."
178,"for countries with decreasing rates of emissions in more recent years (e.g., brazil, indonesia, and many others), the simplest modeling approach—use of the historical average emission rate—will predict higher future emissions than the more complex modeling approaches that take into account the downward trend in emissions, so these countries may be reluctant to use the more complex modeling approaches."
178,"in contrast, for countries with increasing rates of emissions in more recent years (e.g., peru), the more complex modeling approaches that take into account the upward trend in emissions will project higher future emissions, so these countries may be more willing to select a more complex modeling approach."
178,"if the goal is that, as earth observation data quality/quantity increase over time, the methods used to project future emissions for redd+ also improve, there may be a need for more speciﬁc guidance to be given on how countries facing different national circumstances should project their future emissions."

182,jolly 15.2 what do we want to evaluate?
182,"space systems provide an interesting paradox: they are often considered and funded as research and development programs, but act in many cases as key infrastructures delivering unique public and private services, particularly earth observation sys- tems."
182,"when measuring socioeconomic impacts, basic deﬁnitions of what to mea- sure vary."
182,15.2.1 space programs the ﬁrst full-scale space programs date from the late 1940s to early 1950s.
182,"from the start, they consisted of r&d projects to develop technologies and know-how to send objects into space and utilize this new dimension for science and security purposes."
182,"today, institutional space programs worldwide still cover a wide range of technologies (i.e., launchers, satellites, space stations, ground segment) and disci- plines (e.g., telecommunications, earth observation, navigation, and astronomy), sometimes with “accompanying” programs to involve new users (e.g., commer- cialization of technologies outside the space sector)."
182,"space programs are usually undertaken nationally via dedicated agencies, but also often within a bilateral or multilateral international cooperation framework, particularly in the european context."
182,"since 1980s, a number of private actors have conducted their own space programs directly, for proﬁt (e.g., telecommunications satellite operators, com- mercial launch providers), but always within a regulatory framework put in place by governments (oecd 2005)."
182,15.2.2 space applications “applications” are the resulting outcomes of many space programs.
182,"sometimes they are actively sought, to develop speciﬁc space products and services (e.g., satellite television); on occasion such results are accidental."
182,the data derived and/or signal issued from a large number of programs initiated for purely scientiﬁc pur- poses can be deemed relevant by large communities of users.
182,"today the value chains for space applications vary, depending on the commercial or scientiﬁc beneﬁts of the data or signal provided."
182,that is where the distinction between pure r&d programs (set up for a limited period) and applications (often to be set up on an enduring operational basis) becomes blurry at times.
182,it has been historically
183,15 evaluation of space programs: select findings … 173 difﬁcult to shift programs from the science and technology environment to the ﬁnancially sustainable operational environment.
183,"15.2.3 space infrastructure the term “space infrastructure” encompasses all systems, whether public or private, that can be used to deliver space-based services."
183,these include both the space and ground segments.
183,"as identiﬁed in oecd (2005), there are two complementary and interlinked space-based infrastructures."
183,"the ﬁrst one focuses on the “front ofﬁce”, i.e., the one that is “user-oriented” and designed to provide information-related services including communications, navigation signals, and earth observation data to governments and society at large."
183,"the second concerns the essential enabling “back ofﬁce”, i.e., the space transport, satellite manufacturing and servicing infrastructure."
183,15.3 tracing beneﬁts to satellites there are different ways to try and trace socioeconomic beneﬁts from satellites’ unique capabilities.
183,"one can focus on those capabilities (links, signals or data) or base the analysis at the programmatic or infrastructure level."
183,there are already many efforts underway to try and assess the economic impacts of science and r&d programs.
183,"as identiﬁed by the oecd space forum, some of the methodologies used are still evolving."
183,applying existing techniques to space programs provides some interesting lessons learned.
183,two examples are provided below.
183,"the macroeconomic approach is often used in the case of large r&d programs or infrastructure to provide cost–beneﬁt information, via economic input–output analyses."
183,the main objective is to measure the growth of productivity in a region or country generated by the investment.
183,input–output analysis speciﬁcally shows how industries are linked together through supplying inputs for the output of an econ- omy.
183,"factors that can be used to construct indicators of productivity include employment, expenditures, income, production of goods and services, and com- petitiveness."
183,such factors are of interest at both the national and regional levels.
183,"results of these analyses are derived from macroeconomic data such as changes in gdp, which can then be compared to changes in capital."
183,the challenge when interpreting the material is to ﬁnd the causal linkages between the program/infrastructure investments and the rise in productivity.
183,"however, the ﬁndings of these studies are sometimes contentious."
183,they are also highly dependent on the choice and evaluation of appropriate variables over long

184,"as an example, the u.s."
184,"federal aviation administration’s (faa) ofﬁce of commercial space transportation published a report in 2006 on the impacts of commercial space transportation and related industries in other economic sectors, speciﬁcally in terms of revenues and jobs that are generated."
184,the economic impact analysis used an input/output method and the regional input-output modeling system (rims ii) developed by the u.s.
184,"department of commerce, bureau of economic analysis."
184,"the space sector, as deﬁned in the study by the faa, was found to be responsible—via direct, indirect, and induced impacts—for usd 98 billion in economic activity in 2004 and 551,350 derived jobs throughout the u.s."
184,"all major u.s. industry sectors were affected positively to some extent (e.g., the information services sector, manufacturing, ﬁnance and insurance, healthcare and social assistance)."
184,"as a comparison, using the same methodology the economic impact of the civil aviation industry was found to be over ten times that of com- mercial space transportation and enabled industries."
184,"methodology-wise, input– output analyses are valuable methods to measure economic impacts."
184,"on the other hand, one inevitable drawback of this type of analysis stems from the lack of precise space sector statistics, since the statistical codes used for the study by deﬁnition cover more than just space activities (oecd 2016)."
184,"at the other end of the analytical spectrum, microeconomic analysis studies the behavior of individual organizations, ﬁrms, and customers and their interactions, usually determined by market demand and supply."
184,"the use of supply and demand curves is, however, not always directly applicable to space systems and their derived applications because of immature products (new technologies) and non- quantiﬁable demand."
184,"a real technical limitation of microeconomic analysis is the daunting task of assessing accurately all the markets liable to be affected by a speciﬁc space technology, and not just when it is innovative."
184,"numerous studies of “spin-offs” have been conducted in the u.s. since the 1960s (such as outputs from nasa’s apollo program), notably of the transfers from space-related hardware and know-how to other sectors (e.g., medical imagery)."
184,"the value of spin-offs is, however, not easily quantiﬁable, although they provide interesting illustrations of the diffusion of space technologies in different economic sectors."
184,"a combination of macro and micro approaches tends to provide better estimates, although it will still fail to address potentially larger noneconomic impacts."
184,the choice of a speciﬁc analytical technique for impact assessment is not random but context-speciﬁc; this is particularly true when looking at space applications.
184,"the timing and objective of the assessment, as well as the nature and scope of the public r&d funded, are factors that must also be borne in mind when selecting an ana- lytical technique from an existing toolbox."
185,15 evaluation of space programs: select findings … 175 15.4 the way forward one important lesson learned from existing evaluations of space programs is that more work is needed to provide evidence-based information to decision-makers and citizens on the beneﬁts (and limitations) of space applications.
185,"existing methods provide useful hints at actual socioeconomic beneﬁts derived from the space infrastructure, particularly for earth observation, but with diverse inherent caveats, so there is a need to reﬁne further quantiﬁable analytical tools."
185,"in that context, it remains key to maintain the effort in building the international knowledge base on impact assessments to provide know-how and valid experiences to practitioners (avoiding reinventing the wheel)."
185,the oecd space forum contributes to this activity and will continue engaging actors in the space community and beyond to explore the broad economic and social dimensions of space-based applications.

188,young 16.1 introduction how can we integrate earth observation systems and international environmental regimes to enhance the role of satellite observations in solving a variety of large-scale environmental problems?
188,"1 as the capacity of satellite earth observation to address environmental issues has grown, needs have arisen for enhanced coor- dination among major players active in this ﬁeld."
188,"we noted in chap. 1 that par- ticularly important developments in this regard include the growing capacity of satellite observations to (i) provide crucial information on progress in meeting the objectives of issue-speciﬁc governance systems (e.g., rates of sea level rise or ocean acidiﬁcation in the case of the climate change regime or rates of land degradation in the case of the regime to combat desertiﬁcation); (ii) assist efforts to prevent or mitigate environmental disasters, through measures such as ice warning systems for maritime shipping, flash-flood alerts, or growth mapping of major crops such as rice, maize and soybeans; and (iii) verify compliance with regulatory arrangements 1 international regimes are institutional arrangements created by states to address issues such as international trade, global warming, or ﬁsheries management; see chap."

189,young on the part of individual regime members or actors subject to the rules of various regimes.
189,this chapter explores in detail the question of whether these capabilities have progressed to the point where there is a compelling case to create an integrated environmental earth observation regime complex and for establishing rules and procedures to guide interactions between providers of satellite observations and users responsible for implementing a range of international environmental agree- ments.
189,"to this end, we analyze organizational matters to be considered for strengthening connections between existing institutions and explore a number of normative issues associated with the development of such arrangements."
189,we con- clude with a discussion of next steps regarding the establishment of an international environmental earth observation regime or a more coherent regime complex.
189,16.2 why focus on institutional complexes?
189,"alongside the proliferation of institutional arrangements in global governance and their rising density and scope, scholars have deepened our understanding of how separate institutional arrangements interact, overlap, complement, or interfere with each other in a variety of ways (e.g., young 1996; young 2002; oberthür and gehring 2006; oberthür and stokke 2011; orsini et al."
189,2013).
189,"frequently, gover- nance of a particular issue area is best understood as the result of the interplay of several relevant institutions, with individual institutions affecting the contents, operations, or consequences of other institutions, whether at the same or at different levels of governance."
189,"here, we explain why interplay within larger complexes of institutions is important in thinking about the role of earth observation systems in addressing large-scale environmental problems."
189,studying institutional complexes entails taking an aggregate view of institutional interplay.
189,terminology differs but considerable agreement exists regarding the conceptual core and empirical signiﬁcance of this phenomenon.
189,"among the terms in use are “clusters” (young 1996; oberthür and gehring 2006), “governance architectures” (biermann et al. 2009), “regime complexes” (raustila and victor 2004), and “institutional complexes” (oberthür and stokke 2011)."
189,the conceptual core is clear.
189,"interplay involves interactions among institutions that are distinct in terms of membership and decision making, yet deal with the same activity, or aspects of the same activity, usually in a non-hierarchical manner."
189,"this formulation is compatible with raustiala and victor’s often cited deﬁnition of a regime complex as a set of “partially overlapping and non-hierarchical institutions governing a particular issue-area” (raustila and victor 2004), but it does not preclude normative hierarchy."
189,"although international organizations and treaties are not usually verti- cally ordered, elements of formal or actual subordination nevertheless may exist (stokke and oberthür 2011)."
189,among the advantages of taking an aggregate view of institutional interplay is that it directs attention to the distinctive capacities of each institution involved and
190,16 integrating earth observation systems … 181 to the ways in which several institutions may complement one another in the overall governance of an issue area.
190,"in international environmental governance, the insti- tution best placed to generate scientiﬁc knowledge about the effects of various management programs is often different from the institution with competence to establish such programs or enforce their regulations."
190,"to illustrate, the distinctive qualities that provide the international council for the exploration of the sea (ices) with a central role in the provision of advice on north-east atlantic ﬁsheries are its membership, comprising the national marine science organizations of most littoral states, and its procedures developed over a period of nearly a century for insulating the advisory function from political pressure without ceding relevance to decision making (schwach 2000)."
190,"in contrast, actual regulation typically rests with narrower international bodies whose scope of membership is deﬁned by the rela- tionship of the stocks in question to the economic zones or high seas areas in the region (stokke 2015)."
190,"effective compliance control may require yet another insti- tution, because the membership of all major port states in the region covered by the north-east atlantic fisheries commission (neafc) equips this body particularly well for orchestrating the cross-checking of ﬁsher reports with delivery reports, port inspections, and data derived from its satellite-based vessel monitoring system, allowing for the integration of real-time tracking of all vessels flagged by member states (stokke 2014)."
190,"each of the institutions involved in this institutional complex retains its operational autonomy, yet their interaction is managed in ways that enhance their combined contributions to overall ﬁsheries governance."
190,such retention of operational autonomy without foregoing the realization of gains from coordination makes the institutional complex approach especially rel- evant for cost-intensive and strategically sensitive activities such as satellite earth observation.
190,"in the remainder of this chapter, we unpack this observation and explore its implications for the development of earth observation systems to con- tribute to solving environmental problems."
190,"16.3 the earth observation environmental regime complex satellites are placed in orbit for a variety of purposes other than earth observation, such as broadcasting or navigational guidance."
190,"among those satellites dedicated to remote sensing, a majority are equipped primarily to tackle concerns other than environmental problem solving, including national defense and weather forecasting (adriaensen et al."
190,2015).
190,"thus, environmental agencies that aspire to tailor the planning and operation of space missions and associated data management to their speciﬁc needs must compete with numerous other stakeholders, often with closer and more longstanding relationships to those producing and distributing earth observation data."
190,this section outlines the earth observation activities that are
191,182 o.s.
191,stokke and o.r.
191,young relevant to environmental problem solving and considers the complex of institu- tions that govern them.
191,"16.3.1 scope of activities in focus it is helpful to divide the chain of activities that connect mission planning and environmental problem solving into three segments: acquisition of data, manage- ment of data, and use of earth observation data for information, assistance, and compliance purposes by those responsible for implementing environmental regimes."
191,"the acquisition of satellite earth observation data involves a range of closely linked operations including requirement deﬁnition, sensor speciﬁcation and instrumentation packaging, spacecraft launch and flight operations, and data reception (bailey et al."
191,2001).
191,"due to the complexity and costs involved, a few leading space agencies, those of the usa, (then) ussr and japan as well as the european space agency (esa), traditionally handled these operations."
191,"since the late 1980s, however, numerous other nations, especially china and india, have developed state-of-the-art satellite imaging capacity (morel 2013)."
191,"according to a recent count, as many as 34 governments have participated in the planning, launching, and operation of some 200 civilian satellites with global land cover observing capacity, roughly half of which were still operational in belward and skøien (2015)."
191,"commercial earth observation programs, such as the spot satellite system initiated by the french space agency centre national d’études spatiales (cnes) in the 1970s, now supply very high resolution imagery to military as well civilian customers (morel 2013).2 in addition, private ﬁrms have entered this area of activity, as imaging devices with spatial resolution as ﬁne as 3–5 m have been placed on small and relatively low-cost satellites operated by major companies such as google or digital globe or smaller ones like planet labs or skybox (belward and skøien 2015).3 as a result, a large number of governmental and private actors now engage in the acquisition of earth observation data potentially relevant to environmental problem solving."
191,"management of satellite earth observation data is about distribution and archiving of the received data, often involving further processing to enhance its 2 here we apply the terminology proposed by belward and skøien (2015): very high resolution is less than 5 m; high resolution is 5–9 m; medium resolution is 10–39 m; moderate resolution is 40– 249 m; while low resolution means 250 m–1.5 km."
191,3 google acquired skybox imaging (from 2016 named terra bella) in 2014 as part of the com- pany’s efforts to provide real-time images; see oecd (2014).
192,16 integrating earth observation systems … 183 usefulness for particular purposes (bailey et al.
192,2001).
192,the earth observation data providers certainly engage in these activities.
192,"but so do national and international governmental organizations closer to the end users, such as the global data processing and forecasting system (gdpfs) of the world meteorological organization’s (wmo) world weather watch (www) programme (dillow 2012)."
192,"use of satellite earth observation data for environmental problem solving, as part i–iv of this book elaborate, involves a wide range of states and organizations for whom remote-sensing data complement other sources of information that prove helpful when conducting their respective tasks."
192,"to illustrate such complementarity, consider how satellite earth observation data enhance the value of other pieces of information in furthering compliance with international vessel-source pollution rules in the baltic sea."
192,"such compliance efforts beneﬁt from the membership of all coastal states in the paris mou involving regional port authorities, and in the regional-seas regime for the area centered on the helsinki commission (helcom)."
192,"member states conduct some 4000 surveillance flights every year, sometimes integrated through a coordinated extended pollution control operation (tahvonen 2010)."
192,"in 2011, this coordinated operation involved aircraft and patrol vessels from ﬁve regional states as well as satellite surveillance provided by the cleanseanet service under the eu-based european maritime safety agency (emsa)."
192,"since vessels over 300 gross tons engaged in international voyages are obliged under international maritime organization (imo) rules to be equipped with automatic identiﬁcation system (ais) transponders, backtracking of vessels located near an oil spill can, in conjunction with a regional oil-drift forecast model endorsed by the scientiﬁc branch of the regional regime, help identify one or more likely culprits for subsequent port-state inspection (tahvonen 2010)."
192,"thus, earth observation data blend in with other types of information, helping to narrow the scope of those suspected of rule violation and allowing more efﬁcient use of the port-state control mechanism (stokke 2014)."
192,"in remote-sensing terms, the user interprets the pro- cessed data conveyed in the satellite images in light of inputs from other sources, yielding “analyzed information” (smith and doldirina 2008) in support of envi- ronmental problem solving."
192,"agencies tasked with implementing the provisions of environmental regimes are newcomers among the users of satellite earth observation data, compared to users of data located in meteorological services or national security agencies."
192,among the premises of this book is the proposition that there is considerable room for improvement with respect to environmental agency awareness about recent advances in satellite earth observation technologies and the opportunities they provide for more effective detection and monitoring of environmental problems or for supporting response action or compliance mechanisms.
192,"as the next section argues, the converse is also true; the coordinating institutions set up largely by providers and managers of earth observation data do not provide sufﬁcient expo- sure to the practices and needs of environmental governance."
193,184 o.s.
193,stokke and o.r.
193,"young 16.3.2 boundaries of the earth observation environmental regime complex the many institutions that co-govern satellite earth observation activities derive partly from international space law centered on a small number of united nations (un) treaties and regional collaboration agreements adopted in the early decades of space exploration, and partly from a wide array of soft-law instruments aiming to support mutually beneﬁcial coordination."
193,"with the rising commercialization of space, the more recent of these coordination mechanisms typically take the form of partnerships, involving national space agencies and international organizations, as well as industry associations."
193,"prominent among those partnerships is the group on earth observations (geo), set up in 2005 to enhance the compatibility of existing observing and processing systems that would, importantly, continue to operate under their own mandates, hence the term global earth observation system of systems (geoss; see part iii)."
193,the subset of space law that is relevant to earth observation activities deals primarily with acquisition of data.
193,"the 1967 outer space treaty, for example, makes clear, consistent with its broader “open-skies” principle, that satellite earth observation is a legitimate activity that does not require consent from states or private actors observed; article ix adds only that states are to inform others about activities that might affect their use of space."
193,"the 1972 liability convention makes states liable for damage caused by space objects launched from their territory, including those launched by private entities."
193,"recently, the permanent court of arbitration proposed more elaborate procedures for handling liability complaints relating to space activities (weeden and chow 2012)."
193,"crucial to the implementation of these various rules for coping with unintended impacts and space congestion, increasingly challenging with the deregulation and privatization of space activities during the past two decades, is the work of the international telecommunications union (itu), a specialized un agency that collaborates with national space agencies to assign satellite orbits and radio frequencies (oecd 2014; viikari 2007)."
193,"globally applicable provisions exist also for earth observation data manage- ment, especially those set forth in the un principles relating to remote sensing of earth from outer space, adopted in 1986."
193,"although that instrument is sometimes referred to as the normative centerpiece for satellite earth observation activities (e.g., kuriyama 2005; smith and doldirina 2008), it is only a non-binding reso- lution and its contents are not precise enough to serve as meaningful legal com- mitments."
193,"nevertheless, the general thrust of the principles is clearly favorable to those who wish to align earth observation data provision and management to the needs of environmental problem solving."
193,"it starts out by deﬁning remote sensing as “sensing of the earth’s surface from space … for the purpose of improving natural resources management, land use and the protection of the environment” (principle i), adding that such activities are to be “carried out for the beneﬁt and in the interest of all countries” (principle ii)."
193,hortatory language and qualiﬁcations appear as soon as norms become speciﬁc to actual management of earth observation data.
193,states
194,"16 integrating earth observation systems … 185 are “encouraged to provide for establishment and operation of data collecting and storage stations and processing and interpretation facilities … wherever feasible” (principle vi), rendering earth observation data accessible in a non-discriminatory manner and at reasonable cost (principle xii)."
194,"the most prominent soft-law norms on earth observation data management guide states toward open-access practices but, as smith and doldorina (2008) point out, they are silent on the role of private companies that are steadily becoming more important in space affairs."
194,actual practices regarding earth observation data management have varied considerably among states and organizations depending on purpose and ﬁneness of resolution.
194,"the meteorological and the oceanographic communities opted for open and free access in the 1990s (harris and baumann 2015); this policy was also reflected in the international charter on space and major disasters, made opera- tional by the major space agencies in 2000 and now providing data and imaging access even to non-parties during a crisis situation.4 in other domains, data at medium resolution or ﬁner have traditionally come at a cost (belward and skøien 2015)."
194,"still, the current trend among public data providers is toward free-and-open access."
194,"while cost-retrieval policies made us landsat data subject to payment during the 1980s and 1990s, even by domestic public agencies, a gradual de-commercialization peaked in the 2008 decision to make all landsat data available to all at no cost (sawyer and vries 2012)."
194,"from 2009, china-brazil earth resources satellite (cbers) program data can be downloaded free of charge by all african countries (oecd 2012); more recent policies also include latin america.5 a similar movement is evident in the esa data policy, which used to differentiate between research and commercial uses, charging for the latter (harris and browning 2003), but no longer does (esa 2012)."
194,"consistent with this trend, the european commission’s copernicus data policy from 2013 provides that non-sensitive data from this program are available on a “free, full and open basis” (eu 2013).6 even commercial ventures are adapting their pricing policies: medium resolution spot satellite data more than 5 years old are now available free of charge to non-commercial users (selding 2014)."
194,"this move toward more open access to publicly acquired data has been fuelled by a combination of declining prices on satellite imaging, rising concern among legislators that they are “paying twice” for earth observation data, and growing appreciation that wide availability of such data can empower individuals, civil society, and business and stimulate the economy (sawyer and vries 2012)."
194,earth observation data are included among the high-value areas in the open data charter 4 the charter has been activated more than 500 times since 2000; details at www.disasterscharter. org (accessed 30 august 2016).

195,"young adopted by the group of eight industrialized nations (g8), with its openness-by-default principle and its complaint that states “do not always share these data in ways that are easily discoverable, useable, or understandable to the public”.7 on this cue, as the primary international private–public partnership for improving coordination along the earth observation chain of activities, geo has agreed to “promote and encourage” data management principles close to the open-access end of the continuum of existing practices."
195,"speciﬁcally, geoss partners and others should strive to make their earth observation data and metadata discoverable through catalogues and search engines; accessible via online services; usable through encodings widely accepted among user communities, quality con- trol, and comprehensive documentation of access and use conditions as well as data provenance; preserved for future use; and curated by means of correction, update, and necessary reprocessing (geo 2015a).8 limitations on the actual usability of available data for environmental problem solving, and how to overcome them, are the subject of the next section."
195,"16.4 integrating the earth observation environmental regime complex in chap. 1, we offered a taxonomy of ways in which satellite earth observations can promote national or international efforts to solve environmental problems."
195,"in conjunction with other types of data, satellite earth observations can help to inform decision-makers about the severity of environmental problems by identifying undesirable conditions, monitoring their development, and assessing the adequacy of efforts to combat the problems."
195,"satellite earth observations can also be vital for provision of assistance to those exposed to environmental risks or disasters, like search and rescue operations or early warning systems for floods and tsunamis."
195,"in addition, satellite observations play crucial roles in certain systems for verifying compliance with international environmental commitments, as illustrated in the helcom oil pollution case."
195,this section identiﬁes some important initiatives intended to strengthen each of these functions and comments on institutional adaptations that might enhance them.
195,"7 see preamble and principle 1 of the g8 open data charter, available at https://www.gov.uk/ government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ﬁle/207772/open_data_charter.pdf (accessed 2 august 2016)."
195,"the g8 refers to a group of highly industrialized countries that meet annually on important economic or other issues, comprising canada, france, germany, italy, japan, russia, the uk, and the u.s., plus the eu."
195,"8 metadata is information about the data, including its format and provenance, i.e. how it was acquired, the extent of quality control and curation, etc."
196,"16 integrating earth observation systems … 187 16.4.1 information as chap. 1 brings out, cases abound in which satellite earth observations help to identify and monitor environmental problems or assess progress toward solving them."
196,"in some of these cases, institutional mechanisms exist and allow interaction among providers and users but too often such interaction occurs at a stage when decisions regarding instrumentation and data processing capacities have already been made."
196,"especially in the climate and biodiversity areas, environmental users of satellite earth observation data have made progress in coordinating their interactions with data providers."
196,"an important example features the 50 essential climate variables (ecvs), each with its desired requirements for accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution, deﬁned by the global climate observing system (gcos) in close interaction with the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) and un framework convention on climate change (unfccc) (bojinski et al."
196,2014).
196,"these ecvs are also applicable to a range of adjacent environmental issues, such as air quality monitoring and forecasting as well as water resource management (tan 2014)."
196,"a corresponding set of essential biodiversity variables (ebvs) are being developed under the geo biodiversity observation network (bon), in response to the aichi targets for 2020 deﬁned under the un convention on biological diversity (uncbd) (pereira et al."
196,2013).
196,"the bon initiative links leading space agencies with scientiﬁc and governmental actors at national and international levels, including the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ipbes)."
196,"among its ongoing projects is to develop a “bon in a box” regionally adaptable toolkit aiming to harmonize local, national, or regional biodiversity monitoring initiatives.9 these and other initiatives aim at making satellite earth observation data relevant to a broader set of environmental moni- toring efforts than hitherto."
196,among the strengths of the essential variable approach is to provide focal points for earth observation data providers when planning missions and instrumentation payloads.
196,"in many cases, beneﬁtting fully from satellite capabilities will require recurrent interaction among users and those responsible for mission planning and subsequent data processing."
196,"such recurrent interaction will be particularly impor- tant for the ongoing efforts to develop essential variables for monitoring and assessing marine ecosystems, in part because biological and ecological character- istics interact in ways that are often complex, poorly understood and, especially relevant to our discussion, varying in importance seasonally and over time (hayes et al."
196,2015).
196,"to illustrate, high up on the list of candidate essential marine ecosystem variables is satellite-observed, color-variant chlorophyll concentration, indicative of phytoplankton density and primary production more generally."

197,"young stocks of phytoplankton and primary production must take into account time and space variant factors, such as relative abundance of species, the layering of chlorophyll in the water column, and in some interesting locations, the standing stocks of algae in and under the ice (constable et al."
197,2016).
197,"the intensity and recurrence of provider–user interaction needed to optimize the role of satellite data in an overall monitoring effort, taking into account the relative costs of alternative acquisition methods, is likely to vary considerably among environmental regimes."
197,"while the most well-known examples of satellite observations supporting assessment of progress in environmental governance are found in the ozone and climate areas (see chap. 1), some innovative providers are exploring new or more extensive applications of existing data and observing capabilities."
197,"consider the example of the global mangrove watch, developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) in partnership with, among others, the global ngo wetlands international and offered as a tool for the global wetland observing system under the ramsar convention (rosenqvist et al."
197,2014).
197,"trends in mangrove cover can be highly relevant also for assessing progress or setbacks under un conventions on climate change (unfccc), biodiversity (uncbd) and conserva- tion of migratory species of wild animals (convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals, cms) (lucas et al."
197,2014).
197,the jaxa initiative exploits the longevity of global-scale remote sensing at frequencies conducive to mangrove observation in combination with rapidly advancing data processing capacity.
197,"such conduciveness for particular environmental applications would be stronger and more effective if a broader range of actual and potential users, span- ning the functional ambits of several environmental regimes, were to be consulted at the planning stage of satellite earth observation missions."
197,"16.4.2 assistance goals pursued under some international environmental agreements fuse with broader societal-security concerns, not least those aiming to prevent and respond effectively to environmental disasters such as floods and wildﬁres."
197,"satellite-derived information can support each stage of the disaster management cycle, including prevention, warning, response, and recovery."
197,sweta and bijker (2013) point out that those engaged in the various stages of the disaster management cycle differ widely as to what they perceive as decisive quality characteristics of earth observation data and in terms of the extent of metadata needed.
197,this situation suggests that new arenas and more inclusive review procedures would help to improve the ﬁtness of the wide range of available earth observation products to the distinctive needs of diverse users.
197,"considering that the meteorological community has been prominent among the non-military users of earth observation data ever since the dawn of the satellite era (edwards 2006), it is understandable that flood management is an area with rela- tively ﬁrm institutional links along the provider–user chain, especially with respect"
198,16 integrating earth observation systems … 189 to early warning.
198,geostationary satellites hovering over ﬁxed positions allow meteorological agencies to issue forecasts of where and when thunderstorms are about to hit and where the likelihood of flash floods is particularly high (tan 2014).
198,"wmo has played an active role in integrating satellite and otherwise-obtained data for this purpose, including through its flood forecasting initiative (ffi)."
198,"this initiative, operational since 2003, builds capacity among meteorological and hydrological agencies in developing countries to compile and disseminate the rel- evant information in flood-critical situations to those responsible for civil protection and response (sene 2008)."
198,"important as it is to empower meteorological and hydrological agencies by means of satellite earth observation data, the overall flood management capacities of exposed regions are likely to beneﬁt even more if patterns of involvement are expanded further."
198,"as reflected in a series of soft-law instruments under the 1992 un economic commission for europe (unece) water convention (the envi- ronmental framework agreement with the longest record of flood-risk responsibil- ity) and in its global counterpart the 1997 un watercourses convention, modern flood protection strategies give pride of place to the water retention capacities of nature itself, including the networks of small waterways, wetlands, soils, and grasslands throughout a river basin (unece, 2009).10 this environmental dimension of flood protection means that flood management must be an integral part of general river basin management plans often developed by international envi- ronmental bodies established by riparian states."
198,"while wmo is sensitive to this need for integrated flood management, as evident in the associated programme on flood management (apfm) initiated jointly with the global water partnership (gwp),11 those responsible for such larger river basin management plans are likely to have earth observation data needs distinctive from those of meteorologists and hydrologists."
198,wildﬁre prevention and response is another area where satellite earth obser- vation data are key and where institutionalized provider–user interaction may help to tailor relevant information products to the needs of environmental managers.
198,the environmental and societal challenges posed by wildﬁres are enormous.
198,"in the world bank’s disaster management portfolio, only projects addressing floods and droughts have been more numerous (ieg 2006)."
198,"one means for linking providers and users in this ﬁeld is the fire program of the global observation for forest cover and land dynamics (gofc–gold) effort, an international partnership including the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos; a coordinating body for space agencies) as well as research communities, ngos, and subsidiary bodies of the unfccc and un convention to combat desertiﬁcation (unccd) 10 see model provisions on transboundary flood management, especially provision 4, reproduced in ece (2009, annex i)."

199,2009).
199,"while close interaction with focus groups of earth observation data users in central america, africa, and asia was important to the design of these applications, the project is provider-initiated and interaction with users have revolved around the processing and dissemination of satellite data, not data acquisition."
199,"efforts to prevent and respond to disasters such as floods and wildﬁres are increasingly integrated within larger environmental management plans, thus involving national and international environmental agencies with earth observation data needs that may exceed or differ from those deﬁned by civil protection agencies."
199,such diversity should be reflected in increasingly institutionalized provider–user interactions that aim to enhance the role of satellite data in supporting disaster management.
199,"16.4.3 compliance involvement of existing and potential environmental management users is no less important when designing new earth observation products for the third major function of satellite data in environmental problem solving, improving adherence to international commitments."
199,"as noted in chap. 1, many states have used satellite data as part of their national inventory reporting under the kyoto protocol, espe- cially with respect to emissions and removals associated with land use and land cover changes (e.g., reddy et al."
199,2015).
199,they will continue to do so for pledges under the 2015 paris agreement.
199,"in other sectors such as ﬁsheries management, satellite observations can also be crucial to veriﬁcation and review activities, those parts of a regime’s compliance system that evaluate the reliability of national or target group reports by providing independent information suitable for cross-checking."
199,satellite-based tracking of individual ﬁshing vessels as part of systems for compliance monitoring is a well-established practice in many regional ﬁsheries management regimes.
199,"so far, however, these vessel monitoring systems have required specially devised on-board transponders typically linked to flag-state enforcement agencies and have therefore been relevant only for vessels registered with a regime member."
199,"the global fishing watch initiative by google (a relative newcomer among earth observation data providers) in partnership with certain ngos interested in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (iuu) ﬁshing, seeks to overcome that limitation by using instead the ais signals that imo has mandated"

200,"1).12 in order to function as intended, however, the global fishing watch initiative needs complementary action under global and regional institutions responsible for maritime safety or resource management (mccauley 2016), action that is not necessarily forthcoming."
200,"imo mandates ais transponders only for vessels larger than 300 gross tons and engaged in international voyages, meaning that application to most ﬁshing vessels is discretionary for the flag states."
200,"unfortunately, iuu ﬁshers are frequently registered by flags-of-convenience states unlikely to prioritize compliance."
200,a 2015 submission by two environmental ngos encouraging a joint fao/imo ad hoc working group on iuu fishing to advocate stricter ais reg- ulations met with a lukewarm response (fao 2015).
200,"among the counter arguments is the expectation that use of the ais system for compliance purposes might encourage tampering or even disabling the transponders, undermining the safety-at-sea objectives that motivated the creation of the system."
200,some states and regional organizations have nevertheless mandated ais signals for large parts of their ﬁshing fleets.
200,"even if regulatory developments are slow at the global level, this satellite-supported tool may become important in combatting iuu ﬁshing."
200,"as with the information and assistance roles, designing steadily more effective earth observation products for compliance purposes frequently requires coordina- tion among data providers and users with sufﬁciently high stakes in the outcome to mobilize political energy for creating an effective institutional environment."

200,this is true even for those dealing with global or widespread issues like the depletion of stratospheric ozone or the destruction of tropical forests.
200,what we can expect in this realm is the emergence of a complex of institutions involving providers of earth observation data that have specialized in the development of capabilities involving the acquisition and management of data together with a range of potential users that require data for different purposes.
200,those users may want to develop means of integrating earth observation data with other types of data to maximize their effectiveness in solving the problems that fall within their remit.
200,"as a result, it is important to address a series of issues that center on developing productive relations between providers and users of earth observation data."

201,young matter of developing rules governing the provider–user interface to ensure that this relationship conforms to broader societal preferences.
201,"should earth observation data providers make data available free of charge, for example, or is it legitimate for them to charge for their services?"
201,"if charges are involved, should users of earth observation data be allowed to shop among providers in order to obtain the most favorable deals for their purposes?"
201,"16.5.1 an earth observation environmental data forum so long as earth observation data providers and users responsible for implementing environmental regimes operate independently, it is unlikely that the data from providers will dovetail well with user needs."
201,"left to their own devices, providers will design payloads that focus on the latest technologies and cutting-edge capa- bilities regarding the acquisition of data."
201,"for their part, users are likely to formulate their requests for data with little attention to the practical limits of what the pro- viders can supply given realistic cost constraints."
201,what is needed in this regard is a conscious effort to ﬁnd ways to bring together the providers and the users not only at the stage of distributing available data to individual users but also at the stage of planning regarding the number and types of satellites to launch and the instru- mentation packages loaded on individual satellites.
201,"in effect, there is a need for an end-to-end relationship in which providers and users engage in cooperative efforts all the way from designing missions to evaluating the results and planning for improved missions at a later stage."
201,what is the best way to engage in this sort of matchmaking?
201,"assuming that the community of providers and the community of users remain separate groups with their own goals and objectives, there are several strategies that may prove helpful in this regard."
201,"one strategy is to match speciﬁc providers (e.g., esa or jaxa) with particular users (e.g., those responsible for administering the ozone regime, the climate regime, or the biodiversity regime)."
201,this would allow for intensive engagement focused on the data needs of those seeking to solve speciﬁc environ- mental problems.
201,"another strategy is to focus on the functions we reviewed above (i.e., inform, assist, comply) and to match the capabilities of eo data providers with the sorts of data needed to handle each of these functions."
201,"while these strategies may make sense under some circumstances, they have obvious drawbacks as general approaches to matchmaking between providers and users of earth observation data."
201,"there is considerable overlap among environmental regimes in their needs for data, so it makes sense to look for synergies in responding to these needs and to encourage cross-regime communication designed to make use of earth observation data in the most efﬁcient way."
201,"similarly, many individual regimes involve needs for data covering the full range of functions we have identiﬁed."
201,"in such cases, it makes sense to look for ways to coordinate efforts to"
202,16 integrating earth observation systems … 193 provide the different types of data needed by regime administrators in an efﬁcient manner.
202,one interesting response to these concerns would be to develop an informal but nevertheless well-deﬁned and functionally broad forum in which providers and users of earth observation data relevant to solving environmental problems could interact with each other to discuss issues involving the match or ﬁt between the capabilities of providers and the needs of users.
202,such a forum would not be a substitute for the development of contractual agreements between speciﬁc providers and users covering their terms of engagement (see sect.
202,16.5.2).
202,"rather, the earth observation environmental data forum would provide a more general setting for discussion of emerging capabilities in this ﬁeld and the evolution of environmental regimes creating new uses for earth observation data."
202,geo might play a con- structive role in orchestrating the participation of providers in such a forum.
202,an earth observation environmental data forum would follow up on the call by the geo ministerial meeting in 2015 to “strengthen its focus on users and stakeholders and in particular develop new approaches to effectively engage with … multilateral environmental agreements” (geo 2015b).
202,there is no counterpart to geo on the environmental user side.
202,"however, the un environment programme (unep), the world bank, and the global environment facility (gef) are involved in the implementation and funding of many of the major international environmental regimes; unep and the world bank are also geo partners."
202,"building on the experiences from endeavors that involve individual international environmental regimes, such as the deﬁnition of ecvs, a broader earth observation environmental data forum could facilitate similar pro- cesses among wider sets of users, linking them to relevant provider expertise on advances in technological capabilities and on remaining cost constraints."
202,"the scope of participation by those responsible for operating environmental regimes could vary depending on the substantive focus of each forum meeting, which may be deﬁned in terms of issue area (e.g., forestry, ﬁsheries, biodiversity) or function, or any combination of these."
202,there is no need to formalize relations among these entities regarding the cre- ation and operation of an earth observation environmental data forum.
202,but there is an opportunity for the progressive development of social practices in this realm.
202,deeper involvement on the part of major international funding agencies such as gef and the world bank would allow such a forum to beneﬁt from the particular experience and expertise those agencies have in evaluating societal beneﬁts across environmental projects and issue areas.
202,they could also provide ﬁnancial muscle to fund speciﬁc earth observation activities tailored to their project portfolios—the world bank is a major user of earth observation data in support of its investment decisions and project implementation (royal society 2015).
202,it might well be appropriate for the gef to provide the relatively modest funding needed to support periodic meetings of an earth observation environmental data forum bringing together leading providers and users.

203,stokke and o.r.
203,young 16.5.2 terms of engagement there remains the issue of the contractual arrangements covering relations between providers and users regarding the use of speciﬁc data applied to particular envi- ronmental problems.
203,"many of those who have thought about the uses of earth observation data believe that publicly funded agencies (e.g., esa, jaxa, nasa) should be responsible for the collection of relevant data and that the data they obtain should be made available for environmental problem solving on a free-and-open basis."
203,"on the other hand, as we have noted, private companies are entering the ranks of earth observation data providers; they advertise their services as efﬁcient sources of data needed to handle a variety of functions."
203,these observations raise a number of classic issues regarding the relative merits of public and private provision of various services.
203,"without going into detail regarding these underlying issues, we can identify and comment on several concrete matters relating to the terms of engagement between earth observation data providers and users in need of par- ticular types of data to address the environmental problems they seek to solve."
203,"today, many countries (including developing countries like china and india) and a growing number of private corporations operate satellites and use them to collect various types of data on a regular basis."
203,"this suggests that users endeavoring to solve speciﬁc environmental problems may be tempted to shop around, searching for different types of data to meet their needs from a variety of providers."
203,"nonetheless, both providers and users may ﬁnd that they have signiﬁcant incentives to form clear-cut (though not necessarily exclusive) and lasting relationships cov- ering the terms of engagement between them regarding the provision and use of earth observation data."
203,"for one thing, individual users may wish to have input at the design stage, participating in decisions relating to the instrument packages loaded on speciﬁc satellites, the orbits of satellites, or arrangements involving the coordination of two or more satellites to ensure needed coverage, in return for making long-term commitments to using the services of a particular provider."
203,"if the problem is simply a matter of monitoring rates of loss of tropical forests or the magnitude of marine dead zones, it may be sufﬁcient to work with low-resolution images that are col- lected on a weekly or even monthly basis."
203,"when the problem is a matter of pro- viding early warning regarding tidal waves likely to hit exposed coasts or forecasting where and when a hurricane will make landfall, there is a need for higher temporal resolution data that can be collected and disseminated rapidly."
203,"while providers have coordinating mechanisms of their own (e.g., ceos and geo) and users tend to be grouped into distinct regimes dealing with separate issues (e.g., stratospheric ozone depletion, marine pollution, deforestation), there may be good reasons to make a concerted effort to bridge this gap when it comes to addressing speciﬁc environmental problems."
203,one way to do this is to move toward the for- mation of lasting contractual relationships organized around regime complexes encompassing all those players endeavoring to solve more or less well-deﬁned environmental problems.
204,"16 integrating earth observation systems … 195 users will often want to merge data obtained from a variety of sources, including observations from aircraft, in situ monitoring devices, and mobile sources as well as satellite earth observation data."
204,"in such cases, they will have an incentive to work with multiple providers to develop programmatic arrangements that maximize their ability to carry out monitoring, reporting, and veriﬁcation functions effectively."
204,"unlike consumers whose engagement with providers is likely to end once they have completed the purchase of a speciﬁc product, relationships between providers of data and users dealing with environmental problems will normally be complex and ongoing."
204,this suggests that both sides will ﬁnd it beneﬁcial to spell out terms of engagement in relatively explicit contractual agreements.
204,there may even be rea- sons to develop mutually agreed procedures to provide authoritative interpretations of the terms of resultant contracts when the parties disagree about their application to speciﬁc situations.
204,"when public agencies are in need of services, ranging from the construction of infrastructure to the provision of security services at public facilities, it is normal to issue requests for proposals and to establish some procedure both to evaluate the merits of the proposals received and to make decisions regarding preferred pro- posals."
204,the evaluation may include a variety of considerations relating to the track record of the providers and the quality of the services to be provided as well as the proposed budget.
204,"for various reasons, this model may not be applicable to the relationships between earth observation providers and users we are considering in this analysis."
204,"among other things, the providers themselves may be public agencies and there may be questions regarding the extent to which it is appropriate to charge for providing the relevant data."
204,"still, there is merit in thinking in contractual terms about the provision of earth observation data to address speciﬁc environmental problems, especially in cases where the options include turning to private enter- prises as sources of supply."
204,"among other things, an approach of this sort can produce well-deﬁned and stable expectations on the part of all participants, a matter of particular importance in relationships that are expected to last indeﬁnitely and to adapt successfully to changing circumstances."
204,"with regard to the speciﬁc question of payment for the provision of earth observation data, there is no simple answer."
204,the current trend in which space agencies increasingly provide earth observation data on an open-access basis is appealing not only for ideological reasons but also because environmental regimes are seldom well-endowed with funds that would be needed to purchase data.
204,"still, it would be a mistake to jump to the conclusion that free-and-open access is the preferred policy under all conditions."
204,supporting the growth of national space industries and associated technology development is a major priority for govern- ments active in this sector (oecd 2014).
204,"among esa member states, for instance, strengthening industrial competitiveness is the most frequently cited motivation for space activities (adriaensen et al."
204,2015).
204,"it is not surprising, therefore, that policies of open access to data free of charge are questioned and sometimes opposed by companies that specialize in the provision of earth observation products similar to"

205,"cnes, for example, speciﬁcally conﬁned its zero-cost policy to older and medium resolution earth observation data so as not to undercut markets exploited by its spot partner airbus defence and space (selding 2014)."
205,"the european commission has reportedly promised to adjust its copernicus data policy should it jeopardize the viability of european private satellite operators.13 moreover, users often need to order specialized data to address the problems they are seeking to solve."
205,"in some cases, private providers may be more responsive to these needs and more efﬁcient in minimizing the costs involved, as illustrated in the role of commercial actors in developing networked systems of smaller and smaller satellites (oecd 2014)."
205,"more generally, we should not exclude the pos- sibility that private providers have more compelling incentives to develop new or more cost-efﬁcient observing systems and ﬁnding ingenious ways to conﬁgure them to meet the needs of certain users."
205,none of this is meant to undermine the premise that open-access data supplied by national space agencies will prove to be the best option under a variety of conditions.
205,but it is clear that we should not simply assume that this option con- stitutes the preferred strategy in all cases.
205,"in efforts to come to terms with the provider–user interface on a case-by-case basis, the issue of ﬁnancial arrangements must be tackled head on with the objective of arriving at mutually satisfactory arrangements."
205,16.6 impacts on earth observation sustainability placing environmental institutions more centrally in the larger earth observation environmental regime complex promises to enhance the role of satellite data in environmental problem solving.
205,"but it also involves costs for earth observation data providers that, for long-term sustainability, must somehow be balanced by substantive provider beneﬁts."
205,among the costs are not only the time and energy that providers must invest in various processes for identifying the environmental needs that match existing or future acquisition and processing capacities but also the opportunity costs of instrumentation packaging specially tailored for environmental problem solving.
205,"to illustrate this observation, we address three impacts of ﬁrmer connections among earth observation data providers and environmental agencies, revolving around economic viability, environmental sustainability, and certain normative or ethical concerns that loom steadily larger as satellite systems become more sophisticated."
205,"13 see selding (2014): “the commission may reassess the sensitivity of speciﬁc copernicus data on its own initiative or at the request of a member state”; see also eu (2013), art."
206,"16 integrating earth observation systems … 197 16.6.1 economic viability the end of the cold war made it less compelling for governments to allocate resources to space activities for security reasons, as did the rising preparedness of private actors to develop space capacities independent of taxpayer support."
206,these developments have raised questions about the stability of public funding for the major space agencies.
206,"in the case of nasa, the political support for its budget has been perceived, in the words of one observer, as “a mile wide but an inch deep” (handberg 2003; cited in cobb and wnw 2011)."
206,"obtaining the necessary long-term funding for earth observation activities is seen as particularly challenging since they do not typically provide spectacular “space events”, like landings on the moon or explorations of mars, that have fuelled popular interest in and support for space activities (morel 2013)."
206,some leading spacefaring nations have seen con- siderable variation in the public support for spending on space.
206,"surveys indicate that the share of the us public that considers government spending on space activities as excessive rose from about a third in 1988 to around half in the mid-1990s, then leveled off to around 40% (cobb and wnw 2011)."
206,"despite these worries over the economic viability of space activities, govern- mental space budgets supporting civilian uses have proven stable among the oecd countries, even during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008–2009, whereas emerging economies like china, india, and brazil have increased their space budgets con- siderably (oecd 2014)."
206,"as highlighted by gaubert (2002), governmental pre- paredness to pay for space activities derives in part from interest among space-capable states to retain or improve their competitiveness in a technology-intensive and growth-driving sector."
206,a recent review of european national space strategies indicates that only security and transportation loom larger than environment and resource management among priority areas seen as beneﬁt- ting from engagement in space activities (adriaensen et al.
206,2015).
206,"new initiatives that broaden and enhance the use of satellite data for environmental problem solving are likely to stabilize and reinforce the perception that public spending on space activities is money well spent, adding to the social capital of those engaged in the space sector."
206,"indirectly, therefore, enhanced contributions to environmental problem solving are likely to contribute to the ﬁnancial viability of space-based earth observation activities, even if the environmental regimes that stand to beneﬁt are not charged directly for these services."
206,"economic beneﬁts for providers can also be more direct, especially when intensive or recurrent provider–user interaction promises to gen- erate specially tailored earth observation products, enabling more efﬁcient or cost-effective operation of certain governance tasks, such as problem monitoring or compliance control."
206,"in such situations, international environmental bodies may be motivated to contribute ﬁnancially to realize the product, either directly through their own budgets or (perhaps more frequently) through related environmental funding agencies such as the gef or one of the many funds for climate action."

207,16.6.2 environmental sustainability a more prominent role for satellite earth observation in environmental problem solving would strengthen one strand of a broader effort to improve the environ- mental sustainability of space activities.
207,"the other strand of that effort has revolved around a series of congestion problems in outer space, notably the scarcity of orbits appropriate for geosynchronous or sun synchronous observation, the rising chal- lenge of frequency interference, and the risks space debris poses to safe spacecraft operation, including those resulting from collisions or intentional destruction of satellites (williamson 2012).14 the rising prominence of outer space sustainability is evident in the adoption of the 2007 space debris mitigation guidelines by the un committee on the peaceful uses of outer space (copuos) and in that committee’s decision to place outer space sustainability on its agenda from 2010 onwards, having tasked a working group on space sustainability with developing speciﬁc inputs suitable for best-practice guidelines concerning debris, the safety of space operations, and management of the radio-electric spectrum (brachet 2012)."
207,"like any sector that generates obvious societal beneﬁts but also threatens certain environmental qualities or exploits ﬁnite resources, those engaging in private or public space activities must demonstrate awareness of the environmental problems they generate and dynamism in efforts to mitigate them."
207,developing and exploiting positive externalities by using facilities in space to solve sustainability problems on earth ﬁts well with the sector’s growing preparedness to place negative externalities in outer space such as debris and congestion on the international political agenda.
207,"16.6.3 normative or ethical concerns even if the terms of engagement governing interactions between providers and users of earth observation environmental data are well-deﬁned and widely under- stood, there are some important normative issues that arise in this realm and that are destined to take on greater prominence as satellites become more sophisticated and, in the process, capable of providing a growing array of services of interest to those endeavoring to solve environmental problems."
207,"for the most part, these are speciﬁc 14 in 2007 china deliberately destroyed one of its own inoperative meteorological satellites using a ground-based missile, generating more than 3000 long-lived fragments; half of that number of debris fragments were produced by an accidental collision of two us-operated satellites (brachet 2012)."
208,16 integrating earth observation systems … 199 versions of issues arising in a wide range of settings as the power of information systems increases.
208,"should there be rules regarding rights to privacy on the part of those whose activities are being monitored (e.g., emitters of greenhouse gases) or whose activities play a role in causing environmental problems of public concern (e.g., users of chemical fertilizers and pesticides)?"
208,is it important to be concerned about the potential for corrupt or unethical behavior on the part of either providers or users of earth observation data?
208,are there or should there be safeguards regarding the handling of such data in the event that anti-democratic forces achieve growing influence or political turmoil ensues?
208,none of these concerns is unique to the realm of earth observation environmental data; they arise in many settings.
208,experience with the integrity of information systems in other settings can be applied to the development of an earth observation environmental regime complex.
208,but it will be important for both providers and users to be conscious of these concerns and to adapt general responses to the speciﬁc circumstances arising in conjunction with earth observation environmental data.
208,"16.7 conclusion we have approached the development of an earth observation environmental regime complex largely as a matter of building productive relationships between two distinct communities to enhance capacity to provide information, assist in preventing or mitigating disasters, and improve compliance regarding a range of environmental problems."
208,"we expect that the provider community, including private companies as well as public space agencies, and the user community, including those responsible for building and implementing a wide range of environmental regimes, will remain distinct."
208,but it will be important to devise and strengthen terms of engagement that allow the two communities to develop end-to-end relationships starting with the design of space missions and payloads and carrying through to the assessment of performance in addressing a variety of tasks and improving the design of future missions.
208,"in our judgment, there is room not only for minimizing tensions in the relationships between these communities but also to achieve a higher level of synergy that improves the performance of environmental regimes and solidiﬁes support for space agencies."
208,"making use of our general knowledge of regime interplay, we have identiﬁed the principal elements of the terms of engagement between the two communities and discussed ways to develop these terms in a manner that beneﬁts both communities going forward."
208,one practical step that may prove helpful in this context is to launch an earth observation environ- mental data forum with a mandate to foster enhanced coordination between the two communities.

213,"the case studies in parts ii-iv demonstrate how speciﬁc countries, organizations, or projects have attempted to link societal needs and global policy demands to the beneﬁts of satellite earth observations."
213,chapter 16 examines topics related to a future earth observation regime complex and a possible earth observation environmental data forum.
213,the points of departure for the book were laid out in the key ﬁndings from the policy and earth observation innovation cycle (peoic) advisory board workshop held in tokyo in november 2015 (see appendix c for the full text): 1.
213,"earth observations provide a unique window and perspective on our world, serving the betterment of all humankind by supporting policies aimed at sus- tainably managing natural and societal resources on an ever more populous, affluent, and interconnected planet earth."
213,earth observations should be regarded as critical societal infrastructure.
213,"there is strong evidence that publicly open earth observations are making positive, cost-effective contributions to solving a variety of high priority environmental and societal problems."

214,"japan, together with its international partners, should identify and ﬁll emerging gaps in next generation space missions to guarantee full realization of all societal beneﬁts of earth observations derived from long-term continuity."
214,"there is a changing paradigm for earth observations, with nongovernmental groups launching satellites and with the growing popularity of small satellites, drones and crowd-sourcing/citizen science campaigns, which are associated with the rapid development of data technology and applications."
214,each author contribution builds on these statements and elaborates in detail lessons learned from their individual experiences.
214,"all contributions recognize the growing impact of human action on the earth system, the efforts to integrate natural and social sciences, and the usefulness of space-based earth observations that provide a unique viewpoint for understanding this interaction and supporting decision-making by providing scientiﬁc evidence."
214,a key message from the contri- butions is the need to demonstrate the value or roi of earth observations.
214,the importance of open access to data for increased societal beneﬁt is also stressed.
214,"however, authors note the challenge of quantitatively assessing the societal and economic impacts of earth observations, as well as the need to select the right analytical technique for the speciﬁc context in question."
214,"finally, the impact of new technologies is recognized as an opportunity to extract actionable knowledge, as well as a challenge to the assessment of beneﬁts, as they will combine space-based earth observations with other sources of information."
214,17.2 assessment methodologies the assessment methodologies introduced in this volume can be categorized largely into literature-based analysis and economic analysis.
214,"17.2.1 literature-based analysis the peoic project of japan (chap. 2) takes a unique approach in combining literature analysis with data mining techniques to assess how satellite earth observation data and information have been used in policy formation and imple- mentation, based on an institutional approach featuring the case of the protection of the stratospheric ozone layer."
214,"satellite earth observations are a key monitoring tool for the regime, providing decision-makers with information on the status of the environment (i.e., systematic observations of the ozone layer)."
214,the study applies a text-mining technique to investigate the relationship between policy and satellite earth observations by selecting literature that represent policy decisions and
215,17 conclusion 207 scientiﬁc reports.
215,the work is signiﬁcant and unique as there has been no such analysis performed in the past.
215,constructing comparable literature databases proved challenging.

215,"14, johnson et al. attempt an assessment of the quantity of earth observation data used for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (redd+) implementation."
215,"results show that earth observation data quality (i.e., spatial resolution) was basically uniform among users, while data quantity (i.e., the number of maps produced, the length of his- torical timeframe for which data were used) varied considerably from country to country and project to project, while neither the data quality nor quantity explained the ways in which the countries or projects utilized the data."
215,earlier work on the application of landsat data (macauley 2008) followed a similar but distinct approach.
215,"further, the group on earth observations (geo) conducted an analysis to identify earth observation priorities for different societal beneﬁt areas (sbas) and then performed a cross-sba analysis based on documents from the past 10 years (group on earth observations 2010)."
215,"as useful as these studies are in providing quantitative evidence of the beneﬁts of earth observations for addressing policy priorities, literature-based studies have limita- tions mainly due to the fact that outside the scientiﬁc domain, it is rare that a speciﬁc data source, satellite, or sensor name will be mentioned in policy literature."
215,"the challenge therefore is to identify a meaningful correlation between satellite data and policy decisions, given that satellite data are almost always combined with other data sources before they are processed into information useful to decision-makers."
215,the peoic study does succeed in showing a quantiﬁable rela- tionship between scientiﬁc assessments and policy decisions.
215,by establishing the role of satellite data within the scientiﬁc assessments it attempts to identify the role of satellite earth observation in decision-making.
215,evolving information technology will allow more progress to be made in this area.
215,"17.2.2 economic analysis economic analysis is a method applied increasingly to measure, account for, and demonstrate the beneﬁts of earth observations in many societal settings."
215,the need has been prompted in particular by growth of economic constraints in most major space programs.

216,he introduces two speciﬁc examples—air quality and vol- canic ash—for which nasa has conducted studies on the socioeconomic impacts of satellite missions and applications.
216,the study on air quality estimated that satellite data represents a value of around 26 million usd.
216,"in the case of volcanic ash, it was estimated that the use of satellite earth observation data for air trafﬁc management following the 2010 eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption in iceland saved 25–72 million usd."
216,"if data had been used from the beginning of the incident, costs estimated at an additional 132 million usd might have been avoided."
216,esa’s earth observation strategy and the european copernicus program are introduced by aschbacher (chap.
216,the copernicus program included an extensive study in its mission-planning phase based on prospective (ex ante) costs and beneﬁts.
216,"independent studies for copernicus have shown that, on average, 1 eur invested in the copernicus program leads to an economic beneﬁt of approximately 10 eur due to better decisions, more efﬁcient policy implementa- tion, and savings due to better preparedness in the case of natural disasters, com- bined with various other economic potentials such as in job creation and the use of imagery."
216,"he also notes that these beneﬁts will only be realized if access to space-based earth observation data and information is full, free, and open."
216,"lafaye, in chap. 7, introduces two examples of collaboration between the french space agency (cnes) and ministries through a master agreement with the french ministry of environment (medde) and the ministry of overseas territories (dgom)."
216,"in this frame, an analysis of public policies and the identiﬁ- cation of satellite earth observation contributions were conducted, in areas including the management of natural and environmental resources, as well as maritime environmental surveillance and security."

216,obersteiner et al. contribute a visionary description of their work to develop methodologies and analytical tools to assess the societal beneﬁts of investments in improving the global earth observation system of systems (geoss) across its nine sbas (chap.
216,the fundamental idea of this work is that costs incurred in
217,17 conclusion 209 incrementally improving the observing system will result in beneﬁts through information cost reduction or better-informed decisions.
217,"the assessment ﬁnds that in the majority of case studies, the societal beneﬁts of improved and globally coordinated earth observation systems were orders of magnitude higher than the investment costs."
217,it concludes that geoss-informed earth system science products and services must receive adequate support to guarantee a transition to more sci- entiﬁc and evidence-based decision-making.
217,17.3 perspectives on the beneﬁts of earth observations for society and policy sir martin sweeting introduces a u.k. perspective in chap.
217,"observations of the environment are of critical importance to the u.k., providing scientiﬁc evidence to support decision-making."
217,"there is a need for comprehensive, continuous, and fresh observation of a growing range of parameters to address the various challenges facing the country."
217,"furthermore, he notes the opportunities from new technologies and the avalanche of data and actionable knowledge they will provide."
217,sustained contributions from all forms and sources—national and international—are needed and there is a clear need for stakeholder dialog in order to maximize the potential of environmental observations for decision-making.
217,china (chap. 8) has developed a top-down policy approach with the ten-year plan for the china integrated earth observation system (2007) and the medium- and long-term plan for development of science and technology (2006–2020).
217,earth observation technologies are now recognized as major public goods that are urgently required in support of various areas.
217,"in this chapter, fan introduces the key components of the chinese earth observation program—including the meteoro- logical, oceanic, earth resources, high-resolution, and environmental protection and disaster monitoring constellation components—as well as the role of the private sector."
217,the chinese earth observation program uses a system-of-systems approach and data are distributed free of charge in line with international practice.

218,"since 2005, geo has had considerable success in developing geoss, advocating broad and open data sharing, initiating major global monitoring initiatives, strengthening these accomplishments, and recognizing the need for further collective effort to foster the use of earth observation resources to their fullest extent."
218,the geo strategic plan 2016–2025 is introduced in sect.

219,the optimal mission design can be established based on this assessment.
219,the program then moves into the development and operation phases.
219,the assessment guarantees that the mission provides comprehensive observations that are adapted to user needs and ensure continuity and sustainability.
219,sustained funding and stakeholder dialog are critical.
219,commercial capabilities and new technologies should be leveraged in a timely manner; these companies should be involved as stakeholders throughout the process.
219,"finally, an international knowledge base, such as that of the oecd space forum, should be maintained so that experiences can be shared for subsequent missions."
219,"the model can be applied to various societal or scientiﬁc domains, targeted either to speciﬁc nations or international programs; it can also be combined with the concept of an earth observation regime complex to effectively carry out the programs."
219,the lack of a systematic approach such as the one described above may have slowed the future planning of the japanese earth observation program.
219,"now that japan’s space program has matured, and given the economic constraints japan has been facing over the last two decades, it seems timely for japan’s space program to take concrete steps toward establishing such an effective scheme, together with international partners and stakeholders."
219,it is time to realize that the focus of space-based earth observations is no longer purely r&d or science; it must also serve the needs of those who ﬁnance it.

220,onoda the peoic project started as an effort to look to the international community for guidance on the development of tools to assess the beneﬁts of earth observations.
220,"with the establishment of the international advisory board, the project evolved beyond its initial scope, enabling us not only to compile the latest achievements in the ﬁeld but also to add a novel view on the future governance of earth observation systems."
220,this has given us a broader perspective on where we are heading with existing and newly emerging earth observation technologies.
220,the study was timely because today we are at the point where we have the technological capability to exploit the avalanche of new information and thus knowledge that are derived from earth observations for improved decision-making.
220,"it is therefore our responsibility to use this opportunity well, to achieve a better future for human society and the earth’s environment."
