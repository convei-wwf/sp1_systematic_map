1,results indicate that received in revised form 14 march 2017 farmers need accurate seasonal climate forecasts between 1 and 2 months before the onset of rains.
1,"the accepted 2 june 2017 most desirable dissemination channels are radio, local elders, local farmer meetings and extension available online 12 june 2017 agents."
1,"the most likely used farming strategies are change of: planting date, crop acreage, crop variety, and production intensification."
1,"the vast majority of farmers are willing to pay for seasonal climate fore- keywords: casts, and the average annual economic value of seasonal climate forecasts are about usd 5492 for the benefits heckman model 354 sampled farmers and usd 66.5 million dollar at the national level."

1,practical implications our study analyses the economic benefits of seasonal climate forecasts for small farmers in the republic of benin in west africa and shows a clearly expressed need of these farmers for seasonal climate forecasts from public and community-based agencies to improve their production and increase their incomes.
1,we also show that available seasonal climate forecasts can lead to improved benefits for farmers.
1,"the most important forecasts requested by farmers are those related to the onset, distribution and amount of rainfall preferably forecasts that are available one to two months before the onset of rains."
1,many farmers would like to receive these seasonal climate forecasts through radio dissemination and also through meeting with extension and other local farmers.
1,this sug- gests that national and local government authorities need to prioritise the establishment of public radio stations that can reach local farming areas with information on farming including weather and climate forecasts.
1,"we also show that the majority of farmers respond to the availability of seasonal climate forecasts by adopting various strategies such as change of planting date, change of crop acreage, change of crop variety, change of crops planted and increase of fertilizer."
1,"uncertainty in getting the information on time and continuously, and difficulties in understanding the information, are the main factors that influence the usefulness of forecasts."
1,access to extension services increases the likelihood of using seasonal climate forecasts significantly.

2,"we conclude by noting the key areas that need to be emphasised by government include improved extension services that have components of seasonal climate forecasts in their programmes, the need for national meteorological agency to produce locality- specific seasonal climate forecasts which are relevant to various farming communities with respect to the major crop and farming activities undertaken."
2,staff of national meteorological agencies need to be more proactive in seeking information from farmers in specific localities with regards to their needs of climate and weather forecasts.
2,"lastly, it is important to note that farmers do not expect perfect seasonal forecasts and would be happy with an accuracy of around 80% that is eight seasonal forecasts out of ten seasonal forecasts issued that are useful."
