6,"in order to estimate these innovation and technological and scientiﬁc pursuit are key impacts, pwc consulted 93 entities previously contracted by esa endeavours for a thriving society and, in a context of immense (collectively accounting for about eur 516.4 m of esa economic constraints and critical social issues, the demonstration procurements between 2013 and 2018) to observe that 88% of the value of eo data in support of science and technological considered that they have generated spillovers thanks to their breakthrough is considered of primary importance."
6,but the ability participation in the eoep programmes.
6,"some of these entities to estimate knowledge beneﬁts is a recognised challenge for were able to provide the associated monetary estimations, on the research and technological agencies all over the world when basis of which pwc postulated total spillover beneﬁts in the range trying to justify public investments (see e.g., mazzuccato, 2013; of eur 794.9 to 1,089.1 m, with associated weighted spillover florio, 2019). multipliers ranging between 1.63 and 2.24."
6,"as recognized by the as already discussed, eo data provide fundamental contributions authors, the calculation was certainly approximate and it was to improvements in understanding about earth system science, intended only to provide a “minimal estimation of a very complex particularly with respect to climate change."

6,"from this perspective, eo missions have traditionally, the most common indicators used to measure value insofar as they provide information which is useful for beneﬁts derived from science and innovation are the number of taking decisions."
6,"this notion is generally framed as the value of patents ﬁled upon deployed solutions and the (weighted) number information or voi theory: this was originally developed in the of academic publications stemming from the design of new late 1960s to support public policy evaluation in the areas of systems or from the use of the data (see e.g., oecd, 2016). health, environment and climate change, to appreciate the value esa maintains a patent portfolio for technological transfers and of public goods, and was then transposed to the valuation of eo regularly looks at the number of scientiﬁc publications that make data (see e.g., macauley, 2006) and used to assess the value of reference to its own missions."

6,"however, these only provide a partial view and additional uncertainty with, and without, information."
6,decisions taken elements should be considered.
6,"for example, assimilating outer relying on alternative types of data (e.g., often, ground-based space probes to public research infrastructures the likes of large measurements) represent the so-called “counterfactual”, against particle accelerators and genomics platforms, florio (2019) takes which an improvement is measured (and value attributed). into account aspects such as beneﬁts to the work of scientists and depending on the degree of the uncertainty and on what is at students; knowledge spillovers for ﬁrms; beneﬁts to users of stake, decision makers may be willing to pay for information, information technology and science-based innovation; welfare either additional or improved, as long as the expected beneﬁt effects on the general public and even willingness of taxpayers to exceeds the cost of the information."
