1,"the resulting value score (vs) curve shows non-dimensionalised relative economic value as a function of the cost/loss ratios for different decision-makers, over their full meaningful range."
1,"the vs curve is similar in terms of computational mechanics and graphical display to the relative operating characteristic (roc) curve, but the roc curve is shown to be insensitive to either conditional or unconditional biases and thus to reflect potential rather than actual skill."
1,"the possibility of collapsing the vs curve into a single scalar score is addressed, and it is shown that the results can depend very strongly on the assumed distribution of cost/loss ratios in the community of forecast users."
1,introduction both bs and ss are scalar measures of the association between the forecasts and corresponding observations.

1,"almost universally, the accu- tained in the joint frequency distribution of the fore- racy of such forecasts is evaluated using the brier score casts and observations, p(fi, oj) (murphy & winkler, (e.g., murphy, 1997; murphy & daan, 1985; stanski et 1987)."
1,"here fi, i = 1, . . . , i, are the allowable forecasts; al., 1989; wilks, 1995): and oj, j = 0, 1, are the possible observations for dichotomous outcomes."
1,"if forecast probabilities are 1 n rounded to tenths, then i = 11, with f1 = 0.0, f2 = 0.1, . . ., bs = ∑ ( ft − ot )2 n t =1 (1) and f11 = 1.0."
1,"in that case the joint distribution p(fi, oj) can be visualised as a table with two rows and 11 columns, each entry of which specifies one of the 22 where ft is the probability forecast on occasion t, ot is a joint probabilities in the distribution."

2,"it is sometimes naively the basic premise of the cost/loss problem is that of a assumed that greater overall accuracy, as measured for decision-maker faced with the uncertain prospect of example by bs or ss, will necessarily lead to greater some kind of adverse weather."

9,"figures 6(a) and 6(b) contain results for the las vegas cool- and warm-season forecasts, respectively."
9,"the zero line is heavy, the contour interval is 0.02, and dashed contours indicate negative values (i.e., mos forecasts deemed more valuable in aggregate)."
9,"the raw integrated vs results underlying these figures range from near zero to – 1⁄4 for large a and small b, to approx- imately 1⁄2 for small a and large b."
9,figure 6(c) shows thumb-nail sketches of selected beta distributions for perspective.
9,"the case of a = b = 1 yields the uniform distribution, for which the vs at all cost/loss ratios are weighted equally."
9,"this seemingly attractive choice is equivalent to use of the bs (equation (1)) to evaluate the forecasts, since the expected value of eef according to the uniform distribution is a linear function of bs (murphy 1966), and therefore so also is the expected value of vs."
9,"as could have been anticipated, the mos forecasts have a greater integrated vs when the larger cost/loss ratios are emphasised in the cool season, and when the smaller cost/loss ratios are emphasised during the warmer months."
9,figure 6 shows very clearly that the result of collapsing the vs curve into a single score depends very strongly on the weighting function that is assumed to represent the spectrum of forecast users.
9,"conclusions this paper has proposed a method to evaluate proba- bility forecasts for binary predictands, based on the simple 2×2 cost/loss ratio problem."
9,"the result is a curve representing the variation of (scaled) economic value as a function of the cost/loss ratio; which respects the fact that different decision-makers will derive different ben- efits from a given set of forecasts, and that attempting to express forecast quality with a single number will fail to capture this variation."
9,"the vs curve is an extension of the approaches of mylne (1999) and thompson & brier (1955), who considered forecast evaluation in terms of economic value for particular, individual cost/loss ratios."
9,"the approach is a rational way to approach verification for weather variables that directly affect human enterprises, and would probably be less attractive for forecasts of variables such as geopotential heights."
9,"note that the 2×2 cost/loss ratio situation is essentially a toy decision problem which neglects such complications as multiple decision options, multiple relevant meteorological events, related sequential deci- sions, and different attitudes toward risk (e.g., wilks, 1997), although a large number of decision problems figure 6."
