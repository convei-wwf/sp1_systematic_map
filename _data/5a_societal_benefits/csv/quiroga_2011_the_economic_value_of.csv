4,"the ebro basin, located in the northeast of the iberian peninsula, is the largest basin in spain, with an area of 85 000 km2 and a mean an- nual runoff of 16.92 km3 yr−1 ."

4,urban supply and consumptive industrial demand is 0.96 km3 yr−1 and irrigation demand is 6.32 km3 yr−1 .
4,"to illustrate the loss of production generated from dif- ferences in the management of water systems, we analyse rice production, one of the main agricultural crops of the ebro delta (60% of its surface)."

8,in cerdá and quiroga (2010) a model is proposed to eval- uate information considering the risk aversion level.
8,the main concept used for this purpose is the certain equivalent.
8,the certain equivalent (ce) can be defined as the amount of money producing the same utility (u) without uncertainty as the expected utility (eu) of a gamble when the risk exists.
8,the role of risk aversion is analyzed here by considering that a manager decides between alternative 1 (more risk) and al- ternative 2 (less risk).

8,"the quality of coefficient of absolute risk aversion, which is constant for information is defined in terms of the following index: this function."
8,"(p1 − pθ ) the arrow-pratt absolute risk aversion coefficient can q = corr(θ,z) = ,where p1 = pr{θ = 1/z = 1} be interpreted as the percentage change in marginal utility (1 − pθ ) caused by each monetary unit of a gain or loss (raskin and table 5 summarizes the variables introduced in the model cochran, 1986)."
