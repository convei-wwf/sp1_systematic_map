1,"when truly poor families do not receive benefits (errors of exclusion) or when nonpoor families do receive benefits (errors of inclusion), this undermines the effectiveness of the policy (3)."
1,"unfortunately, many governments in low- and middle-income countries (lmics) lack recent, reliable data on where poverty is concentrated (4)."
1,"while most lmics have access to poverty data that provide comprehensive coverage at the largest administrative subdivision (e.g., the state level in nigeria, comparable with the state level in the united states), coverage is far less complete at the third administrative subdivision (e.g., the ward level in nigeria, comparable with municipalities in the united states)."
1,"in nigeria, the most recent demographic and health survey (dhs) surveyed households in only 13.8% of wards."
1,"this problem is present across lmics; in peru, for example, 32.0% of the comparable administrative units were covered in the most recent dhs, and in indonesia, just 16.1% were covered."

2,this is important because the survey benchmark does not for the objective of targeting the extreme poor (daily consumption contain data for 86.2% of nigerian wards (the admin-3 unit) below $0.57).
2,substantial increases in the area under the curve and 18.5% of local government areas (lgas; the admin-2 unit). are produced as the targeting policy shifts from states (the largest we document how the accuracy and complete coverage of the administrative unit) to lgas (the intermediate administrative ml-based maps make it possible to design a more disaggregated unit) and from lgas to wards (the smallest administrative unit). geographic targeting policy than would be possible with survey these findings are consistent with work done in other contexts data alone.

2,the better coverage of ml-based poverty maps does not come at the expense of accuracy.

2,"at all levels of spatial disaggregation, the correlation with data."
2,optimal targeting is simulated by using the same survey the nlss is similar.
2,note that we do not expect the ml-based estimates to outperform the dhs-based estimates since the dhs data were used to train the ml-based model (ml-based poverty maps).
2,"rather, the main advantage of the ml-based maps is that they allow for accurate extrapolation of wealth estimates into the large number of regions not surveyed by the dhs."
2,we further find that correlations with ground truth for both dhs and ml-based poverty maps increase when we consider only the regions where the evaluation (nlss) data are most reliable.

9,our goal with this third method is to make the imputation representative of incomplete evaluation data.
9,while great care was taken in the design of the true missingness in the dhs.
9,"thus, we randomly replace 18.5% of lgas and the nlss to ensure that the survey population was representative of the full 86.2% of wards with imputed values since 18.5% of lgas and 86.2% of wards population of nigeria (and also representative of each state), we are unable to do not have the dhs (and would thus require imputed estimates in practice)."
