3,in the benefit chain concept benefits as well as costs must be considered.
3,"the concept looks at incremental changes of costs and benefits with respect to the already existing observing system (e.g., national)."

4,"but accounting for both the costs and benefits of additional geo investments does provide a rational way of prioritizing between a small set of alternatives within the eo domain, and provides a filter to avoid high-cost, low-benefit actions."
4,the benefit value we refer to is the economic value rather than the financial value.
4,"in other words, it is the value of the benefit to the society as a whole, not just to the entities providing the infor- mation."

5,"in particular, we know too little about the costs of a global spatial data infrastructure."
5,"since we cannot assess the costs of national systems, we will have problems in estimating the costs for a global system."
5,"the statement made by david rhind (2000), former chief executive of the ordnance survey of great britain is partially still valid today and shows the problem we face: “we know very little about how much money and other resources are actually being expended on maintenance of the existing national spatial data infrastructures, let alone on creation of enhanced versions of them, or who is pro- viding these resources."
5,"in broad terms, we do not know whether these resources are being applied wisely.”"
5,"it would seem helpful, therefore, to carry out some sound accounting of this expenditure: arguments for adding to it or for using it more effectively or efficiently are unconvincing if we do not know the present practice."
