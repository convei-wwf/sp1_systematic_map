2,"our main hypothesis is allow quantifying the welfare change between a state in which a certain to distinguish between the value of knowledge per se, whose socio- action is taken, based on currently available information, and a different economic impact is not quantifiable, and the value of a knowledge’ state in which the same action is taken using improved information output’, such as a scientific publication, whose socio-economic impact (macauley, 2006; gallo et al., 2018)."
2,"in other cases, new knowledge is can be quantified (rosseau et al., 2020; florio, 2019; florio et al., 2016). patented, and the socio-economic benefit can be estimated by looking at indeed, newly generated knowledge is usually incorporated and the marginal social value of the patent (florio, 2019)."
2,"however, scien­ disseminated through scientific publications and used by the scientific tific subjects often contribute to expanding understanding about certain community itself to create new knowledge outputs."

2,"asi have largely financed the development of dedicated eo satellite however, a feature of the contemporary production of scientific constellations, respectively the copernicus programme and cosmo knowledge is the generation of a large number of scientific publications skymed."

2,"as explained in rosseau et al. (2020) and sights generated by recent works addressed at estimating the social florio (2019), it is possible to estimate the value of a knowledge ’output’ value of scientific publications (e.g., rosseau et al., 2020), and lessons such as a scientific publication that embodies a piece of knowledge learned from the cost-benefits analysis of large research infrastructures deriving, in this case, from the eo infrastructure."
2,"indeed, large research (ec, 2014; florio, 2019; florio et al., 2016; battistoni et al., 2016)."
2,"the infrastructures are publications factories (see, for example, carrazza empirical application of this method is easy to implement; it also leads to et al., 2016)."
2,"by being involved (even indirectly) in an eo infrastructure, conservative estimates and can be used to appraise the value of scientific scientists can access and collect new information that can be further publications produced by any research infrastructure, including uni­ elaborated to produce a knowledge output ultimately published in the versities, in any field of study. scientific domain."

3,the marginal social value of scientific publications community is willing to pay for an additional publication is at least the cost of producing it.
3,"indeed, a specific feature of research infrastructures is that the to estimate the socio-economic impact of scientific publications, we demand for new knowledge is driven by the scientific community, which is try to assess the marginal social value of a ’statistical’ publication, that is also the producer of such knowledge. the increased benefit, for the community of scientists, associated with in the last few years, the cost of scientific publishing has attracted the the existence of an additional publication (drèze and stern, 1987; attention of a bunch of scholars, especially from the publishers’ perspective boardman et al., 2017)."

3,"it includes, much an average scientist (the main consumer of scientific research) for example, the cost of laboratory equipment, computing resources, would be willing to pay for the availability of an additional publication software, databases, and any other fixed asset needed for research, (carson et al., 1996; breidert, 2007; johnston et al., 2017)."

4,the latter although this is not always the case (e.g. cost for conferences and trips can be a function of the number of citations received.
4,using citations as a can increase as the number of publications increases).
4,"for simplicity, we proxy for the influence of a publication has several drawbacks (harzing, also neglect the role of externalities imputable to any effect of the 2010; waltman et al., 2013)."
4,"for example, citations vary significantly research and publication process (e.g."

4,clarivate7 in 2019 reveals that experiments or by the physical distribution of papers).

4,"by neglecting these aspects, the estimated marginal social cost publication has generated, particularly in the field of science (harzing, publications – on which we rely to compute the marginal social benefit – 2010; bourke and butler, 1996). will be lower than the actual one, confirming our estimates’ conserva­ in this context, in our framework, we should consider at least the first tive nature. round of publications citing the initial publications directly related to previous works simply estimate the marginal cost by adopting the the eo infrastructure.8 to assign a monetary value to citations, we shall opportunity cost of scientists’ time approach."
4,"(ec, 2014; florio, 2019; again consider the opportunity cost of time employed by a scientist to rosseau et al., 2020)."
4,the idea is that when scientists spend time on a read and cite someone else’ publication.
4,"thus, the shadow price of research project related to eo, which may then translate into an addi­ citation is estimated using the opportunity cost of time employed by a tional publication, they have an opportunity cost for not working on an scientist to decide to cite a publication which can vary from few minutes alternative project."
4,"hence, a monetary value can be attached to a sci­ to hours and depends on several factors (florio, 2019)."
4,"since this in­ entific publication by estimating its marginal cost, which depends on the formation is difficult to obtain, we compute the value of citation of a salary received by the scientists (in our function, we also consider the representative paper (valuecit), at year t, by multiplying the marginal opportunity cost of editors’ and reviewers’ time) and the time dedicated cost of a publication by a coefficient (α) equal to the share of time that to that publication."
4,"while rosseau et al. (2020) in their work also researchers, on average, devote to reading activities."
4,"then we divide the attempt to apply this method by interviewing professors at the univer­ results by the average number of references reported in the citing papers sity la sapienza of rome, we further develop and advance this approach (avreft ) roughly assuming that each of these references has contributed by exploiting available secondary data at the publication level."
4,"while equally to the production of the publication (florio, 2019) . the availability of microdata at the publication level could provide a more precise estimation of different items of the cost function (e.g."

4,"it is also very conservative as usually the social value proxied by the marginal cost is lower than those calculated with wtp (boardman et al., 2017)."
4,"additionally, as highlighted by romer (1990), 5 by using market wages of scientists, we underestimate the social value of when authors work on different publications, this aspect is captured by scientific research as market wages are commonly lower than shadow their annual productivity. 6 wages (the latter are the social opportunity costs of labour and should be in our theoretical setting, we use the yearly average salary of researchers and the share of time devoted to research/peer reviewing activities to assign a value to the representative (marginal) article."
