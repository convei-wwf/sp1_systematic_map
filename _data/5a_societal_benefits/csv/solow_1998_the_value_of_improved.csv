1,abstract.
1,the economic value of long-range weather prediction is measured by the increase in social welfare arising from the use of the prediction in economic decisionmaking.
1,this paper describes a study of the economic value of enso prediction to u.s. agriculture.
1,"the interdisciplinary study involved the analysis of data and models from meteorology, plant science, and economics under a framework based on bayesian decision analysis."
1,the estimated annual value of perfect enso prediction to u.s. agriculture is $323 million.
1,introduction skill in interannual climate prediction has improved over the past decade.
1,"this improvement is due in large part to the ability to predict, up to a year in advance, oceanographic conditions in the equatorial pacific ocean relating to the phenom- enon known as el niño-southern oscillation (enso)."
1,a recent comprehensive review of enso prediction is given in latif et al.
1,(1994).
1,"public investment in data acquisition, modelling studies, and other scientific activities should lead to further improvements in enso prediction and, as a result, to further improvements in climate prediction."
1,"for this reason, there is an interest in assessing the return to investment in this area."
1,"in a previous study, adams et al. (1995) estimated the value of improved enso prediction to agriculture in the southeast u.s."
1,this paper describes an extension of the earlier study to all u.s. agriculture.
1,"beyond its enlarged scope, the present study differs from the previous one in two respects."
1,"first, the report of the previous study was aimed primarily at economists."
1,"in contrast, the present paper stresses the interdisciplinary aspects of the study."
1,"second, the present study improves on the previous one in certain technical areas, including a more comprehensive treatment climatic change 39: 47–60, 1998."

2,solow et al. of climate statistics and crops and improved modelling of decisionmaking under uncertainty.
2,the basic scenario considered here is the following.
2,the enso year runs from october to september.
2,each enso year can be classified according to enso phase.
2,"there are three enso phases: warm event (or el niño), cold event (or el viejo), and non-event."
2,"climate in the u.s. is affected by enso phase, although not all regions are affected and, those that are affected, are not necessarily affected in the same way."
2,the regional climatic differences between different enso phases affect the yields of different crops.
2,"thus, advanced knowledge of enso phase pro- vides advanced knowledge of climatic conditions, which in turn provides advanced knowledge of agricultural yields."
2,"since different crops respond differently to cli- matic conditions, advanced knowledge of yields provides information about the profitability of different cropping patterns."
2,individual farmers use this information about profitability in selecting their cropping patterns.
2,the consequences of these individual decisions for the agricultural sector and ultimately for consumers are captured through the market for agricultural products.
2,"in broad terms, the economic effect of improved enso prediction is the same as that of a technological improvement that increases the supply of agricultural products."
2,the value to society of this shift in supply is the increase in the sum of consumer and producer welfare.
2,the sum of these is referred to as economic surplus.
2,"briefly, changes in consumer welfare reflect gains (or losses) due to lower (or higher) prices, while changes in producer welfare reflect changes in so-called quasi-rents, which in most cases are comparable to profits."
2,the economic value of enso prediction is defined as the expected change in economic surplus arising from changes in cropping pattern due to the prediction.
2,"to use this scenario as a basis for estimating the value of improved enso pre- diction, it is necessary to model (i) the climatic differences between different enso phases; (ii) the effects of these climatic differences on yields; (iii) the way in which information about yields affects planting decisions; and (iv) the way in which the behavior of individual farmers affects the market of agricultural products."
2,these steps are described in the following sections.
2,climatic differences between enso phases the first step in estimating the differences in monthly climate between the three enso phases was to classify each enso year in the 40-year study period 1947– 1986 by enso phase.
2,"the classification rule was based on a 5-month moving average of the average sea surface temperature anomaly within the tropical pa- cific region 4◦ s–4◦ n, 150◦ w–90◦ w constructed by the japan meteorological agency."
2,"if the index exceeded 0.5 ◦ c for 6 consecutive months including october– december, then the enso year was classified as el niño phase."
2,"if the index fell below –0.5 ◦ c for 6 consecutive months including october–december, then the"

3,all other years were classified as non-event phase.
3,"the classification, which is similar to others (e.g., kiladis and diaz, 1989), is given in table i."
3,"using this classification, monthly climate statistics were calculated for each enso phase at each of 54 stations."
3,"these stations, which are listed in table ii, were selected to provide balanced coverage of agriculturally significant regions."
3,an agricultural region was associated with each of these stations.
3,both the cli- mate differences between enso phases and the corresponding yield effects were assumed to be constant within these regions.
3,"daily climate data for the representa- tive stations were used to calculate monthly mean values of the following climate statistics: − mean and standard deviation of daily minimum and maximum temperature; − mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of skewness of daily precipitation; − the number of wet days; and − the one-step transition probabilities between wet and dry days."

4,"details of this analysis, including an assessment of the statistical significance of observed climatic differences between enso phases, are presented in sittel (1994a, b)."
4,some selected results are shown in figure 1.
4,"in broad terms, climatic differences between the phases are greatest during winter."
4,"in the southeastern u.s., where the enso signal appears to be most pronounced, el niño years tend to be colder than normal in the fall and winter and warmer than normal in the spring and summer."
4,"el viejo years generally exhibit patterns with the opposite sign, although typically not the same magnitude."
4,"for precipitation, el niño years tend to be wetter than normal in the winter and spring and dryer than normal during the summer."

5,agriculture 51 magnitude.
5,"these results are generally consistent with those found in other studies (e.g., ropelewski and halpert, 1986)."
5,"yield effects the crops included in this study were barley, corn, cotton, hay, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybeans, tomatoes, and wheat."
5,"this selection was based primarily on economic importance and on planting schedules, which determine the potential for incorporating long-range weather prediction into planting decisions."
5,these crops account for over 90% of acreage and 80% of farm gate value in the u.s.
5,"for each crop, the effect of yield of climatic differences between enso phases were estimated for each region using a plant biophysical simulation model called the erosion productivity impact calculator (epic)."
5,"this model, which is described in williams et al. (1989) and bryant et al. (1992), was originally developed to determine the relationship between soil erosion and productivity."
5,"however, because it uses climatic information in calculating yield, it is well-suited for this study."
5,the epic model estimates crop yield based on total biomass produced and a harvest index.
5,biomass and the harvest index increase through the growing season as a function of heat units.
5,"the harvest index may be reduced by high tempera- ture, low solar radiation, or water stress during critical crop stages."
5,"biomass may be reduced by water, temperature, and aeration stress and also by nitrogen and phosphorus stress."
5,"the plant growth model in epic has been tested throughout the u.s. and in several other countries (steiner et al., 1987; williams et al., 1989; bryant et al., 1992; kiniry et al., 1995)."
5,the most comprehensive validation study was conducted by williams et al.
5,(1989).
5,"in that study, the model was tested for 6 crop species at 20 u.s. and 15 foreign locations with considerable variation in weather and soil characteristics."
5,"in all cases, mean simulated yield was within 7% of measured yield."
5,other studies found similar results.
5,the yield results for the stations shown in figure 1 are given in table iii.
5,yield differences among summer crops were due mainly to differences in water stress.
5,"for example, corn in mount airy, nc and bridgeville, de suffered fewer days of summer water stress in el viejo years than in el niño and non-event years."
5,"in contrast, the enhancement of growing conditions at corpus christi, tx during el niño years was due to higher crop-available water in the spring months."
5,winter wheat yields are more affected by temperature stress than by water stress.
5,"for example, higher winter wheat yields during el viejo years were due mainly to reduced winter temperature stress."

8,"decisionmaking and the value of prediction under the scenario considered in this paper, the climatological implications of an enso prediction are used to formulate a prediction of crop yields."
8,the prediction of yields is then used by farmers to optimize cropping patterns.
8,"the way in which farmers use this information can be formalized in terms of bayesian decision theory (kite-powell and solow, 1994)."
8,this formalization is outlined in this section.
8,let a denote a particular cropping pattern and let the random variable s denote the enso phase.
8,"the possible values of s are e (el niño), v (el viejo), and n (non-event)."
8,let s denote a realization of s and let b(a | s) be the profit for cropping pattern a if the realized enso phase is s.
8,"in the absence of an enso phase prediction, the expected profit for a is: x e(b(a)) = b(a | s)π(s) , (1) s"
9,the value of improved enso prediction to u.s.
9,agriculture 55 where π(s) is the probability that s = s.
9,the optimal cropping pattern a∗ maximizes e(b(a)).
9,"note that, in the absence of an enso phase prediction, the farmer optimizes cropping pattern over long-run average climatic conditions."
9,"in particular, a∗ does not change from year to year."
9,"on the other hand, crop production in a particular year resulting from cropping pattern a∗ depends on the realized enso phase in that year."
9,"for a given enso phase s, the economy-wide supply for each crop resulting from optimal cropping patterns of each farmer in all regions can be found using a model capturing both farmers’ decisions across all production regions and the demand for each crop."
9,"let t1 (s) be the economic surplus arising from the aggregate supply curves – that is, from supplies summed across all farmers in all regions."
9,"in the absence of an enso phase prediction, the expected economic surplus is given by: x t1 = t1 (s)π(s) . (2) s suppose now that an annual enso phase prediction is issued prior to the plant- ing season."
9,let the random variable x denote the predicted phase and let x denote a realization of x.
9,"as with s, the possible values of x are e, v , and n."
9,"although only categorical predictions were considered in this study, the same general ap- proach could be applied to probabilistic predictions."
9,suppose that the enso phase prediction x in a particular year is x.
9,"the farmer uses this prediction to update the probability distribution of s according to bayes’s theorem: p(s | x) = p(x | s)π(s)/p(x) , (3) where p(s | x) is the probability that s = s given x = x, p(x | s) is the probability that x = x given s = s, and: p(x) = prob(x = x) x (4) = p(x | s)π(s) . s the likelihood p(x | s) is a non-standard measure of prediction skill."
9,for a perfect prediction: p(x | s) = 1 if s = x (5) 0 otherwise in which case: p(s | x) = 1 if s = x (6) 0 otherwise .
9,"in contrast, for a completely uninformative prediction, p(x | s) = 1/3 for each s, so that p(s | x) = π(s)."
10,56 andrew r.
10,solow et al.
10,"the individual farmer behaves as before, choosing the optimal cropping pattern a ∗ (x) to maximize expected profit: x e(b(a) | x) = b(a | s)p(s | x) . (7) s note that, by averaging over p(s | x) in equation (7), the farmer is taking account of the possibility of incorrect phase prediction."
10,"otherwise, the farmer would simply choose a to maximize b(a | x)."
10,the optimal cropping pattern a ∗ (x) now depends on the realized enso phase prediction x.
10,let t2 (x | s) be the economic surplus at the national level if x = x and s = s.
10,"the conditional expected surplus given x = x is found by averaging over the conditional distribution of s given x = x: x t2 (x) = t2 (x | s)p(s | x) (8) x and the unconditional expected surplus is: x t2 = t2 (x)p(x) . (9) x finally, the value of the enso phase prediction is given by t2 − t1 ."
10,the same approach can be used to assess the value of an improvement in – as opposed to the establishment of – an enso phase prediction.
10,it is important to stress that the value of enso prediction is an average or long-term concept.
10,"in a particular year, an incorrect prediction may lead to a loss."
10,"however, on average – or equivalently, over time – the use of the prediction will lead to an increase in profits."
10,"implementation and results to implement the bayesian approach outlined in the previous section, it is neces- sary to specify prior probabilities of the enso phases and the likelihood function of the prediction scheme."
10,"in the study described here, the prior probability π(s) was taken to be the relative frequency of s in table i, so that: π(e) = 0.23 π(v ) = 0.30 π(n) = 0.47 ."
10,"as noted above, the likelihood function is a non-standard measure of prediction skill."
10,"in the present study, three hypothetical levels of prediction skill – modest, high, and perfect – were considered."
10,"in related work, we are attempting to estimate the likelihood function of a simple, model-based enso prediction scheme (a."
10,solow and m.

11,"using the prior probabilities given above, these likelihoods are converted into the posterior probabilities given in table v."
11,"for given posterior probabilities, an economic model called sprasm was used to calculate expected surplus."
11,"this model is a stochastic programming version of the agricultural sector model (asm) that was used in the earlier study (chang and mccarl, 1992)."
11,the asm provides estimates of the changes in prices and quantities

12,solow et al.
12,"table vi expected economic value of enso prediction ($ million per year) skill expected value modest 240 high 266 perfect 323 of agricultural products, and corresponding changes in economic surplus, due to changes in yields."
12,this model was validated by solving for prices and quantities using 1992 yield data.
12,the solutions were all within 2% of actual 1992 quantities and 5% of actual 1992 prices.
12,further details of this general approach to model validation are given in fajardo et al.
12,(1981).
12,"the incorporation of a stochastic com- ponent based on discrete stochastic programming (lambert et al., 1995) provides a convenient and powerful way to capture decisionmaking under uncertainty."
12,"under the combined model, farmers maximize expected profit subject to a market clearing condition and a set of resource constraints, while consumers utilize agricultural products with knowledge of prices."
12,"again, it is important to stress that, under the decisionmaking component of this model, farmers take into account the possibility of incorrect phase predication as outlined in the previous section."
12,the results of the study are summarized in table vi.
12,"these values, measured in 1995 dollars, are larger than those from the previous study."
12,"this increase is due, in part, to the larger geographic scope and the greater coverage of agricultural activ- ities."
12,"however, due to the refinements of data and procedures in the present study, a direct comparison is not strictly possible."
12,the annual values given in table vi represent recurring gains to society.
12,"assuming that future benefits are discounted at an annual rate of 6%, the net present value to the agricultural sector of a high skill enso prediction operating over 10 years is around $2 billion."
12,"in interpreting the results in table vi, it is important to distinguish between the economic value of improved enso prediction and the economic impacts of a particular enso phase."
12,"for example, in this study, the economic surplus associated with a single el niño year is approximately $2.5 billion less than that associated with a non-event year."
12,"however, even with a perfect prediction, all of the negative effects (such as yield reductions) cannot be avoided, so that the value of predicting this event perfectly is considerably less."

13,agriculture 59 6.
13,discussion the study described here and in the earlier report represents the first systematic attempt to assess the economic value of enso prediction for a major sector of the u.s. economy.
13,"although earlier attempts have been made (e.g., o’brien, 1993), they have been based on ad hoc methods, rather than on a model of economic de- cisionmaking."
13,the study described here documents the existence of enso signals in regional climate in the u.s. and identifies their consequences for crop yields.
13,advanced knowledge of these yield differences have potential value for farmers.
13,the results of this study confirm the preliminary findings of the earlier study that enso prediction has substantial economic value to u.s. agriculture.
13,"while the specific results presented here seem reasonable, we believe that the main contribu- tion of this paper is the description of a rigorous approach to assessing the value of long-range weather prediction."
13,"in implementing this approach, it is not necessary to use the epic model or the sprasm model."
13,different or more elaborate models can be used.
13,"incidentally, the same general approach can be used to assess the value of prediction to other sectors of the economy."
13,"turning to the specific results of this study, while the values in table vi are substantial – particularly compared to the cost of enso prediction itself, they represent only around 1–2% of the net income of u.s. farmers."
13,"this may seem low, in light of the publicized effects of enso."
13,there are features of the study that tend to underestimate the value of enso prediction to agriculture.
13,"for example, only cropping decisions were allowed to respond to enso prediction."
13,"no provision was made for other kinds of adjustments, such as alterations in inputs (e.g., fertilizers) or harvesting decisions."
13,"also, some valuable vegetable and perennial crops were omitted from the analysis due to lack of information about potential yield effects."
13,"on the other hand, the study assumed that all farmers respond optimally to enso prediction."
13,failure of this assumption would lead to an overestimation of the value of enso prediction.
13,"in addition to the technical problems associated with this kind of empirical analysis, the value of enso prediction to any sector is limited in two important ways."
13,"first, substantial climate variability remains within enso phases, particu- larly on the regional scale."
13,"to put it another way, even perfect enso prediction is far from perfect climate prediction."
13,"second, as noted, the value of enso prediction is limited by the capacity of decisionmakers to respond to the prediction."
13,"in almost all cases, this capacity will fall far short of avoiding all losses due to inclement climate."
