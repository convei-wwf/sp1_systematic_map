1,farm proﬁtability several research studies delineated advantages of mesonet weather information for eﬃcient agricultural economics decision-making.
1,"however, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative mesonet decision-making research in this ﬁeld is still missing."
1,"this paper aims at ﬁlling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on proﬁtability analysis, usda nass and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the oklahoma extension center."
1,the results show that the cumulative economic beneﬁts for agricultural production in oklahoma from uti- lizing mesonet information (assuming the proﬁtability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006–2014 (combining generated proﬁts and prevented losses in agricultural production).
1,"mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic beneﬁts in terms of prevented losses than additional production proﬁts, especially in drought years."
1,"a regional analysis for oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative beneﬁts of mesonet applications in the southwest ($45.9 million), north central region ($38.2 million), and in panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006–2014."
1,"also, high temporal variations were found for all oklahoma climate regions."
1,"this research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic under- standing of the economic value and beneﬁts of weather information provided by the oklahoma mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state."

2,accounting for and measuring economic value of information of any accurate weather information can generate signiﬁcant economic kind and in any discipline is a very challenging task.
2,"the main reason beneﬁts in regard to optimizing agricultural land use and generating for this diﬃculty arises from the fact that information, even though one additional net returns (proﬁts) that might have been forgone if this of the most powerful production factors, is generally intangible, and information was not available."
