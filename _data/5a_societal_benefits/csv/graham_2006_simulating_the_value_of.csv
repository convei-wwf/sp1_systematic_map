1,precipitation in much of panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical paci- ﬁc sea surface temperature (sst) and this relationship is reﬂected in gatun lake inﬂows.
1,"for example, the correlation coeﬃcient between wet season (july–december) inﬂow and nino3 sst is 0.53 over the period 1914–1997."
1,"operational capabilities to predict tropical paciﬁc ssts have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such sst forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inﬂows (compared with climatological expectations)."
1,"because substantial reductions in lake inﬂow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inﬂows, coupled with a method for translating that information into eﬀective operational policy, might result in more eﬃcient canal management."
1,a combined simulation/optimization/assessment ‘‘virtual’’ canal system was implemented and exercised using operational el niño forecasts over the period 1981–1998.
1,"the results show the following main points: (i) at current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to ﬂow forecasts) unless ﬂows are substantially reduced (i.e., during el niño episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate. (ii) the inclusion of accurately speciﬁed levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneﬁcial policies. (iii) the situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inﬂows are relatively high, and those where storage and inﬂows are relatively low."
1,"in the former case, demands can be met without the beneﬁt of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments. (iv) for a nominally conﬁgured canal system, the use of operational el niño forecasts with appropriately speciﬁed uncertainty resulted in approximately $us 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic clima- tological forecasts."
