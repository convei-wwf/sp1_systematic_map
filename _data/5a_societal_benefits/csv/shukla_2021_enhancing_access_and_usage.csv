8,"similarly, participate in the training, which exemplifies the “empower-the- participants’ feedback on individual case studies and data sets and trainers” approach, as well as the increased impact and reach of tools discussed helped us schedule more time and include further these trainings. information on the materials that the participants most liked and in the section below, we provide a more in-depth description wanted to see again. of how the above mentioned capacity-building efforts enhanced in general, the participants found the web services (such as eo uses for improved environmental services at selected ewx) able to meet their needs."
8,they liked various features environmental service agencies across the region. that ewx offers.

8,the majority of the participants indicated that they environmental services would “very likely” be using ewx and climateserv for their professional activities.
8,"across all trainings, in general, this section provides details of selected examples of how the participants favored the case studies focusing on “drought environmental services were enhanced and improved in at least monitoring,” “seasonal-scale climate scenarios,” and “weather four agencies across the e & sa region following the capacity- forecasts.”"
8,this was likely because those case studies were most building efforts.
8,"in each case, the existing needs of each of the relevant to the routine professional duties of most participants. agencies are described, their typical end users are listed, and the case study “implementing index insurance using ewx” also how the capacity-building efforts described previously led to clear received favorable feedback; however, in general, the participants examples of eos uptake in improving environmental services to needed further information."
