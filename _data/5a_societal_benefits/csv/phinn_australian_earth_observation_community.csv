7,introduction it is hard to imagine modern society in the absence of earth observation.
7,"earth observation technologies common applications of eo are used to collect data from satellite, aircraft, and remotely operated systems to deliver information bushfire mapping and services that are now ubiquitous and so well integrated into daily activities in our society, economies emergency and disaster response and governments that they are largely ‘unseen’."
7,"energy resources our daily weather and oceanographic forecasts, disaster management systems, water and power flood mapping supply, infrastructure monitoring, mining, agricultural production chains, environmental monitoring and forestry more, all use earth observation (figure 1)."
7,"horticulture relevant, accurate, detailed and up-to-date spatial information is recognised as an essential resource infrastructure for australia’s public and private sectors, and thus there is a strong need to continue to innovate and land management improve earth observation science and application in australia and its territories."
7,"earth observation is ocean monitoring vital to a range of sciences, as well as government and mining and mineral exploration industry activities used to understand and manage our environments sustainably, from within urban precision agriculture residential blocks to the australian continent, oceans and beyond."
7,"with the support of emerging technologies, research and full engagement across government, industry, and research sectors, the benefits of earth observation urban and regional planning for daily life in australia will continue to grow."
7,"water resource management ‘earth observation’ (eo) encompasses a broad suite of activities that use remote sensing to gather observations weather forcasting and produce measurements and spatial data to monitor and examine our planet, its environments, human environmental monitoring activities and infrastructure1."
7,"eo data are collected at a range of scales from centimetres to kilometres, throughout all our environments — built, natural, figure 1 and managed."
7,"some eo data have been collected eo information and products are routinely applied regularly for decades through ongoing satellite across a wide range of industries for economic and programmes, while other data may be collected at societal benefit, some of which are shown here. specific times and places to respond to particular needs a comprehensive list of 200 eo applications can be found at www.skywatch.co/get-inspired such as natural disasters or emergency situations."
7,"in this document, we use the following meanings for commonly used terms: data refer to raw images or observations with no or limited corrections; data product refers to image data with a location and time attribute applied to them and other basic corrections applied; spatial information refers to an image file with location and time attributes as well as advanced corrections applied to it, and transformed to a thematic (categorical, e.g. land-cover type) or quantitative (e.g. temperature, water depth) product so it can be used with other spatial data; services are processes (e.g. code and algorithms) that use spatial information to generate maps, measurements, graphs or other outputs for a specific application e.g. fuel load mapping."
7,these are now also referred to as ‘spatial analytics’.
7,services can also include tools designed to help end-users explore spatial data products for their own purposes.

18,"while some key datasets are readily discoverable, many datasets are hard to find and access."
18,"in addition to this, a range of important datasets remain in archives and ‘unlocking’ them can only be achieved through significant and sustained investment in infrastructure, processes, relationships with foreign agencies, trained personnel, and scientific and legally accepted validation to deliver them in a form fit for use."
