1,integrating earth observations data into geospatial databases that support public health decisions s.a.

1,"most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads."
1,the public health applications in remote sensing (phairs) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the united states.
1,"several earth observations (eo) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement."
1,output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the national centers for environmental prediction (eta version) model (ncep/eta).
1,simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by ncep/eta’s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based continuous air monitoring system (cams).
1,the simulations were re- run after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from modis (mod-12).
1,"for the cams test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns."
1,"additional eo data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from srtm, dust- generating areas derived from mod-15’s fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fpar) and leaf area index (lai) data, soil moisture data from amsr-e, and aerodynamic surface roughness."
1,"ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from eo data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis."
1,"the overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several eo data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of eo data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence."
1,introduction immense concern; and relative new-comers like west nile virus are receiving close scrutiny.

(socioeconomics, demographics), and with global and regional earth observations data (weather forecasts, disaster as evidence for global climate change mounts, and as the monitoring)."
1,"modern medical diagnoses, treatment, reporting, global economic and medical consequences of natural disasters and containment in the face of potentially devastating emerging become better understood, it is clearly in the best interests of infectious diseases like avian flu (h5n1), require readily humanity to share health information in such ways as to available historical information, as well as forecasts of future connect even the most remote areas of the world."
1,it is now conditions that might accelerate an epidemic.
1,"there is commonly accepted among people everywhere that enormous widespread interest in disease surveillance systems covering a societal benefits will accrue from the combined capabilities of wide array of communicable diseases and medical conditions remote sensing, geographic information systems, and position, that allow health care professionals to query databases for navigation, and timing (pnt) technologies, especially those similar cases reported locally, regionally, and globally."

2,"dream is a to begin developing an infrastructure, the public health desert dust cycle model consisting of two modules: (a) an applications in remote sensing (phairs) project is atmospheric simulator; and (b) a dust cycle simulator."
2,"the engineering an integrated vector- and raster-based system that atmospheric simulator parameters include land surface can be accessed as a web-based service by health care processes, turbulent mixing, convection, large-scale professionals."
2,"it is initially designed for the desert region of the precipitation, lateral diffusion, and radiation."

2,"phairs has three parallel thrusts: (1) assimilate the dust cycle module simulates dust production, advection and eo data into an atmospheric dust model; (2) iterate model turbulent diffusion, and dry and wet deposition (nickovic et al., inputs to optimize model outputs; and, (3) undertake a beta-test 2001; shao et al., 1993; georgi, 1986)."

2,"phairs is modelling primarily mineral dust and pixel values from earth observation data to improve respiratory diseases, but water-borne and vector-borne diseases the model’s performance and convert it into a more like malaria and typhoid can be modelled also."

2,"this requires sub-setting, re-projection and rescaling of fused data."
2,"2.2 models most models available for earth system science, are not designed for eo data."
2,"compatibility issues arise, among which are: (a) measurement units, (b) x,y,z,t resolution, (c) map projection and ease of re-projection to fit model requirements, (d) file formats, (e) error and error propagation, and (f) validity of the data set as a replacement input."
2,"these issues must be reconciled before assimilation of each candidate data set can be performed, and before iterations of multiple data sets can be statistically evaluated."
2,it is assumed that overall improvements in model outputs will result from accumulated incremental figure 1.
