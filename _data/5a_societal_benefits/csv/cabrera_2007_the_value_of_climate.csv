1,federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information.
1,"a representative peanut–cotton– corn non-irrigated north florida farm was used to estimate the value of the enso-based cli- mate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of cli- mate, prices, and risk aversion levels."
1,"yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, ﬁrst, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain out- comes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs."
1,results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when la niña or el niño enso phases are forecast.
1,highly risk averse farmers could beneﬁt from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (oﬀensive responses).
1,the inclusion of commodity loan programs (clp) and crop insurance programs (cip) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels.

2,"introduction major improvements in climate predictions related to the phenomenon known as el niño-southern oscillation (enso) call for studies to estimate the value of this technology and its potential uses to reduce farm risks (podestá et al., 2002; phillips et al., 2002)."
2,"the agricultural sector, among the most vulnerable to climate changes, can use seasonal forecasts to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions (bert et al., 2006; jagtap et al., 2002; chen et al., 2002)."
2,"however, farm decisions do not occur in isolation and may be inﬂu- enced by decision making institutions such as federal farm policies and regulations that may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information (hansen, 2002)."
2,"several studies have previously estimated the value of agricultural forecasts (let- son et al., 2005; meza and wilks, 2003; hammer et al., 2001), but only a few have included the impacts of government institutions on the value of the seasonal fore- casts (mjelde and hill, 1999; mjelde et al., 1996; bosch, 1984)."
2,"mjelde et al. (1996) remains the state of the art analysis on how farm programs might inﬂuence the value of climate information; but since that time, farm legislation has undergone substantial changes, and researchers have learned much about how to estimate the value of climate information."
2,the use of biophysical crop simulation models together with stochastic weather generators to characterize enso intra-phase variations and conﬁdence intervals have played a major role in recent years.
2,synergies or conﬂicts between farm programs and climate information represent a critical knowledge gap in how we should think about climate forecast value.
2,farm programs condition the use of climate information in a variety of ways.
2,they limit the range and eﬃcacy of forecast responses since farm programs may restrict the crops farmers can grow and how they may grow them.
2,"in addition, farm programs alter the riskiness of decision environments since they (are intended to) reduce the variability of farming incomes."
2,"the objective of this study is to estimate the impacts of farm programs on the value of enso forecasts in a rainfed peanut–cotton–corn farm in jackson county, florida."
2,we tested the hypothesis that government interventions might enhance or limit the usefulness of the climate information.
2,this study expands the framework used by letson et al. (2005) by including the impacts of government farm programs into the estimations of the forecast value.
2,"we deﬁne forecast value or risk adjusted net income as the monetary amount of change (i.e., us$ ha1) in the net income resulting from incorporating seasonal climate forecast information and risk aversion levels in farm decision making."

3,"location and climatic characteristics the study was conducted on a representative 130 ha rainfed farm in jackson county, fl that grows peanut, cotton, and maize in soil type dothan loamy sand."
3,"we selected this speciﬁc case study because it has similarities in environment (e.g., climate, soils), resources (e.g., farm size, crops grown), and technology (e.g., rainfed agriculture) to other major agricultural production areas in the southeastern united states, which would suggest a broader relevance of our ﬁndings."
3,"el niño southern oscillation or enso is a phenomenon characterized by changes in the sea surface temperature of the equatorial paciﬁc ocean that aﬀects the atmosphere and cause seasonal climate variations around the globe (ropelewski and halpert, 1986)."
3,"in florida, rainfall is highly sensitive to enso phases with an average excess of about 40% of the normal rainfall across most of the state during an el nino year, with deﬁcits of about 30% lasting during a la nina year (jagtap et al., 2002)."
3,"florida also has average temperatures 1–2 °c below normal during el nino years, whereas la nina brings temperatures 1–2 °c above normal during winter months (jagtap et al., 2002)."
3,"hansen et al. (1998a,b, 1999) and mavromatis et al. (2002) have found that enso inﬂuenced yields of most of the crops in florida."
3,"the weather station at chipley (30.783n, 85.483w) was used as representative for jackson co., which presented 1143 mm of rainfall and 21.7 °c of mean temperature during the growing season (february–november)."
3,enso phases inﬂuence precipita- tion and to a lesser extent temperature in jackson co.
3,"in general, higher precipita- tion levels and lower temperatures are observed during el niño years, especially before planting."
3,"during la niña years, the opposite is observed (fig."
3,"the jackson climate risk assessment model we integrated climatic, agronomic, economic, and policy components (fig. 2) in a farm decision model."
3,"this model ﬁrst optimizes management practices with and without forecasts and with and without farm programs, and then simulates net mar- gins over long periods of time."
3,"to test our hypothesis that federal farm policies may enhance or limit the useful- ness of the climate information (mjelde et al., 1996) we introduced two farm pro- grams consisting of commodity loan programs (clp) and crop insurance programs (cip)."
3,"the clp included loan deﬁciency payments (ldp) and marketing loan beneﬁts (mlb), while the cip included multi-peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop revenue coverage (crc)."
3,"in the study area, ldp are available for cotton and mlb are available for peanut and maize."

6,generation of synthetic crop yields.
6,"limited duration of daily weather records provided only a few realizations of the enso impacts to crop yields (i.e., only 14 el niño realizations), however a thorough assessment of climate risk and forecast value requires the study of a more complete account of enso events."
6,"previous approaches have relied on the use of stochastic weather generators to produce synthetic weather (letson et al., 2005; meza et al., 2003) and then used these weather data to predict agronomic and economic outcomes."
6,we used a diﬀerent approach consisting of a stochastic yield generator based on simulated crops yields.
6,our stochastic yield generator employed re-sampling in three steps.
6,"first, crop yields simulated by crop models were sorted for an enso phase and a planting date."
6,"second, a function (logarithmic, exponential, quadratic, or linear; whichever had a higher r2) was ﬁt to the data."
6,we used a mathematical function in order to avoid underestimating potential extreme values in the distribution.

7,"we repeated the procedure for each planting date, of each crop, in each enso phase."
7,our simulated yields are consistent with previous research and data in florida.
7,"these are supported by hansen et al. (1998a) ﬁndings, in which historical data in la niña years showed greater maize yields with lower deviations compared with lower yields and greater deviations during el niño years."
7,"likewise, our peanut yields are consistent with mavromatis et al. (2002) who found greater yields during la niña years and fraisse et al. (2005) who predicted between 10 and 20% higher prob- abilities to collect yield indemnity payment during el niño years than during la niña years due to lower yields."
7,"in addition, results from fraisse et al. (2005) pointed out greater peanut yields for medium to late plantings as in our simulated yields."
7,"for the case of cotton yields, hansen et al. (1998a) did not found signiﬁcant diﬀerences among enso phases, but historical data indicate a trend of greater yields during el niño years as it has been found in our simulation."

7,economic component 2.2.2.1.
7,generation of synthetic prices.
7,"in order to match our yields, we stochasti- cally generated distributions of 2970 price series for each crop (peanut, cotton, and maize) by simulating a multivariate distribution respecting price covariance among crops based on historical price variability."
7,the procedure followed several steps (for more details see letson et al.
7,"(2005), appendix b)."
7,"first, we obtained monthly average prices (january 1996–january 2005) received by florida farmers for peanut, cotton, and maize from the usda national agricultural statistical service (http://www.nass.usda.gov/ﬂ/econ/prices/)."
7,"we estimated their descriptive statistics, and explored their correlation structure."
7,we deﬂated prices to jan 2005 dollars using the us consumer price index.
7,we de-trended the data for sea- sonal diﬀerences by estimating monthly residuals with respect to their means.
7,we used principal component analysis to decompose the matrix of price residuals into three uncorrelated time series of amplitudes that were separately sampled.
7,the sampled values were combined and back transformed to reconstruct crop price residuals.
7,we conﬁrmed that the correlation structure of the synthetic price resid- uals was similar to that of the historical data according to kolgomorov–smirnov tests and that the historical price distributions were well reproduced according to quantile–quantile plots.
7,"and ﬁnally, we re-introduced seasonal price averages for the harvesting dates of the three crops: 2 september–6 november for peanut, 22 september–28 december for cotton, and 1 july–30 september for maize."
7,"for the case of cotton, we increased its price by 18.66% to account for the seed value."
7,"we stress the price distributions are not historical values, but distributions consistent with historical variability."
7,2.2.2.2.
7,production costs.
7,we consider variable and ﬁxed production costs by crop in the model.

8,"the variable costs ($ ha1) were 1088 for peanut, 1122 for cotton, and 574 for maize."
8,"the ﬁxed costs ($ ha1) were 344 for peanut, 177 for cotton, and 87 for maize."
8,2.2.2.3.
8,whole farm model.
8,we used a stochastic non-linear whole farm model to study the role of climate forecasts in decision making and to estimate the value of these forecasts.
8,"we solved the model to identify optimal decisions and to simulate annual economic outcomes by constraining the model to the optimal settings with and without enso information, and with and without farm programs."
8,2.2.2.3.1.
8,optimal farm decisions.
8,"we sampled 325 years of our synthetic yields and prices to ﬁnd optimal land allocation to the three crops and planting date deci- sions, assuming the chance of forecasting a given phase is its historical frequency (14, 35, and 16 for el niño, neutral, and la niña phases) for the period 1939–2003."
8,"the model selected optimal decisions for 70 el niño events, 175 neutral years, 80 la niña events, and the sum of all of them."
8,"the model maximized the expected utility (u) for one year planning period sub- ject to land and labor availability (letson et al., 2005), where utility was a power function of wealth based on a constant relative risk aversion rr (hardaker et al., 2004), eqs."

9,farm simulation and evoi calculation.
9,we constrained the farm model to optimal land allocations to simulate net margins for 2970 years (990 for each enso phase) using all our synthetic yields and all our synthetic prices.
9,this proce- dure was repeated for each constant relative risk of aversion.
9,we estimated the expected value of the information (evoi) by comparing the simulated net margins with and without forecast according to their historical propor- tion frequencies.
9,"to be consistent with the precedent literature, we estimated evoi over diﬀerent planning horizons in certainty equivalent units (us$)."
9,introduction of farm programs several farm programs exist in place and directly impact agricultural production risk in the united states.
9,"among them, crop insurance, disaster assistance, ﬁxed and countercyclical payments, and commodity loan programs are available for farmers in jackson county, florida."
9,"in order to evaluate land allocation decisions for our three crops, we were interested in farm programs that depend on actual production and distinguish among commodities as is the case of commodity loan programs and crop insurance."
9,"we were not interested in disaster assistance programs, federal income taxes, and other type of farm program provisions (ﬁxed and countercyclical payments) because they either do not depend directly on actual production or farmers have limited or no control over them in their annual decision making."
9,"in addition, according to local information (k."
9,"nicodemus, rural community insurance, october 2004) only very few cases can be found for claiming disaster assistance; federal income taxes have been found to inﬂuence only moderately the value of the forecast (mjelde et al., 1996); and program payments are totally independent of production and farm deci- sion making."
9,2.3.1.
9,"commodity loan programs the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 (the 1996 fair farm act) initiated loan deﬁciency payment (ldp) programs for several crops, including cotton."
9,the purpose of this ldp program is to provide producers with ﬁnancial help to market their crops throughout the year.
9,the ldp for a county is determined by comparing the county’s loan rate and posted county price (pcp).
9,"if the pcp is below the loan rate, then producers are eligible for ldps."
9,the payment amount is the diﬀerence between the loan rate and the pcp (http://www.card.ias- tate.edu/ag_risk_tools/ldp/).
9,the farm program of ldp in jackson county sets a minimum price of $1.14 kg1 for cotton.

10,"/ agricultural systems 93 (2007) 25–42 the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 (the 2002 fsria farm act) eliminated the peanut ‘‘quota’’, but created new forms of farm ﬁnancial help for peanut growers (http://www.ers.usda.gov/amberwaves/november04/features/ peanutsector.htm)."
10,"among the new sources of government payments is the market- ing loan beneﬁt (mlb), which entitles peanut growers to receive marketing assis- tance loans of $0.39 kg1 on current production."
10,also the 2002 fsria farm act changed the maize mlb to $0.08 kg1 (http://www.ers.usda.gov/brieﬁng/corn/ policy.htm).
10,"in order to compare evoi with and without the inclusion of farm programs, we applied the ldp to cotton and mlb to peanut and maize in our synthetically gen- erated prices by limiting the minimums to at least the levels of the respective pro- grams."
10,"in the case of cotton, we ﬁrst applied the ldp and then added the value of the seed."
10,the value of the seed is unaﬀected by the farm programs.

10,crop insurance programs several crop insurance options are available.
10,to reduce the number of decisions we used the most common insurance products used by jackson county farmers in 2004 according to the economic research service (www.ers.usda.gov).
10,"for peanut we used multi-peril crop insurance (mpci) at the 70% level; for cotton crop rev- enue coverage (crc) at 65% level; and for maize, mpci at 50% coverage."

11,"/ agricultural systems 93 (2007) 25–42 35 mpci covers yield loss to a selected level, while crc covers loss value to a selected level (yield multiplied by a price election)."
11,the price election selected was the maximum in each one of the cases.
11,"it was ($kg1) 0.3935, 1.4991, and 0.0964 for peanut, cotton, and maize, respectively."
11,"the use of medium levels of yield coverage (peanut and cotton) and highest price coverage is consistent with what producers tend to insure (mjelde et al., 1996)."
11,insurance premium costs by crop were calculated by multiplying the premium cost by the selected planted area by crop inside the decision function of the model.
11,"the local premium costs to the farmer were ($ ha1) 29.16, 50.16, and 7.66 for peanut, cotton, and maize, respectively."
11,an indemnity payment was calculated when the yield (mpci for peanut and maize) or the value of the yield (crc for cotton) was lower than the insured thresh- old in a determined year.
11,the indemnity payment was the amount the farmer would receive in compensation to raise the income of the crop to the insured level.
11,the indemnity payment was added to the income in the objective function by multiplying the land area by the price base and by the amount of loss.

11,the proportion of crops on the farm did not change by enso phase for the case of rr = 1 (table 3).
11,"however, there were favorable planting dates for diﬀerent enso phases."
11,"later peanut plantings were preferred in el niño years, while very early cotton plantings were chosen for la niña phases."
11,"medium to late maize plantings were selected for el niño and la niña years, but earlier plantings were selected during neutral years."
11,"diversiﬁcation decreased with risk aversion; e.g., only 2 crop planting dates were selected for rr = 4 and only 3 crop planting dates were selected for rr = 0, compared to 4 for rr = 1 when optimized for all years."
11,crop rotations and land allocation from optimizations are consistent with the ranges indicated by local informants.
11,"for rr = 0, 0.5, and 1 the proportion of pea- nut, cotton, and maize was always 35%, 36.7%, and 28.3%; for rr = 2, 3, and 4 the proportion of the same crops was 0%, 37.8%, and 62.2%, respectively, with no pea- nut being produced."

14,"/ agricultural systems 93 (2007) 25–42 a defensive response, while risk averse use forecast oﬀensively."
14,forecast responses in jackson county combine defensive with oﬀensive risk strategies.
14,"under normal risk aversion (rr = 1), when producers are prepared to minimize income losses (defen- sively) and to take advantage of favorable conditions (oﬀensively), the average evoi was $2.90 ha1 for all years, which increased to $6.60 ha1 for el niño events."
14,the value of the information increased considerably to around $25 ha1 for the average of all years when rr > 1.
14,this was even more valuable for the case of more risk averse farmers when el niño or la niña events were forecast ($48 ha1).
14,"for less risk averse producers (rr < 1), limited increase in the value of the information was observed for la niña events and remained steady for el niño events (fig."
14,"small-scale jackson county farmers, like the representative farmer for this study, are risk averse farmers that would use the forecast oﬀensively by being more respon- sive to la niña or el niño events to take advantage of likely favorable conditions."
14,"conversely, large farmers would use the forecast defensively by being more respon- sive to la niña phases to avoid losses during these events."
14,"for all years, evoi is $2.40 ha1 at rr = 0 and it is maximized at $24.60 ha1 at rr = 2 (similar results were found by letson et al. (2005), in pergamino, argentina)."
14,"our ﬁndings of evoi values, which show the best opportunity of forecasts for highly risk averse producers and encourages oﬀensive forecast use, is consistent with previous studies (letson et al., 2005; messina et al., 1999; mjelde et al., 1998); and katz’s webpage (www.esig.ucar.edu/hp_rick/agriculture.html)."
14,"even a perfect forecast provides a distribution of possible weather outcomes, which will impact crop yields and together with uncertain prices will impact eco- nomic returns."
14,a frequency distribution of evoi estimates is presented in fig.
14,evoi range and likelihood are of practical importance because forecast users may want to know the range and likelihood of evoi as well as the likelihood of neg- ative evoi estimates.

15,cabrera et al.
15,"/ agricultural systems 93 (2007) 25–42 39 of 2970 (28%), which is not negligible."
15,negative evoi occurs because of the joint eﬀect of weather and prices.
15,"prices of peanut are still highly distorted by government regulations (even after the 2002 farm act that abolished the ‘‘peanut quota’’, there are still quota buyout, base acreage, and other peanut price programs)."
15,it is expected that these peanut price incentives will disappear in the near future.
15,"consequently, it is highly likely that the ﬁnal prices received by peanut farmers will continue decreasing in the near future."
15,the ers (http://www.ers.usda.gov) estimates this reduction on the order of 33% of current likely prices.
15,"also, statistics and projections from ers indicate that pea- nut us exports will remain marginal and not have major impacts on the domestic peanut prices."
15,"in order to study the impacts of peanut price reductions in our value of information portfolio, we arbitrarily reduced the prices of peanuts 33% and esti- mated the value of the information under those conditions."
15,results indicated that there were no substantial changes in the evoi estimates.
15,"for example, compared with the original case, the average evoi when the price of peanut was 33% lower only decreased $0.20 ha1 under risk normality (rr = 1), and it only decreased around $2.40 ha1 for the average of all years when rr > 1."
15,the curves when using 33% lower peanut prices were very similar to fig.

15,forecast value with commodity loan programs we followed similar analyses to the evoi estimates when clp were applied.
15,"4b shows the relationship between enso phases, evoi and rr when clp are included."
15,overall the value of the information is greatly reduced when clp are applied.
15,"under normal risk aversion (rr = 1), average evoi was slightly higher than when not using clp, $3.80 ha1, which increased to $6.80 ha1 for el niño events."
15,this was the highest value of the information.
15,"for higher risk averse levels (>1), the value of the information was substantially lower than when not using clp, on the order of $1.50 ha1 for the average of all years."
15,the evoi was small but positive for all years; however it was zero for la niña years and rr = 1 and for el niño and neutral years and >1 because there were no diﬀerences between the optimal settings when using forecast information.
15,"while for less risk averse farmers (rr < 1) a defensive response could have slightly better evois than not using clp, for more risk averse producers (rr > 1) the value of the information is substantially lower for the case of using clp."
15,"when using clp, less risk averse farmers (usually large farmers) would slightly beneﬁt with defensive responses during el niño events, however more risk averse farmers (usually small farmers) would not beneﬁt by using enso forecast."

16,evoi was negative ($0.50 ha1) for all years and rr > 2 because it was highly negative (<$11 ha1) when neutral years.
16,evoi estimates for el niño years and rr were moderately high (>$22 ha1).
16,still under cip conditions high risk averse farmers could beneﬁt by potential favorable conditions when el niño years are forecast.
16,"negative evoi is possible as reported in previous studies (letson et al., 2005; mjelde et al., 1996)."
16,"negative evoi occurs because of intra-phase variability: e.g., optimization selected a crop combination based on a sample of weather realizations and the actual weather occurrence diﬀered in ways that impacted income."
16,"moreover, the incidence of negative evoi estimates increased when stochastic prices (enso independent) are unfavorable for a deﬁned enterprise proposition."
16,"under high risk aversion levels, enterprises with less variable returns are chosen over enterprises with overall higher returns."
16,it was consistent over all optimizations that peanut was not selected for high risk aversion levels even though it was the most proﬁtable enter- prise.
16,"also, we sampled 325 years for our optimization and then constrained the model to the optimal settings."
16,use of forecast could be a losing proposition when extreme prices and weather coincide.
16,high frequency and overall higher negative val- ues found in this study (including the case of not using farm programs) diﬀer from previous studies.
16,"in our model, jackson county producers are required to use all their land with limited labor available."
16,"this fact makes producers select even nega- tive enterprises, in order to use labor as eﬃciently as possible."
16,"for example, cotton was a negative enterprise for all enso phases and no farm programs, but it was always selected because it was needed in the natural rotation of crops as described by local informants."

16,"although the inclusion of both farm pro- grams decreases the overall value of the information, it also buﬀers the occurrence of negative values as when is only cip applied."
16,the evoi for all years is negative for rr > 1 varying between $0.10 ha1 and $0.90 ha1.
16,"the value of the information was positive, but marginal for la niña years and for rr > 1."
16,"it was always positive for el niño years and it had moderate values ($26 ha1) for rr > 1, indicating that highly risk averse farmers would still beneﬁt by using el niño forecast oﬀensively by taking advantage of potential advantageous situations when clp and cip are in place."
16,"conclusions as hypothesized, farm programs substantially impact the value of forecasts."
16,farm programs such as commodity loan programs and crop insurance programs reduce farm income variability and the riskiness of the farm enterprises.
16,"consequently, the inclusion of clp and cip tends to reduce the overall value of the climate informa-"

17,"however, depending upon the risk aversion level of the farmer it could vary considerably."
17,decision making institutions and regulations such as farm programs will always aﬀect farm riskiness and farmers’ decisions.
17,they should be included in the analyses of decisions.
17,forecast value is inherently probabilistic even for perfect enso phase forecasts and must be estimated and communicated as conﬁdence intervals rather than a single point estimate.
17,our numerous synthetic prices and yields allowed us to generate probability distributions of the value of the forecasts.
17,each estimate we report is associated with its probability of occurrence.
17,"within these distributions, negative value of the forecast information exists and is not negligible (letson et al., 2005)."
17,"further research should include weather synthetic generators, other forms of farm programs, and similar representative farms in the neighboring states of alabama and georgia."
17,"currently, a state of the art weather generator adaptable to north florida conditions is being developed by a team of researchers at the university of miami."
17,"other farm programs such as direct payments, counter cyclical payments and taxes, would be useful to better represent the decision making environment that farmers face and identify more synergies and conﬂicts between climate information and farm programs that could be proactively used."
