2,"in regions such as africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for 27 achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty 28 elimination."
2,"however, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often sub-optimal due to lack 29 30 author manuscript of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts."
2,"here, we present a decision support system (dss) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal timescales by combining 31 data from earth observation satellites (eos) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical 32 models and hydrologic modeling."
2,the large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is 33 overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based 34 measurements.
2,"in addition, an eos evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow 35 in calibrating hydrologic models."
2,"compared to a dss forced with a climatological forecast (zero- 36 skill), the hydropower production with the new dss increased by 20%."
2,"the study highlights the 37 advantage of using data from eos in overcoming the issue of data scarcity in water resources 38 applications, particularly in developing regions of the world such as africa."
2,39 (keywords: hydropower; decision support system; remote sensing; water resources) 40 introduction 41 access to water and energy are essential for the development of the socio-economically vulnerable 42 regions of the world.
2,"in fact, clean water and energy constitute two (sdg6 and sdg7) out of the 43 seventeen sustainable development goals (sdgs) identified by the united nations (griggs et al., 44 2013; sachs, 2012) (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/)."
2,"effective water and energy resources 45 planning is necessary for not only achieving sdg6 and sdg7 but also plays an important role in 46 addressing other sdgs such as poverty elimination (sdg1), zero hunger (sdg2), and promotion 47 of sustainable cities and communities (sdg11)."
2,"in this regard, hydropower, which lies at the nexus 48 of water and energy, has an important role to play."
2,"this is especially true in africa, which has 49 witnessed significant growth in the construction of reservoirs, including those specifically 50 targeting hydropower production."
2,"with such an exponential increase in hydropower capacity, it is 51 crucial to operate these reservoirs in such a way that guarantees energy production is maximized, 52 not an easy task given the seasonal and annual variability of water availability under present 53 (broman et al., 2020) and future (fletcher et al., 2019) climatic conditions."

3,"these reasons 56 necessitate the development and implementation of decision support systems (dsss) which can 57 provide reliable and effective information to decision makers, at the relevant time scales."
3,58 59 author manuscript dsss are used for the optimal operations of reservoirs for a variety of purposes.
3,"typically, the near-term (daily), sub-seasonal (weekly), and seasonal (monthly) releases from a reservoir serve 60 multiple purposes, such as domestic, industrial, and agricultural water supply, flood control, 61 hydropower, and the maintenance of environmental flows (alemu et al., 2011; koppa, 62 gebremichael, zambon, et al., 2019; westphal et al., 2003)."
3,"a dss consists of three parts: 1) an 63 inflow forecasting system which uses statistical or dynamical methods to generate possible 64 realizations of future inflow into the reservoir at the required timescales, 2) an optimization system 65 which employs either deterministic or stochastic programming techniques, based on the nature of 66 the inflow forecasts, to optimize reservoir outflows, and 3) a visualization support system interface 67 that communicates this information to the user in an effective way to meet their decision-making 68 process in a timely fashion."
3,"in the rest of the introduction, we provide a brief overview of the three 69 enumerated dss components and summarize the objectives of this study."
3,70 inflow forecasting system 71 the effectiveness of a dss for hydropower planning is significantly influenced by the reliability 72 of the inflow forecasting system.
3,"inflow forecasting systems generally fall into one of the 73 following two categories: (1) statistical modeling based on past streamflow observations, and (2) 74 dynamically driven hydrologic modeling forced by climate forecasts."
3,"75 in the first category, statistical modeling techniques such as autoregressive moving average and 76 neural networks which sample from past observation of inflows, are used to generate the forecasts 77 (cuo et al., 2011; li et al., 2017)."
3,"several factors hinder the application of such an inflow 78 forecasting system in africa, of which in-situ data scarcity and inaccessibility are the most 79 significant, because the lack of reliable long-term inflow information adversely impacts the 80 accuracy of statistical models of forecasting."
3,"81 in the second category, dynamic forecasts of reservoir inflows are generated with computational 82 physics-based climate and hydrologic models."

4,"see the terms and conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on wiley online library for rules of use; oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 84 hence forecast-informed decision making (alfieri et al., 2013; benninga et al., 2017)."
4,"while this 85 category has shown value in generating dynamic forecasts and acknowledging some uncertainties 86 in the forecasts, it is limited by the large range in ensemble members and questions about which 87 ensemble forecast products are reliable."
4,"in addition, reliable calibration of spatially distributed 88 89 author manuscript hydrologic models for forecasting purposes are largely dependent on the availability of streamflow measurements."
4,"90 in our opinion, the next advancement in the inflow forecasting system in regions with reduced in 91 situ monitoring would be to develop a methodology that accurately quantifies the uncertainty in 92 the climate ensemble forecast products and reduces the uncertainty to a level that is useful for 93 decision making."
4,"therefore, in this study, we propose a new approach for inflow forecasting 94 system that is particularly appropriate in data-scarce regions, such as africa."
4,"this approach is to 95 utilize earth observing system (eos) data to both dynamically adjust the climate forecasts 96 provided by climate forecast centers, while also utilizing the eos data with novel techniques to 97 calibrate the hydrologic models of watersheds with limited surface measurements."
4,"98 the value of eos in enabling improved water resources management in data scarce regions is well 99 recognized (sheffield et al., 2018)."
4,"the development of improved eos over the last fifty years has 100 resulted in vast amounts of direct and indirect observations of nearly all the water and energy 101 balance components required for modeling the earth’s terrestrial processes, including its hydrology 102 (lettenmaier et al., 2015)."
4,"although, eos data have been extensively used in climate and 103 hydrological modeling and forecasting through data assimilation (crow and ryu, 2009; mazrooei 104 and sankarasubramanian, 2019) and model calibration (koppa, gebremichael, and yeh, 2019; 105 lópez et al., 2017; rakovec et al., 2016; zink et al., 2018) or directly as forcing inputs, the utility 106 of such data for water and energy resources planning, in general, and hydropower reservoir 107 operation, specifically, has not been sufficiently explored."
4,108 one of the key challenges in utilizing eos data products is to choose which data products to use.
4,"109 there are many eos data products for the same variable (e.g., precipitation) with large differences 110 amongst them owing to differences in satellites, sensors and retrieval algorithms."
4,"in addition, the 111 choice of eos data products may have to take into account their joint performance to ensure some 112 realism, for example, the closure of energy and water balance."

5,"see the terms and conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on wiley online library for rules of use; oa articles are governed by the applicable creative commons license 114 eos data products for only one variable may show good performance in simulating the streamflow 115 at the outlet of the catchment, but it may have large errors and unrealistic performance in 116 simulating other water balance components, indicating that such an approach may not work in 117 simulating even streamflow in the case of cascading hydropower reservoirs."
5,"therefore, new 118 119 author manuscript methodologies need to be developed that advance the use of eos data for hydropower reservoir planning, particularly in africa where ground validation data are lacking."
5,"120 optimization system 121 the optimization of a cascade of hydropower dams, using an ensemble of streamflow forecasts, is 122 generally carried out using stochastic programming with recourse models (yeh, 1985)."
5,"in such 123 models, the system of reservoirs is optimized for the entire forecast horizon but the release 124 decisions for only the first-time step (referred to as ‘first stage’) is adopted."
5,"then, the forecast 125 horizon is moved forward by one stage and the optimization procedure is repeated."
5,"although the 126 value of stochastic inflow forecasts in hydropower optimization is well studied (séguin et al., 127 2017), an assumption inherent in such optimization models is that the first stage (day, week, 128 month) forecast is deterministic."
5,"in other words, the forecast for the first stage is assumed to be 129 sufficiently accurate such that a single deterministic forecast for the first stage is deemed enough 130 for the optimization of reservoirs."
5,"when new information regarding the inflow into reservoirs are 131 available, the whole system is validated, and the required adjustments are made to the dss before 132 the start of the next stage."
5,"several studies employ this approach for the operation of reservoir 133 cascades (etkin et al., 2015; wang et al., 2012)."
5,"however, such an approach is dependent on the 134 availability of reservoir inflows at regular intervals for the validation of the entire dss, which may 135 not be possible in data scarce regions such as africa."
5,"here, we implement a new stochastic 136 programming with recourse model which considers the first stage to be also stochastic (koppa, 137 gebremichael, zambon, et al., 2019)."
5,"in addition, we implement the conventional stochastic 138 programming with recourse model and a purely deterministic optimization model to enable 139 decision making under data scarcity and uncertainty."

6,the scale of the information produced by 145 hydrometeorological services and climatological centers can often be overwhelming to a user.
6,"as 146 an example, ensemble rainfall forecasts at a single location from a single weather center can easily 147 comprise over 3000 data points for a forecast going out to two weeks in advance – a well-designed 148 149 author manuscript visualization and support system then should consolidate and filter such information using expert knowledge of the data’s relevance to the unique decision making process of the user."
6,"a number of 150 systems have been developed that have been shown to be effective in communicating timely, 151 coherent, relevant, and user-friendly information for a number of applications that have relevance 152 to a broad class of user’s decision-making needs, such as in the area of climate change (wilhelmi 153 et al."
6,2016).
6,"decision support visualization tools for hydropower planning comprises a unique 154 challenge, in that design considerations for decision making need consider a broad range of data 155 types (e.g. rainfall, streamflow, and power), temporal immediacy (e.g. historical, current 156 observations, forecasts), data source centers (e.g. space agencies and weather centers), the range 157 of temporal scale (e.g. 24-hour, 5-day, 1-month, and 3-month totals) and spatial scale (grid, small- 158 to large-catchment averaging), data accessing formats (e.g. csv, flat file, time-series, etc.), 159 uncertainty information (ensembles versus cumulative probabilities versus averages), and general 160 aesthetic and design considerations."
6,"161 objectives of the study 162 in this study, the three systems detailed above are combined to create a decision support system 163 (dss) for hydropower planning in africa and other data scarce regions that leverages the potential 164 of eos data, ensemble climate forecasts, hydrological models, and stochastic optimization 165 systems."

7,"this approach 186 conveniently replaces streamflow data, which is the commonly used data for calibrating 187 hydrologic models, with eos terrestrial evaporation data products, because most 188 watersheds in africa are ungauged and even those that are gauged have data quality issues 189 (outdated rating curve, stage measurements observed and recorded manually by non- 190 experts) and availability (substantial time lag until the data are transferred to electronic 191 format and shared by users, and bureaucracy in data sharing)."

8,the dss process (figure 1) starts with the 207 selection of the most appropriate eos data for precipitation (p) and evapotranspiration (et) 208 209 author manuscript variables for the selected domain (eom).
8,"the selected p dataset is then used to calibrate ensemble weather and climate forecasts using combined analogue and quantile regression approaches 210 (hopson, 2014; hopson and webster, 2010; knievel et al., 2017; koenker and bassett, 1978b) at 211 the daily to seasonal timescales in the cfm."

8,"simultaneously, the selected et dataset is used to calibrate the hydrologic model 214 using a bayesian calibration algorithm to derive a set of parameters for streamflow forecasting."
8,"215 next, the calibrated climate forecasts are used as input into the hydrologic model to generate 216 ensemble forecasts of inflows into all the reservoirs in the study domain for the forecast horizon 217 (hfm in figure 1)."
8,"in om, the generated reservoir inflow forecasts are then used as an input into 218 a stochastic programming with recourse model to generate optimized reservoir release decision 219 such that the hydropower production is maximized."
8,"finally, web-based decision support tools 220 visualize the ensemble climate forecasts, the reservoir inflow scenarios, and the optimized release, 221 storage and hydropower decisions (vm in figure 1)."

14,the novel contribution in this module is in the use of terrestrial evaporation 387 (et) as a proxy for streamflow (sf).
14,"the selection of et as a proxy for sf is motivated by the 388 findings of several previous studies which show that calibrating hydrologic models with et, in the 389 absence of sf observations, improves the accuracy of sf relative to an uncalibrated model 390 (immerzeel and droogers, 2008; lópez et al., 2017; zink et al., 2018)."

26,we note here that the results correspond to the immediate stage of the stochastic 727 programming with recourse model.
26,"therefore, the similarity between the det and spwr-d 728 release decisions may be because the immediate stage of the spwr-d model is deterministic, 729 and the value derived from bma of ensemble members is equal to the det inflow scenario 730 structure."

26,the higher power produced in the spwr-s scenario structure may be 744 attributed to the consistently higher values of reservoir inflow compared with the det and 745 spwr-d scenarios.
