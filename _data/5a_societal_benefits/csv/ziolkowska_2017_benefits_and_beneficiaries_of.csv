2,"with 121 monitoring stations across the state, the oklahoma mesonet has developed an array of tech- nologies to observe a variety of atmospheric and soil variables in 5- to 30-min intervals."
2,"these consistent observations have been especially critical for predicting and preparing for extreme weather events like droughts, floods, ice storms, and severe convective storms as well as for development of value-added tools."
2,"the tools, outreach programs, and mesoscale data have been widely utilized by the general public, state decision-makers, public safety officials, k–12 community, agricultural sector, and researchers, thus generating wide societal and economic benefits to many groups."
2,"based on practical application examples of weather information provided by the oklahoma mesonet, this paper analyzes both benefits generated by oklahoma mesonet information to the public and decision-makers and ripple effects (spreading amplified outcomes/implications) of those benefits in the short and long term."
2,"the paper further details ongoing and anticipated oklahoma mesonet innovations as a response to changing needs for weather-related information over time, especially as a result of technological developments and weather variability."
