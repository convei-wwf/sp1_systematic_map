1,the model can be applied to arbitrary decision problems and is sensitive to a much wider range of factors than traditional forecast valuation models.
1,a simple illustration of its application to the cost–loss decision problem familiar from the forecast valuation literature is discussed.
1,it is shown that perceived value is highly sensitive to perceived model accuracy and that in most cases a high level of perceived accuracy is required for the forecasts to be thought to have any value at all.
1,decisions with a cost–benefit ratio that is close to the climatological probability of the adverse event are shown to be less sensitive to perceived accuracy.
1,"the model shows that it is possible for perceived value to remain unchanged when perceived accuracy increases, thus suggesting an explanation for why forecast uptake often does not increase after improvements in model performance are made."
1,"last, it is argued that attempts to increase forecast uptake should be targeted at those users whose cost–benefit ratios fall in a restricted range that depends on the climatological probability of the event and an objective measure of the ensemble accuracy."
1,introduction shown that forecast value is heavily dependent on user wealth levels and attitudes to risk (mjelde and cochran it has long been recognized that seasonal forecasts 1988; jones et al.

9,the cost–loss scenario considered above is a very restricted application of the model to an extremely simple decision problem that does not exploit its full power.
9,future work will be directed toward exploring the dependence of forecast value on the other model parameters for more realistic decision problems.
9,there are several interesting applications that immediately suggest themselves.
