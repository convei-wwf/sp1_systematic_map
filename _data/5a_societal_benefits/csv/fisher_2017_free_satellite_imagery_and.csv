1,natural resource management requires spatial land resource data for plan- ning.
1,"however, currently the ﬁnancial and human capacity for natural resource mapping, monitor- ing and modelling remains low in local governments."
1,"in this context, this paper explores how new opportunities provided by the increasing availability of free satellite imagery, digital elevation data and open source spatial analysis software, can be applied by local government and ngos to conduct sophisticated natural resource mapping and modelling in ways that meet their needs and incorpo- rates local knowledge."
1,reported are cases of a local government using free geospatial data and gis software to improve evidence-based natural resource management in the developing world with a focus on raster data applications for satellite image analysis and terrain modelling.
1,"it is argued that, through removing barriers to uptake, such applications provide a means of decentralizing land- scape analysis skills to improve local natural resource management."
1,"this hypothesis is supported through examples of a local government applying these tools in eastern indonesia, and within this context barriers to wider adoption are explored."
1,"keywords: gis, remote sensing, dem, decentralization, capacity building, open source accepted: 6 april 2017 introduction policies aimed at government decentralization have been widely implemented through- out latin america, africa and asia (larson, 2002) with the goal of increasing efﬁciency, participation, equity, and accountability."
1,"with respect to natural resource management, decentralization aims to allow more proactive management which is sensitive to local needs leading to improved environmental sustainability (world bank, 1988; tacconi, 2007)."
1,"reviews of this approach have identiﬁed the capacity of local governing organiza- tions as the primary factor limiting effective management (larson, 2002; oyono, 2004; hartter & ryan 2010; arellano-yanguas, 2011; ribot et al., 2010; blomquist et al., 2010)."
1,external advisors with minimal local knowledge to contextualize the advice they provide are commonly used to bridge the gap between limited capacity and the aspiration for good local governance.
1,"this lack of regional engagement with technical planning processes can result in a limited local understanding of planning outputs, leading to poorly informed and inappropriate management recommendations."

2,kristianus haleberek factors can result in reticence from local government to implement governance recom- mendations presented.
2,"information communication technology is often promoted as a tool for improving the evidence base and equity of governance in developing countries (bertot et al., 2010; oecd, 2005)."
2,"however, it is also criticized for being deployed top-down thus failing to address the needs of local governments and communities (heeks, 2010; huang 2013)."
2,"geographic information technologies in particular have been criticized for preferentially empowering a techno-elite and disenfranchising local interests (dunn et al., 1997)."
2,"it is ar- gued that as maps give authority to particular conceptions of land value through deﬁning a range of social and biophysical parameters, differential access to the technology, skills and data required to make them reinforces social and political inequity (fox et al., 2008)."
2,"to address the potentially disempowering aspects of mainstream gis, mapping techniques have evolved to enhance local participatory planning processes and collab- orative decision making (rambaldi et al., 2006; elwood, 2011; mccall & dunn, 2012)."
2,many of these participatory gis approaches have focused on low-tech methods for spatially enabling communities.
2,"there is also increasing interest in the potential for decentralized use of emerging low cost digital spatial tools and data for improving governance (fisher & myers, 2011)."
2,"over the last ten years there has been a rapid increase in the availability of free geospatial data and software (moreno-sanchez, 2012)."
2,"it has been argued that free gis software, when coupled with free spatial data, is providing new opportunities for enhanced transparency and increased community engagement in environmental management (baker and williamson, 2006; fuller, 2006; fisher, 2012)."
2,building local capacity for evidence- based governance can facilitate the incorporation of local context and potentially lead to more informed planning decisions.
2,"geospatial applications for land resource mapping, monitoring and modelling provide key data underpinning natural resources management planning (nrm)."
2,"the current generation of free and open source (fos) geospatial software and free data has re- moved the need for licensing and data purchase, which was a signiﬁcant barrier to broader involvement in land resource mapping, monitoring and modelling for local gov- ernments."
2,advances in computing hardware have enabled use of sophisticated spatial analytical tools on standard laptops.
2,"furthermore the increasing availability of free satel- lite imagery, elevation data and raster based spatial analysis software is providing new opportunities for community stakeholders to combine the quantitative analysis of ‘hard’ data with qualitative local knowledge (fuller, 2006; spiegel et al., 2012)."
2,mccall and dunne (2012) determined ﬁve criteria to evaluate contribution of partic- ipatory gis (pgis) to good governance: 1. strengthening legitimacy through participation; 2. creating respect for and legitimising local knowledge; 3. developing equity within communities and between communities and governments; 4. demonstrating competence; and 5. creating accountability.
2,this paper explores the evolving potential for ‘hi-tech’ raster analysis tools to con- verge with the aspirations of participatory gis for increasing local capacity and improved governance in the developing world.
2,"in summary, the centralized analysis of satellite image and elevation data to support local planning often results in outputs being misinterpreted by the producers; not fully understood by the consumers and not addressing locally relevant concerns."

3,"to investigate this, case studies in eastern indonesia are presented to demonstrate the application of raster based spatial analysis tools by local government and ngos."
3,the potential for con- tribution to improved natural resources management in each of the case studies are assessed using the criteria for participatory mapping to contribute to good governance following mccall and dunne (2012).
3,case studies focus on the use of satellite imagery for mapping and monitoring and the application of digital elevation models for topo- graphic and hydrological modelling.
3,natural resource management in eastern indonesia indonesia moved towards decentralized governance in 1999 through the regional au- tonomy program which has devolved power to over 400 local government districts (kabupaten).
3,"these districts are now responsible for managing a range of essential ser- vices including health, education, infrastructure and environment (holtzappel & ramstedt, 2009; fitrani et al., 2005)."
3,"while management responsibilities have been given, technical capacity remains low, and districts are largely reliant on remote ‘experts’ (central government or consultants) for the provision of planning and technical information."
3,"this lack of capacity is of particular concern in eastern indonesia which suffers from slow economic development and high rates of poverty due largely to: 1. harsh climatic conditions; 2. inadequate infrastructure; 3. poor access to markets (booth, 2004)."
3,"as a result, most of eastern indonesia is classiﬁed as ‘underdeveloped’ by the central government (kementerian dpdtt, 2015)."
3,"in addition, low local revenue has led to a reliance on central government funding to support development activities."
3,this means a degree of planning power has been transferred back to the central government where decisions are made about what and how development projects are funded.
3,"a lack of ac- curate, reliable, current local data and analysis skills reduces the ability of local govern- ments to participate in the planning process and negotiate funding and planning arrangements."
3,"this is a signiﬁcant issue in eastern indonesia where the seasonally arid and remote conditions are markedly different from western indonesia and pose develop- ment problems poorly understood by ‘experts’ from the wet, fertile and densely popu- lated western regions."
3,"in eastern indonesia three key problems have been observed particularly with regards to natural resource mapping: 1. data provided to districts according to needs perceived by central government does not always meet the actual local needs; 2. mapping is provided only in image format, often at a scale too coarse for practical planning; and 3. the source data, analysis methods and levels of accuracy for derived data products are rarely provided."
3,"the following case studies demonstrate the potential for the local government and ngos to undertake their own analysis to solve problems they have identiﬁed, using fos geospatial applications and free data."

4,"the districts of ntt province are some of the driest in indonesia, with a short wet season (3 5 months), variable and relatively low mean annual rainfall."
4,"food security is an increasing challenge with a growing population highly dependent on agriculture, and greater variability in rainfall projected under climate change scenarios."
4,"south east sulawesi, whilst less poor than ntt, is similarly remote with minimal infrastructure and low levels of decentralized ca- pacity."
4,"however, south east sulawesi is rich in mineral and forest resources that leave it open to exploitation by external forces without effective local oversight."
4,methods examples of analysis of free data using open source software are presented as case studies to demonstrate the applicability in a development context and provide practical examples of the potential contributions to good governance.
4,"all the examples presented in this paper have been developed following joint capacity building activities between local government, ngo’s and universities in eastern indonesia and northern australia."

6,effective gover- nance and regulation of mining requires capacity in mapping and monitoring of asm to enable understanding of the potential downstream sediment and contaminant ﬂows of mining.
6,this is critical for assessing and managing the potential environmental and public health impacts.
6,context artisanal gold mining began in the south east sulawesi district of bombana with a ‘rush’ in late 2008.
6,"from september 2008 until april 2009, ofﬁcial records show that more than 63,000 people ﬂooded into the district from neighbouring areas and beyond the province (zulkarnain, 2010)."
6,environmental damage has been widespread with in- creased erosion and river sedimentation from river bank and alluvial mining; the con- version of forest land and markedly reduced downstream river ﬂows and water quality.
6,particular concerns involve the long term health impacts from the use of mer- cury in processing the gold.
6,"method in this case study, two key spatial analyses were undertaken by staff from a local ngo to help understand the impact of the small-scale gold mining in bombana."
6,these analyses were: 1. mapping of the current land cover to determine the distribution and extent of mining in re- lation to surrounding land use; 2. sediment ﬂow modelling to show the extent of potential off-site mining impacts.
6,the land cover mapping was conducted by analysing landsat 8 imagery using an ob- ject based image analysis technique to segment the satellite image into regions of similar spectral statistical classes.
6,"using saga, the image was segmented and grouped into spec- tral class polygons."
6,these polygons were then manually assigned broad spectral land cover classes by visual image interpretation based on ﬁeld experience.
6,"finally, the poly- gons were reclassiﬁed into cover sub-classes based on their spatial context and pattern."
6,"for example, the spectral forest class was divided into forest and mangroves based on proximity to the ocean and estuarine waterways."
6,the ﬂow path modelling was con- ducted using srtm dem data using the ﬂow path module.
6,"this analysis was conducted using the multiple flow direction algorithm (freeman, 1991) and used the mine site classiﬁcation to deﬁne the sediment source grid cells."
6,gis outputs the land cover mapping showed that 16km2 of land had been affected by gold mining.
6,"based on this, subsequent sediment ﬂow modelling suggests that 23 km2 of rice ﬁelds and 27 km2 of aquaculture in the estuarine mangroves could be impacted by the min- ing residue, including mercury and cyanide contamination (see figure 2)."
6,"in addition, whilst mining had occurred in a relatively discrete area, the ﬂow path modelling showed that mining was impacting two catchments with outﬂow points separated by over 70 km of coastline."

7,"the modelled ﬂow of potentially toxic sediments through rice ﬁelds and into an extensive aquaculture region, clearly showed off site impacts in need of consideration."
7,"in addition, the modelling showed the mining sediment ﬂowing through two separate catchments with outﬂow points distant from one another, poten- tially affecting two unrelated communities."
7,only one of these catchments was previously considered as impacted.
7,this mapping increased the legitimacy of concerns around pub- lic health from mercury use in artisanal gold mining and was used to guide subsequent environmental mercury concentration sampling and testing.
7,the ability to produce such mapping and modelling at a local level and its potential for ongoing monitoring of arti- sanal and larger mining activities is helping to create accountability for these operations in the future.

9,"the regulated methods rely on dated secondary data with analysis undertaken by external and remote consultants producing misleading soil loss metrics (kemhut, 2011)."
9,the most signiﬁcant immediate outcome from the application of rusle in this study was the development of a clear understanding of the parameters and processes used in the calculation.

10,kristianus haleberek seasonal ﬁre mapping uncontrolled ﬁre remains one of the largest natural resource management challenges in the dry savanna landscapes of ntt.
10,high frequency and intense savanna ﬁres are widely understood by local people to have negative environmental and economic impacts as they damage pasture and agro-forestry plantations.
10,"current ofﬁcial ﬁre management agendas in indonesia are strongly focused on forest ﬁres of western indonesia (yong & peh, 2014) with little acknowledgment or research on the savanna ﬁres of the drier eastern regions (russell-smith et al., 2000)."
10,collecting base- line data to understand the extent and frequency of ﬁre is essential for any ﬁre manage- ment program.

10,"the ﬁre mapping showed that, on average, 39 per cent of the catchment or around 1280 km2 was burnt each year."
10,in addition the analysis showed that 34 per cent was burnt more than 10 times over the 15 year period (figure 4).
10,contribution to good governance.
10,"prior to this study no ﬁne scale baseline data existed showing the extent, distribution and frequency of ﬁre in west timor."
10,"the lack of knowledge about ﬁre in this region is further compounded by coarse global ﬁre products that fail to map smaller ﬁres thus effectively hiding signiﬁcant landscape issues (laris, 2005)."
10,"whilst ﬁre is perceived in west timor as a signiﬁcant human-ecological phenomenon, the large proportion burnt (up to 62 per cent in 2014), shown by this mapping was far in excess of that generally recognized."
10,the ﬁre mapping work presented in this study produced by a local analyst provides an authoritative counter to current popular and ofﬁcial conceptions that underestimate the role of ﬁre in these landscapes.
10,in doing so it strengthens legitimacy of local nrm concerns and in turn enhances respect for local knowledge.
10,this mapping is now being used to initiate planning discussions amongst land managers in this catchment creating accountability and transparency in decision making.
10,competence was demonstrated through applying simple and repeatable techniques that will facilitate ongoing ﬁre monitoring programs.
10,new knowledge — combined rusle and ﬁre frequency mapping this analysis revealed a spatial patterning generated from two independent datasets in- dicating that 24km2 of the landscape with high erosion potential has also been character- ized by high ﬁre frequency in recent years (see figure 4).
10,"given the primary erosion control measure promoted by the government is reforestation, identiﬁcation of ﬁre as a risk factor affecting both surface soil erosion and the success of reforestation projects is leading to investigations of ways to improve ﬁre management processes."
10,fire mapping is thus an important baseline dataset informing further ﬁeld investigation into the causes and impacts of ﬁre in this catchment.

11,"in areas where the greatest forest cover change occurred, ﬁeld inspections and infor- mal interviews with local farmers were used to test the validity of the data and to deter- mine the cause of forest cover change."
11,"gis results initial results suggest that forest cover increased overall during the period 1993-2010, then decreased during the subsequent period 2010 2013 (see figure 5), despite ofﬁcial reports that reforestation projects had been successfully implemented and had resulted in an increase in forest cover over this period."
11,interviews with local farmers conﬁrmed the loss of forest cover due to timber harvesting for house building and for sale.
11,contribution to good governance large investments have been made into forestry and reforestation projects across indonesia with both commercial and environmental protection goals.

12,"kristianus haleberek is rarely systematic monitoring of the outcomes of these projects (nawir & rumboko, 2008)."
12,"in this case, forest cover change mapping was undertaken by the local govern- ment planning agency, whose role is to assess and provide funding for all locally funded projects, including reforestation."
12,"the ﬁnding that forest cover was in fact de- creasing motivated the planning agency to seek further understanding of possible causes of deforestation in speciﬁc locations, in order to better understand the issues, creating accountability and transparency for assessing outcomes of these forestry pro- jects."
12,"in addition, the incorporation of local knowledge into the assessment and inter- pretation of the results is strengthening legitimacy and building respect for local knowledge."
12,"as a result of this work the planning agency intends to continue landsat based monitoring to determine appropriate locations for, and evaluate the effectiveness of, reforestation projects."
12,such objective regular monitoring by local agencies is rela- tively easily implemented using landsat producing accurate and meaningfully interpreted data.
12,"discussion whilst open source methods for ﬁre mapping (teodoro & duarte, 2013), land cover mapping (steiniger & hay, 2009) and erosion analysis (hobgen et al., 2014) have pre- viously been described, these studies have largely focused on non-local or centralized research studies rather than for planning purposes."
12,"in contrast, the case studies de- scribed in this paper demonstrate the utility of applying free and open source gis and free spatial data in a decentralized development context."
12,the potential contribu- tion of these case studies to support improved natural resource governance suggest some general principles are assessed more broadly against mccall and dunne’s (2012) criteria as follows: 1.
12,strengthening legitimacy – the legitimacy of spatial data is strengthened by decentralized pro- duction through two primary mechanisms: a. the selection of appropriate data for spatial analysis at useful scales to provide levels re- quired to meet speciﬁc local planning needs; and b. the application of local knowledge for interpreting analysis outputs leading to clearer identiﬁcation of errors or inconsistencies.
12,this community participation in the production process leads to a sense of ownership and better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of outputs.
12,this in turn can enable more appropriate and effective use of the spatial data as a planning tool.
12,"whilst local agen- cies may not have the same ﬁnancial or human resources for conducting some specialized forms of spatial or hydrological analyses, in many situations local applications are likely to produce more useful and affordable planning data."
12,"creating respect for local knowledge — whilst remote sensing and terrain modelling appli- cations do not directly incorporate indigenous and local knowledge, local government agencies are more likely to incorporate regional understanding of the landscape into their analyses."
12,"this allows for spatial data to be placed in a historic, social and environ- mental contexts and thus incorporate signiﬁcant cultural and political inﬂuences on land use planning."
12,"developing equity — raster based modelling and analysis, when used as a tool for creat- ing more accurate, locally owned data, can assist in redressing the power imbalance be- tween central government authorities and local agencies."
12,"it adds authority and legitimacy to their understanding of the environment and nrm concerns, and builds skills and conﬁdence, enabling critical evaluation of data and planning recommenda- tions generated by external assessments."
12,this was highlighted as a signiﬁcant outcome by all the government participants engaged in the work.
13,"14679493, 2018, 1, downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sjtg.12210 by university of california, wiley online library on [29/04/2024]."

13,"demonstrating competence — approaches using fos software for analysis of free data enable local government staff to produce and manage their own data, in accordance with their needs."
13,data can easily be updated using the same methods to provide comparable data sets and interrogated in different ways for emerging requirements.
13,creating accountability — locally created and owned maps can contribute to increased trans- parency in decision making processes by building skills to allow lower level agencies to crit- ically assess programs and outcomes.
13,"where the use of external agencies and restricted or expensive data is required, an understanding of the basic principles and techniques of re- mote sensing and gis can enable local government to conduct a more informed assessment of the accuracy and utility of mapping provided and to ensure that consultants are obliged to provide data in a gis format."
13,"in addition to the governance beneﬁts described above, there are a range of technical advantages to choosing fos gis software."
13,"in contrast to commercial packages, open source software are consistently more secure, reliable, and adaptable (casson & ryan, 2006; krogh & hippel 2006; holck et al., 2005; hwang, 2005)."
13,"the open-source community-led development model, in which a diverse community of developers and users work together for the longer-term beneﬁt of an application, builds more robust, targeted and responsive applications."
13,"developer communities generally produce more regular updates ﬁxing bugs, improving stability and maintaining relevance."
13,open source software also allows easy customisation to ﬁt speciﬁc application contexts and cross plat- form interoperability.
13,"fos gis software shares many of these advantages (steiniger & hay, 2009)."
13,"saga- gis, for example, was developed primarily as a platform to support ongoing geospatial research and development."
13,"saga is developed by users for users and is constantly up- dated by developers and the user community, keeping it relevant with cutting edge geospatial research."
13,"currently saga offers more than 700 geo-scientiﬁc modules responding to scientiﬁc questions and needs (conrad et al., 2015)."
13,this ﬂexibility and re- sponsiveness allows fos gis software to quickly and seamlessly incorporate tailor made functionality to facilitate speciﬁc processes or to address particular nrm issues.
13,"this de- velopment model has resulted in fos gis platforms not only at the cutting edge of sci- ence, but which are simultaneously simple to install and apply in remote, resource poor contexts."
13,"indeed from a donor or development program perspective, the cost ben- eﬁt of supporting fos applications, where an application or plugin once built is freely available to all, has considerable global and long term beneﬁts."
13,much of the developing world’s gis work is currently conducted using pirated copies of commercial software.
13,"in indonesia for example, many universities and government agencies rely on unlicensed commercial gis software."
13,"the decision to use commercial software is based on the false assumption that it is better than the open source alterna- tives, even though ‘cracked’ gis applications are difﬁcult to install, often unstable and have limited access to software updates."
13,"it also follows, due to the ubiquity of unlicensed gis in many developing countries, development programs not promoting fos gis soft- ware are implicitly supporting the continued use of illegal software."
13,"to overcome this, fos gis software should be promoted as a legitimate tool in both local government and universities."
13,"signiﬁcantly indonesia’s national mapping authority (badan informasi geospatial) has acknowledged the potential contribution of fos gis software through implementing the national law (ri, 2011) that actively supports fos geospatial use."
13,"whilst an important step, this law, due to a lack of an integrated program to support and legitimize fos use, so far seems to have had minimal impact on the culture of gis teaching and use in indonesia."

14,"kristianus haleberek despite the obvious beneﬁts of open source software, three of the most commonly cited drawbacks are that it is has: 1. under-developed user interface; 2. poor user support; and 3. limited documentation and training material (steiniger & bocher, 2009)."
14,"firstly in contrast with some open source software, the user interfaces of most fos gis software packages are comparable to their commercial counterparts."
14,for saga- gis the deployment of many spatial operations is easier than for many other packages after the basic format logic is learnt.
14,"secondly, user support for open source software is largely provided by the developer team and supported by the user community."
14,"consequently, as the number of users in- creases, so does the support base."
14,"the large increase in the number of users for fos gis software worldwide (steiniger & bocher, 2009) has improved access to support through user forums in many different languages."
14,"developers of open source software also often rely on user feedback via forums for improvements, thus they are responsive to user questions."
14,local language forums have also been developed using social media as a fast and effective tool for communicating with other local users.
14,"finally, one signiﬁcant remaining barrier for implementation of fos gis software and free data approaches is a lack of clear, comprehensive training material."
14,"in order to support decentralized application, training material needs to be produced that: 1. utilizes free data; 2. is contextualized to local nrm issues; 3. results in data that meet local needs and central government reporting requirements; and 4. is produced in appropriate languages."
14,conclusion it is clear from the case studies presented in this paper that the emerging range of free raster based spatial analysis tools and data can contribute to improved natural resource management in a decentralized developing world context.
14,"the assessment presented suggests that active advocacy and ongoing support for the use of fos gis capacity could: 1. build legitimacy in the outputs through participation; 2. support equity, competence and accountability by developing skills; 3. contribute to a common global resource pool of training material; 4. legitimise the use of fos gis tools; and 5. help build a larger legal geospatial industry in the developing world."
14,"considering these potential beneﬁts, it could be argued that all rural development and nrm programs creating new spatial data in less developed countries should include support for fos gis applications, collaborative mapping and monitoring."
14,"whilst more work needs to be done to demonstrate long term impacts, this paper has demonstrated potential beneﬁts of investing in training materials distributed in an open access format and on ground capacity building."
14,this enables local government agencies to perform their own mapping and monitoring to improve governance of natural re- sources.
14,support for software and training material development and the wider adoption of these tools requires advocacy from funding organisations involved in natural resource management projects.
