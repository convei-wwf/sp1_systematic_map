6,"because the highest natural elevation in the county is about 21 feet, the county is highly subject to storm surge, which can flood densely populated low-lying areas along the coast."
6,the reach of storm surge is highly dependent both on distance from the shoreline and on elevation.
6,"emergency management officials reasoned that if they could create a more accurate topographic model than they had previously possessed, they might be able to reduce the number of people it was necessary to evacuate prior to a hurricane actually coming ashore in the county from the 425,000 previously estimated."
6,"not only would a reduction in the number of evacuees reduce the stress on the population, it would save the county government and citizens significant costs."
6,certain facilities are particularly expensive to evacuate.
6,"for example, the county is home to a dozen hospitals, each one of which could cost up to $100,000 to evacuate in advance of a storm, not to mention the indefinable costs of mental and physical stress experienced by patients and their families."
6,broward county officials contracted with florida international university to develop a very accurate digital elevation model of the county based on elevation data acquired using an airborne laser sensor.
6,"the laser data were used to create a grid of elevation values every 2 meters, covering the urban area."
6,"the resulting model, when evaluated by a storm surge model for a category 4-5 storm, enabled broward county to reduce the number of potential evacuees from about 450,000 to approximately 250,000."
6,both estimates include residents of mobile homes.
6,this has resulted in a significant reduction of future costs to the county and its citizens.
6,"in the future, broward county will extend and improve the storm surge analysis by incorporating off shore bathymetry data it has recently acquired."
