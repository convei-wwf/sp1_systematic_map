4,this analysis does not attempt to determine the beneﬁts and costs of performing geospatial-data applications.
4,"rather, it estimates the change in the differences between those beneﬁts and costs with the national map and the current situation without it."
4,"the estimates of total costs and beneﬁts of the national map were based on the projected implementation time, development and maintenance costs, rates of data inclusion and integration, expected usage levels over time, and a beneﬁts estimation model."
4,"the national map provides data that are current, integrated, consistent, complete, and more accessible in order to decrease the cost of implementing spatial-data applications and (or) improve the outcome of those applications."
4,"the efﬁciency gains in per-application improvements are greater than the cost to develop and maintain the national map, meaning that the program would bring a positive net beneﬁt to the nation."
4,the average improvement in the net beneﬁt of performing a spatial data application was multiplied by a simulated number of application implementations across the country.
4,"the numbers of users, existing applications, and rates of application implementation increase over time as the national map is developed and accessed by spatial data users around the country."
4,"results from the “most likely” estimates of model parameters and data inputs indicate that, over its 30-year projected lifespan, the national map will bring a net present value (npv) of beneﬁts of $2.05 billion in 2001 dollars."
4,the average time until the initial investments (the break-even period) are recovered is 14 years.
4,table es-1 shows a running total of npv in each year of the simulation model.
4,"in year 14, the national map ﬁrst shows a positive npv, and so the table is highlighted in gray after that point."
4,figure es-1 is a graph of the total beneﬁt and total cost curves of a single model run over time.
4,"the curves cross in year 14, when the project breaks even."
4,a sensitivity analysis of the input variables illustrated that these results of the npv of the national map are quite robust.
4,"figure es-2 plots the mean npv results from 60 different scenarios, each consisting of ﬁfty 30-year runs."
4,the error bars represent a two-standard-deviation range around each mean.
4,"the analysis that follows contains the details of the cost-beneﬁt analysis, the framework for evaluating economic beneﬁts, a computational simulation tool, and a sensitivity analysis of model variables and values."

5,a graph of the accumulating ben- efits (blue) and costs (red) of the national map over 30 years.
5,the break-even point is where the curves cross (year 14).
5,the kink in the cost curve is the change from development costs to maintenance costs only.
5,"note the slow upward climb of the benefit curve until the project nears completion, when most of the country’s spatial-data users have had time to see valuable data, adopt the national map as their data source for existing tasks, and innovate new applications for spatial data."

20,break even follows just a few years thereafter at the point the curves cross.
20,the slow growth in early years may seem surprising unless the dynamics of the simulation model are examined.
20,"the national map takes time to build and populate with data, meaning that in the early years, very few county-level users see data that is relevant to them and can make the transition from a non-national map county to a national map user."
20,"once there, they make use of only a small fraction of the small number of applications we assume exist and are national map-enabled."
20,"the innovation of new applications is dependent on how many counties have made that initial transition, and so grows slowly also."
20,"at the outset, most of the users are in tier 3, meaning that they have access to the smallest number of initial applications."
20,"users at all tier levels have had little time to adopt and implement many of the existing applications, because the cumulative diffusion fraction is still low."
20,all of these lead to a very small number of application implementa- tions in the early years of the program.
20,"as the national map nears completion in year 10, many things change."
20,"assuming adequate years of funding were pro- vided for development, by year 10, all counties have become users of the national map data and distribution system."

26,a cost-benefit analysis 17 appendix a.
26,formal economic theory the national map is an on-line database and provider of geospatial information that is a pure public good.
26,"as a public good, the intent of the national map is to not exclude anyone from the benefits of its use and to supply geospatial information at virtually no cost."
26,"as shown in equation 1 in section 2, the net benefits of the national map are specified as the value-in-use of the information available."
26,"the value of information is a function of the spatial and temporal applications of digital spatial data and is measured in terms of applications (that is, cost savings, value added, and (or) new uses)."
26,"the willingness to pay for applications using the national map is assumed to be increasing at a decreasing rate: ��������� � � �������� ��������� ��� ���� �� ��� where s is the national map user-tiers, and voitnm is the value in use of the geospatial data that is dependent on the tier of the user and the availability of the national map: � ������������������� ���� where s = g(tnm) where tnm refers to the national map program."
26,"note that the order of progression of tier advancement is tier 3 ‡ tier 2 ‡ tier 1, and that an increase in tier sophistication does in fact result in a tier name with a lower number (for example, a tier 2 county becomes a tier 1 county, thus increasing its capability but lowering the numeral in its name)."
26,the national map is specified in both terms in equation a2 as (1) the increased efficiency from using the national map in cur- rent applications (as a function of s = g(tnm) and (2) the innovative applications that arise from being a national map partner f(tnm).
26,the willingness to pay for the national map is a derived demand.
26,"to find the marginal willingness to pay for the national map, totally differentiate voi into its components: ����������������������� ������ ���� ��������� �� ������ ������ ���� ��� ��� ���� ������ ������ ��� ������ ������ ds the term represents the advancement rate for the national map users to change tiers. d(tnm) ∂(voitnm) the term represents the fraction of the expected applications’ beneﬁts associated with the implementation of the ∂(tnm) national map and represents the derived demand for the national map."
26,we assume that increased collaboration with the usgs—as in data-sharing partnerships—in the national map increases the capability and facility with spatial data more quickly than a nonpartner data user.
26,"a partnership is defined as an acceptance of standards, data sharing, and so on."
