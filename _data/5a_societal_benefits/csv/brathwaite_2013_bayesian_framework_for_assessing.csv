1,this work 18 october 2012 posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through accepted 24 october 2012 the value of information these systems provide.
1,"to this effect, a bayesian framework is available online 3 december 2012 developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, keywords: and stakeholders as information recipients."
1,"information has value to stakeholders as it spacecraft design helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher information value expected pay-offs than in the absence of information."
1,this increase in expected pay-offs bayesian framework is ascribed to the value of the system.
1,"based on this idea, a new metric, value-of-design unpriced system (vod), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services."
1,"the bayesian framework assesses the value-of-design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions."
1,the framework here developed is then applied to the case of an earth science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the gulf of mexico.

1,"results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difﬁcult to justify the acquisition of the system."
