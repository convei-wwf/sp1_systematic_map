1,"such received in revised form evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in 26 february 2014 ofﬁcial statistics; social beneﬁts, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts accepted 1 march 2014 available online 8 july 2014 from r&d are complex and occur in the long term."
1,"however, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts."
1,the full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a ‘bottom-up’ and a ‘top-down’ perspective.
1,"in the bottom-up perspective, each keywords: space investments effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the impacts effects."
1,"although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields evaluation both detailed and integrated results."
1,our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts.
1,"next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identiﬁed, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies."
1,"finally, sugges- tions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard."
1,the core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost beneﬁt analysis.
1,"effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values."
1,"for effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion."
1,"our core recom- mendations are to clearly deﬁne the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies."
1,"social, strategic and environmental impacts deserve special attention, aiming at a more comprehensive coverage of impacts."
