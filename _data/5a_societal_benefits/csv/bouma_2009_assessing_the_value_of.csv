2,decision making under uncertainty case of dutch water quality management in the north sea.
2,"at present, in their seminal paper on the economics of information, water quality in the north sea is monitored through ‘in situ’ hirshleifer and riley (1979) provide a theoretical framework for measurements."
2,extending this system with satellite observations analyzing the role of information when decision-makers are would increase the temporal and geographical coverage of water uncertain about ‘the state of the world’ (event uncertainty).

2,"if outcomes from excessive algal blooms (see the review by stumpf and tomlin- are uncertain, decision-makers base their decisions on the expected son, 2005)."
2,"also, investing in satellite observation could make a more utility of the outcomes instead."
2,"this expected utility depends on systematic monitoring of turbidity possible, which could help enforce the perceived probability of the different ‘states of the world’, or the environmental regulations regarding sea-water clarity around expected probability that a certain outcome will be reached1. economic activities (construction, sand mining) in the north sea."
2,"table 1 presents the decision problem for two potential actions to evaluate the beneﬁts of satellite observation for dutch water (x ¼ 1,2) and two possible states of the world (s ¼ 1,2)."
2,"as hirshleifer quality management we use an empirical, stakeholder-oriented and riley (1979) express it: the decision-maker chooses among approach."
2,"we develop a methodological framework, based on actions, while nature may be metaphorically said to choose among bayesian decision theory, evaluating the role of information in the states."
2,"the consequences (or outcomes), cx,s, of the actions, differ context of decision making under conditions of uncertainty."
2,"based depending on the ‘state of the world’. on the work of schimmelpfennig and norton (2003) and morgan formally, the expected utility of action x can be expressed as, et al.

3,"states in fact, there are three factors that determine the value of s¼1 s¼2 utility of the acts information (hirshleifer and riley, 1979)."
3,"first, it depends on the conﬁdence decision-makers have in their beliefs."

3,"second, it depends theoretical framework of hirshleifer and riley (1979) is applicable, on the extent to which the decision-maker expects the information if we assume that the (public) decision-maker maximizes social, to be true."
3,"as in statistical signiﬁcance testing, an informational instead of individual, returns."
3,"we will come back to this assumption message can be false in two ways: the message can incorrectly when elaborating our empirical approach. reject the ‘true’ state, and it can fail to reject the ‘false’ state."
3,"in decision theory, the former error is called a type i error and the 2.1.2."
3,the value of information latter error is called a type ii error.
3,"if the perceived errors are large, using the framework developed by hirshleifer and riley (1979) the value of the information will, clearly, be less."
3,"third, it depends requires a couple of steps."
3,"first, the impact of an informational upon the content of the information: the more surprising the message on decision-making needs to be assessed."
3,"this depends on informational message, or the larger the difference with the the extent to which the decision-maker uses the information to existing belief, the greater the likelihood that the prior belief will be update his beliefs regarding the ‘state of the world’."
3,"a formal way of updated (hirshleifer and riley, 1979; lybbert et al., 2006). expressing the process of belief updating is reﬂected in the well- known bayes theorem2: 2.1.3."

3,"one of the few studies that have attempted prior probability, or the belief before the additional information, to empirically estimate prior and posterior probabilities is the study qm,s the conditional probability of receiving message m given state s by schimmelpfennig and norton (2003)."
3,"to evaluate the value of (the likelihood of receiving message m given state s), and qm the agricultural economics research, schimmelpfennig and norton unconditional probability of receiving informational message m. asked senior policy makers about their perceptions of the payoffs, the unconditional probability of receiving message m is related to measured in terms of economic surplus estimates, n(cxs), prior the conditional probabilities (of receiving message m in state s) by: probabilities, ps, and the likelihoods of new research producing s ‘‘true’’ messages, qm,s."
3,"on the basis of this information, they were x qm ¼ qm;s ps (3) able to calculate the value of agricultural economics research in s¼1 a number of case studies, such as a crop insurance program and a food safety program. hence, whether an informational message succeeds in making this paper builds on the approach of schimmelpfennig and decision-makers change their belief function depends upon the norton, using stakeholder consultation to estimate the extent to decision-makers prior belief regarding the possible ‘states of the which decision-makers actually use geo information to update world’ and the perceived accuracy of the informational message, or their beliefs."
3,in section 2.2 we further elaborate our approach. the likelihood of receiving message m given state s.
3,"subsequently, with the ‘updated beliefs’ the decision-maker 2.2."
3,the empirical approach might choose a different action than what he would have chosen with his prior beliefs.
3,"the ‘value’ of message m is simply the although schimmelpfennig and norton (2003) suggest that it is difference between the utilities of the actions that is chosen given sufﬁcient to consult one or two key decision-makers to estimate message m (xm) and the action that would have been chosen prior and posterior belief functions, there are two reasons why we without additional information (x0): believe that it is important to consult a wider range."

3,"a rational decision- 3 maker would invest in informational services if his or her schimmelpfennig and norton (2003) suggest that if decision-making is stra- tegic, or if more than one decision-making center is involved, explicit attention should be paid to the political weight of the different decision-making centers."
3,"in the case of dutch water quality management, decision-making is strongly con- 2 there is actually more work on bayesian decision theory in environmental sensus-based."
3,"hence, we do not explicitly account for the political weight of the management, even if few of those deal with the value of information directly (see, different decision-making centers but instead assume that in the decision-making for example, ellison, 1996; varis and kuikka, 1999). process the views and interests of the different actors are accounted for."
