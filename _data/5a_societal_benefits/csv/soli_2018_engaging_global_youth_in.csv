1,"we document how our approach centered on creating a global malaria academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader eﬀorts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the united states agency for international development (usaid)."
1,this approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting speciﬁc needs for geographic information to speciﬁc development objectives in targeted places where usaid works to end extreme poverty.
1,we discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory gis (pgis) and volunteered geographic information (vgi).
1,we demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in mozambique and kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health.
1,"throughout these eﬀorts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to oﬀer opportunities for youth volunteer embedd- edness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from diﬀerent countries."
