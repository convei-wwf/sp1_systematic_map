2,the baer team then recommends mitigation measures to help offset potential threats from secondary post-fire effects.
2,"over the past several decades, federal forest and land managers have used a variety of information sources to determine the sbs in areas affected by wildfire."
2,understanding the sbs in these areas can help managers prioritise post-wildfire response activities.
2,"there are a variety of platforms that provide remotely sensed data, including high or midlevel resolution satellite imagery and aircraft.1 the data also can be gathered directly in the field."
