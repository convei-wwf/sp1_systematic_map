Title = {Long Range Correlation in Vegetation Over West Africa From 1982 to 2011},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {119151-119165},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) data
   records offer important sources for long term correlation modelling over
   West Africa. In this study, we assessed long range correlations in half
   monthly NDVI records over West Africa from 1982 to 2011 using GIMMS
   NDVI. In our analysis, we assessed (a) the annual and seasonal trends
   obtained using Ordinary Linear Regression, (b) the detrended
   lag-1-autocorrelation C(1), (c) the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
   scaling Hurst exponent h and (d) the Multifractal (MF) characteristics
   of NDVI. Results show that there exist some patterns or trends in the
   records that persist over time. The value of C(1) for NDVI was obtained
   as 0.989 is significant at 95\% confidence interval. Consequently, the
   scaling h values of the Hurst DFA showed that about 37.4, 20.5, 41.7 and
   0.5\% of the vegetated areas are anti-correlated (h < 0.5),
   un-correlated (h = 0.5), correlated (0 :5 < h < 1) and uncorrelated
   random walk (h = 1), respectively. The trend analysis from Ordinary
   Least square Regression (OLR) shows that about 54.3, 0.1 and 45.6\% of
   the vegetated areas are positively, uncorrelated and negatively
   correlated, respectively. Our findings revealed that the DFA method
   performed better than OLR and the findings could be useful in
   identifying areas with improved and degraded vegetation, which cannot be
   properly captured by the OLR method. Accordingly, the comparison of the
   MF-DFA results of original data to those of shuffled and surrogate
   series indicated that the multifractal nature of considered time-series
   is both from PDF and long-range correlations but arguably, MF due to
   long range correlation dominates over West Africa. The research is
   therefore helpful in the formulating crop and environmental management
   policies that may be used to improve ecosystem management using a long
   term plan (inter-annual) or short term (inter-seasonal) planning.},

Title = {Incremental Production of Urban Public Green Space: A `Spiral Space'
   Building Typology},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper addresses a challenging global problem, insufficient
   accessible urban public green space, based on building typology.
   Offering sufficient public green spaces and maintaining the equalities
   of citizens' accessibility in high-intensity urban cities has been
   increasingly challenging. Thus, providing adequate and accessible green
   public spaces by 2030 is a sub-goal of SDGs No. 11. Solving this urban
   problem is commonly considered the responsibility of urban planning;
   however, the potential of buildings is scarcely discussed in academia.
   Luckily, in the industry, many top architecture firms (studios) have
   tapped the particular potential of buildings via design practice. This
   practice-led research aims to understand the efforts made by industrial
   circles. Based on the fieldwork worldwide, this study proposes a `spiral
   space' building typology to work as a conceptual framework for this
   emerging field. The key benefit of this building typology-incremental
   production of public green spaces-is qualitatively verified, and the
   good flexibility and international acceptance of this building typology
   are demonstrated based on global cases. This work could serve as a basis
   for future research on how buildings could play a greater role in
   supporting urban sustainability, such as enhancing the residents'
   accessibility to public green space in metropolises. In addition, the
   building typology and corresponding design strategies discussed herein
   could also serve as references for future design practice for
   architects.},

Title = {Drivers of Land Use Change in Lantapan, Bukidnon, Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been the key in addressing the growing
   demand for food production both for home consumption and supplying the
   market. The market demand on agricultural production has therefore
   triggered change in land use. For farmers, it makes a lot of economic
   sense to venture on high value agricultural products where land and
   labor capital is limited
   This study provided a temporal analysis that would describe the land use
   changes in Barangay Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, with emphasis on the
   driving forces and how they influence the farming decision of farmers.
   Participatory mapping and focused group discussion were conducted with
   selected farmer-residents, and a satellite image to generate the
   historical land use map of barangay Songco. Maps were digitized and land
   areas were computed using the ArcGis9 field calculator to derive the
   estimated area occupied by a certain land use.
   Land use change in Songco is influenced by a high demand of agricultural
   products. Furthermore, inappropriate farming systems such as up and down
   planting that vegetable growers practice has caused severe soil erosion,
   leading to the decline on crop yield due to the removal of soil
   nutrients. Moreover, the off-site effect of soil erosion are siltation
   and sedimentation which carry traces of pesticides and chemical
   contaminants into water bodies which are likely to degrade water quality
   and may create health problems for farm families and those living
   downstream (Coxhead et. al. 2005).},

Title = {Mapping peat thickness and carbon stock of a degraded peatland in West
   Sumatra, Indonesia},
Journal = {SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 17},
Abstract = {Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon
   sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2
   emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of
   these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations,
   leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect
   and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and
   carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National
   Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to
   assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra,
   which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation.
   Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat
   thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use
   change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by
   peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey,
   resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and
   subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics,
   machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat
   thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The
   covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance
   from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through
   10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the
   best performance, with an R-2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for
   carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be
   attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which
   disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and
   environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107
   Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment
   of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017
   Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the
   degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the
   past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making
   and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands.},

Title = {Pregnant women and infants as sentinel populations to monitor prevalence
   of malaria: results of pilot study in Lake Zone of Tanzania},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Background: As malaria control interventions are scaled-up, rational
   approaches are needed for monitoring impact over time. One proposed
   approach includes monitoring the prevalence of malaria infection among
   pregnant women and children at the time of routine preventive health
   facility (HF) visits. This pilot explored the feasibility and utility of
   tracking the prevalence of malaria infection in pregnant women attending
   their first antenatal care (ANC) visit and infants presenting at 9-12
   months of age for measles vaccination.
   Methods: Pregnant women attending first ANC and infants nine to 12
   months old presenting for measles vaccination at a non-probability
   sample of 54 HFs in Tanzania's Lake Zone (Mara, Mwanza and Kagera
   Regions) were screened for malaria infection using a malaria rapid
   diagnostic test (RDT) from December 2012 to November 2013, regardless of
   symptoms. Participants who tested positive were treated for malaria per
   national guidelines. Data were collected monthly.
   Results: Overall 89.9 and 78.1 \% of expected monthly reports on malaria
   infection prevalence were received for pregnant women and infants,
   respectively. Among 51,467 pregnant women and 35,155 infants attending
   routine preventive HF visits, 41.2 and 37.3 \% were tested with RDT,
   respectively. Malaria infection prevalence was 12.8 \% {[}95 \%
   confidence interval (CI) 11.3-14.3] among pregnant women and 11.0 \% (95
   \% CI 9.5-12.5) among infants, and varied by month. There was good
   correlation of the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women and
   infants at the HF level (Spearman rho = 0.6; p < 0.001). This approach
   is estimated to cost \$1.28 for every person tested, with the RDT
   accounting for 72 \% of the cost.
   Conclusions: Malaria infection was common and well correlated among
   pregnant women and infants attending routine health services. Routine
   screening of these readily accessible populations may offer a practical
   strategy for continuously tracking malaria trends, particularly seasonal
   variation. Positivity rates among afebrile individuals presenting for
   routine care offer an advantage as they are unaffected by the prevalence
   of other causes of febrile illness, which could influence positivity
   rates among febrile patients presenting to outpatient clinics. The data
   presented here suggest that in addition to contributing to clinical
   management, ongoing screening of pregnant women could be used for
   routine surveillance and detection of hotspots.},

Abstract = {Shanghai is a metropolis with the fastest growing economy and the
   largest economic aggregate in China. In this paper, some change
   detection methods were used for assessment of urbanization and ecosystem
   changes. The urbanization area index (UAI) which is derived from land
   cover is used to reflect the speed of urban expansion, while the
   fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) which is retrieved from NDVI is used
   to represent the status of urban ecosystem. The NDVI time series were
   derived from MOD13Q1 by using an annual stacking approach. Land cover
   maps were retrieved from annual NDVI time series from 2000 to 2009. This
   paper focused on assessment study of urbanization level and ecosystem
   changes in Shanghai municipality. Results indicated following: 1) the
   urban area of Shanghai increased continuously in the past 10 years; 2)
   the UAI increased by an annual average rate more than 1.84\%, its peak
   value was 4.36\% during 2008-2009; 3) the urbanization degree of
   Shanghai ran on a high speed in the past decade; 4) on the whole, FVC
   decreased continuously over the past decade, while the FVC of urban area
   increased slightly and the FVC of some islands and outer suburbs
   increased slightly too; 5) the urban ecosystem of Shanghai became more
   and more ``green{''} but at the cost of decreased cropland and natural
   vegetation cover. The assessment of urbanization and ecosystem changes
   suggests that suburban ecosystem protection is an import and urgent
   problem for government to implement more effective environmental
   management policies.},

Title = {Diagnosis of Nitrogen Nutrition in Sugar Beet Based on the
   Characteristics of Scanned Leaf Images},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Sugar beet is an important economic crop in Northwest China. In this
   area, efficient use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has become crucial due to
   decreased profits associated with both under- and oversupply relative to
   sugar beet requirements. Thus, fast and non-destruction diagnostic tools
   for estimating plant N status have an important role in reducing N
   inputs while maintaining sugar beet yield and qualify. The objective of
   our study was to quantify leaf color characterization of sugar beet with
   an inexpensive scanner and establish the relationship with yield, leaf
   nitrogen content (LNC), plant total nitrogen content (PTNC), chlorophyll
   content (CC), soil nitrate nitrogen content (SNNC) and soil plant
   analysis development (SPAD) readings in sugar beet. In 2017 and 2018,
   field experiments were conducted with five N treatments ranging from 0
   to 180 kg N ha(-1). The main results showed the following: The SPAD
   readings (SPR) and CC exhibited a significant or highly significant
   correlation (maximum = 0.70, P < 0.01), both of which reflected well the
   N nutrient status of the entire plant. Furtherly, a detailed association
   analysis revealed that there was a close relationship (maximum = - 0.63,
   P < 0.01) of LNC, SPR, PTNC, CC and yield with leaf color parameter
   Red/Blue (R/B), which was recommended as leaf color parameters for N
   diagnosis in sugar beet. In addition, based on the distribution of R/B
   value under different N rate, the yield was low with greater R/B value
   than 1.36 indicating an insufficient N supply, and with the R/B value
   was lower than 1.36, the theoretical yield reached its peak indicating
   an adequate supply of N fertilizer. To summarize, compared to the
   complicated and expensive of hyperspectral and other remote sensing
   technologies, scanned leaf image (SLI) processing technique was a
   simple, inexpensive and reliable method of determining sugar beet N
   status that has potential as a diagnostic tool for determining crop N
   requirement.},

Title = {Ethno-meteorology and scientific weather forecasting: Small farmers and
   scientists' perspectives on climate variability in the Okavango Delta,
   Botswana},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {4-5},
Pages = {43-58},
Abstract = {Recent trends in abrupt weather changes continue to pose a challenge to
   agricultural production most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper
   specifically addresses the questions on how local farmers read and
   predict the weather; and how they can collaborate with weather
   scientists in devising adaptation strategies for climate variability
   (CV) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Recent trends in
   agriculture-related weather variables available from country's climate
   services, as well as in freely available satellite rainfall products
   were analysed. The utility of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system
   for the study area in the context of supporting farmer's information
   needs were assessed. Through a multi-stage sampling procedure, a total
   of 592 households heads in 8 rural communities in the Okavango Delta
   were selected and interviewed using open and close-ended interview
   schedules. Also, 19 scientists were purposively selected and interviewed
   using questionnaires. Key informant interviews, focus group and
   knowledge validation workshops were used to generate qualitative
   information from both farmers and scientists. Descriptive and
   inferential statistics were used in summarising the data. Analysis of
   satellite rainfall products indicated that there was a consistent
   increase in total annual rainfall throughout the region in the last 10
   years, accompanied by an increase in number of rain days, and reduction
   of duration of dry spells. However, there is a progressive increase in
   the region's temperatures leading to increase in potential evaporation.
   Findings from social surveys show that farmers' age, education level,
   number of years engaged in farming, sources of weather information,
   knowledge of weather forecasting and decision on farming practices
   either had a significant relationship or correlation with their
   perceptions about the nature of both local {[}ethno-meteorological] and
   scientific weather knowledge. Nonetheless, there was a significant
   difference in the mean scores of farmers in relation to their
   perceptions and those of the climate scientists about the nature of both
   local and Western knowledge. As farmers are adept at judging seasonal
   patterns through long-standing ethno-meteorology, one major CV
   adaptation measure is their ability to anticipate changes in future
   weather conditions, which enables them to adjust their farming calendars
   and make decisions on crop type selection in any given season. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of
   economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005
   Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the
   region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out
   which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides
   and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental
   factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient
   Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
   These machine learning models are innovative and can assess
   environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional
   scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and
   validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a
   proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well
   as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial
   database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning
   factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI,
   Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve
   (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under
   the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5\%),
   0.893 (89.3\%), and 0.790 (79.0\%), respectively. Based on the three
   machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the
   performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895,
   and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers.
   Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors
   affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility
   maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very
   high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized
   construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and
   infrastructural areas.},

Abstract = {Marine user-environment conflicts can have consequences for ecosystems
   that negatively affect humans. Strategies and tools are required to
   identify, predict, and mitigate the conflicts that arise between marine
   anthropogenic activities and wildlife. Estimating individual-,
   population-, and species-scale distributions of marine animals has
   historically been challenging, but electronic tagging and tracking
   technologies (i.e., biotelemetry and biologging) and analytical tools
   are emerging that can assist marine spatial planning (MSP) efforts by
   documenting animal interactions with marine infrastructure (e.g., tidal
   turbines, oil rigs), identifying critical habitat for animals (e.g.,
   migratory corridors, foraging hotspots, reproductive or nursery zones),
   or delineating distributions for fisheries exploitation. MSP that
   excludes consideration of animals is suboptimal, and animal space-use
   estimates can contribute to efficient and responsible exploitation of
   marine resources that harmonize economic and ecological objectives of
   MSP. This review considers the application of animal tracking to MSP
   objectives, presents case studies of successful integration, and
   provides a look forward to the ways in which MSP will benefit from
   further integration of animal tracking data.},

Abstract = {A case-control study was carried out to determine whether residential
   exposure to environmental pollutants increased risk for canine lymphoma
   in pet dugs. One hundred one cases with cyctologically or histologically
   confirmed lymphoma diagnosed at a veterinary teaching hospital between
   the middle of 1996 and the middle of 1998 were examined. Controls were
   obtained by choosing twice the number of dogs without neoplastic
   disease. with overlapping distributions of province of residence, age,
   sex. and breed. Information regarding animal management. residence type,
   professional or hobby use of chemicals by owners, and treatment with
   herbicides or other pesticides in the area li frequently visited by the
   dogs was obtained with a multiple-choice questionnaire by telephone
   interview. Two variables were positively and independently associated
   with the disease. namely residency in industrial areas (odds ratio
   {[}OR]: = 8.5: 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]. 2.3-30.9) and use of
   chemicals by owners, specifically paints or solvents (OR = 4.6: 95\% CI.
   1.7-12.6). A significantly lower value of the mean apr of disease onset
   was found in the group of dogs at risk in comparison with the group of
   all other dogs (6.1 +/- 0.4 years, n = 36 versus 7.5 +/- 0.4 years. n =
   65, respectively; P = .008). Variables describing animal care and
   pesticide use were either not associated with the disease or were
   uninformative. We suggest that canine lymphoma may be considered a
   sentinel of potentially hazardous situations for humans, because of the
   relatively short latency between exposure and disease onset.},

   patients. Among malignant skin tumors, 19.1 degrees AD were squamous
   cell carcinoma (SCC). The incidence of SCC was rapidly increased over
   the past years. However, the incidence rate of SCC in Japan has not been
   changed from the period 1976-1980 to 1986-1990. Sentinel lymph node
   biopsy for SCC did not provide diagnostic value. Bowen's disease and
   Erythroplasia of Queyrat are considered as carcinoma in situ of the
   skin. Erythroplasia of Queyrat have worse prognosis with a higher rate
   of malignant degeneration. Dermoscopy may helpful tool in assisting the
   noninvasive diagnosis of carcinoma in situ of the skin.},

Title = {Are Patagonia grasslands being overgrazed? A response to Marino et al.
   (2020)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},

Pages = {2399-2405},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based upon primary productivity estimates, Oliva et al. (2019) concluded
   that, at the end of last century and after long periods of overgrazing,
   Patagonia's domestic stocks adjusted to regional-scale herbivore
   carrying capacity. Populations of guanaco, a native camelid, increased
   thereafter, driving combined grazing pressures once again over carrying
   capacity in some areas. Marino et al. (2020) argued that grazing is not
   really at equilibrium because domestic stocks are concentrated in areas
   that remain overgrazed. They support the ideas that guanaco density is
   auto-regulated by resource-defence territoriality, and that guanacos are
   weak competitors with domestic stock, occupying only marginal areas. In
   their view, Oliva et al. (2019) put guanacos in the role of scapegoats,
   leaving domestic stocks unchecked. Equilibrium at regional scale does
   not preclude overgrazing and under-grazing at local scales. By
   separating areas with and without domestic stocks, Marino et al. (2020)
   estimated overgrazing at 28\% in Chubut Province and 73\% in Santa Cruz
   Province. Our recalculations show 28\% and 47\% domestic overgrazing,
   respectively. However, when combined with guanaco densities, these
   increase to 48\% for Chubut and 108\% for Santa Cruz. We question the
   hypothesised lack of competitive value and efficient self-regulating
   mechanisms that would prevent guanaco populations from overshooting
   carrying capacity. A dataset of 13 sheep farms showed mean density of 26
   +/- 3.8 guanacos/km(2)and high combined grazing pressures. This was also
   observed in a protected area of Chubut that reached 42 guanacos/km(2)and
   crashed during drought, with 60\% mortality. Thereafter, guanacos
   increased to 70 guanacos/km(2), with recruitment rates that showed a
   complex response of density dependence but remained relatively elevated
   at densities above the estimated carrying capacity. Synthesis and
   applications. Marino et al. (2020) are right to question the apparent
   equilibrium of domestic stocks that are concentrated in areas that may
   be still overgrazed. But ground data show that guanaco populations have
   inefficient density population regulation and can reach densities well
   over carrying capacity, even in the presence of sheep. This does not
   mean that the main control should be on growing guanaco populations but
   it stresses our conclusion that joint management of the native-domestic
   herbivore system is urgently needed. Joint management can be effected
   through local plans, as current guanaco management permits can only be
   issued in areas that are not overgrazed by sheep. Farm management plans
   may in this way transform an apparent competitor into a valuable
   resource, complementary to sheep raising.},

Title = {Shearwater Foraging in the Southern Ocean: The Roles of Prey
   Availability and Winds},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Background: Sooty (Puffinus griseus) and short-tailed (P. tenuirostris)
   shearwaters are abundant seabirds that range widely across global
   oceans. Understanding the foraging ecology of these species in the
   Southern Ocean is important for monitoring and ecosystem conservation
   and management.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Tracking data from sooty and
   short-tailed shearwaters from three regions of New Zealand and Australia
   were combined with at-sea observations of shearwaters in the Southern
   Ocean, physical oceanography, near-surface copepod distributions,
   pelagic trawl data, and synoptic near-surface winds. Shearwaters from
   all three regions foraged in the Polar Front zone, and showed particular
   overlap in the region around 140 degrees E. Short-tailed shearwaters
   from South Australia also foraged in Antarctic waters south of the Polar
   Front. The spatial distribution of shearwater foraging effort in the
   Polar Front zone was matched by patterns in large-scale upwelling,
   primary production, and abundances of copepods and myctophid fish.
   Oceanic winds were found to be broad determinants of foraging
   distribution, and of the flight paths taken by the birds on long
   foraging trips to Antarctic waters.
   Conclusions/Significance: The shearwaters displayed foraging site
   fidelity and overlap of foraging habitat between species and populations
   that may enhance their utility as indicators of Southern Ocean
   ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of upwellings due to
   interactions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with large-scale
   bottom topography, and the corresponding localised increases in the
   productivity of the Polar Front ecosystem.},

Title = {Factors influencing residential location choice: learnings from the
   Indian context},
Journal = {OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 22},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of the present study is to explore the factors that
   influence the residential location choice of households in the Indian
   context.Design/methodology/approachTwo sub-urban towns of Kolkata, i.e.
   Biddhanagar Municipal Corporation and Rajarhat Newtown, are taken as
   case studies. In total, 34 variables are considered related to the
   household's socioeconomic background (10), dwelling (3), travel (2) and
   level of importance of neighborhood characteristics (19). A revealed
   preference household survey is conducted, which resulted in the
   collection of 390 samples. Firstly, 19 level of importance variables are
   deduced to 3 latent factors using exploratory and confirmatory factor
   analysis. After that, a utility function is estimated using a
   multinomial logit regression to identify significant factors.FindingsThe
   results indicate the significance of car ownership, work travel time,
   work mode, monthly income, proximity to work, proximity to
   family/relative/friends, proximity to quality schools, quality of
   physical infrastructure such as water availability, power availability
   and housing typology among others in the residential location choice of
   households.Research limitations/implicationsKolkata, a major
   metropolitan area in eastern India, has been experiencing space
   constraints to cater to the housing demand of the ever-increasing
   population. Although satellite towns are being developed, the
   infrastructure landscape in such towns is uneven, resulting in more
   housing demand in one area than another. The study furnishes significant
   findings to develop more informed policies to attract households in
   low-demand areas and manage high-demand areas to achieve sustainable
   planning.Originality/valueConsidering the importance of geographical
   context, it is the first study on residential location choice, providing
   a perspective of household behavior from eastern India. It also shows
   the importance of physical infrastructure attributes in residential
   location choice for developing countries, which is seldom employed in
   the current practice. Moreover, previous studies (although few) done in
   India consider the objective value of location characteristics. The
   present study focuses on subjective value or the level of importance
   perceived by respondents.},

Abstract = {The scientific-technological development is essential for the sustained
   growth of our regions; the production of quality goods with high added
   value is an important step forward when compared with the production of
   raw materials. Computational Mechanics is an essential tool for the
   development of new technologies and for the optimization of the existing
   ones {[}1].
   The industry faces technological problems increasingly more complex, and
   the numerical simulation of those technological problems induces
   scientists to computational developments of eater complexity. Since
   technological decisions are reached based on the results provided by
   numerical models, is evident that these models have to be highly
   reliable. Therefore, it is essential that sophisticated modeling
   techniques are used; that highly qualified engineers develop models and
   that the results are validated experimentally using industrial or
   laboratory determinations {[}2].
   The examples used to illustrate this article are taken from real
   applications developed for industry: the structural verification of the
   communications satellite ARSAT-1 and the modeling of rock fracturing

Abstract = {The Global Positioning System (CPS) and Personal Communication Services
   (PCS) satellites are both information system technologies applicable to
   the mobile user. GPS, which was developed by the United States military,
   is one of the most successful dual-use systems. The size of the military
   GPS user equipment market currently is only a small fraction of the
   civilian market. GPS enables accurate timing, positioning, and
   navigation capabilities on a worldwide basis, whereas PCS satellites
   also enable worldwide communications. In the past, commercial GPS user
   sets have been integrated with digital maps and computer databases
   (yellow pages) to enable user situational awareness. For example, this
   type of implementation has been integrated into auto navigation systems.
   However, in many applications, the user requires time-evolving
   environmental data for enhanced situational awareness. For example, the
   automobile navigator would like information on traffic patterns,
   accidents, and road construction Since the user is mobile, he needs a
   driver information service supplied through a wireless data link.
   In the past, we have proposed Personal Navigation Service (PNS) as
   wireless PCS tailored to the mobile consumer/navigator.
   Military battlefield planners and participants have similar types of
   requirements for situational awareness involving both navigation and
   wireless data communication. Current world political situations require
   an effective military network centric global grid, which maximizes
   information superiority for the US and our allies. Shared communication
   links and the PVT (position, velocity and time) strengths of GPS create
   many opportunities (many yet to be conceived) for improved mission
   effectiveness.
   There is a compelling opportunity for a complementary space-based Navcom
   satellite architecture to meet the needs of both the military and
   civilian users. Global civil Navcom systems for air, rail, road traffic
   and infrastructure management (among many others) parallel many aspects
   of military Navcom systems for battlefield awareness inside the zones of
   armed conflict. Agreed upon overlapping elements of constituent civil
   and military navigation and communication systems can be integrated into
   a common infrastructure. Open system PNS standards illustrate some of
   these shared architecture concepts {[}1].
   With a dual-use system, there are several issues, which need to be
   resolved.
   (1) Can a cost-effective Navcom Sat system be developed that meets all
   of the requirements of both military and civilian users?
   (2) Why should the military consider dual-use?
   (3) Why should the civilian sector consider dual-use?
   (4) Can dual-use be developed without compromising military performance,
   availability, and security?
   (5) How does dual-use benefit the military as well as the civilian
   sector?
   (6) Why should navigation service and communication services be
   integrated on the same satellite system?
   This paper will address these questions as well as identify many issues
   associated with dual-use, integrated Navcom, and propose solutions to
   those issues.},

   conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of
   high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely
   dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g.
   temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be
   related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined
   with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas)
   reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in
   a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W
   30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea
   surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects
   of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four
   consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07,
   2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time
   during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to
   juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture
   management and genetics were standardized significant differences
   verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental
   effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing
   data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual
   variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed
   to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main
   factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of
   negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other
   hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected
   by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased
   by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW,
   related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on
   occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater
   penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity
   nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may
   also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino
   period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a
   levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number
   of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain
   northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the
   La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher
   chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and
   penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased
   occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the
   potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an
   important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture.

Title = {Evaluation of predicted loss of different land use and land cover (LULC)
   due to coastal erosion in Bangladesh},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Coastal erosion is one of the most significant environmental threats to
   coastal communities globally. In Bangladesh, coastal erosion is a
   regularly occurring and major destructive process, impacting both human
   and ecological systems at sea level. The Lower Meghna estuary, located
   in southern Bangladesh, is among the most vulnerable landscapes in the
   world to the impacts of coastal erosion. Erosion causes population
   displacement, loss of productive land area, loss of infrastructure and
   communication systems, and, most importantly, household livelihoods.
   With an aim to assess the impacts of historical and predicted shoreline
   change on different land use and land cover, this study estimated
   historical shoreline movement, predicted shoreline positions based on
   historical data, and quantified and assessed past land use and land
   cover change. Multi-temporal Landsat images from 1988-2021 were used to
   quantify historical shoreline movement and past land use and land cover.
   A time-series classification of historical land use and land cover
   (LULC) were produced to both quantify LULC change and to evaluate the
   utility of the future shoreline predictions for calculating amounts of
   lost or newly added land resources by LULC type. Our results suggest
   that the agricultural land is the most dominant land cover/use (76.04\%
   of the total land loss) lost over the studied period. Our results
   concluded that the best performed model for predicting land loss was the
   10-year time depth and 20-year time horizon model. The 10-year time
   depth and 20-year time horizon model was also most accurate for
   agricultural, forested, and inland waterbody land use/covers loss
   prediction. We strongly believe that our results will build a foundation
   for future research studying the dynamics of coastal and deltaic
   environments.},

Title = {Building an international network for a primary care research program:
   reflections on challenges and solutions in the set-up and delivery of a
   prospective observational study of acute cough in 13 European countries},
Journal = {BMC FAMILY PRACTICE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Background: Implementing a primary care clinical research study in
   several countries can make it possible to recruit sufficient patients in
   a short period of time that allows important clinical questions to be
   answered. Large multi-country studies in primary care are unusual and
   are typically associated with challenges requiring innovative solutions.
   We conducted a multi-country study and through this paper, we share
   reflections on the challenges we faced and some of the solutions we
   developed with a special focus on the study set up, structure and
   development of Primary Care Networks (PCNs).
   Method: GRACE-01 was a multi-European country, investigator-driven
   prospective observational study implemented by 14 Primary Care Networks
   (PCNs) within 13 European Countries. General Practitioners (GPs)
   recruited consecutive patients with an acute cough. GPs completed a case
   report form (CRF) and the patient completed a daily symptom diary. After
   study completion, the coordinating team discussed the phases of the
   study and identified challenges and solutions that they considered might
   be interesting and helpful to researchers setting up a comparable study.
   Results: The main challenges fell within three domains as follows:
   i) selecting, setting up and maintaining PCNs;
   ii) designing local context-appropriate data collection tools and
   efficient data management systems; and
   iii) gaining commitment and trust from all involved and maintaining
   enthusiasm.
   The main solutions for each domain were:
   i) appointing key individuals (National Network Facilitator and
   Coordinator) with clearly defined tasks, involving PCNs early in the
   development of study materials and procedures.
   ii) rigorous back translations of all study materials and the use of
   information systems to closely monitor each PCNs progress;
   iii) providing strong central leadership with high level commitment to
   the value of the study, frequent multi-method communication,
   establishing a coherent ethos, celebrating achievements, incorporating
   social events and prizes within meetings, and providing a framework for
   exploitation of local data.
   Conclusions: Many challenges associated with multi-country primary care
   research can be overcome by engendering strong, effective communication,
   commitment and involvement of all local researchers. The practical
   solutions identified and the lessons learned in implementing the
   GRACE-01 study may assist in establishing other international primary
   care clinical research platforms.},

Abstract = {The urban heat island effect caused by the rapid increase in urban
   anthropogenic heat has gradually become an important factor affecting
   the living environment of urban residents. Studying the temporal and
   spatial variation characteristics of urban anthropogenic heat is of
   great significance for urban planning and urban ecological service
   systems. In this study, the urban anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) in 2004,
   2009, 2014, and 2020 in the central urban area of Guangzhou was
   retrieved based on Landsat data and the surface energy balance equation,
   and the temporal and spatial characteristics of different types of
   anthropogenic heat were explored by combining the transfer matrix and
   the migration of the gravity center. The results showed that: (1) The
   overall change trend of anthropogenic heat in the central urban area of
   Guangzhou was enhanced, and the degree of enhancement was related to the
   type of urban functional land. (2) Different types of anthropogenic heat
   had different characteristics in terms of area expansion and spatial
   changes. Low-value anthropogenic heat (zero-AHF zone, low-AHF zone,
   medium-AHF zone) changed drastically in terms of area expansion.
   High-value anthropogenic heat (medium-AHF zone, high-AHF zone) changed
   more drastically in space. The increase in urban population, rapid
   economic development, and increased industrial production activities
   have stimulated the emission of anthropogenic heat, which has a positive
   impact on the intensity of anthropogenic heat.},

Title = {The relationships between landscape compositions and land surface
   temperature: Quantifying their resolution sensitivity with spatial
   regression models},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {145-157},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the relationships between landscape compositions and land
   surface temperature (LST) is important for mitigating urban heat island
   effect. Existing studies have investigated the impacts of land-cover
   types on LST, while the effects of LST autocorrelation are overlooked.
   This study used spatial regression model to distinguish the
   contributions of land-cover types on LST from that of LST
   autocorrelation. Its objectives are as follows: (1) to build
   quantitative relationships between LST and land-cover types at multiple
   resolutions and (2) to find suitable resolutions for measuring the
   relationships. LST is retrieved from a Landsat ETM+ image, and
   land-cover information is extracted from a Quickbird image. Two spatial
   regression models, spatial lag and spatial error models, are used to
   quantify the relationships at 18 resolutions ranging from 60 m to 1080
   m, at 60 m intervals. Results of this study indicate that the
   resolutions of 660 m and 720 m are most suitable for measuring the
   relationships between landscape compositions and LST. At these
   resolutions, all the five coefficients of dependent variables
   characterizing landscape compositions attain the maximum value, while
   the coefficient of the autocorrelation of LST is reduced to minimum. At
   resolutions finer than 660 m, the autocorrelation of LST affects LST
   more significantly than land-cover types. At resolutions coarser than
   720 m, most coefficients are insignificant. This study also measures the
   impacts of major land-cover types on LST. These findings provided
   valuable insights into how thermal environmental impacts of urbanization
   can be mitigated through local-level planning and zoning approaches. (C)

Title = {Claims for fertility interventions: a systematic assessment of
   statements on UK fertility centre websites},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Abstract = {Objectives: Fertility services in the UK are offered by over 200 Human
   Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)-registered NHS and private
   clinics. While in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection (ICSI) form part of the National Institute for Health and Care
   Excellence (NICE) guidance, many further interventions are offered. We
   aimed to record claims of benefit for interventions offered by fertility
   centres via information on the centres' websites and record what
   evidence was cited for these claims.
   Methods: We obtained from HFEA a list of all UK centres providing
   fertility treatments and examined their websites. We listed fertility
   interventions offered in addition to standard IVF and ICSI and recorded
   statements about interventions that claimed or implied improvements in
   fertility in healthy women. We recorded which claims were quantified,
   and the evidence cited in support of the claims. Two reviewers extracted
   data from websites. We accessed websites from 21 December 2015 to 31
   March 2016.
   Results: We found 233 websites for HFEA-registered fertility treatment
   centres, of which 152 (65\%) were excluded as duplicates or satellite
   centres, 2 were andrology clinics and 5 were unavailable or under
   construction websites. In total, 74 fertility centre websites,
   incorporating 1401 web pages, were examined for claims. We found 276
   claims of benefit relating to 41 different fertility interventions made
   by 60 of the 74 centres (median 3 per website; range 0 to 10).
   Quantification was given for 79 (29\%) of the claims. 16 published
   references were cited 21 times on 13 of the 74 websites.
   Conclusions: Many fertility centres in the UK offer a range of
   treatments in addition to standard IVF procedures, and for many of these
   interventions claims of benefit are made. In most cases, the claims are
   not quantified and evidence is not cited to support the claims. There is
   a need for more information on interventions to be made available by
   fertility centres, to support well-informed treatment decisions.},

Abstract = {Considerable economic losses and ecological damage can be caused by
   forest fires, and compared to suppression, prevention is a much smarter
   strategy. Accordingly, this study focuses on developing a novel
   framework to assess forest fire risks and policy decisions on forest
   fire management in China. This framework integrated deep learning
   algorithms, geographic information, and multisource data. Compared to
   conventional approaches, our framework featured timesaving, easy
   implementation, and importantly, the use of deep learning that vividly
   integrates various factors from the environment and human activities.
   Information on 96,594 forest fire points from 2001 to 2019 was collected
   on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire hotspots
   from 2001 to 2019 from NASA's Fire Information Resource Management
   System. The information was classified into factors such as topography,
   climate, vegetation, and society. The prediction of forest fire risk was
   generated using a fully connected network model, and spatial
   autocorrelation used to analyze the spatial aggregation correlation of
   active fire hotspots in the whole area of China. The results show that
   high accuracy prediction of fire risks was achieved (accuracy 87.4\%,
   positive predictive value 87.1\%, sensitivity 88.9\%, area under curve
   (AUC) 94.1\%). Based on this, it was found that Chinese forest fire risk
   shows significant autocorrelation and agglomeration both in seasons and
   regions. For example, forest fire risk usually raises dramatically in
   spring and winter, and decreases in autumn and summer. Compared to the
   national average, Yunnan Province, Guangdong Province, and the Greater
   Hinggan Mountains region of Heilongjiang Province have higher fire
   risks. In contrast, a large region in central China has been recognized
   as having a long-term, low risk of forest fires. All forest risks in
   each region were recorded into the database and could contribute to the
   forest fire prevention. The successful assessment of forest fire risks
   in this study provides a comprehensive knowledge of fire risks in China
   over the last 20 years. Deep learning showed its advantage in
   integrating multiple factors in predicting forest fire risks. This
   technical framework is expected to be a feasible evaluation tool for the
   occurrence of forest fires in China.},

Abstract = {One of key elements of culture of the Far East is literary Chinese,
   venyan (). In spite of the fact that hieroglyphs have identical tracing
   and value in the countries of East Asia, their pronunciation differs.
   The role of the Chinese hieroglyphs in Korea, Japan and in Vietnam can
   be compared to Latin role in medieval Europe. Since 7th century, in
   Vietnam Chinese and writing are used more and more. Even when in the
   10th century the country becomes independent and the Vietnamese deprived
   of writing supports the provision of a spoken language, Chinese and
   writing do not disappear. In the 17th century the Roman Catholic
   missionaries presented the system of the letter in Vietnamese on a Latin
   basis, kuoknga (Quoc Ngu) (state language) which and is used since then.
   Prior to the beginning of the 20th century the system of the letter of a
   kuoknga was used in parallel with chu-number. Presently it is used only
   kuoknga. The Vietnamese phonetic letter is language of modern fiction,
   science, education, management of government, daily friendly and
   official communication. Written in any language of the world, including
   not hieroglyphic, texts with ease and grace can be translated on kuok
   nga.},

Abstract = {The landslide susceptibility of a region is important for socioeconomic
   considerations and engineering applications. Thus, an automated system
   for mapping of landslide susceptibility could be of significant benefit
   for society. In this paper, a knowledge-based landslide susceptibility
   zonation (LSZ) system has been proposed. The system consists of input,
   understanding, expert, and output modules. The input module accepts
   thematic images of contributing factors for landslides. The
   understanding module interprets input images to extract relevant
   information as required by the expert module. The expert module consists
   of knowledge base and inference strategy to categorize a region into
   different landslide intensities. Finally the output module provides a
   LSZ map. It is a pixel-based system and provides output having the scale
   same as that of the input maps. The system has been tested to prepare a
   landslide susceptibility map for the Tehri-Garhwal region in India's
   lower Himalayas, and further validated with studies for two other
   different regions. The proposed system provides output commensurate with
   that provided by experts. The categories of hazard zones have a
   discrepancy as little as 6.2\% in high hazard zones and near to 1.5\%
   and 4\% in moderate and low hazard zones, respectively. The high hazard
   zones in the LSZ maps from the proposed system are supersets of that
   obtained by experts (i.e., the proposed system provides safer LSZ map).
   Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed system can be used for
   preparation of LSZ maps. In the future, the methodology may be extended
   for real time assessment and prediction of landslide hazards.},

Title = {Preoperative Serum Human Epididymis Protein 4 Levels in Early Stage
   Endometrial Cancer <i>A Prospective Study</i>},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of
   human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and cancer antigen 125 markers with
   pathological prognostic factor to complete the preoperative clinical
   panel and help the treatment planning.
   Methods: This prospective multicenter study was conducted in 2
   gynecologic oncology centers between 2012 and 2014 (Institute for
   Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo in Trieste and Catholic
   University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, Italy). We enrolled 153 patients
   diagnosed with clinical early (International Federation of Gynecology
   and Obstetrics stages I-II) type I endometrial cancer.
   Results: Human epididymis protein 4 levels seemed to be strictly related
   to age (P < 0.001) and menopausal status (P < 0.002). Compared with
   myometrial invasion (MI), the HE4 values were significantly higher in
   case of invasion of greater than 50\% of the thickness: MI of greater
   than 50\%, median of 94.85 pmol/L (38.3-820.8 pmol/L), versus MI of less
   than 50\%, median of 65.65 pmol/L (25.1-360.2 pmol/L), (P < 0.001). The
   HE4 levels increase significantly with increasing tumor size: diameter
   of larger than 2 cm, median of 86.9 pmol/L (35.8-820.8 pmol/L), versus
   diameter of smaller than 2 cm, median of 52.2 pmol/L (33.3-146.8
   pmol/L), (P < 0.001). In our population, HE4 did not correlate with the
   histological grade, endometrial cancer type I versus type II (P=0.86),
   the lymphovascular infiltration (P=0.12), and the cervical invasion (P =
   0.6). We established a new variable, considering 3 high-risk tumor
   features: MI of greater than 50\% and/or histologicalG3 and/or type II.
   Humanepididymis protein 4 levels significantly increase in high-risk
   tumors (high risk HE4, 93.6 pmol/L vs low-medium risk, 65.5 pmol/L; P <
   0.001).
   Conclusions: A preoperative HE4 evaluation could help stratify patients
   with deep invasion and/or metastatic disease and is correlated with
   other relevant prognostic factors to be considered to tailor an adequate
   surgical strategy.},

Title = {Integrating local pastoral knowledge, participatory mapping, and species
   distribution modeling for risk assessment of invasive rubber vine
   (<i>Cryptostegia grandiflora</i>) in Ethiopia's Afar region},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {The threats posed by invasive plants span ecosystems and economies
   worldwide. Local knowledge of biological invasions has proven beneficial
   for invasive species research, but to date no work has integrated this
   knowledge with species distribution modeling for invasion risk
   assessments. In this study, we integrated pastoral knowledge with Maxent
   modeling to assess the suitable habitat and potential impacts of
   invasive Cryptostegia grandiflora Robx. Ex R. Br. (rubber vine) in
   Ethiopia's Afar region. We conducted focus groups with seven villages
   across the Amibara and Awash-Fentale districts. Pastoral knowledge
   revealed the growing threat of rubber vine, which to date has received
   limited attention in Ethiopia, and whose presence in Afar was previously
   unknown to our team. Rubber vine occurrence points were collected in the
   field with pastoralists and processed in Maxent with MODIS-derived
   vegetation indices, topographic data, and anthropogenic variables. We
   tested model fit using a jackknife procedure and validated the final
   model with an independent occurrence data set collected through
   participatory mapping activities with pastoralists. A Multivariate
   Environmental Similarity Surface analysis revealed areas with novel
   environmental conditions for future targeted surveys. Model performance
   was evaluated using area under the receiver-operating characteristic
   curve (AUC) and showed good fit across the jackknife models (average AUC
   = 0.80) and the final model (test AUC = 0.96). Our results reveal the
   growing threat rubber vine poses to Afar, with suitable habitat
   extending downstream of its current known location in the middle Awash
   River basin. Local pastoral knowledge provided important context for its
   rapid expansion due to acute changes in seasonality and habitat
   alteration, in addition to threats posed to numerous endemic tree
   species that provide critical provisioning ecosystem services. This work
   demonstrates the utility of integrating local ecological knowledge with
   species distribution modeling for early detection and targeted surveying
   of recently established invasive species.},

Title = {Species density of foliage-dwelling spiders in field margins: a simple,
   fuzzy rule-based model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {129},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-99},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Field margins are grassy strips or banks between arable fields or
   meadows that are not cultivated or ploughed and contain only single
   shrubs or trees. They not only support beneficial arthropods, e.g.
   predators of crop pests, but can also be of potential value to species
   of concern, making them a critical target for conservation of
   biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Most ecological data and most
   knowledge of ecological relationships are imprecise, uncertain or
   ambiguous. An overemphasis on the precision of mathematical models,
   thus, does not necessarily translate into a greater representation of
   reality. In contrast, fuzzy expert systems permit the representation and
   processing of `soft' ecological knowledge in terms of natural language.
   This is done by sets of IF-THEN rules that relate the variables
   (expressed in the form of fuzzy sets such as `rather cold', `comparably
   few species', etc.) among each other. Data on 96 field margins in
   southern Germany and their foliage-dwelling spider assemblages, which
   had been collected from May to September 1994, were used for fuzzy
   modelling of the effects of margin width, margin density, frequency of
   mechanical disturbance and vegetation-architectural complexity on
   species density of spiders. Habitat factors were ordered according to
   their hierarchical effectiveness: margin width and disturbance determine
   habitat persistence, habitat persistence and margin density determine
   colonisation potential, and colonisation potential and herbaceous-plant
   cover determine species density. Forty-five rules are necessary to
   relate these factors. The predictive power of the fuzzy model was
   surprisingly high. The mean average error between predicted and observed
   number of species for test data, which was not used for model
   development, was less than 1.4 species (observed values ranged between 3
   and 25). A multiple-regression model showed a mean average error of 3.17
   species. We conclude that fuzzy models are suitable for representing the
   soft knowledge of field-margin/spider-assemblage relationships. The
   model permits time- and manpower-saving validation on larger scales by
   qualitative rather than quantitative data collection and by the
   inclusion of remote sensing data. We believe that fuzzy models could
   provide a valuable means for formulating measures necessary for
   conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2000

Abstract = {For more than 15 years, the World tourism organization and other major
   multilateral organizations have worked on the development of reliable
   tools for assessing tourism related to others economic activities in a
   country: the tourism satellite account. Its implementation at a
   sub-national level is a challenging endeavour and requires going beyond
   this framework. A regional tourism economic account is a good answer to
   the demand for regional tourism economic data and to highlight the
   problematic of employment with a tourism employment module. This
   combination sheds a new light on the role of tourism in creating,
   preserving and diversifying jobs in the economy. We developed a regional
   tourism economic account (RTEA), based on the supply-side, in order to
   take advantage of the existence a system of regional accounts and to
   respond to the lack of domestic tourism data. All these developments
   have been applied in a French overseas region, Reunion Island. The
   results show their feasibility. The others ultra-peripheral regions of
   European Union, others European islands and more generally small island
   tourism economies can benefit from this experience, (i.e. all regions in
   which a system of regional account has been implented). (C) 2016 Varna

Abstract = {The Census of Marine Life was a 10-year, international research effort
   to explore poorly known ocean habitats and conduct large-scale
   experimentation with new technology. The goal of Census 2010 in its
   mission statement was to describe what did live in the oceans, what does
   live in the oceans, and what will live in the ocean. Many of the
   findings and techniques from census research may prove valuable in
   making a transition, which many governments have publicly endorsed, from
   single-species fisheries management to more holistic ecosystem
   management. Census researchers sampled continental margins, mid-Atlantic
   ridges, ocean floor vents and seeps, and abyssal plains and polar seas
   and organized massive amounts of past and new information in a public
   online database called the Ocean Biogeographic Information System
   (www.iobis.org). The census described and categorized seamount biology
   worldwide for its vulnerability to fishing, advanced large-scale animal
   tracking with acoustic arrays and satellite archival tags, and
   accelerated species identification, including nearshore, coral reef, and
   zooplankton sampling using genetic barcoding and pyrotag sequencing for
   microbes and helped to launch the exciting new field of marine
   environmental history. Above all, the census showed the value of
   investing in large-scale, collaborative projects and sharing results
   publicly.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem fragmentation is being recognized as an important
   characteristic of landscapes, with numerous implications on its
   ecological and socio-economic valuation, and for the sustainable
   management of forest and natural resources in general. Particularly in
   regions where the population pressure on natural resources is heavy, and
   where the natural and man-influenced ecosystems are highly vulnerable,
   monitoring of landscape pattern provides valuable insight in and
   indicators of ecological landscape development. Pattern is a relatively
   complicated and multi-dimensional characteristic of landscape. Among the
   constituting agents are number of vegetation classes considered, number,
   size, shape, and relative and absolute spatial arrangement of the single
   patches, as is the scale (spatial resolution, level of detail) with
   which the landscape pattern is analysed. If an analysis shall go beyond
   a merely narrative and descriptive approach, indexes are frequently
   employed to quantitatively characterize the landscape pattern. These
   indexes are calculated from one or more measurable attributes. Usually,
   those indexes are derived on the basis of complete maps produced from
   remote sensing imagery and GIS analysis, and assuming that segmentation
   and classification of the imagery has been made with a high level of
   accuracy. Relatively little has been published on how to possibly
   estimate landscape pattern from sample surveys. This paper discusses the
   potential of sample surveys to produce estimates of some aspects of the
   fragmentation status of a landscape, where forest and non-forest are
   used as example classes. Sample based indexes can be derived from
   different sampling and plot designs, where area and perimeter length are
   attributes that can most easily be estimated. However, not all
   attributes interesting for landscape pattern description can be
   estimated from samples. We present a method that gives a metric, which
   is related to mean patch size. Sample-based approaches have some
   interesting properties: some analysis of pattern can be done in the
   absence of complete maps, and also for historic inventory data, when
   neither maps nor imagery are available. The proposed analysis of
   estimating a mean patch size related metric could easily be done with
   common forest inventory plot designs, where no additional measurements
   are required. This may make it interesting for ``time series{''} using
   old forest inventory data.},

Title = {Two-Dimensional Space Turntable Pitch Axis Trajectory Prediction Method
   Based on Sun Vector and CNN-LSTM Model},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {A two-dimensional space turntable system has been used to ensure that
   the Solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) can track the
   Sun stably, and the prediction of the two-dimensional turntable
   trajectory is an important part of payload health management. Different
   from the dynamic model using traditional trajectory prediction, we
   propose a new method for predicting the pitch axis trajectory of the
   turntable based on the sun vector and a deep learning CNN-LSTM model.
   First, the ideal solar position of the pitch axis was calculated using
   the sun vector. Then, the ideal solar position was combined with the
   running turntable pitch axis motor speed, current, and solar position
   error signal as the CNN-LSTM model input data. The model parameters were
   trained and adjusted through test data simulation using Fengyun-3E
   satellite orbit data. Finally, the next position of the pitch axis was
   predicted. The test results showed that in the sun vector and CNN-LSTM
   model, the RMSE value was 0.623 and the MSE value was 0.388. It was
   better than the LSTM model or CNN model alone and could accurately
   predict the pitch axis position.},

Title = {Comparison of bauxite resources - geo-economical considerations},

Month = {WIN-SPR},
Abstract = {In order to meet the significantly increased metal demand of the world
   market, it has been decided to expand the capacity of the existing
   alumina refineries and to set up new plants (more than 2 Mt/a each). The
   selection among the bauxite sources is based on previous exploration
   data, such as: tonnage, grade, mineralogy, etc., the geographical
   position of the deposit, existing natural and constructed infrastructure
   and the distance from deep water ports. Environmental and political
   risks are also investigated. Decision making is a complex task in which
   the close co-operation of professionals of the bauxite-alumina industry
   is needed. The authors specify the most determinant factors which are
   investigated for decision making and call attention to the fact that, in
   many cases, inconsistent data are compared as if they were equal in
   value or identical such as:
   the reliability of explorations made for deposits in various countries,
   and at different times is also different,
   the methods applied in reserve calculation and resource estimate are
   different,
   the qualitative criteria used for commercial grade ores are different,
   no numeric data are available showing the possible error in reserve
   calculation
   the terminology used for bauxite categories is also different.
   Adequate attention is never given for the further development of
   possible prospects; their investigation may be neglected in the
   selection. As a consequence, when different resources are compared, the
   geological risks (stability in bauxite production) cannot adequately be
   taken into account. For minimizing the transport costs (either the
   bauxite supply to the alumina plant or the alumina shipping to the
   smelter or both) the geographical position of the raw material is one of
   the most significant economic factors in the value of the deposit. There
   are several regions in the world which are so rich in bauxite potential
   (West Africa, edge of the Guyana Shield in Venezuela and Brazil, the
   Amazon Basin in Brazil, Weipa Gove in Australia, Eastern Ghats in India,
   etc.) where new deposits should be explored as a function of their
   geographical position. The landsat interpretation has proved to be an
   excellent tool for establishing priorities among the options. The
   authors give a short review and comparison of the most significant
   regions and deposits focusing their interests on the:
   tonnage, grade and mineralogy, further prospects (undiscovered)
   deposits, infrastructure, distance from mine/deposits to the deep water
   ports, available alumina content (for a low or a high temperature
   procedure) for estimating the bauxite consumption per ton of alumina,
   soluble silica content for estimating the caustic soda consumption per
   ton of alumina, beneficiation cost in some cases, risk factors
   (geological, environmental, political and national)
   The authors conclude, that in spite of the fact that about 30 - 35
   billion tons of bauxite have been registered so far as proved + probable
   reserves and a further 55 - 60 billion tons can be estimated as possible
   resources in the world, finding new resources in better geographical
   locations and their exploration may be advantageous. The new exploration
   data must be more reliable, as well. The costs of reconnaissance and
   exploration may be far below the haulage costs.},

Title = {Long-term Follow-up of Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules Found
   Benign on Molecular Testing: A Validation Study},
Journal = {OTO OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective Molecular testing has revolutionized management of
   indeterminate thyroid nodules (Bethesda categories III and IV). Few
   studies have attempted to validate the negative predictive value of
   molecular tests. Using long-term observation as a surrogate for surgical
   resection, we sought to examine the false-negative rate of ``benign{''}
   indeterminate thyroid nodules on molecular testing. Study Design Case
   series with retrospective data collection and chart review. Setting
   Large community-based practice with multiple satellite offices. Methods
   All patients with thyroid nodules that underwent ultrasound-guided
   fine-needle aspiration biopsy between 2013 and 2019 were evaluated
   through retrospective analysis. Cytologically indeterminate nodules
   reflexively underwent molecular testing to guide clinical management.
   Observation was recommended for lesions with benign molecular testing,
   and these nodules were followed clinically and by ultrasound. Results A
   total of 2011 nodules underwent fine-needle aspiration, of which 280
   (14\%) were indeterminate thyroid nodules. Of those 280 nodules, 100
   (36\%) were benign on molecular testing. Three samples were excluded
   from analysis due to patient deaths from unrelated causes. Surgical
   resection was recommended in 16 of the 97 nodules (17\%), with the
   majority due to size and compressive symptoms. Histopathology was
   available in 14 nodules that underwent surgery, with 1 demonstrating
   minimally invasive follicular carcinoma. Conclusion While molecular
   testing is safe to use in guiding management of indeterminate thyroid
   nodules, consideration of individualized clinical factors and close
   long-term follow-up remains paramount.},

Title = {Development and application of the soil moisture routing (SMR) model to
   identify subfield-scale hydrologic classes in dryland cropping systems
   using the Budyko framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {573},
Pages = {153-167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems
   often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and
   subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of
   saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath
   the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit
   representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from
   site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the
   grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an
   established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework,
   for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with
   spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements
   in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse
   region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified
   to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was
   combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a
   dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer
   management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact.
   Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss
   potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape
   through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively.
   Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed
   within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability
   was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of
   each had water supply 172\% and 137\% that of the dry zone. Depth to a
   hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary
   landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral
   flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep
   climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in
   water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation
   ranging from 91\% in the western-most field to approximately 70\% in
   each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to
   apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high
   crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is
   minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water
   storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage
   capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and
   minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting
   fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses.
   Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the
   frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all
   dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for
   inspiration in the design of cropping systems.},

Title = {Likelihood of elephant death risk applying kernel density estimation
   model along the railway track within biodiversity hotspot of

Abstract = {The seasonal and occasional movement of wild animals including elephants
   from one terrestrial habitat to another habitat are very common natural
   as well as biological habits for the survival of their lives. Around 163
   km railway track runs from Siliguri Junction (SGUJ) to Alipurduar
   Junction (APDJ) within biodiversity hotspot region. According to the
   report of Forest Department, around 14 prominent and 59 minor elephant
   corridors have been crisscrossed over the railway track and in between
   the years 1974 and 2019, nearly 71 elephants are brutally killed due to
   collision with running trains. The kernel density estimation model is
   applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal death risk of elephants. To
   predict the spatial vulnerability or risk of accidental death of
   elephants, Kernel density estimation analytical algorithms like
   Bandwidth selection, Intensity, Grid Resolution, Kernel function have
   been considered. This model considers past accidental deaths data along
   with secondary data like train speed, fragmentation of elephant
   habitats, distance of croplands from railway track, human encroachment
   with electric fencing etc. The anthropogenic activities as well as land
   use and land cover change have been analysed using Landsat 8 Operational
   Land Imager-OLI (2019) satellite images and digitally processed by EDRAS
   IMAGINE 16.5(v16.5.0.852) software. Similarly digital thematic maps have
   also been prepared on ArcGIS 10.3 platform. Kernel Density Estimation
   (KDE) intensity (risk) is computed considering the Elephant Death Risk
   Score (EDRS) as it takes into account of the first and second order
   properties. Fixed bandwidth is selected for the whole distribution and
   it is computed by the nearest neighbour distance mean method. On the
   basis of calculated tau value, (the mean distance between centroids and
   nearest neighbour index) Kernel Density map is prepared to show the
   elephant death risk in term of first order properties and second order
   properties. The result shows very high and high KD (risk) values (
   0.9799-10.0709) are confined in the eastern and western segments of the
   SGUJ to APDJ railway line. Therefore, this model helps to take
   sustainable holistic environmental management of wild animals as well as
   wild natural habitats in different corners of the globe.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To identify patient and health care factors which are related
   to the use of medical treatments that comprise quality measures and to
   assess the relation of these measures with mortality.
   Methods: The study sample consisted of 20 140 patients with acute
   coronary syndromes from the international GRACE registry. Multivariable
   logistic regression modeling was used to determine predictors of quality
   performance. Quality indicators were use of aspirin and beta-blockers
   within 24 hours and at hospital discharge, use of angiotensin-converting
   enzyme (ACE) inhibitors at discharge, and in-hospital mortality.
   Results: Use of medications in eligible patients at discharge ranged
   from 73\% for ACE inhibitors to 93\% for aspirin. High-risk features
   (eg, heart failure, older age) were related to failure to use aspirin
   and beta-blockers. Being at a teaching hospital and care by a
   cardiologist were associated with better use of aspirin and
   beta-blockers. Coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with
   failure to use ACE inhibitors and aspirin. When hospitals were divided
   into quartiles of quality performance, adjusted in-hospital mortality
   was 4.1\% in the top versus 5.6\% in the bottom quartile, representing a
   27\% (95\% confidence interval: 11\% to 42\%) lower relative mortality.
   Conclusion: Identification of factors associated with failure to use
   proven treatments, including high-risk groups that would derive
   particular benefit from effective therapies, provides an opportunity to
   focus quality improvement interventions. The association of lower
   hospital mortality with better use of selected medical treatments
   supports their measurement to improve quality of care. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {Coral reefs are a vital component of coastal and marine ecosystems. They
   are now under strong environmental challenges and are being harmed by
   human activities and rising sea surface temperatures, which are reducing
   the living coral cover. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the
   mapping accuracy of coral covers using PlanetScope satellite pictures
   with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method surrounding Cu Lao Xanh
   Island in Binh Dinh province. To adjust for the sunglint effect, the
   bands were corrected using the Hedley technique. After that, the
   Depth-Invariant Index technique was utilized to reduce the influence of
   the water column, and the ANN algorithm was employed for mapping. Hard
   coral, soft coral, seagrass, deep water, and bare bottom were identified
   as the five kinds of benthic habitat. The accuracy of the classification
   results was assessed using field data collected on May 10 and 11, 2022.
   The results indicated that the artificial neural network (ANN) technique
   had a higher accuracy, with a total classification accuracy of 89.55\%
   and a kappa value of 0.87. Cu Lao Xanh's coral area is around 68
   hectares, with soft corals mostly found west and southwest of the island
   and hard corals in the east. This finding demonstrates that Planetscope
   satellite imagery is effective at monitoring shallow coral reefs on
   small islands, providing a scientific foundation and reliable data for
   the development of a more comprehensive coral reef ecological monitoring
   and management.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the development of an
   optimal design framework for high altitude long endurance solar unmanned
   aerial vehicle. The proposed solar aircraft design framework provides a
   simple method to design solar aircraft for users of all levels of
   experience. Design/methodology/approach This design framework consists
   of algorithms and user interfaces for the design of experiments,
   optimization and mission analysis that includes aerodynamics,
   performance, solar energy, weight and flight distances. Findings The
   proposed sizing method produces the optimal solar aircraft that yields
   the minimum weight and satisfies the constraints such as the power
   balance, the night time energy balance and the lift coefficient limit.
   Research limitations/implications - The design conditions for the sizing
   process are given in terms of mission altitudes, flight dates, flight
   latitudes/longitudes and design factors for the aircraft configuration.
   Practical implications - The framework environment is light and easily
   accessible as it is implemented using open programs without the use of
   any expensive commercial tools or in-house programs. In addition, this
   study presents a sizing method for solar aircraft as traditional sizing
   methods fail to reflect their unique features.
   Social implications - Solar aircraft can be used in place of a satellite
   and introduce many advantages. The solar aircraft is much cheaper than
   the conventional satellite, which costs approximately \$200-300m. It
   operates at a closer altitude to the ground and allows for a better
   visual inspection. It also provides greater flexibility of missions and
   covers a wider range of applications.
   Originality/value This study presents the implementation of a function
   that yields optimized flight performance under the given mission
   conditions, such as climb, cruise and descent for a solar aircraft.},

Title = {Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs): A Case Study from Kota

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is
   relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and
   engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by
   taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new
   approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve
   this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The
   framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of
   database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on
   information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of
   literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters
   included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building
   structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural
   facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury,
   fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3)
   interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and
   diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is
   allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 \%
   damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25\% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26
   - 50\% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75\% damage/victims/period),
   and 1.00 (75 - 100\% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are
   compiled and analyzed with ``Landslide Distribution Map{''} (LDM) to
   generate a ``Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD){''}. The LDM was
   produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in
   order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally,
   three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were
   then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 (<
   0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability;
   Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High
   Vulnerability); and Class 5 (> 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results
   from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of
   high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as
   a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and
   managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially
   to be extended with different background environments. (C) IJOG - 2017.

Title = {Mosaics of fire and water: the co-emergence of anthropogenic landscapes
   and intensive seed exploitation in the Australian arid zone},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN ARCHAEOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {2-19},
Abstract = {In arid Australia, the antiquity, role and ecological contexts of
   `firestick' farming in seed-based foraging economies remain unclear. We
   use Landsat imagery to analyse effects of contemporary Martu hunting
   fires on seed-bearing grasses and forbs. Today, Martu rarely harvest
   wild seeds but inadvertently foster patches of grass when they burn to
   hunt burrowing monitor lizards. Therefore, anthropogenic seed patches
   need only be by-products of fires set to achieve other goals rather than
   the intended crop of firestick farming. Nonetheless, sustained burning
   over the long-term creates and maintains closely juxtaposed mosaics of
   seed and small game patches. We use the marginal value theorem (MVT) to
   model how pre-contact foragers may have used seed patches within such
   mosaics in response to climate change and population growth. We show
   that seeds would have been reliably available to foragers in
   anthropogenic patches whenever small game hunting returns were low and
   travel distances to new hunting patches long. Such circumstances
   probably occurred during the middle to late Holocene when population
   growth filled better-watered habitats of arid Australia, and climatic
   variability associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   reduced the number of water sources that could support foraging.
   Prolonged occupation around the water sources that remained triggered
   the emergence of fine-grained, anthropogenic fire mosaics. If so, the
   late Holocene proliferation of formalised seed milling equipment closely
   followed the emergence of firestick farming and signalled the consequent
   development of seed-based foraging economies, further fuelling
   population growth and social complexity when more mesic climatic
   conditions returned. Earlier milling technology during the Pleistocene
   and early Holocene probably accommodated seed distributions created in
   fire regimes other than the mosaic burning conducted by Martu today.},

Abstract = {In recognition of the critical role of field observations in the ongoing
   development of our discipline, the 43rd annual Binghamton Geomorphology
   Symposium (BGS) celebrated The Field Tradition in Geomorphology. By
   organizing a conference devoted to this theme, we sought to honor the
   contributions of pioneering, field-based geomorphologists and to
   encourage our community to contemplate how field work might continue to
   provide unique insight into a new, more technologically-driven era. For
   example, given recent advances in remote sensing methods such as LiDAR,
   what kind of added value can field work provide? Similarly, how can
   field-based studies contribute to societally relevant, large-scale
   questions related to climate change and sustainable management of the
   Earth system? Motivated by such questions, the 2012 BGS was convened in
   Jackson Hole, WY, a new, Western location that enabled participation by
   Rocky Mountain and west coast research groups underrepresented at
   previous Binghamton symposia. Also, in keeping with the field tradition
   theme, the 2012 BGS emphasized field trips, including a rafting
   excursion down the Snake River and an overview of the tectonic and
   glacial history of Jackson Hole. The on-site portion of the symposium
   consisted of invited oral and poster presentations and contributed
   posters, including many by graduate students. Topics ranged from an
   historical overview of the development of geomorphic thinking to
   long-term sediment tracer studies to a commentary on the synergy between
   LiDAR and field mapping. This special issue of Geomorphology consists of
   papers by invited authors from the 2012 BGS, and this overview provides
   some context for these contributions. Looking forward, we hope that the
   43rd annual BGS will stimulate further discussion of the role of field
   work as the discipline of geomorphology continues to evolve, carrying on
   the field tradition into the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Estimation of Soil Erosion and Sediment Yield in the Lancang-Mekong
   River Using the Modified Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and GIS
   Techniques},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The Lancang-Mekong River basin, as an important transboundary river in
   Southeast Asia, is challenged by rapid socio-economic development,
   especially the construction of hydropower dams. Furthermore, substantial
   factors, such as terrain, rainfall, soil properties and agricultural
   activity, affect and are highly susceptible to soil erosion and sediment
   yield. This study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in terms
   of spatial distribution and sediment deposition by using the revised
   universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and GIS techniques. This study also
   applied remote sensing and available data sources for soil erosion
   analysis. Annual soil erosion in most parts of the study area range from
   700 to 10,000 t/km(2)/y with a mean value of 5350 t/km(2)/y.
   Approximately 45\% of the total area undergoes moderate erosion.
   Moreover, the assessments of sediment deposition and erosion using the
   modified RUSLE and the GIS techniques indicate high sediment erosion
   along the flow direction of the mainstream, from the upper Mekong River
   to the Mekong Delta. The northern part of the upper Mekong River and the
   central and southern parts of the lower Mekong River are the most
   vulnerable to the increase in soil erosion rates, indicating sediment
   deposition.},

Title = {Assessing the Threat of Erosion to Nature-Based Interventions for
   Stormwater Management and Flood Control in the Greater Accra
   Metropolitan Area, Ghana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Perennial flooding has become a major feature in urban areas in
   developing economies generating research interest towards finding
   alternative approaches to stormwater management which could complement
   the existing systems and help address the challenge of flooding. One of
   such alternative approaches is nature-based stormwater management and
   flood control, the implementation of which could be affected by soil
   erosion. This paper, as part of a wider research, was developed to
   determine the extent of the threat of soil erosion to stormwater
   management in an urban area on the example of Greater Accra Metropolitan
   Area, Accra Ghana as the focus of the research. Landsat 8 images (2014)
   were used in the research to prepare the Landcover maps. Daily rainfall
   data from 6 raingauge stations from 1972 to 2014 were utilized to
   prepare the rainfall erosivity factor maps, whereas DEM was used to
   prepare the slope and slope length (SL) factor maps. The land cover map
   with an overall accuracy of 73.6 and Kappa 0.7122 was combined with
   literature sources to prepare the vegetative cover factor map, and
   conservation practice factor map. A soil series map, prepared and
   updated with literature sources and data from the Harmonized World Soil
   Database on physical parameters, was used to calculate the soil
   erodibility factor (K factor) for each soil series. These were
   integrated into RUSLE model as 30 m raster maps to generate a soil loss
   map at tons/ha/yr. The results produced rainfall erosivity index values
   based on the modified Fournier index ranging between 0.058 and 23.197
   which is classified as low. Low soil erodibility factor (K) ranging
   between 2.9x10(-5) and 8.5x10(-2) t ha/MJ mm indicated low
   susceptibility to erosion, SL factor value showing areas of low to
   almost flat relief with a few isolated areas of moderate slope length
   were generated. A soil loss of 69,5918 tons/ha/yr classified the soils
   as having high potential soil loss. The results showed a very low soil
   loss threat of 0-5.1853 tons/Ha/yr for more than 90\% of the study area.
   Targeted intervention for source areas with high potential soil loss
   will contain any threat of erosion and sediment yield to the
   implementation of an infiltration-based stormwater management and flood
   control system.},

Title = {A review of drought monitoring with big data: Issues, methods,
   challenges and research directions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over recent years, the frequency and intensity of droughts have
   increased and there has been a large drying trend over many parts of the
   world. Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has
   gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging
   natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological
   environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early
   warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency
   especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger.
   There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its
   applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data
   heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought,
   it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial
   distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of
   this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and
   reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies,
   researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring.
   Challenges related to data life cycle such as data challenges, data
   processing challenges and data infrastructure management challenges are
   also discussed. Finally, we conclude that big data analytic can be
   beneficial in drought monitoring but there is a need for statistical and
   artificial intelligence-based approaches.},

Title = {Distinct microalgae species for food-part 1: a methodological (top-down)
   approach for the life cycle assessment of microalgae cultivation in
   tubular photobioreactors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Specific microalgae species are an adequate source of EPA and DHA and
   are able to provide a complete protein, which makes them highly
   interesting for human nutrition. However, microalgae cultivation has
   also been described to be energy intensive and environmentally
   unfavorable in pilot-scale reactors. Moreover, production in cold
   temperature zones has not been sufficiently investigated. In particular,
   the effects of tube materials and cultivation season length have rarely
   been previously investigated in the context of a comparative LCA of
   microalgae cultivation. A computational ``top-down{''} model was
   conducted to calculate input flows forNannochloropsissp.andPhaeodactylum
   tricornutumcultivation in a hypothetical tubular photobioreactor.
   Cultivation processes were calculated according to detailed satellite
   climatic data for the chosen location in Central Germany. This model was
   applied to a set of different scenarios, including variations in
   photobioreactor material, tube diameter, microalgae species, and
   cultivation season length. Based on these data, a life cycle assessment
   (LCA) was performed following ISO standard 14040/44. The impact
   assessment comprised the global warming potential, acidification,
   eutrophication, cumulative energy demand, and water scarcity. The
   results showed that a long cultivation season in spring and fall was
   always preferable in terms of environmental impacts, although
   productivity decreased significantly due to the climatic preconditions.
   Acrylic glass as a tube material had higher environmental impacts than
   all other scenarios. The cultivation of an alternative microalgae
   species showed only marginal differences in the environmental impacts
   compared with the baseline scenario. Critical processes in all scenarios
   included the usage of hydrogen peroxide for the cleaning of the tubes,
   nitrogen fertilizer, and electricity for mixing, centrifugation, and
   drying. Microalgae cultivation in a tubular photobioreactor in a
   ``cold-weather{''} climate for food is sustainable and could possibly be
   a complement to nutrients from other food groups. The added value of
   this study lies in the detailed description of a complex and flexible
   microalgae cultivation model. The new model introduced in this study can
   be applied to numerous other scenarios to evaluate photoautotrophic
   microalgae cultivation in tubular photobioreactors. Thus, it is possible
   to vary the facility location, seasons, scale, tube dimensions and
   material, microalgae species, nutrient inputs, and flow velocity.
   Moreover, single processes can easily be complemented or exchanged to
   further adjust the model individually, if, for instance, another
   downstream pathway is required.},

Title = {Integrating waveform lidar with hyperspectral imagery for inventory of a
   northern temperate forest},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that attempts to use remote sensing to map the
   spatial and structural patterns of individual tree species abundances in
   heterogeneous forests, such as those found in northeastern North
   America, may benefit from the integration of hyperspectral or
   multi-spectral information with other active sensor data such as lidar.
   Towards this end, we describe the integrated and individual capabilities
   of waveform lidar and hyperspectral data to estimate three common forest
   measurements - basal area (BA), above-ground biomass (AGBM) and
   quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) - in a northern temperate mixed
   conifer and deciduous forest. The use of this data to discriminate
   distribution and abundance patterns of five common and often, dominant
   tree species was also explored. Waveform lidar imagery was acquired in
   July 2003 over the 1000 ha. Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in
   central New Hampshire (USA) using NASA's airborne Laser Vegetation
   Imaging Sensor (LVIS). High spectral resolution imagery was likewise
   acquired in August 2003 using NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging
   Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Field data (2001-2003) from over 400 US Forest
   Service Northern Research Station (USFS NRS) plots were used to
   determine actual site conditions.
   Results suggest that the integrated data sets of hyperspectral and
   waveform lidar provide improved outcomes over use of either data set
   alone in evaluating common forest metrics. Across all forest conditions,
   8-9\% more of the variation in AGBM, BA, and QMSD was explained by use
   of the integrated sensor data in comparison to either AVIRIS or LVIS
   metrics applied singly, with estimated error 5-8\% lower for these
   variables. Notably, in an analysis using integrated data limited to
   unmanaged forest tracts, AGBM coefficients of determination improved by
   25\% or more, while corresponding error levels decreased by over 25\%.
   When data were restricted based on the presence of individual tree
   species within plots, AVIRIS data alone best predicted species-specific
   patterns of abundance as determined by species fraction of biomass.
   Nonetheless, use of LVIS and AVIRIS data - in tandem - produced
   complementary maps of estimated abundance and structure for individual
   tree species, providing a promising adjunct to traditional forest
   inventory and conservation biology planning efforts. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Title = {Linking data of ENSO, NDVI-MODIS and crops yield as a base of an early
   warning system for agriculture in Cordoba, Argentina},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {By influencing interannual rainfall variability in the Province of
   Cordoba, Argentina, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also impact on
   corn and soybean yields at the main rain-fed agricultural production
   departments. Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental
   impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a
   region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and
   decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean
   yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using
   different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production
   departments of Cordoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Rio
   Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Cordoba as a vegetation proxy to
   depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal
   persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators
   from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing
   season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops
   productivity.
   Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence
   during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is
   compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While
   for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p <
   0.05) in all Cordoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS.
   Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships
   when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when
   using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was
   located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop
   season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as
   an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case,
   the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small.
   The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more
   extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May,
   at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the
   growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with
   the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11\% and 10\% of Rio
   Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19\% when
   SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an
   unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of
   crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression
   models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI
   and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors.
   Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making
   use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during
   the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO
   influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its
   incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis
   of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.},

Title = {Observed and Predicted Geographic Distribution of <i>Acer
   monspessulanum</i> L. Using the MaxEnt Model in the Context of Climate
   Change},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Acer monspessulanum (Montpellier Maple) is an important deciduous tree
   species native to the Mediterranean region. It is largely distributed in
   the southern part of western Europe; however, it is geographically less
   present in north Africa and western Asia. The effects of the most
   significant environmental variables for its habitat suitability, and
   climate change, are unclear in terms of the future changes to its
   distribution. The objective of the present study was to model the
   current and future geographical potential distribution of the
   Montpellier Maple in the Mediterranean basin and West Asia using maximum
   entropy modeling software (MaxEnt). The value of the Area Under the
   Curve (AUC) of MaxEnt was used to analyze the model's performance. More
   than 5800 well-distributed presence points, elevation, slope, aspect,
   topographic wetness index (TWI), natural vegetation characteristics from
   MODIS products, and 19 bioclimatic variables were used to conduct the
   study. Regarding the projections of the species distribution under
   climate change, 17 global climatic models were used under two RCP
   scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) for the 2040-2060 and the 2060-2080 time
   periods. The results show that temperature seasonality (40\%
   contribution to the model), elevation (33.5\%), mean annual temperature
   (6.9\%), mean annual precipitation (6.2\%), and max temperature of the
   warmest month (4.5\%) were identified as the primary factors that
   accounted for the current distribution of the Montpellier Maple. Under
   the climate change scenarios, MaxEnt predicts a large decrease in the
   species suitability area, with a shift towards the southwestern regions
   of the species distribution, especially to the mountainous zones of the
   Moroccan Atlas. Our results show that climate largely limits the
   distribution of the Montpellier Maple in the Mediterranean basin, as its
   change in the future is expected to significantly reduce the suitable
   area by more than 99\% from the historical climate conditions, to reach
   only 16,166.9 and 9874.7 km(2) under the moderate RCP4.5 and extreme
   RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the end of the 21st century. Our
   study can provide a good view of the future changes in the distribution
   of Montpellier Maple for its protection and sustainable management.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Despite their remarkable courage, children fleeing persecution to
   America's southern border are among the most vulnerable individuals in
   our society. Seeking compassion and fairness in the midst of a refugee
   crisis, these children instead meet a system that is all-too callous and
   unbending. C.J. was no different. Facing death threats from a gang at
   home in Honduras, C.J. and his mother Maria travelled 3,000 treacherous
   miles to America. Maria did her best to speak on behalf of her son in
   immigration court-despite limited English proficiency, no legal
   background, and no assistance-but the immigration judge rejected C.J.'s
   pleas for relief. In early 2018, the Ninth Circuit ruled against C.J. as
   well, holding that immigrant children facing deportation do not have a
   right to appointed counsel; in doing so, it became the first court to
   state that it is constitutionally permissible for children to be forced
   to represent themselves in removal proceedings. However, opening a
   window of hope for children asylum-seekers, the Ninth Circuit recently
   took the significant step of withdrawing the initial panel's decision
   and electing to rehear C.J.'s case en banc.
   The initial panel was incorrect; the Fifth Amendment, when carefully
   considered in light of today's realities, compels a right to appointed
   counsel for immigrant children facing the prospect of deportation. The
   ``fundamental fairness{''} principle and human dignity value underlying
   Fifth Amendment procedural due process point to a need for children to
   be represented by attorneys in order to have meaningful voices. And a
   thorough analysis under the Supreme Court's procedural due process test
   demonstrates that the only way to ensure children with legitimate claims
   are not turned away in significant numbers is to provide a right to
   appointed counsel. Yet, because this right has not been recognized, tens
   of thousands of children today are deprived of the fair hearings to
   which they are constitutionally entitled.
   The Ninth Circuit now has a historic opportunity to right this wrong.
   When it reconsiders C.J.'s case in the near future, it should reject the
   initial panel's reasoning and instead chart a path that respects the due
   process rights of those who most need the protection of a fair justice
   system. And in the midst of unprecedented executive action curtailing
   the rights of asylum-seekers and utter legislative inaction in response,
   now is a pivotal time for our courts to recognize this right to
   appointed counsel. Ultimately, the lives of children like C.J.-and truly
   the heart and grace of the American justice system-depend on it.},

Abstract = {Around the world, vast improvements in public transportation methods in
   urban environments have been made. However, in densely populated areas,
   the bicycle remains a very useful means of transportation. Its small
   size and minimal environmental impact are the critical factors that
   maintain its relevance. Moreover, the advancement of connected devices
   and sharing-based services have allowed private vendors to develop
   bike-sharing programs, giving millions access to bike transportation
   around the globe. These bike-sharing programs rely on the user to check
   out and return the bike to a designated bike-holding station. With the
   growth of Internet of Things (IoT) services and wirelessly connected
   devices, there is a major benefit in enabling vendors to track their
   bicycle assets. Satellite navigation has come a long way, however, it
   requires a large power overhead. This paper proposes an energy-efficient
   bicycle tracking system that utilizes bicycle powered Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BLE) beacons and Long Range (LoRa) type base-stations in order
   to track and maintain a real-time location-based inventory of all
   assets. The BLE beacons are used to track individual bicycle assets
   based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) proximity and the
   LoRa base stations exploit longer range communication capabilities to
   transmit asset location information between each other, for added
   management capabilities. Preliminary proximity estimations using BLE
   beacons in an urban outdoor environment show promising results with
   proximity accuracy consistently under 2 meters.},

Title = {Precision variable rate nitrogen for dryland farming on waterlogging
   Riverine Plains of Southeast Australia?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in
   popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land
   preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen,
   invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many
   major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability
   as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may
   include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical
   harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable
   Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information
   and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces
   crop yields.
   Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the
   district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings
   over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha).
   Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across
   GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR
   levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one
   year may be poorest in the next.
   We answer the question: ``Why would a farmer in this district choose to
   apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in
   possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment,
   georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map
   data for that paddock in many past seasons?{''} We show that soil
   conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN
   versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging.
   If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season,
   applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of
   attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled
   soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable.
   We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated
   decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable,
   fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced
   in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with
   high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices.
   Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of
   each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1\% increase in
   yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7\% decrease in applied N.
   We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable
   than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may
   lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.},

Abstract = {Flash floods are very abrupt and sudden and can devastate large areas
   with in fraction of seconds. Tsunami is also a grass root cause of
   infrastructure loss and casualties. Tsunami is caused by the release of
   energy inside the ocean. It has been observed that Tornados and Tsunami
   frequently occurred that caused more than 120000 casualties between 1992
   to 2005. Several approaches and cases have been studied and applied to
   overcome this topmost issue. Strong and reliable flood risk management
   system must have the capabilities to forecast and estimate the change in
   the process: the hydro atmospheric and climatic development that causes
   flood waves and land and metropolitan exposure that leads to casualties.
   Techniques utilized for the early investigation of flash floods may be
   classified into following categories a. Sensors and
   instrumentation-based b. Radar based c. Satellite images based. In this
   paper researchers presented a reliable and vigor cost-effective solution
   for the prediction of flash floods accurately and precisely by using
   direct measurements with the combination of scaled conjugate gradient
   back propagation. Researchers have adopted direct measurement method by
   utilizing couple of sensors named as PIR, ultrasonic sensor, water or
   humidity sensor, temperature and pressure sensors. Gas sensor has also
   been used to detect the increased carbon dioxide levels in the
   environment as soil is saturated more and the probability of flash flood
   occurrence becomes sure in this situation. An appropriate mixture of
   estimation sensors can extensively boost the benefit of information in
   contrast with that from a single sensor. 48 hours of data has been
   recorded and processed for the false alarm identification by using
   Scaled conjugate gradient back propagation. Results proved that our
   proposed system worked better or equivalent to the other available
   techniques with minimized error rate. Results showed that it performed
   better than the existing approaches. Multi layer perceptron (MLP) was
   applied on the same data set for the error and false alarm
   classification. Results were compared with the multi-layer perceptron
   and it can be easily observed that they are close enough therefore
   scaled conjugate gradient back propagation performed very well.},

Title = {First space-based derivation of the global atmospheric methanol emission
   fluxes},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Pages = {4873-4898},
Abstract = {This study provides improved methanol emission estimates on the global
   scale, in particular for the largest methanol source, the terrestrial
   biosphere, and for biomass burning. To this purpose, one complete year
   of spaceborne measurements of tropospheric methanol columns retrieved
   for the first time by the thermal infrared sensor IASI aboard the MetOp
   satellite are compared with distributions calculated by the IMAGESv2
   global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed
   using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1
   emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on
   net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization
   based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly
   better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is
   achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with
   respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol
   measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions
   are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the
   MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse
   modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate
   an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source
   totals 187 Tg yr(-1) with a contribution of 100 Tg yr(-1) from plants,
   only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr(-1).
   Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are
   inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 \%) and Indonesia (up to 58 \%),
   whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20-25
   \%) and Central Africa (25-35 \%). On the other hand, the biogenic
   source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions
   of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2),
   probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which
   is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant
   error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived
   biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union. The
   robustness of the derived fluxes to changes in convective updraft
   fluxes, in methanol removal processes, and in the choice of the biogenic
   a priori inventory is assessed through sensitivity inversions. Detailed
   comparisons of the model with a number of aircraft and surface
   observations of methanol, as well as new methanol measurements in Europe
   and in the Reunion Island show that the satellite-derived methanol
   emissions improve significantly the agreement with the independent data,
   giving thus credence to the IASI dataset.},

Title = {Biologically important areas II for cetaceans in US and adjacent
   waters-Arctic region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) in the
   Arctic region. The Arctic region extends from the Bering Strait to the
   Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Amundsen Gulf, and Viscount Melville Sound.
   This NOAA-led effort uses structured elicitation principles to build
   upon the first version of NOAA BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. In addition
   to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, BIA II products incorporated a
   scoring and labeling system to improve their utility and
   interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the best available science
   and have no inherent regulatory authority. They have been used by NOAA,
   other federal agencies, and the public to support marine spatial
   planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the
   development of conservation measures for cetaceans. Supporting evidence
   for Arctic BIA II came from data derived from aerial-, land-, and
   vessel-based surveys; satellite telemetry; passive acoustic monitoring;
   Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification; aboriginal subsistence
   harvests, including catch and sighting locations and stomach contents;
   and prey studies. BIAs were identified for bowhead (Balaena mysticetus),
   gray (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), fin
   (Balaenoptera physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. In
   total, 44 BIAs were delineated and scored for the Arctic, including 12
   reproduction, 24 feeding, and 8 migration BIAs. BIAs were identified in
   all months except January-March. Fifteen candidate areas did not have
   sufficient information to delineate as BIAs and were added to a watch
   list for future consideration in the BIA process. Some BIAs were
   transboundary between the Arctic region and the Aleutian Islands-Bering
   Sea region. Several BIAs were transnational, extending into territorial
   waters of Russia (in the Chukchi Sea) and Canada (in the Beaufort Sea),
   and a few BIAs were delineated in international waters.},

Abstract = {Paddy cultivation in Malaysia plays a crucial role in food production,
   with a focus on improving crop quality and quantity. With current
   national self-sufficiency levels ranging between 67 and 70\%, the
   Malaysian government intends to produce higher-quality crops and boost
   agricultural production. However, the prominent paddyproducing state of
   Kedah has witnessed a decline in yields over the years. To address this,
   the study explores the effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   equipped with vegetation indices (VIs) for monitoring paddy plant health
   at various growth stages. Researchers acquired aerial imagery during two
   seasons in 2019, capturing three distinct growth stages: tillering (40
   days after sowing), flowering (60 days after sowing), and ripening (100
   days after sowing). These stages represent critical points in the paddy
   plant's life cycle. Agisoft Metashape software processed the images to
   extract VIs data. The study found that the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (BNDVI) exhibited over 90\% similarity. In contrast, the Normalized
   Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), utilizing near-infrared and red-edge
   light reflections, demonstrated a unique relationship. NDRE outperformed
   NDVI and BNDVI with an R-squared value of 0.842, showcasing its superior
   accuracy, especially for dense crops like paddy plants sensitive to
   subtle changes in vegetation. In conclusion, this research highlights
   the potential of UAV-based VIs for effectively monitoring paddy plant
   health during different growth stages. The NDRE index, in particular,
   proves valuable for assessing dense crops, offering insights for
   precision agriculture and crop management in Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Universities and business schools across the world are addressing the
   topic of inclusion primarily via financial barriers. MOOCs, Coursera and
   other buzzwords are the hot topics of the day. Participants around the
   world certainly benefit from lowering financial hurdles. Yet, from our
   experience, the contribution of MOOCs to increasing skill levels in
   developing and emerging countries is severely constrained by
   technological boundaries.
   Many prospective students of E-Learning in Africa, Asia, Latin America
   and the Pacific Islands incur substantial challenges. In many countries,
   internet is only available from satellite connection, and it is
   expensive and slow. Fibre optic cables are not the norm in Central
   Africa or in the Pacific Islands. This implies that fancy web based
   trainings and sophisticated interactive modules will simply ``time
   out{''}.
   Yet it is exactly those prospective students of E-Learning in emerging
   and developing countries who stand to benefit most -after all the
   quality of local universities and business schools offering professional
   trainings may not always be up to international standards. Access to
   international best practice E-Learning would be a superb way to let the
   participants catch up.
   To address this problem, Frankfurt School of Finance \& Management
   (Frankfurt School) developed the highly innovative, technologically
   highly accessible LinkEd platform to provide affordable part-time
   training opportunities to international development finance
   practitioners, eager for education but often hampered by the limited
   access to it. But how is it possible to combine high quality online
   education with low technical and infrastructural requirements? The
   LinkEd strategy is to mix modern and traditional online learning
   approaches allowing participants with and without high speed internet to
   follow the courses.
   Provide education and training opportunities for developing and
   developed countries
   Provide highly specialized and relevant knowledge on development finance
   Offer affordable and flexible six-month courses
   Constant development and improvement of the e-learning tools
   Offer an international network of partner institutions hosting the final
   examination, giving the participants the possibility to receive a
   Frankfurt School Certification
   In 2010, the pilot of the first ``Certified Expert in Microfinance{''}
   (CEMF) was launched in India and became international one year later.
   With its international setup, the CEMF course has been offered for the
   fifth time starting September 2013. In 2012, the ``Certified Expert in
   SME Finance{''} started and in 2013 the ``Certified Expert in Risk
   Management{''} was added to the portfolio. Since its beginning, the
   LinkEd portfolio has been expanding and until today (10/2013) the
   concept has attracted around 900 participants from more than 100
   different countries. However that was not enough, in March 2014 the
   Frankfurt School will launch a new course on Climate and Renewable
   Energy Finance.
   Summarizing, what makes LinkEd successful? The fact that we offer an
   alternative and affordable way of education to participants from all
   over the world. The fact that we offer the flexibility to learn along
   side of a full time job. The fact that high qualified trainers and
   experts develop and support the courses. The key factor of the success
   is to link all of this into one concept: LinkEd},

Abstract = {Home hemodialysis (HHD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are associated with
   better clinical outcomes, lower hospitalization rates, and improved
   quality of life compared with conventional in-center hemodialysis.
   However, <12\% of patients requiring dialysis therapy use HHD or PD in
   the United States, even though over 90\% of nephrologists would choose
   home-based dialysis modalities for themselves. Inadequate patient
   education and decision-making support are key barriers to patients
   choosing home-based therapy. Likewise, there are key challenges for
   dialysis providers, including development and optimal delivery of
   education materials, appropriate staffing, and training. The Satellite
   Healthcare Optimal Transitions (OT) Program was developed to provide
   education and decision support to patients during the transitional
   period. OT provides in-depth education in all dialysis modalities at the
   start of dialysis over a flexible time period (1-4 weeks, adapted for
   various learning curves) to allow for time to physical stabilization,
   self-care training, and modality choice based on each patient's
   individual life motivations, goals, and environments. OT may provide
   value to patients and providers by providing comprehensive support for
   dialysis modality selection, resulting in increased patient confidence
   to execute home dialysis with the potential for improved patient
   outcomes, and reduced hospitalizations.},

Title = {Hydrogen Isotopes as a Sentinel of Biological Invasion by the Japanese
   Beetle, <i>Popillia japonica</i> (Newman)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Invasive species alter ecosystems, threaten native and endangered
   species, and have negative economic impacts. Knowing where invading
   individuals are from and when they arrive to a new site can guide
   management. Here, we evaluated how well the stable hydrogen isotope
   composition (delta H-2) records the recent origin and time since arrival
   of specimens of the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica Newman)
   captured near the Portland International Airport (Oregon, U.S.A.). The
   delta H-2 of Japanese beetle specimens collected from sites across the
   contiguous U.S.A. reflected the delta H-2 of local precipitation, a
   relationship similar to that documented for other organisms, and one
   confirming the utility of delta H-2 as a geographic fingerprint. Within
   weeks after experimental relocation to a new isotopic environment, the
   delta H-2 of beetles changed linearly with time, demonstrating the
   potential for delta H-2 to also mark the timing of arrival to a new
   location. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the recent
   geographical origin and timing of arrival of each specimen based on its
   delta H-2 value. The geographic resolution was broad, with values
   consistent with multiple regions of origin in the eastern U.S.A.,
   slightly favoring the southeastern U.S.A. as the more likely source.
   Beetles trapped from 2007-2010 had arrived 30 or more days prior to
   trapping, whereas the median time since arrival declined to 3-7 days for
   beetles trapped from 2012-2014. This reduction in the time between
   arrival and trapping at the Portland International Airport supports the
   efficacy of trapping and spraying to prevent establishment. More
   generally, our analysis shows how stable isotopes can serve as sentinels
   of biological invasions, verifying the efficacy of control measures, or,
   alternatively, indicating when those measures show signs of failure.},

Title = {Evaluation of different DTMs in sediment connectivity determination in
   the Mascarada River Watershed, southern Brazil},
Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {332},
Pages = {80-87},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The study of sediment connectivity based on the geomorphic
   characteristics of the watershed has gained interest during the last
   decades. The calculation of connectivity indexes for a mountainous
   watershed that is normally susceptible to landslides allows the
   recognition of the unstable areas that have higher connection to any
   point such as the watershed outlet. Thus, the knowledge of spatial
   patterns of connectivity within the watershed is very useful in the
   sediment-related disaster management because the connectivity provides
   useful information on sediment pathways. The objective of the present
   study was to test four different global DTMs to compute the sediment
   connectivity index (IC) in the Mascarada river watershed (320 km(2)),
   southern Brazil. By analyzing the land use for each pixel, the Manning
   roughness was determined and used for the weighting factor in IC
   calculation. Field survey and satellite image analysis showed that 420
   landslides occurred in this watershed on January 5th, 2017. The
   calculated IC value maps demonstrated that the hillslopes with landslide
   occurrences have higher values of IC. Among the tested DTMs, the one
   with the highest resolution (12.5-m resolution DTM) showed the best
   representation of the flow paths with high IC values. For all the
   resolutions, the IC mean values of the landslides scars were larger
   compared to the remaining area of the hillslopes, where the landslides
   occurred, which implies higher connectivity of the landslides to the
   watershed outlet. The results also showed that the 12.5-m resolution DTM
   generated the lowest mean and the largest amplitude of IC values,
   differentiating areas with high and low connectivity. It is concluded
   that the global DTM (12.5-m) is capable to provide important information
   on sediment connectivity and that together with a landslide inventory it
   can be an important tool for sediment management in mountainous
   watersheds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Use of Long-Distance Migration Patterns of an Endangered Species to

   Area},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Large marine protected areas (MPAs), each hundreds of thousands of
   square kilometers, have been set up by governments around the world over
   the last decade as part of efforts to reduce ocean biodiversity
   declines, yet their efficacy is hotly debated. The Chagos Archipelago
   MPA (640,000 km(2)) (Indian Ocean) lies at the heart of this debate. We
   conducted the first satellite tracking of a migratory species, the green
   turtle (Chelonia mydas), within the MPA and assessed the species' use of
   protected versus unprotected areas. We developed an approach to estimate
   length of residence within the MPA that may have utility across
   migratory taxa including tuna and sharks. We recorded the longest ever
   published migration for an adult cheloniid turtle (3979 km). Seven of 8
   tracked individuals migrated to distant foraging grounds, often 1000 km
   outside the MPA. One turtle traveled to foraging grounds within the MPA.
   Thus, networks of small MPAs, developed synergistically with larger
   MPAs, may increase the amount of time migrating species spend within
   protected areas. The MPA will protect turtles during the breeding season
   and will protect some turtles on their foraging grounds within the MPA
   and others during the first part of their long-distance postbreeding
   oceanic migrations. International cooperation will be needed to develop
   the network of small MPAs needed to supplement the Chagos Archipelago
   MPA. Uso de los Patrones de Migracion a Larga Distancia de una Especie
   en Peligro de Extincion para Informar a la Planeacion de la Conservacion
   del area Marina Protegida mas Grande
   Resumen Las areas marinas protegidas grandes (MPAs, en ingles), con
   cientos de miles de kilometros cuadrados cada una, han sido establecidas
   por gobiernos alrededor del mundo a lo largo de la decada pasada como
   parte de los esfuerzos para reducir las declinaciones de biodiversidad
   oceanica, sin embargo su efectividad sigue siendo tema de debate. La MPA
   del archipielago de Chagos (640,000 km(2)) (Oceano indico) yace al
   centro de este debate. Llevamos a cabo el primer rastreo satelital de
   una especie migratoria, la tortuga verde (Chelonia mydas), dentro de la
   MPA y evaluamos el uso de la especie de areas protegidas y areas no
   protegidas. Desarrollamos una estrategia para estimar la duracion de
   residencia dentro de la MPA que podria tener utilidad para taxones
   migratorios, incluyendo atunes y tiburones. Registramos la migracion mas
   larga jamas publicada para un quelonio adulto (3979 Km). Siete de 8
   individuos rastreados migraron a zonas de alimentacion distantes, a
   menudo 1000 Km fuera de la MPA. Una de las tortugas viajo a zonas de
   alimentacion dentro de la MPA. Asi, las redes de pequenas MPAs,
   desarrolladas sinergicamente con MPAs mas grandes puede incrementar la
   cantidad de tiempo que las especies migratorias pasan dentro de areas
   protegidas. La MPA protegera a las tortugas durante la temporada
   reproductiva y protegera a algunas tortugas en sus zonas de alimentacion
   dentro de la MPA y a otras durante la primera parte de sus migraciones
   pos-reproductivas de larga distancia. Se necesitara cooperacion
   internacional para desarrollar la red de pequenas MPAs necesarias para
   complementar la MPA del archipielago Chagos.},

Abstract = {Transformation is a total transition process from a form into a new
   figure which can be interpreted as the final stage of a process where
   space and time become greatly affect the changes to the ultimate stage.
   Changes are done by giving the response of the influence of external and
   internal elements that will lead to a change of shape that has been
   known previously. The title of ``education city{''} to the city of
   Bandung past of history of its establishment. Education in Bandung began
   to show its development since the establishment of Hollandsch Inlandsche
   Kweekschool, shortened into HIK48, on May 13, 1868. It was established
   by some important figures, among others, were R. H. Muhammad Musa.
   Meanwhile, higher education began to grow since the establishment of
   Technische Hoogeschool (abbreviated as THS) in 1920 as part of the
   Ethical Policy of the Dutch Government to its colony. So since then, the
   life of higher education in the city of Bandung continues to grow and
   increase. THS is a forerunner to the birth of Bandung Institute of
   Technology (ITB now). The purpose of this study is to establish the
   theory that can explain how the transformation of urban space in Balubur
   Tamansari in Bandung City, so it can be seen adjusting the physical
   setting of the region as the city's identity. The research method used
   was a qualitative grounded theory research method, the approach is
   focused on the discrete phenomenon in the field in order to disclose the
   meaning of the background of the city region space. This phenomenon was
   appointed through a process of snowball sampling. The process of data
   collection, analysis and theory building will be done at the same time
   in a period of time and iterative of process. This research generates
   knowledge building based on the knitting of the value system, the
   activity of perpetrator and physical setting in the region.},

Abstract = {Surveillance systems for West Nile virus (WNV) combine several methods
   to determine the location and timing of viral amplification. The value
   of each surveillance method must be measured against its efficiency and
   costs to optimize integrated vector management and suppress WNV
   transmission to the human population. Here we extend previous
   comparisons of WNV surveillance methods by equitably comparing the most
   common methods after standardization on the basis of spatial sampling
   density and costs, and by estimating optimal levels of sampling effort
   for mosquito traps and sentinel chicken flocks. In general, testing for
   evidence of viral RNA in mosquitoes and public-reported dead birds
   resulted in detection of WNV approximately 2-5 weeks earlier than
   serological monitoring of sentinel chickens at equal spatial sampling
   density. For a fixed cost, testing of dead birds reported by the public
   was found to be the most cost effective of the methods, yielding the
   highest number of positive results per \$1000. Increased spatial density
   of mosquito trapping was associated with more precise estimates of WNV
   infection prevalence in mosquitoes. Our findings also suggested that the
   most common chicken flock size of 10 birds could be reduced to six to
   seven without substantial reductions in timeliness or sensitivity. We
   conclude that a surveillance system that uses the testing of dead birds
   reported by the public complemented by strategically timed mosquito and
   chicken sampling as agency resources allow would detect viral activity
   efficiently in terms of effort and costs, so long as susceptible bird
   species that experience a high mortality rate from infection with WNV,
   such as corvids, are present in the area.},

Abstract = {Wildfires in Indonesia 2015 burnt forests in many protected areas,
   including remaining forests in Tesso Nilo National Park. We investigated
   the extent to which 2015's wildfires affect the remaining habitat and
   the spatial distribution of ungulates in the park by using satellite
   images to identify burnt and unburnt forest patches. Habitat conditions
   and the presence of ungulates indicated by the number of ungulate signs
   were compared between burnt and unburnt areas. The devastated trees at
   different rates depending on tree lifeform stages. Wefound that younger
   trees were more vulnerable to fire. The abundance of ungulates did not
   differ significantly between burnt and unburnt areas, but all vegetation
   characteristics were significantly different (Mann-Whitney U-test
   p-value < 0.05). We surmise that food such as new shoots or leaves,
   particularly at the edge of burnt areas, attracted ungulates out of
   unburnt areas. The remaining forest is relatively small, and the park is
   under continued pressure from illegal conversion, so any further loss of
   remaining forest as refugia will likely harm the ungulate population. We
   recommend that management should prioritize the preservation of
   remaining pristine habitat and the reduction of fire suppression,
   especially during the dry season.},

Title = {Big Data Analysis Framework for Water Quality Indicators with
   Assimilation of IoT and ML},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {According to the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goal `6'
   seeks to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water for
   all. Digital technologies, such as big data, Internet of Things (IoT),
   and machine learning (ML) have a significant role and capability to meet
   the goal. Water quality analysis in any region is critical to identify
   and understand the standard of water quality and the quality of water is
   analyzed based on water quality parameters (WQP). Currently, water
   pollution and the scarcity of water are two major concerns in the region
   of Uttarakhand, and the analysis of water before it is supplied for
   human consumption has gained attention. In this study, a big data
   analytics framework is proposed to analyze the water quality parameters
   of 13 districts of Uttarakhand and find the correlation among the
   parameters with the assimilation of IoT and ML. During the analysis,
   statistical and fractal methods are implemented to understand the
   anomalies between the water quality parameters in 13 districts of
   Uttarakhand. The variation in WQP is analyzed using a random forest (RF)
   model, and the dataset is segmented location wise and the mean, mode,
   standard deviation, median, kurtosis, and skewness of time series
   datasets are examined. The mean of the parameters is adjusted with the
   coefficient of variation based on the standard values of each parameter.
   The turbidity in almost all the experimental sites has a normal
   distribution, with the lowest mean value (0.352 mg/L) and highest (11.9
   mg/L) in the Pauri Garhwal and Almora districts, respectively. The pH of
   the water samples is observed to be in the standard range in all the
   experimental sites, with average and median values being nearly
   identical, at 7.189 and 7.20, respectively. However, the pH mode is
   0.25. The Cl- concentration varies with mean values from the lowest
   (0.46 mg/L) to the highest (35.2 mg/L) over the experimental sites,
   i.e., the Bageshwar and Rudraprayag districts, respectively. Based on
   the analysis, it was concluded that the water samples were found to be
   safe to drink and in healthy condition in almost all the districts of
   the state Uttarakhand, except for the Haridwar district, where some
   increase in contaminants was observed.},

Title = {Climate variability and implications for keeping rivers cool in England},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Water temperature (Tw) is a primary determinant of river ecosystem
   health and function that is strongly controlled by climate variability
   and change but mediated by catchment properties. We apply a nested
   analysis to: (1) evaluate how annual and seasonal mean Tw varied across
   England during the period 2000-2018; (2) assess the extent to which
   these regional-temporal dynamics correlate with the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO); and (3) quantify the impact of local climate
   variability on modelled daily maximum Tw for open, shaded and spring-fed
   river reaches. Such information is used to identify sentinel locations
   for long-term monitoring and reporting, to evaluate the true benefit of
   riparian shade management, and to assess the impacts of climate change
   on Tw. We draw on a national archive of nearly 1 million Tw values and
   data from a high resolution field experiment in central England.
   Nationally, annual mean Tw changed by-0.4 degrees C/ decade over the
   period 2000 to 2018, broadly in line with Central England Temperatures,
   although summer Tw changed by +0.6 to +1.1 degrees C/decade in parts of
   central and northern England. There were significant associations
   between summer Tw and NAO (rho = 0.64, p < 0.05), especially at sites
   above 300 m altitude (rho = 0.70, p < 0.01). The regional analysis
   reveals strongest links between summer Tw and NAO in northeast England
   and weakest associations in lowland regions of southern and east England
   with major aquifers. Hence, places with significant groundwater flows
   offer the greatest chance of detecting long-term signals in Tw that are
   not being driven by the NAO. Site-specific, logistic regression models
   of daily maximum Tw are found to be sensitive to the prevailing NAO
   phase during calibration periods. Such models show a thermal benefit for
   shaded sites compared with open sites that is one average 0.2 degrees C
   under negative NAO but 2.8 degrees C under positive NAO. Based on the
   findings from our nested analysis we suggest ways of optimising
   monitoring networks plus improving the appraisal of measures intended to
   keep rivers cool. In particular, we call for the creation of a national
   indicator of Tw for use in UK Climate Change Risk Assessments.},

Title = {Comparison of the Applicability of J-M Distance Feature Selection
   Methods for Coastal Wetland Classification},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Accurate determination of the spatial distribution of coastal wetlands
   is crucial for the management and conservation of ecosystems. Feature
   selection methods based on the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) method include
   J-M distance with simple average ranking (JM(ave)), J-M distance based
   on weights and correlations (JM(improved)), and heuristic J-M distance
   (JM(mc)). However, as the impacts of these methods on wetland
   classification are different, their applicability has rarely been
   investigated. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and random forest
   (RF) classifier, this is a comparative analysis of the applicability of
   the JM(ave), JM(improved), and JM(mc) methods. The results show that the
   three methods compress feature dimensions and retain all feature types
   as much as possible. JM(mc) exhibits the most significant compression
   from a value of 35 to 15 (57.14\%), which is 37.14\% and 40\% more
   compressed than JM(ave) and JM(improved), respectively. Moreover, they
   produce comparable classification results, with an overall
   classification accuracy of 90.20 \& PLUSMN; 0.19\% and a Kappa
   coefficient of 88.80 \& PLUSMN; 0.22\%. However, different methods had
   their own advantages for the classification of different land classes.
   Specifically, JM(ave) has a better classification only in cropland,
   while JM(mc) is advantageous for recognizing water bodies, tidal flats,
   and aquaculture. While JM(improved) failed to retain vegetation and
   mangrove features, it enables a better depiction of the mangroves, salt
   pans, and vegetation classes. Both JM(ave) and JM(improved) rearrange
   features based on J-M distance, while JM(mc) places more emphasis on
   feature selection. As a result, there can be significant differences in
   feature subsets among these three methods. Therefore, the comparative
   analysis of these three methods further elucidates the importance of J-M
   distance in feature selection, demonstrating the significant potential
   of J-M distance-based feature selection methods in wetland
   classification.},

Title = {The 2023 terahertz science and technology roadmap},

Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) radiation encompasses a wide spectral range within the
   electromagnetic spectrum that extends from microwaves to the far
   infrared (100 GHz-similar to 30 THz). Within its frequency boundaries
   exist a broad variety of scientific disciplines that have presented, and
   continue to present, technical challenges to researchers. During the
   past 50 years, for instance, the demands of the scientific community
   have substantially evolved and with a need for advanced instrumentation
   to support radio astronomy, Earth observation, weather forecasting,
   security imaging, telecommunications, non-destructive device testing and
   much more. Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of
   technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply
   and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations
   to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and
   development community has advanced related technology and bridged the
   transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency
   operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our
   stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap
   (Dhillon et al 2017 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 50 043001). As one might
   envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and
   technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly.
   It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023
   version we both provide an update on key developments in established
   technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and
   highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The
   developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific
   research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum
   optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful
   subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and
   climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the
   expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that
   together provide an overview of past developments and the likely
   challenges facing the field of THz science and technology in future
   decades. The document is written in a form that is accessible to policy
   makers who wish to gain an overview of the current state of the THz art,
   and for the non-specialist and curious who wish to understand available
   technology and challenges. A such, our experts deliver a `snapshot'
   introduction to the current status of the field and provide suggestions
   for exciting future technical development directions. Ultimately, we
   intend the Roadmap to portray the advantages and benefits of the THz
   domain and to stimulate further exploration of the field in support of
   scientific research and commercial realisation.},

Title = {Seasonal Change and Spatial Distribution of Traffic Noise in

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS},

Abstract = {In this study, traffic noise in Seferihisar, which is a holiday resort
   by the Aegean Sea in the West of Turkey, was investigated. The noise
   occurring in summer and winter, on weekdays, and at weekends was mapped
   separately. Besides, land uses exposed to traffic noise were specified.
   In the carried out method, the land uses were primarily mapped by using
   the satellite images of the study area. Then, the noise was measured at
   46 points during ten days in summer and winter, on weekdays and at
   weekends, and it was mapped by using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
   method and by means of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques.
   The measurements were taken in the daytime (07: 00-19: 00), in the
   evening (19: 00-23: 00), and at night (23: 00-07: 00) as stated in the
   Turkish Regulation of Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise.
   Since the time interval of the daytime measurements was large, the noise
   was measured in three different periods for the daytime measurements. In
   the formation of noise maps, logarithmic averages of all measurements
   taken at each point were used. The noise maps were overlapped with the
   land use maps by the help of the GIS techniques; the land use affected
   by the noise was analyzed.
   The results showed that the road traffic noise varied from summer to
   winter seasons in the study area depending on heavy or light traffic.
   The noise occurring in summer showed an increase both on weekdays and at
   weekends. While the limit value was exceeded in 49 of the measurement
   averages taken in winter, the limit value was exceeded in 96
   measurements taken in summer. The noise maps formed according to the IDW
   method displayed that the areas in which the limit value was exceeded in
   the daytime in summer took up 14.27\% of the study area while this rate
   went down to 4.06\% in winter. The study area is one of the most
   important destinations for summer holiday. 20.12\% of the area that
   exceeded the limit value in summer was builtup and 10.69\% of them was
   tourism area. The noise together with population and traffic that
   increase in summer season is an important environmental problem against
   which some precautions should be taken. The findings of the study
   present significant results which might guide local governments in
   preventing and managing the noise.},

Abstract = {Global climate change is one of the most important scientific, societal
   and economic contemporary challenges. Fundamental understanding of the
   major processes driving climate change is the key problem which is to be
   solved not only on a global but also on a regional scale. The accuracy
   of regional climate modelling depends on a number of factors. One of
   these factors is the adequate and comprehensive information on the
   anthropogenic impact which is highest in industrial regions and areas
   with dense population - modern megacities. Megacities are not only
   ``heat islands{''}, but also significant sources of emissions of various
   substances into the atmosphere, including greenhouse and reactive gases.
   In 2019, the mobile experiment EMME (Emission Monitoring Mobile
   Experiment) was conducted within the St. Petersburg agglomeration
   (Russia) aiming to estimate the emission intensity of greenhouse (CO2,
   CH4) and reactive (CO, NOx) gases for St. Petersburg, which is the
   largest northern megacity. St. Petersburg State University (Russia),
   Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany) and the University of Bremen
   (Germany) jointly ran this experiment. The core instruments of the
   campaign were two portable Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectrometers which were used for ground-based remote sensing
   measurements of the total column amount of CO2, CH4 and CO at upwind and
   downwind locations on opposite sides of the city. The NO2 tropospheric
   column amount was observed along a circular highway around the city by
   continuous mobile measurements of scattered solar visible radiation with
   an OceanOptics HR4000 spectrometer using the differential optical
   absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. Simultaneously, air samples
   were collected in air bags for subsequent laboratory analysis. The air
   samples were taken at the locations of FTIR observations at the ground
   level and also at altitudes of about 100 m when air bags were lifted by
   a kite (in case of suitable landscape and favourable wind conditions).
   The entire campaign consisted of 11 mostly cloudless days of
   measurements in March-April 2019. Planning of measurements for each day
   included the determination of optimal location for FTIR spectrometers
   based on weather forecasts, combined with the numerical modelling of the
   pollution transport in the megacity area. The real-time corrections of
   the FTIR operation sites were performed depending on the actual
   evolution of the megacity NOx plume as detected by the mobile DOAS
   observations. The estimates of the St. Petersburg emission intensities
   for the considered greenhouse and reactive gases were obtained by
   coupling a box model and the results of the EMME observational campaign
   using the mass balance approach. The CO2 emission flux for St.
   Petersburg as an area source was estimated to be 89 +/- 28 kt km(-2)
   yr(-1), which is 2 times higher than the corresponding value in the
   EDGAR database. The experiment revealed the CH4 emission flux of 135 +/-
   68 tkm(-2) yr(-1), which is about 1 order of magnitude greater than the
   value reported by the official inventories of St. Petersburg emissions
   (similar to 25 t km(-2) yr(-1) for 2017).
   At the same time, for the urban territory of St. Petersburg, both the EM
   ME experiment and the official inventories for 2017 give similar results
   for the CO anthropogenic flux (251 +/- 104 t km(-2) yr(-1) vs. 410
   tkm(-2) yr(-1)) and for the NOx anthropogenic flux (66 +/- 28 tkm(-2)
   yr(-1) vs. 69 tkm(-2) yr(-1)).},

Title = {Mapping and Modelling Malaria Risk Areas Using Climate,
   Socio-Demographic and Clinical Variables in Chimoio, Mozambique},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Background: Malaria continues to be a major public health concern in
   Africa. Approximately 3.2 billion people worldwide are still at risk of
   contracting malaria, and 80\% of deaths caused by malaria are
   concentrated in only 15 countries, most of which are in Africa. These
   high-burden countries have achieved a lower than average reduction of
   malaria incidence and mortality, and Mozambique is among these
   countries. Malaria eradication is therefore one of Mozambique's main
   priorities. Few studies on malaria have been carried out in Chimoio, and
   there is no malaria map risk of the area. This map is important to
   identify areas at risk for application of Public Precision Health
   approaches. By using GIS-based spatial modelling techniques, the
   research goal of this article was to map and model malaria risk areas
   using climate, socio-demographic and clinical variables in Chimoio,
   Mozambique. Methods: A 30 m x 30 m Landsat image, ArcGIS 10.2 and
   BioclimData were used. A conceptual model for spatial problems was used
   to create the final risk map. The risks factors used were: the mean
   temperature, precipitation, altitude, slope, distance to water bodies,
   distance to roads, NDVI, land use and land cover, malaria prevalence and
   population density. Layers were created in a raster dataset. For class
   value comparisons between layers, numeric values were assigned to
   classes within each map layer, giving them the same importance. The
   input dataset were ranked, with different weights according to their
   suitability. The reclassified outputs of the data were combined.
   Results: Chimoio presented 96\% moderate risk and 4\% high-risk areas.
   The map showed that the central and south-west ``Residential areas{''},
   namely, Centro Hipico, Trangapsso, Bairro 5 and 1 de Maio, had a high
   risk of malaria, while the rest of the residential areas had a moderate
   risk. Conclusions: The entire Chimoio population is at risk of
   contracting malaria, and the precise estimation of malaria risk,
   therefore, has important precision public health implications and for
   the planning of effective control measures, such as the proper time and
   place to spray to combat vectors, distribution of bed nets and other
   control measures.},

Title = {An integrated approach to streamflow estimation and flood inundation
   mapping using VIC, RAPID and LISFLOOD-FP},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {610},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Controlling the damaging effects of fluvial flood events has been a
   major challenge for mankind. Integrated hydrologic-hydrodynamic models
   are often employed to estimate the flow and vital flood inundation
   information for mitigating such damages. The most important criterion
   for their implementation is that they should offer large-scale
   applicability with a finer resolution to have local relevance and
   practicability. This study presented an integrated modeling framework,
   VIC-RAPID-LISFP that couples a hydrological model (VIC), a river routing
   model (RAPID) and a hydrodynamic model (LISFLOOD-FP) for fast generation
   of high-resolution flow and flood inundation extent. The utility of the
   model is tested and demonstrated for a case study in the Upper Krishna
   River basin in India. The results showed that the simulated hourly
   streamflows from the calibrated model match reasonably well with the
   observations in terms of various efficiency measures. Also, the
   generated flood inundation maps from the model can reliably capture more
   than 80\% of the satellite-derived flood inundation extent during both
   the low and high flow events. The proposed modeling framework is based
   on readily available open source hydrographic data, and minimum
   meteorological information, so it has global applicability for
   supporting a flood management system with local relevance, especially
   for the data-scarce regions.},

Title = {A Data-Driven Approach to Hurricane Debris Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The large amount of debris generated in the aftermath of hurricane and
   storm events can cause severe financial and logistical burdens to
   coastal communities. Existing debris estimation models mainly focus on
   wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50\%,
   highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that
   can account for other types of debris while improving accuracy.
   Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic
   framework to estimate the presence and amount of waterborne debris
   following a severe storm using machine learning (ML) techniques as a
   function of relevant storm and landcover parameters. Machine learning
   techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models,
   employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris
   removal database for Hurricane Ike, respectively. The results show that
   the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a
   misclassification error of 5.56\% for the debris presence predictive
   model, and a normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 11.98
   for the debris volume model, the lowest RMSE of the tested algorithms.
   Dual-layer ML models are also investigated, incorporating the debris
   presence as a predictor in the debris volume model. The results show a
   percent error of 11.29\% for the dual-layer model and an approximately
   5.4\% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not
   incorporate debris presence. The generated debris volume and presence
   models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate
   mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource
   allocation following a storm event.},

Title = {Optimization and assessment of phytoplankton size class algorithms for
   ocean color data on the Northeast US continental shelf},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {267},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The size structure of phytoplankton communities influences important
   ecological and biogeochemical processes, including the transfer of
   energy through marine food webs. A variety of algorithms have been
   developed to estimate phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) from satellite
   ocean color data. However, many of these algorithms were developed for
   application to the global ocean, and their performance in more
   productive, optically complex coastal and continental shelf regions
   warrants evaluation. In this study, several existing PSC models were
   applied in the Northeast U.S. continental shelf (NES) region and
   compared with in situ PSC estimates derived from a local HPLC pigment
   data set. The effect of regional re-parameterization and incorporation
   of sea surface temperature (SST) into existing abundance-based model
   frameworks was investigated and model performance was assessed using an
   independent data set. Abundance-based model re-parameterization alone
   did not result in significant improvement in model performance compared
   with other models. However, the inclusion of SST led to a consistent
   reduction in model error for all size classes. Of two absorption-based
   algorithms tested, the best performing approach displayed similar
   performance metrics to the regional SST-dependent abundance-based model.
   The SST-dependent model and the absorption-based method were applied to
   monthly composites of the NES region for April and September 2019 and
   qualitatively compared. The results highlight the benefit of considering
   SST in abundance-based models and the applicability of absorption-based
   PSC methods in optically complex regions.},

Title = {The role of the state in the decline of public space - a historical
   perspective},
Journal = {TER ES TARSADALOM},

Abstract = {According to Mike Davis, the militarisation of urban space is a process
   that builds a city wound securitisation, leading to an urban space made
   exclusive through surveillance and disciplining strutegies. The end or
   decline of public space is described as the result of such
   militarisation processes by critical theorists who linked it to
   capitalist, neoliberal city governance. Thus understood, urban space is
   formed by capital to achieve an economically more competitive city
   leading to the displacement of the poor and homeless. As a result,
   public space ceases to exist as the epitome o f democracy, as a place
   where different social groups can mingle and voice their discontent.
   While such processes of militarisation increasingly characterise the
   urban spaces of Budapest, too, it is not necessarily the case that the
   discourse on the ``decline{''} or ``end of public space{''} also applies
   to Budapest when it is analysed from a local and historical perspective.
   In addition, the question arises as to whether there has ever actually
   been a more democratic public space in Budapest.
   This article focuses on the changing role of the state through its
   interpretation of the meaning and use of public space, starting from
   Lefebvre's argument that power is mediated through space. In addition to
   Lefebvre's theories on the production of space, this study is informed
   by Susan Gal's paper on the semiotics of public/private distinction, as
   it is helpful for a deeper understanding of the relationship between the
   state and public space. Based on feminist theory, Gal argues that the
   difference between public and private is ideologically defined.
   Therefore, the relation between public and private cannot alone describe
   society, it rather acts as a tool for argument or discussion of value
   systems.
   The aim is to understand from a historical perspective the decline of
   public space and the militarisation of urban space as discussed by
   critical theorists in the case of Budapest. For such urban tendencies
   should be seen not only with regard to capital(ism) but also in the
   context of (central and local) governments. The basis is provided by
   analyses of both the minutes of the Budapest Metropolitan Council of
   1978 and archive footage (news and advertisements) from the 1960s to the
   1970s.
   The article concludes that although the militarisation of urban space
   described by Davis also characterises Budapest, especially since the
   2000s, the author's historical research suggests that in the case of
   Budapest the lack of democratic public space has a longer history than
   neoliberal urban planning, rooted in the period ofstate socialism when
   other policies of exclusion privileged certain social groups.},

Abstract = {Analysis described in the paper were made in the frame of the PROZA
   (Operational decision-making based on atmospheric conditions,
   http://projekt-proza.pl/) project co-financed by the European Union
   through the European Regional Development Fund. One of its tasks was to
   develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support
   different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing
   the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather
   conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of
   the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG
   (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were
   performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels
   collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and
   track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking
   method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the
   temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using
   principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main
   benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its
   efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of
   the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that
   correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena,
   which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the
   weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model)
   forecasts. The paper presents analysis of exemplary MCSs in the context
   of near real-time prediction system development and proves that
   developed tool can be helpful in MCSs monitoring.},

Title = {Variations of Ecosystem Services Supply and Demand on the Southeast
   Hilly Area of China: Implications for Ecosystem Protection and
   Restoration Management},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The balance between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) is
   an important prerequisite for maintaining the sustainability of
   ecological protection and restoration project implementation. However,
   research related to ecological protection and restoration is
   insufficient for the study of the demand for ecosystem services. Many
   ecological protection and restoration projects have been implemented in
   the Fujian Province, but the ESs and the relationship changes between
   supply and demand are not clear. In this study, multisource remote
   sensing and public data and the InVEST model were used to quantitatively
   assess and map four typical ESs, including food production, water yield,
   soil retention and carbon sequestration. Hotspot analysis was used to
   analyze the spatial cluster of the ESs supply-demand ratio. The results
   showed that: (1) there were trade-offs between supporting and regulating
   services, particularly between carbon sequestration and water yield
   services, and the strength of trade-offs or synergies between food
   production and other services was stronger in protection and restoration
   areas than in other areas; (2) the supply of ESs in the Fujian Province
   exceeded the demand, and the supply-demand ratio for ESs decreased from
   the mountainous regions in the northwest interior to the economically
   developed regions in the southeast coast; and (3) ecological restoration
   projects improved the relationship between supply and demand for some
   ESs, while other areas (except protection and restoration areas) had
   many low-value clusters of supply-demand ratios, especially regarding
   water yield and carbon sequestration services. Based on the results, our
   findings also provide suggestions for ensuring the sustainability of
   ecological protection and restoration in southeast hilly areas and other
   similar regions.},

Title = {Positive predictive value of stroke identification by ambulance

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Introduction/background Accurate prehospital identification of patients
   who had an acute stroke enables rapid conveyance to specialist units for
   time-dependent treatments such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy.
   Misidentification leads to patients who had a `stroke mimic' (SM) being
   inappropriately triaged to specialist units. We evaluated the positive
   predictive value (PPV) of prehospital stroke identification by ambulance
   clinicians in the North East of England. Methods This service evaluation
   linked routinely collected records from a UK regional ambulance service
   identifying adults with any clinical impression of suspected stroke to
   diagnostic data from four National Health Service hospital trusts
   between 1 June 2013 and 31 May 2016. The reference standard for a
   confirmed stroke diagnosis was inclusion in Sentinel Stroke National
   Audit Programme data or a hospital diagnosis of stroke or transient
   ischaemic attack in Hospital Episode Statistics. PPV was calculated as a
   measure of diagnostic accuracy. Results Ambulance clinicians in North
   East England identified 5645 patients who had a suspected stroke (mean
   age 73.2 years, 48\% male). At least one Face Arm Speech Test (FAST)
   symptom was documented for 93\% of patients who had a suspected stroke
   but a positive FAST was only documented for 51\%. Stroke, or transient
   ischaemic attack, was the final diagnosis for 3483 (62\%) patients. SM
   (false positives) accounted for 38\% of suspected strokes identified by
   ambulance clinicians and included a wide range of non-stroke diagnoses
   including infections, seizures and migraine. Discussion In this large
   multisite data set, identification of patients who had a stroke by
   ambulance clinicians had a PPV rate of 62\% (95\% CI 61 to 63). Most
   patients who had a suspected stroke had at least one FAST symptom, but
   failure to document a complete test was common. Training for stroke
   identification and SM rates need to be considered when planning service
   provision and capacity.},

Abstract = {Wetland is an important part of the natural ecosystem. The study of
   land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) and its prediction is of great
   significance to land-use optimization and ecological environment
   protection of wetlands. Based on the LULC data of Chongming Dongtan
   Wetland from 1986 to 2020, the paper analyzed the driving factors of
   LULCC and predicted the LULCC in the next 10 years by using CA-Markov
   model. The main land-use type of wetland is water, followed by
   cultivated land, and other types of land-use areas are small. The area
   of paddy fields, woodland and construction land continue to increase,
   while the grassland and mudflat continue to decrease. Waters are
   gradually transformed into natural wetlands due to sediment accumulation
   in nature reserves. Agricultural reclamation leads to large-scale
   conversion of natural wetlands into paddy fields in agricultural
   reclamation areas. The expansion of construction land and woodland has
   occupied a large scale of cultivated land. Economic development and
   agricultural population were the main driving factors of LULCC, with
   contribution rates of 69.02\% and 15.06\%, respectively. The impact on
   wetlands increased rapidly after 2002. Fiscal expenditure, agricultural
   and industrial output value explained wetland LULCC the most. In
   2020-2030 years, the area of mudflat and waters increase, the area of
   reed beach and grassland will continue to decrease. The area of
   cultivated land will decrease by 964.72hm(2). Woodland and construction
   land showed a downward trend different from the past. There was no
   obvious change in spatial distribution.},

Abstract = {The present study estimates snowmelt runoff in the Bhagirathi basin of
   the river Ganga using the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) with the freely
   available input datasets. A temperature index model WinSRM is used to
   calculate the discharge from simulated snowmelt runoff during 2010-2014.
   The variables of the model include precipitation, rainfall, air
   temperature, and snow cover area (SCA). Air temperature and
   precipitation are obtained from the MERRA-2 reanalysis and Indian
   Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data, respectively, over the
   delineated zones of the basin. The SCA is estimated using the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product: MOD10A2 data
   with an 8-day period or composite SCA of 500-m spatial resolution
   interpolated to a daily scale. Five-year simulation results show that
   the discharge maintains a high flow in monsoon with a mean value of
   375.50 m(3)/s. However, the model underestimates the average runoff
   volume by 7\% in 2013 and overestimates it by 10\% in 2010. The observed
   snow volume difference (D-v\%) is - 10.32 and + 4.36 for the years 2010
   and 2012, respectively. Measured and simulated discharge rates are found
   to be in agreement with correlation coefficients in the range of
   0.81-0.84 during the 2010-2014 period. Simulated discharge rates showed
   strong variability with typically highest values from mid-June to August
   (e.g. 3400.31 m(3)/s in 2013). The model also showed some additional
   peaks in September and June as seen in measurements during 2010, 2013,
   and 2014. Average runoff rates during the monsoon season (June-August)
   were estimated to be in the range of 478.69-689.23 m(3)/s during the
   study period. This study reveals the contiguity of the model results as
   compared with the real-time observations and indicates potential for
   improvement with the usage of satellite-derived inputs within the
   deviation limits. The findings from the study have implications for
   better monitoring of glacier health, snowmelt runoff, and natural
   resource management in the Himalayas, where meteorological and
   hydrological observations are limited.},

Abstract = {Introduction. This paper explores the notion and use of third space as
   conceptualised by Kuhlthau, Maniotes and Caspari on guided inquiry in
   information literacy and in human computer interaction literature.
   Creative processes are part in many academic disciplines. Information
   seeking triggers creativity in many ways, especially in learning
   processes. Virtual makerspaces can supplement educational virtual
   environments. This paper assesses the use of a third space lens for the
   planning of virtual makerspaces supporting academic creativity (based on
   findings from information behaviour studies), as seen from both
   information literacy and human computer interaction perspectives.
   Method. The paper is based on (i) findings from an empirical study in a
   creative academic context, (ii) scoping literature reviews of:
   creativity and information behaviour, search as learning, third space,
   and makerspaces.
   Analysis. Findings on information needs, information behaviour and
   creativity and search as learning are mapped against what an academic
   virtual makerspace can offer when applying a third space lens.
   Cognitive, affective, and physical perspectives are acknowledged.
   Findings. Both virtual academic makerspaces and third space holds value
   for information supportive environments for creativity and must build on
   findings on information behaviour.
   Conclusion. Further research should consider practical implementation.},

Title = {A Shift to Human Body Temperature (37°C) Rapidly Reprograms Multiple
   Adaptive Responses in <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> That Would
   Facilitate Niche Survival and Colonization},

Abstract = {One of the first environmental cues sensed by a microbe as it enters a
   human host is an upshift in temperature to 37 degrees C. In this dynamic
   time point analysis, we demonstrate that this environmental transition
   rapidly signals a multitude of gene expression changes in Escherichia
   coli. Bacteria grown at 23 degrees C under aerobic conditions were
   shifted to 37 degrees C, and mRNA expression was measured at time points
   after the shift to 37 degrees C (t = 0.5, 1, and 4 h). The first hour is
   characterized by a transient shift to anaerobic respiration strategies
   and stress responses, particularly acid resistance, indicating that
   temperature serves as a sentinel cue to predict and prepare for various
   niches within the host. The temperature effects on a subset of stress
   response genes were shown to be mediated by RpoS and directly correlated
   with RpoS, DsrA, and RprA levels, and increased acid resistance was
   observed that was dependent on 23 degrees C growth and RpoS. By 4 h,
   gene expression shifted to aerobic respiration pathways and decreased
   stress responses, coupled with increases in genes associated with
   biosynthesis (amino acid and nucleotides), iron uptake, and host
   defense. ompT, a gene that confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides,
   was highly thermoregulated, with a pattern conserved in enteropathogenic
   and uropathogenic E. coli strains. An immediate decrease in curli gene
   expression concomitant with an increase in flagellar gene expression
   implicates temperature in this developmental decision. Together, our
   studies demonstrate that temperature signals a reprogramming of gene
   expression immediately upon an upshift that may predict, prepare, and
   benefit the survival of the bacterium within the host.
   IMPORTANCE As one of the first cues sensed by the microbe upon entry
   into a human host, understanding how bacteria like E. coli modulate gene
   expression in response to temperature improves our understanding of how
   bacteria immediately initiate responses beneficial for survival and
   colonization. For pathogens, understanding the various pathways of
   thermal regulation could yield valuable targets for antiinfective
   chemotherapeutic drugs or disinfection measures. In addition, our data
   provide a dynamic examination of the RpoS stress response, providing
   genome-wide support for how temperature impacts RpoS through changes in
   RpoS stability and modulation by small regulatory RNAs.},

Abstract = {SENTINEL is a Coordinated Action funded by the European Commission under
   the specific program (EURATOM) for research and training in the nuclear
   energy field as part of the 6th Framework Program.
   The project deals with radiation protection, safety and related issues
   that arise as a result of new developments in equipment, digital
   imaging, medical devices and information technology industries,
   paralleled by novel practices and modalities. In practice, this project
   deals with almost all-radiological digital imaging, outside of Computed
   Tomography.
   This project is important as at present developments are entirely driven
   by combined and essential global forces of the industry on one hand and
   the clinical users on the other hand. There has been no parallel action
   in research on the protection, safety, efficacy, optimization,
   justification or ethical issues, despite a certain amount of regulatory
   development. This deficit is now evident, as day-to-day practice has
   outpaced the available statutory safety and standards framework. The
   undertakings of the project covers:
   Functional and Objective Equipment Performance and International
   Standards
   Dosimetry, Constancy Testing and QA
   Justification, Ethics, and Efficacy
   Guidelines, Good Practice, and Training Materials.
   The project underwrites the safety, efficacy and ethical aspects of
   clinical practice while protecting and adding value to the products and
   of the associated knowledge based equipment, information technology and
   service industries.
   The Coordination Action is divided into eight distinct but interrelated
   Work Packages: Functional Performance and Standards; Efficacy and Safety
   in Digital Radiology, Dentistry and Nuclear Medicine; Efficacy and
   Safety in Cardiology; Efficacy and Safety in Interventional Radiology;
   Efficacy and Safety in Population Screening/Sensitive Groups; Good
   Practice Guidance and Training.
   The intention of the present paper is to present the efforts of this
   Coordinated Action in the area of education and training.},

Title = {Parameters adaptive adjustment strategy of quantum communication channel
   in free-space based on software-defined quantum communication},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Quantum communication in free space will be disturbed by natural
   environment, such as fog, dust, and rain, which is a difficult problem
   in the construction of quantum communication system. In order to solve
   this problem and improve the survivability of quantum communication
   system, we propose an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy for
   free-space quantum communication based on software-defined quantum
   communication (SDQC). Firstly, we propose a software-defined quantum
   communication model based on the idea of software defined networks. The
   architecture of SDQC is divided into four layers: transport layer,
   access layer, control layer, and management layer. The SDQC system sends
   the link information to the preset program at a management level through
   the real-time monitoring of channel state by the access layer. According
   to the link information, the management level issues instructions to the
   control layer to adjust the parameters such as the initial quantum state
   and the existence time of single quantum state, in order to improve the
   quantum entanglement and fidelity. Secondly, we analyze the relationship
   between quantum fidelity and parameters in SDQC system under three noise
   channels, i.e. depolarization channel, spontaneous amplitude decay
   channel, and phase damping channel. In the depolarized channel, the
   quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase of the error probability
   P-d of the qubit. When the error probability of qubit is certain, the
   system has the maximum quantum fidelity with the value of parameter x is
   0.5. In the spontaneous amplitude decay channel, the quantum fidelity F
   decreases with the increase of the quantum state transition probability
   p(t). When the transition probability of quantum state is certain, the
   higher the value of parameter x, the higher the fidelity will be. In the
   phase-damped channel, the quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase
   of the probability p(c) with which the qubit and the background
   interference equivalent quantum state have complete elastic scattering.
   When the probability is certain, the larger the value of |1/2 - x|, the
   higher the quantum fidelity of the system will be. Finally, we study the
   optimal values of SDQC system parameters under different environmental
   disturbances. The simulation results show that the optimal parameters of
   SDQC system are different when the parameters of three noise channels,
   namely depolarization, spontaneous amplitude decay and phase damping,
   are different. The system adaptively selects the initial quantum state
   and the existence time of single quantum state according to the
   environmental change and business demand, so that the quantum fidelity
   is always at the peak in the communication process. This strategy
   effectively improves the adaptability and comprehensive immunity of the
   quantum communication system.},

Abstract = {Hai Phong city is located in the Northern coast of Vietnam where the
   mangroves are distributed between zone I and zone II among the four
   mangrove zones in Vietnam. This city is vulnerable to rising sea levels
   associated with climate change and tropical cyclones, which are
   forecasted to become more severe due to the impact of climate change. In
   the past, mangrove forests in this city have decreased markedly because
   of over expansion of shrimp farming. Thus, identification of mangrove
   forests is important to monitor and support mangrove conservation and
   management in the coastal zone. The objectives of this research were to
   identify the locations of mangrove and characterize mangrove species in
   Hai Phong using HH and HV backscatters of the Advanced Land Observing
   Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) with enhanced Phased Array L-band Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Image segmentation was used to identify the
   locations of mangrove forests. Moreover, Geographic Information System
   (GIS) was applied to update current status of mangrove species in 2015.
   The results showed that the means of HH and HV backscatter coefficients
   of K. obovata are lower than S. caseolaris. K. obovata has HH value
   around -13.9 dB until -10.3 dB and HV value around -20.6 dB until -16.2
   dB. Higher HH values between about -14.9 dB and -6.8 dB and HV values
   between roughly -20.6 dB and -14.3 dB have observed by S. caseolaris.
   The total area of mangrove forest in Hai Phong in the year 2015 was
   around 4084 hectares, of which S. caseolaris occupied over 68\% and
   mixed mangrove species was approximately 25.6\%. This research indicates
   the potential for the use of L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR in characterizing
   mangrove forest species in the coastal zone.},

Title = {Climate limits on European forest structure across space and time},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {168-178},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The structure of a forest dictates its function, vulnerability to
   mortality, and ecosystem services it provides. Many aspects of the
   environment and management determine forest structures, such as canopy
   height, stand density, carbon content, etc. Environmental factors, such
   as climate, limit the extent to which management can maximize structures
   of a forest. By understanding how climate limits forest structures over
   large landscapes we can better quantify the potential upper limit that a
   forest structure can achieve independent of management. Further, by
   quantifying how climate limits forest structures we can deepen our
   understanding of the impact climate change has had and will have on our
   forest resources and services. This type of information goes beyond
   quantifying how climate will impact the pools and fluxes of a forest,
   which is typically done for climate change studies over large
   landscapes. Estimating how climate change will impact structures will
   allow us to quantify how climate change will impact resources and
   services unquantifiable by pools and fluxes alone - such as
   biodiversity, habitat suitability, and market values. We quantified how
   maximum and minimum temperatures, and precipitation limit 3 forest
   structures, diameter at breast height, height, and basal area across the
   European continent. We found that climate zones exist that maximize each
   forest structure. Further, we estimated how climate change since the
   1950's has influenced the potential structures of European forests by
   assessing eight individual forests throughout Europe and then Europe as
   a whole. All three forest structures are limited in different ways
   depending on their location in Europe. Though some individual forests
   have seen a benefit from climate change, European forests on average
   have lost 5.0\%, 1.7\% and 6.5\% of potential forest diameter, height
   and basal area respectively. Further, the extremes of the climate values
   in our study, which may support endemic life, have already begun to
   vanish from the entire continent.},

Title = {Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of occult
   breast cancer: a SEER population-based study},
Journal = {CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {4381-4391},
Abstract = {Background: Occult breast cancer (OBC) is a rare type of breast cancer
   that has not been well studied. The clinicopathological characteristics
   and treatment recommendations for OBC are based on a limited number of
   retrospective studies and thus remain controversial.
   Patients and methods: We identified 479 OBC patients and 115,739 non-OBC
   patients from 2004 to 2014 in and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results (SEER) database. The clinicopathological characteristics and
   survival outcomes were compared between OBC and non-OBC patients. We
   used the propensity score 1:1 matching analysis to evaluate OBC vs
   non-OBC comparison using balanced groups with respect to the observed
   covariates. We further divided the OBC population into four groups based
   on different treatment strategies. Univariable and multivariable
   analyses were used to calculate and compare the four treatment outcomes
   within the OBC population.
   Results: OBC patients were older, exhibited a more advanced stage, a
   higher rate of negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor
   status, a higher rate of HER2-positive status, and a higher rate of >=
   10 positive lymph nodes, and were less likely to undergo surgical
   treatment than non-OBC patients. After adjustments for
   clinicopathological factors, the OBC patients exhibited a significantly
   better survival than the non-OBC patients (P<0.001). This result was
   confirmed in a 1:1 matched case -control analysis. Within the four OBC
   treatment groups, we observed no difference in survival among the
   mastectomy group, the breast-conserving surgery (BCS) group, and the
   axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)-only group. The multivariable
   analysis revealed that the sentinel lymph node dissection-only group had
   the worst prognosis (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: OBC has unique clinicopathological characteristics and a
   favorable prognosis compared with non-OBC. BCS plus ALND and
   radiotherapy showed a survival benefit that was similar to that of
   mastectomy for OBC patients.},

Abstract = {Vegetation cover on the coast of Bahia de Banderas, Nayarit, has been
   modified and reduced dramatically in recent decades because of tourism
   development, so that the objectives of this study were: (1) generate
   information on the composition, richness, and structural values of
   species of trees, shrubs and woody vines and (2) define the spatial
   distribution and the current cover of vegetation. The field sampling for
   the floristic and ecological information was conducted in 60 plots of
   1,000 m(2) each; and vegetation cover map was generated from satellite
   images. 43 families, 92 genera and 127 species were identified. The
   families with the highest number of species were Fabaceae,
   Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae and Malvaceae; 59 \% of the species were trees,
   34.6 \% shrubs and 6.4 \% woody vines. Two variants of tropical
   deciduous forest and three of tropical semideciduous forest, which
   together occupy 36 \% of the total area were recognized. The species
   with the highest relative importance value in the tropical semideciduous
   forest were Bursera simaruba, Brosimum alicastrum, Couepia polyandra,
   Ficus obtusifolia, Hippomane mancinella, Attalea cohune, Piper aduncum,
   and Pisonia aculeata. In the tropical deciduous forest species with
   higher relative importance value were Bursera instabilis, Cochlospermum
   vitifolium, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Ficus cotinifolia, Haematoxylum
   brasiletto, Lysiloma divaricatum, Lonchocarpus mutans, and Plumeria
   rubra. The tourism and agricultural development, the presence of species
   in a risk category, and small surface with natural vegetation, indicate
   the need of implementing management and conservation programs in this
   area of Nayarit.},

Title = {Recovery of renal function in Black South African patients with

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Objective:To describe recovery of renal function (RC) in Black South
   African patients with primary malignant hypertension (MHT) and end-stage
   renal failure, according to the type of dialysis provided.
   Design: A retrospective analysis of the records of 31 patients with MHT.
   Setting: A university-based, large tertiary-care hospital and its
   community-based satellite continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
   (CAPD) clinics.
   Patients: Only patients with renal failure caused by MHT and who were on
   dialysis between January 1997 and June 2000. There were 11 patients on
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) that regained renal function; 11 patients on
   hemodialysis (HD), none of whom recovered renal function; and 9 patients
   on PD who did not recover renal function during the same time period.
   Outcome Measures: The groups were investigated for variables that might
   predict RC.
   Results: Peritoneal dialysis compared with HD was highly significant as
   an indicator of RC (p < 0.0001), with 60\% of patients on PD regaining
   renal function, versus 0\% on HD. Median time to recovery was 300
   (150-365) days. There was no significant difference in decline of mean
   arterial pressure (MAP) between the groups; MAP declined significantly
   in all groups (p = 0.00002). All groups received similar drug therapy.
   In the RC group, initial MAP, kidney size, and urine output tended to be
   higher and creatinine lower (p = not significant). Dialysis adequacy was
   similar in the different groups.
   Conclusions: This retrospective study suggests there may be benefit from
   PD as the primary form of dialysis when patients have MHT as a cause of
   their renal failure. Possible predictors of RC include blood pressure
   control, initial MAP, initial serum creatinine, initial urine output,
   and kidney size. Time should be allowed for RC before transplantation is
   undertaken. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the benefit of
   CAPD in patients with MHT.},

Title = {Modelling responses of western Amazonian palms to soil nutrients},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {367-381},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the responses of individual plant species along different
   edaphic gradients is a key question in ecology, with implications to
   community assembly, functioning of forest ecosystems, niche theory and
   conservation planning. In tropical rain forests, responses to soil
   nutrients have been described only for a handful of species. Even
   abundant and conspicuous components of the forest, such as the palms
   (Arecaceae), remain largely unknown in this respect.
   We inventoried all palm species and analysed soil chemistry in 96 sites
   across western Amazonia to (i) assess the relative importance of some
   micronutrients vs. macronutrients as drivers of patterns in palm species
   composition, (ii) model the response shapes of 61 palm taxa and of
   canopy vs. understorey palms along gradients of selected soil nutrients,
   (iii) determine if the response shapes of conspecific palm varieties
   differ in relation to the most important observed soil nutrient and (iv)
   assess if the rank order of the most abundant canopy species changes
   along edaphic gradients.
   Patterns in palm species composition were best explained by Mehlich-III
   extractable exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg) and phosphorus (P), with the
   different palm species clearly separating along the soil cation
   concentration gradient. All 61 palm taxa exhibited statistical responses
   along soil nutrient gradients. Response shapes in relation to
   exchangeable bases varied among bimodal skewed (51\% of species),
   unimodal skewed (47\%) and monotonic (2\%).
   There were no significant differences between canopy vs. understorey
   species in their mean response shapes to the exchangeable bases, but
   canopy species had significantly higher mean optimum value for soil P
   and greater mean niche width along the Ca, K, Mg, P and boron (B)
   gradients. Varieties of the same species of Bactris, Desmoncus and
   Geonoma generally had different response shapes and different optima for
   the exchangeable bases.
   Synthesis. Among the soil variables we studied, macronutrients
   (especially exchangeable bases and P) emerged as more important than
   micronutrients in predicting species abundances in palm communities of
   western Amazonian non-inundated forests. Non-Gaussian responses were
   predominant, conspecific palm varieties exhibited different response
   types, and the rank order of dominance of canopy palms varied along the
   gradients of exchangeable bases and P. Together, these findings advance
   niche theory about palms and may be used for generating better
   predictive models of palm species distributions and for experimental
   studies that search for the physiological mechanisms underlying inter-
   and infra-specific trade-offs along edaphic gradients.},

Abstract = {Bird conservation Joint Ventures are collaborative partnerships between
   public agencies and private organizations that facilitate habitat
   management to support waterfowl and other bird populations. A subset of
   Joint Ventures has developed energetic carrying capacity models (ECCs)
   to translate regional waterfowl population goals into habitat objectives
   during the non-breeding period. Energetic carrying capacity models
   consider food biomass, metabolism, and available habitat to estimate
   waterfowl carrying capacity within an area. To evaluate Joint Venture
   ECCs in the context of waterfowl space use, we monitored 33 female
   mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 55 female American black ducks (A.
   rubripes) using global positioning system satellite telemetry in the
   central and eastern United States. To quantify space use, we measured
   first-passage time (FPT: time required for an individual to transit
   across a circle of a given radius) at biologically relevant spatial
   scales for mallards (3.46 km) and American black ducks (2.30 km) during
   the non-breeding period, which included autumn migration, winter, and
   spring migration. We developed a series of models to predict FPT using
   Joint Venture ECCs and compared them to a biological null model that
   quantified habitat composition and a statistical null model, which
   included intercept and random terms. Energetic carrying capacity models
   predicted mallard space use more efficiently during autumn and spring
   migrations, but the statistical null was the top model for winter. For
   American black ducks, ECCs did not improve predictions of space use; the
   biological null was top ranked for winter and the statistical null was
   top ranked for spring migration. Thus, ECCs provided limited insight
   into predicting waterfowl space use during the non-breeding season.
   Refined estimates of spatial and temporal variation in food abundance,
   habitat conditions, and anthropogenic disturbance will likely improve
   ECCs and benefit conservation planners in linking non-breeding waterfowl
   habitat objectives with distribution and population parameters.

Abstract = {The solar wind consists of electrons and ion species having kinetic
   energy K 10 keVs. Ion stream is mainly composed of protons. Their flux
   magnitude is especially important for radiation hardness assurance
   scientists who qualify materials for future space missions. Materials
   irreversibly degrade as soon as are exposed to solar radiation. Hence,
   proton differential and integral flux spectra play a crucial role in
   properly estimating radiation loads deposited within satellite
   functional components. Up to now, the wind fluxes were read out, e.g.,
   from figures made for specific periods of a solar cycle. This method is
   not effective and is a source of a flux, and further on, a fluence
   uncertainty. The objective of this work was to calculate and tabulate
   the solar wind differential and integral proton fluxes, which can be
   used further on to evaluatespace mission proton fluence spectra. Solar
   wind proton bulk velocity and number density from four space solar
   observatories (SOHO, ACE, WIND, and DSCOVR) were numerically processed
   to achieve that goal. Fluxes were tabulated and represented in calendar
   year periods.Now, the radiation hardness assurance community can quickly
   access, compute and compare SW proton fluxes from different energy
   ranges, calendar years, and satellite data sources. Proton fluxes
   presented here indicate magnitude variations along with the solar cycle
   period. A correlation between the number of sunspots and the proton
   average flux was found, i.e., the larger the number of spots, the larger
   the flux magnitude. More importantly, it was discovered that proton
   fluxes indicate huge variations in magnitude for a selected year based
   on different satellite data sources. For some years, the difference
   reaches 240\%. This value is reported for the first time and shows that
   to have a complete picture of the SW proton stream population, one must
   compare data from all four satellites. Also, it is reported that
   satellites, for a given calendar year, record different ranges of proton
   velocity and number density values. This finding, even stronger,
   suggests a necessity of comparing SW data from as many solar
   observatories as pos-sible. The spread in the proton flux magnitude
   (240\%) has a direct implication for planning and executing satellite
   material on-ground radiation test campaigns. Not carefully choosing
   aproton flux may result in a false impression of how examined material
   would degrade under an interplanetary space radiation environment.In
   this article, recommendations for selecting proper proton spectra are
   given.(c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In 1989, the Argentine government began a very deep reform of the
   country's economic system. Among the biggest changes, there was a wave
   of privatisations, accompanied by an accelerated transfer of functions
   from the national government to the provinces. The first ones included
   the telephone company and the national flag airline and were conducted
   with the goal of financing the stabilisation programme and gaining
   national and international credibility for the government, rather than
   increasing efficiency. A second privatisation wave took place in 1992,
   when the public enterprises that provided electricity, gas, petroleum
   and water were sold. This time the process was characterised by a
   greater concern towards efficiency. The latest transfers of public
   utilities to the private sector took place in 1997, and involved the
   airports and the national post office.
   Among the firms privatised by the Argentine government, there was the
   water and sewerage supplier for the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area
   (Obras Sanitarias de la Nacion, or OSN). It was also a trigger for other
   privatisations, since many provinces followed the national government's
   example and sold their own water companies. Water and sewerage is the
   infrastructure sector where Argentina is in the worst relative position.
   The coverage of sewerage services is low compared to other countries
   with similar levels of GDP per capita, and it is even lower for water
   services. The main difference between the privatisation of water and
   sewerage services and most other privatisations was that, while in other
   sectors the government directly sold the public firms, in this case the
   ownership of the company's asset, was not transferred. Instead a fixed
   terra 30 year concession was awarded to the firm that offered the lowest
   rate level without any disbursement.
   Focusing on the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area's concession, the
   regulatory tools for price regulation consist of a hybrid of price-cap
   and cost-plus systems. On one side, water and sewerage prices are
   individually capped, but whenever a cost index is greater than 7\%. the
   firm can file an ``extraordinary revision{''} to be allowed to increase
   tariffs beyond the cap ({''}passthrough{''}). Caps are based on a
   complex tariff structure determined by house and land values giving the
   firm no incentives to improve the quality of service and the clients do
   not have any incentive to use services rationally. The concession
   contract includes other regulatory instruments (goals for coverage and
   quality) and a specified level of investment. Related to that. there are
   also ``periodic revisions{''} (every 5 years) to examine the attainment
   of quality and coverage goals, the fulfilment of investment plans and
   the financial viability of those plans according to the rates. In terms
   of institutions. a special agency was created (ETOSS). ETOSS has six
   members that are chosen by political authorities, without parliamentary
   approval and is financed from a 2.7\% tax oil the firm's revenues. Some
   authors believe that the ETOSS has been captured in some way. But while
   the outcome of the latest renegotiations cannot be said to have been
   against the regulated firm, it took place without any intervention by
   ETOSS.
   The changing instances that followed the concession of the water and
   sewerage services in Argentina have clearly demonstrated that public
   utility regulation is an issue that may be subject to considerable
   uncertainty when renegotiations and contract revisions occur. The
   privatisation of OSN was probably unique in the sense that it was based
   on the idea of competition for monopoly rights, and its philosophy was
   that such competition was able to drive prices down to competitive
   levels. That idea proved to be right in the very, beginning (since water
   rates immediately dropped by 27\%). but it also created an environment
   where productive efficiency was not encouraged and almost everything was
   subject to renegotiation whenever the regulated firm was interested in
   it. Conclusions of this paper propose some changes which may guide the
   concession towards efficiency (a simpler rate system, quality and
   coverage Goals only instead of investment level goals. and an automatic
   rate adjustment mechanism based on the evolution of some simple index).},

Abstract = {This paper presents an automated approach for efficient detection of
   building regions in complex environments. We investigate the shadow
   evidence to focus on building regions, and the shadow areas are detected
   by recently developed false colour shadow detector. The directional
   spatial relationship between buildings and their shadows in image space
   is modelled with the prior knowledge of illumination direction. To do
   that, an approach based on fuzzy landscapes is presented. Once all
   landscapes are collected, a pruning process is applied to eliminate the
   landscapes that may occur due to non-building objects. Thereafter, we
   benefit from a graph-theoretic approach to accurately detect building
   regions. We consider the building detection task as a binary
   partitioning problem where a building region has to be accurately
   separated from its background. To solve the two-class partitioning, an
   iterative binary graph-cut optimization is performed. In this paper, we
   redesign the input requirements of the iterative partitioning from the
   previously detected landscape regions, so that the approach gains an
   efficient fully automated behaviour for the detection of buildings.
   Experiments performed on 10 test images selected from QuickBird (0.6 m)
   and Geoeye-1 (0.5 m) high resolution datasets showed that the presented
   approach accurately localizes and detects buildings with arbitrary
   shapes and sizes in complex environments. The tests also reveal that
   even under challenging environmental and illumination conditions (e.g.
   low solar elevation angles, snow cover) reasonable building detection
   performances could be achieved by the proposed approach.},

   LUQU COUNTY},

Abstract = {Using Landsat-NDVI data, this paper explores the spatiotemporal
   variation and future trends in the NDVI of grassland in Luqu County from
   1990-2017 and analyzes the driving mechanisms of the process via trend
   analysis, the Hurst index, and partial correlation analysis. It is found
   that (1) the grassland NDVI in Luqu County fluctuated greatly from 1990
   to 2017, and there were three time periods when the mean grassland NDVI
   decreased, from 1994 to 2000, from 2001 to 2007, and from 2015 to 2017,
   while from 2007 to 2015 the mean grassland NDVI in Luqu County slowly
   increased; (2) in Luqu County, the overall NDVI pattern of grassland
   shows the distribution characteristics of low in the central and
   southwestern regions and high in the northern and eastern regions, with
   the central low value area mainly located in the area of East Karshen
   Mountain south of Gaxiu Village of Gahai Township, the southwestern low
   value area mainly located in the border area with Maqu County, and the
   high value area located in the northern part of Luqu County and the
   Taohe River Basin in the east. Vegetation distribution becomes sparser
   as elevation increases. The mean NDVI value of grassland in the area
   above 3,800 meters above sea level gradually decreases; (3) the overall
   fractional vegetation cover of grassland in Luqu County shows an
   increasing trend, and the area distribution showing increasing trends,
   decreasing trends, and no significant changes accounts for 81.4\%,
   15.34\%, and 3.26\%, respectively. From the spatial distribution
   characteristics, the areas with significant decreases are mainly
   distributed around Gahai Lake, Luqu County, the scenic spot of Zecha
   Stone Forest, Gahai Township of National Highway 213, and the area
   around the transit section of Langmusi Township; (4) the reverse
   characteristics of grass vegetation change in Luqu County are stronger
   than the same-direction characteristics, and the areas with strong
   reverse characteristics are larger than the areas with strong
   same-direction characteristics. Therefore, in the future, the grassland
   NDVI in Luqu County will be under pressure of continuous deterioration;
   (5) precipitation and temperature are the main influencing factors of
   the grassland NDVI in Luqu County. The fluctuation in precipitation
   leads to the fluctuation in grassland coverage, and the increase in
   temperature has a negative impact on the grassland NDVI in Luqu County;
   (6) human activities have a two-way impact on the grassland NDVI in Luqu
   County. The growth in the number of local residents and foreign
   tourists, the expansion of builtup land, overgrazing, and industrial
   development have had a negative impact on the grassland NDVI. On the
   other hand, policy factors have played a positive role in the evolution
   of grassland coverage since 1990, especially a series of policies to
   promote grassland ecological protection and sustainable development.
   Cultivating grass for livestock, returning grazing to grass, ecological
   protection, herders' settlement, and ecological rewards and subsidies,
   have greatly improved the relationship between grassland residents and
   the grassland.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the first decadal reanalysis simulation of the
   biogeochemistry of the North West European shelf, along with a full
   evaluation of its skill, confidence, and value. An error-characterized
   satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a
   physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a
   localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis
   improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the
   study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had
   skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10
   ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and
   higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity,
   and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate,
   nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for
   partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The
   reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but
   not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing
   environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case
   studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf
   bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially
   threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed
   that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the
   total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\%
   confidence level. These results indicate that the reanalysis output data
   set can inform the management of the North West European shelf
   ecosystem, in relation to eutrophication, fishery, and variability of
   the carbon cycle.},

Title = {Understanding Tree-to-Tree Variations in Stone Pine (<i>Pinus pinea</i>
   L.) Cone Production Using Terrestrial Laser Scanner},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Kernels found in stone pinecones are of great economic value, often
   surpassing timber income for most forest owners. Visually evaluating
   cone production on standing trees is challenging since the cones are
   located in the sun-exposed part of the crown, and covered by two
   vegetative shoots. Very few studies were carried out in evaluating how
   new remote sensing technologies such as terrestrial laser scanners (TLS)
   can be used in assessing cone production, or in trying to explain the
   tree-to-tree variability within a given stand. Using data from 129 trees
   in 26 plots located in the Spanish Northern Plateau, the gain observed
   by using TLS data when compared to traditional inventory data in
   predicting the presence, the number, and the average weight of the cones
   in an individual tree was evaluated. The models using TLS-derived
   metrics consistently showed better fit statistics, when compared to
   models using traditional inventory data pertaining to site and tree
   levels. Crown dimensions such as projected crown area and crown volume,
   crown density, and crown asymmetry were the key TLS-derived drivers in
   understanding the variability in inter-tree cone production. These
   results underline the importance of crown characteristics in assessing
   cone production in stone pine. Moreover, as cone production (number of
   cones and average weight) is higher in crowns with lower density, the
   use of crown pruning, abandoned over 30 years ago, might be the key to
   increasing production in combination with stand density management.},

Title = {The small pelagic fishery of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania: What we know
   and what we need to know for management under climate change},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Small pelagic fish, including anchovies, sardines and sardinellas,
   mackerels, capelin, hilsa, sprats and herrings, are distributed widely,
   from the tropics to the far north Atlantic Ocean and to the southern
   oceans off Chile and South Africa. They are most abundant in the highly
   productive major eastern boundary upwelling systems and are
   characterised by significant natural variations in biomass. Overall,
   small pelagic fisheries represent about one third of global fish
   landings although a large proportion of the catch is processed into
   animal feeds. Nonetheless, in some developing countries in addition to
   their economic value, small pelagic fisheries also make an important
   contribution to human diets and the food security of many low-income
   households. Such is the case for many communities in the Zanzibar
   Archipelago and on mainland Tanzania in the Western Indian Ocean. Of
   great concern in this region, as elsewhere, is the potential impact of
   climate change on marine and coastal ecosystems in general, and on small
   pelagic fisheries in particular. This paper describes data and
   information available on Tanzania's small pelagic fisheries, including
   catch and effort, management protocols and socio-economic significance.
   Then, incorporating the rapidly improving understanding of the region's
   oceanography resulting from the application of remote sensing and
   oceanographic modelling, the paper undertakes the most complete
   assessment to date of the potential impacts of climate change on the
   small pelagic fishery of the Pemba Channel. Pathways of climate change
   impact are explored and crucial knowledge gaps, both in terms of the
   fishery itself and the wider ecosystem, are identified in order to guide
   future research activities. Although we analyse small pelagics in the
   specific context of the Pemba Channel, the key challenges identified in
   the analysis are likely to be relevant to many small pelagic fisheries
   in coastal nations heavily dependent on living marine resources.},

Title = {A Simple Method to Estimate Weed Control Threshold by Using RGB Images
   from Drones},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The estimation of the infestation level in a field and the consequent
   determination of the economic threshold is a basic requisite to
   rationalize post-emergence weeding. In this study, a simple and
   inexpensive procedure to determine the economic threshold based on weed
   cover is proposed. By using high-resolution RGB images captured by a
   low-cost drone, a free downloadable app for image processing and common
   spreadsheet software to perform the model parametrization, two different
   methods have been tested. The first method was based on the joint
   estimation of the two parameters involved in weed cover calculation,
   whereas the second method required the availability of further images
   for the separate estimation of the first parameter. The reliability of
   the two methods has been evaluated through the comparison with observed
   data and the goodness of fit in parameter calibration has been verified
   by calculating appropriate quality indices. The results showed an
   acceptable estimation of the weed cover value for the second method with
   respect to observed data (0.24 vs. 0.17 m(2) and 0.17 vs. 0.14 m(2), by
   processing images captured at 10 and 20 m, respectively), whereas the
   estimations obtained with the first method were disappointing (0.35 vs.
   0.17 m(2) and 0.33 vs. 0.14 m(2), by processing images captured at 10
   and 20 m, respectively).},

Title = {Technology Roadmapping Architecture Based on Knowledge Management: Case
   Study for Improved Indigenous Coffee Production from Guerrero, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Having demonstrated its importance for economic and human developments,
   technological change is considered one of the biggest supports
   worldwide. Today, with the population increase, the inclusion of
   technology is considered the most appropriate way to reduce the impact
   of this challenge. Considering 171 indigenous coffee producers from
   Paraje Montero and Tierra Colorada from Guerrero, Mexico, the present
   study proposes technological routes for the indigenous coffee production
   chain and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as sensors,
   actuators, and processing devices basing on the requirements of the
   chain. During face-to-face sessions, questionaries, field visits, and
   literature review for knowledge management, the results expose the need
   of effective actions against diseases and the reduction of climate
   change, lack of infrastructure, old plantations, and lack of
   commercialization channels; for these and considering the requirement of
   greenhouse technology by indigenous coffee producers and following the
   labor value driver of the digital compass, the necessity of several
   kinds of sensors, technologies, and methodologies has been identified
   with high possibilities to be implemented by similar producers analyzed
   in this manuscript to help in solving the problems identified in this
   work. The combination of remote sensing, signal processing, and
   spectroscopy could be employed to explore mineralogical features of soil
   and help problems with fertilization; sensor modules to collect
   temperature, humidity, and light intensity data are a priority for
   greenhouse monitoring; electrochemical sensors and optical technologies
   could be of great help to detect the presence of diseases in coffee
   plants; and the installation of a greenhouse solar dryer is necessary to
   reduce the time of the sun drying process and protect the coffee cherry.
   These emerging technologies will help to improve the production of
   coffee. The study contributes to identify a technology roadmap proposing
   technological implements according to indigenous coffee production chain
   requirements and serves as support for future studies in indigenous
   regions.},

Title = {Considerations in the Treatment of Osteoporotic Distal Radius Fractures
   in Elderly Patients},
Journal = {CURRENT REVIEWS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-56},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewWith the incidence of distal radius fractures
   increasing in the elderly population, we sought to summarize the current
   orthopedic and medical management of these fractures in the elderly
   osteoporotic population.Recent FindingsThe number of osteoporotic
   patients undergoing surgical fixation for distal radius fractures has
   increased in recent years. This is likely due to the improved outcomes
   seen with volar locking plates, as well as an increase in the number of
   fellowship-trained hand surgeons. Despite this potential improvement in
   acute fracture management, a majority of these patients are
   underdiagnosed and undertreated for their underlying osteoporosis or
   endocrinopathies. The implementation of fracture liaison services and
   the ability of the treating orthopedist to recognize this gap in patient
   care result in a higher number of patients initiating appropriate
   treatment.SummaryIt is vital that when discussing acute fracture
   management, a thorough discussion is had with patients regarding
   functional outcome and the benefits of both surgical and non-operative
   management. As these fractures become more prevalent and a greater
   percentage undergo surgical intervention, the economic burden of distal
   radius fractures will continue to rise. It is imperative that the
   treating surgeon view these fractures as sentinel events that are
   predictive of future hip and vertebral fractures. While relatively new,
   the use of fracture liaison services to help aide in proper screening
   and treatment of osteoporotic patients is of great value.
   Non-pharmacologic therapy such as physical therapy, smoking and alcohol
   cessation programs, and dietary modifications are crucial in treating
   patients with osteoporosis. While bisphosphonates remain the first-line
   treatment in patients with osteoporosis, novel therapies show promise
   for future use.},

Title = {Machine Learning for Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence in Changsha: An
   Innovative Investigation into the Introduction of a Forest Fuel Factor},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Affected by global warming and increased extreme weather, Hunan Province
   saw a phased and concentrated outbreak of forest fires in 2022, causing
   significant damage and impact. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires
   can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early
   warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in
   China's forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the
   overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire
   occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation,
   topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the
   occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel
   moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of
   forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology,
   topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along
   with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and
   evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a
   database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was
   constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built
   using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the
   Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive
   Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified
   using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with
   an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in
   predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the
   GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model,
   which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest
   fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse
   Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire
   probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal
   distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied
   significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and
   December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The
   highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern
   regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of
   forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy
   evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was
   identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability
   prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that
   vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence
   on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors,
   and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in
   Changsha City.},

Title = {Assessment of long-term ground subsidence and groundwater depletion in
   Hanoi, Vietnam},
Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {299},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization and population growth in Hanoi city raise the demand
   for groundwater and the risk of land subsidence. This study is the first
   to conduct a long-term interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)
   analysis with different SAR sensors including ALOS, COSMO-SkyMed and
   Sentinel-1 to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of subsidence in
   Hanoi between 2007 and 2018. The results show that subsidence in Central
   Hanoi had been diminishing during these 12 years, while the southern and
   western outskirts (Ha Dong and Hoai Duc district) had become hot spots
   with peak rates of \~{}50 mm/yr. We further model the subsidence
   time-series with 22 years of piezometric records to estimate
   hydrogeological properties in the area. The modeling yields a mean
   consolidation coefficient of 0.56 m2/yr, a value typical for aquitards
   composed of > 90\% fine-grain materials. The model also predicts another
   0.5-1.3 m of subsidence in Ha Dong by the end of this century. Based on
   these results, we propose zoning for subsidence susceptibility as the
   basis for future groundwater management in Hanoi. From a regional
   perspective, Hanoi is relatively less affected by land subsidence
   compared to other South East Asian cities due to geotechnical factors
   including small consolidation coefficients, as well as social factors
   such as lower population density.},

Title = {Modis Derived Vegetation and Aridity Indices Account for Spatial
   Variation in Desertification Risk Index in Dry Environment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-63},
Abstract = {It was estimated annually that several thousands of hectares (ha) of
   land has been lost to desertification and the negative impacts are
   manifested on the environment and general livelihood of people; reduced
   capacity to provide for the basic needs such as food and water. Although
   this is true of many countries in Sub Sahara Africa, yet the spatial
   pattern of the level of desertification and the areas at risk has not
   been sufficiently quantified and mapped. This study is aimed at
   determining and mapping the spatial extent of desertification risk index
   in the 9 frontline states of Northern Nigeria and to identify areas and
   population that are at risk given the current condition to enhance
   mitigation and adaptation strategy plan. We used both aridity and
   vegetation indices in combination with elevation and urban/settlement
   population data to determine and mapped the risk of desertification in
   the nine frontline states. To obtain aridity index we used De Martonne
   aridity index (lar-DM) equation; this was calculated from the raster
   layers of mean annual temperature (MAT) and total annual precipitation
   (TAP) using map algebra. To monitor vegetation conditions we used eMODIS
   NDVI 10-day maximum-value composite MVC NDVI images at 250m spatial
   resolution. We created desertification risk index map from spatial
   overlay of NDVI/vegetation cover, elevation, population and aridity
   index. The study shows that aridity in the study area increases
   northward in curvilinear pattern as 75 \% (430,650 km(2)) of the region
   falls into three aridity categories: arid, semi-arid and dry sub humid
   while the remaining 25\% (33,000 km(2)) found in southern Kebbi,
   Zamfara, Katsina and Bauchi falls under sub humid. Aridity index as
   proximate of the desertification was however found to be inadequate as
   the combination of vegetation index produced desertification risk index
   (DRI) map which has helped to identify ``hot spot{''} these are places
   where risks to desertification are higher than their surrounding areas.
   Suggestions such as sound land management, energy substitution strategy
   are made to combat the menace of desertification with special attention
   placed on these highly vulnerable ``hot spot{''} areas.},

Title = {Internationalization of higher education in Vietnam: current situations,

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {227-241},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Purpose The research aims to provide the basis for a better
   understanding of the internationalization of higher education in
   Vietnam. First, it examines Vietnam's higher education reforms and
   policy/ legal frameworks for the promotion of internationalization since
   the implementation of Doi Moi in 1986. Secondly, it analyzes the
   internationalization activities at the national and institutional
   levels. At both levels, the internationalization activities are
   categorized into internationalization at home and cross borders (Knight,
   2012). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges Vietnamese HE is
   facing and presents policy directions. Design/methodology/approach This
   study employs a case study research strategy to examine and gain
   understanding of internationalization of higher education in Vietnam as
   a phenomenon. The study collected detailed information using a variety
   of data collection procedures over a period of time. First, it analyzes
   Vietnam's higher education reforms as well as policy and legal framework
   for the promotion of internationalization. Then, using Knight's
   framework, the study analyzed the internationalization at home and
   crossborder educational activities at the national and institutional
   levels. At the national level, strategic policy goals and programs were
   explored. Then, it chose Vietnam National University- Hanoi as a
   institutional case to learn its institutional strategies on cross border
   programs and mobility, reputation building, research cooperation.
   Findings Vietnam has continuously reformed its legal and policy
   framework of higher education to better integrate into the global higher
   education market and also to meet the national demand for economic
   development. Predominant rationale for Vietnam to engage in crossborder
   programs is for brain development, specifically in the academics and
   public sector. Meanwhile internationalization at home is driven by (1)
   international programs and universities and (2) initiative to enhance
   competitiveness of its higher education institutes. Vietnam hosts
   different models of international universities, including classical,
   satellite and co-founded. However, issues and challenges remain, such as
   poor lack of systematic cooperation and coordination at the governmental
   level, retaining talents, and finally finances. Originality/value
   Written for the special edition on Internationalization of Higher
   Education in the Era of SDGs: Asia-Pacific Perspective, the study aims
   to provide a basis for understanding the current situation of
   internationalization higher education in Vietnam and how it compares to
   its partners in the region. This study is unique as it provides a
   two-layer analysis, at the national and institutional levels capturing
   macro and micro perspectives in one scene. In addition, this study
   includes rich empirical data, which was rare in previous literature due
   to limited access.},

Title = {A monitoring and feedback tool embedded in a counselling protocol to
   increase physical activity of patients with COPD or type 2 diabetes in
   primary care: study protocol of a three-arm cluster randomised
   controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC FAMILY PRACTICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Physical activity is important for a healthy lifestyle.
   Although physical activity can delay complications and decrease the
   burden of the disease, the level of activity of patients with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2)
   is often far from optimal. To stimulate physical activity, a monitoring
   and feedback tool, consisting of an accelerometer linked to a smart
   phone and webserver (It's LiFe! tool), and a counselling protocol for
   practice nurses in primary care was developed (the Self-management
   Support Program). The main objective of this study is to measure the
   longitudinal effects of this counselling protocol and the added value of
   using the tool.
   Methods/Design: This three-armed cluster randomised controlled trial
   with 120 participants with COPD and 120 participants with DM2 (aged
   40-70), compares the counselling protocol with and without the use of
   the tool (group 1 and 2) with usual care (group 3). Recruitment takes
   place at GP practices in the southern regions of the Netherlands.
   Randomisation takes place at the practice level. The intended sample
   (three arms of 8 practices) powers the study to detect a 10-minute
   difference of moderate and intense physical activity per day between
   groups 1 and 3. Participants in the intervention groups have to visit
   the practice nurse 3-4 times for physical activity counselling, in a
   4-6-month period. Specific activity goals tailored to the individual
   patient's preferences and needs will be set. In addition, participants
   in group 1 will be instructed to use the tool in daily life. The primary
   outcome, physical activity, will be measured in all groups with a
   physical activity monitor (PAM). Secondary outcomes are quality of life,
   general - and exercise - self-efficacy, and health status. Follow-up
   will take place after 6 and 9 months. Separately, a process evaluation
   will be conducted to explore reasons for trial non-participation, and
   the intervention's acceptability for participating patients and nurses.
   Discussion: Results of this study will give insight into the effects of
   the It's LiFe! monitoring and feedback tool combined with care from a
   practice nurse for people with COPD or DM2 on physical activity.},

Title = {Models of Earth's main magnetic field incorporating flux and radial
   vorticity constraints},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-144},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We describe a new technique for implementing the constraints on magnetic
   fields arising from two hypotheses about the fluid core of the Earth,
   namely the frozen-flux hypothesis and the hypothesis that the core is in
   magnetostrophic force balance with negligible leakage of current into
   the mantle. These hypotheses lead to time-independence of the integrated
   flux through certain `null-flux patches' on the core surface, and to
   time-independence of their radial vorticity. Although the frozen-flux
   hypothesis has received attention before, constraining the radial
   vorticity has not previously been attempted. We describe a
   parametrization and an algorithm for preserving topology of radial
   magnetic fields at the core surface while allowing morphological
   changes. The parametrization is a spherical triangle tesselation of the
   core surface. Topology with respect to a reference model (based on data
   from the Oersted satellite) is preserved as models at different epochs
   are perturbed to optimize the fit to the data; the topology preservation
   is achieved by the imposition of inequality constraints on the model,
   and the optimization at each iteration is cast as a bounded value
   least-squares problem. For epochs 2000, 1980, 1945, 1915 and 1882 we are
   able to produce models of the core field which are consistent with flux
   and radial vorticity conservation, thus providing no observational
   evidence for the failure of the underlying assumptions. These models are
   a step towards the production of models which are optimal for the
   retrieval of frozen-flux velocity fields at the core surface.},

   city center of Erzurum, by examining the spatial, structural and
   functional transformation with the abolition of borders while
   transforming into a cafe/restaurant. These traditional Erzurum houses
   are located at the intersection of Rasit Pasa and Salih Yuzbasi Streets
   in Ibrahim Pasa District, which is one of the historical settlements in
   the south west of Inner Castle. Houses once used independently began to
   be used as a single building with a number of changes made in the plan
   layout. However, during the change of function, facade layout and
   numerous spaces intertwined under the same roof and this made it
   difficult to understand the original plan scheme of the buildings. As
   there is a lack of documentation of the changes made and the presence of
   ambiguity in the different verbal information sources about the
   buildings, the main problem of this study is to determine the number of
   houses the cafe/restaurant consists of. Other important problems are the
   determination of the boundaries and the spatial organization of the
   houses. In addition, the scarcity of written sources in literature about
   these historic adjacent houses, which are numerous but more modest in
   the urban fabric compared with the two-story independent houses,
   increases the importance of this study. In order to reveal the changes
   and transformation of a group of traditional Erzurum houses built
   independently but adjacent to each other, first of all, traditional
   Erzurum houses were examined architecturally under the headings of
   location, plan and facade layout, material and construction technique
   properties. Then the architectural features and possible traces of
   change on this group of buildings, which were not mentioned in any
   source or document, were revealed in terms of location and plan
   features. After documentation of the current situation, property deeds,
   cadastral plans, satellite images, old photographs, historical and
   current maps, traces of the buildings themselves, information about
   traditional Erzurum houses and comparative studies were used to
   understand the different building phrases and restitution of the plan of
   these buildings. When the archive documents are evaluated, it is
   understood that the group of buildings were built in the second half of
   the 18th century according to Nene Saliha Hanim's Foundation record
   dated to 1791-92. Also, parcel numbers with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 belong to
   a foundation named ``Nene Saliha Hanim{''} and parcel numbers with 5,
   15, 16, 17, 18, 41 and 42 belong to private property according to the
   land registers. Within the building group, in addition to eight
   independent houses analyzed spatially, functionally and structurally,
   the external body walls and garden boundaries of at least two more
   houses, which do not exist currently, were identified. Possibly, a khan
   might have existed in the place of one. Unlike the traditional Erzurum
   houses mentioned in the literature, these houses, for which a
   restitution is prepared, have a simple spatial organization consisting
   of one or two rooms. The studied houses, which contain many clues about
   the social and cultural life style of the old Erzurum city, yet which
   are decreasing in number, should be registered as cultural assets by the
   relevant Conservation Board.
   Additionally, the reconstruction permit decision given in the
   Conservation Development Plan for this region that conforms to many
   protection criteria such as historical, architectural, continuity,
   rarity and memorial value with its structure, parcel and streets should
   be re-evaluated. This study is important as it reveals that these
   single-story houses, which are stacked in a building block on a
   traditional street texture, with modest architectural organization
   should be part of the relevant literature on traditional Erzurum houses,
   which mainly deals with independent separate two-story houses owned by
   wealthy families. In addition, it is stated for the first time in the
   literature with this study that the parcels inside the building block
   get access to the main street through a common closed inner street, in
   contrast to the houses lined up adjacent to each other on independent
   lots on the street.},

Abstract = {The ability to monitor plant nutrient status of high value horticultural
   crops and to adjust seasonal nutrient supply via fertilizer application
   has economic and environmental benefits. Recent technological advances
   may enable growers and field consultants to conduct this type of
   monitoring nondestructively in the future. Using the perennial crop
   apple (Malus domestica) and the annual crop potato (Solanum tuberosum),
   a hand-held leaf reflectance meter was used to evaluate leaf nitrogen
   (N) status throughout the growing season. In potato, this meter showed
   good correlation with leaf blade N content. Both time of day and time of
   season influenced leaf meter measurement, but leaf position did not. In
   apple, three different leaf meters were compared: the leaf spectral
   reflectance meter and two leaf greenness meters. Correlation with both N
   rate and leaf N content were strongest for the leaf reflectance meter
   early in the season but nonsignificant late in the season, whereas the
   leaf greenness meters gave weak but significant correlations throughout
   the growing season. The tapering off of leaf reflectance values found
   with the hand-held meter is consistent with normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) values calculated from satellite images from the
   same plots. Overall, the use of leaf spectral reflectance shows promise
   as a tool for nondestructive monitoring of plant leaf status and would
   enable multiple georeferenced measurements throughout a field for
   differential N management.},

Title = {An Integrated Experimental Design for the Assessment of Multiple

Abstract = {Background: For nearly five decades long-term studies in rodents have
   been the accepted benchmark for assessing chronic long-termtoxic
   effects, particularly carcinogenicity, of chemicals. The European Food
   Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have
   pointed out that the current set of internationally utilized test
   methods capture only some of the potential adverse effects associated
   with exposures to these agents over the lifetime.
   Objectives: In this paper, we propose the adaption of the
   carcinogenicity bioassay to integrate additional protocols for
   comprehensive long-term toxicity assessment that includes developmental
   exposures and long-term outcomes, capable of generating information on a
   broad spectrum of different end points.
   Discussion: An integrated study design based on a stepwise process is
   described that includes the priority end points of the Economic
   Co-operation and Development and the National Toxicology Program
   guidelines on carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity and developmental and
   reproductive toxicity. Integrating a comprehensive set of relevant
   toxicological end points in a single protocol represents an opportunity
   to optimize animal use in accordance with the 3Rs (replacement,
   reduction and refinement). This strategy has the potential to provide
   sufficient data on multiple windows of susceptibility of specific
   interest for risk assessments and public health decision-making by
   including prenatal, lactational, neonatal exposures and evaluating
   outcomes over the lifespan.
   Conclusion: This integrated study design is efficient in that the same
   generational cohort of rats used for evaluating long-term outcomes can
   be monitored in satellite parallel experiments to measure biomarkers and
   other parameters related to system-specific responses including
   metabolic alterations and endocrine disturbances.

Title = {UAV-based partially sampling system for rapid NDVI mapping in the
   evaluation of rice nitrogen use efficiency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Rapid acquisition and mapping of normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) values is essential for a timely evaluation of nitrogen use
   efficiency (NUE) in sustainable agriculture. The zonal nutrient
   management techniques for sustainable agriculture require timely and
   efficient NDVI data collection and analysis capabilities, - a need that
   is still rarely addressed. However, as with the use of manned aircraft,
   the primary limitation of established unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   imaging technologies is the limited time window for large-area data
   collection. Furthermore, as the spatial resolution increases, the
   post-processing time generally becomes longer. To overcome problems
   associated with the need for rapid data acquisition and post-processing,
   we have developed a UAV-based sensor system called the Accurate and
   Speed Scanner (AS-Scanner). The data acquisition accuracy and NDVI
   mapping speed of the system were assessed. According to the results of a
   ground-level experiment, the mean absolute error (MAE) between the
   reflectance data of the AS-Scanner and the corresponding data of the ASD
   FieldSpec 3 spectrometer is less than 1.11\%. Furthermore, results of a
   plot-level experiment suggest that the NDVI values of a raw point cloud
   from AS-Scanner-based UAV platform (AS-NDVI) and UAV-mounted Mica-Sense
   RedEdge camera (REG-NDVI) are highly correlated (0.54 < R-2 < 0.57, p <
   0.01). In a map-level experiment, the interpolated, 15 m x 15 m pixel
   size AS-NDVI values were in good agreement with the REG-NDVIs over a
   4.01 ha (40100 m(2)) rice field (0.55 < R-2 < 0.65, p < 0.01). The
   average processing times of the inverse distance weighted (IDW, 0.45 s),
   kriging linear (KL, 0.73 s), and nearest neighbor (NN, 1.05 s)
   interpolations of the AS-Scanner data prove that it is possible to
   efficiently create NDVI maps using data from the sensor. Besides, the
   effect of the varying solar irradiance values on the AS-NDVIs was
   analyzed under varied illumination conditions. Moreover, the AS-NDVIs
   were also used to assess the NUE in a paddy rice field at the panicle
   stage. The results show that nutrients can be effectively assessed using
   AS-Scanner data. Despite some disadvantages such as the potential of
   NDVI value saturation over dense canopies, the AS-Scanner provides a
   method for quickly obtaining reasonable spatial resolution crop
   information for agricultural nutrient monitoring and management. This
   also offers the potential to reduce environmental pressure which may be
   caused by untimely estimation of NUE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Oyster reefs and seagrass beds are being lost worldwide at alarming
   rates. These habitats provide many services to humankind and, thus, much
   effort has been dedicated to their restoration. Here, we examine the
   efficacy of created oyster reefs at enhancing seagrass beds through the
   amelioration of hydrographic conditions and water quality. We carried
   out a field experiment in the Northern Gulf of Mexico where we compared
   areas shoreward of created reefs with adjacent reef-free areas over
   several years using a before-after control-impact (BACI) design. The
   reefs were built with oyster shell, measured 65 m, and were placed at
   circa 100 m from the shoreline to ensure subtidal conditions and enhance
   oyster recruitment. The BACI results showed few and disparate effects of
   the reefs, even when distance from the reef was factored in. However, we
   found a temporal increase in seagrass cover throughout all the
   experimental area (i.e. including both reef and control plots) following
   reef deployment. Interestingly, further analysis with satellite imagery
   showed the experimental area had higher seagrass cover 5 years after
   reef deployment than it did before reef deployment, but such increase
   was not observed for nearby areas. In concert, the results suggest
   ``shadow{''} effects for the reefs examined, where positive effects on
   seagrass beds extend beyond the area directly shoreward from the reef.
   Oyster reef restoration may have positive impacts on shallow seagrass
   beds in turbid, high-energy systems; however, more work on the extent
   and mechanisms for this interaction is needed.},

Abstract = {The accelerated sea level rise and its resulting impacts on the highly
   populated coastal regions bearing significant economic value is one of
   the negative outcomes of climate change. In this study, the most
   vulnerable areas regarding sea level rise in Turkey are defined through
   CVI analysis, and the level of inundation is estimated from
   multi-mission satellite altimetry sea level anomaly, together with
   significant wave heights and the effects of tidal and meteorological
   forcing. Consequently, the maximum level of flooding that is expected to
   occur by 2100 reaches up to 6.7 m in Cukurova Delta which is one of the
   most vulnerable areas of the country, and GIS-based inundation mapping
   on the high resolution elevation model indicates that 69\% of the area
   would be under the risk of flooding. Considering the probable sea level
   rise in Cukurova by the end of this century, immediate adaptive measures
   must be undertaken for the protection of the coastal zone. In addition,
   it will be of utmost importance to make an inventory of the vulnerable
   zones comprising coastal aquifers and ecosystems, and to introduce
   adaptive long-term strategies related to local coastal zone management
   plans.},

Abstract = {Land cover is one of the key terrestrial variables used for monitoring
   and as input for modelling in support of achieving the United Nations
   Strategical Development Goals. Global and Continental Land Cover
   Products (GCLCs) aim to provide the required harmonized information
   background across areas; thus, they are not being limited by national or
   other administrative nomenclature boundaries and their production
   approaches. Moreover, their increased spatial resolution, and
   consequently their local relevance, is of high importance for users at a
   local scale. During the last decade, several GCLCs were developed,
   including the Global Historical Land-Cover Change Land-Use Conversions
   (GLC), the Globeland-30 (GLOB), Corine-2012 (CLC) and GMES/ Copernicus
   Initial Operation High Resolution Layers (GIOS). Accuracy assessment is
   of high importance for product credibility towards incorporation into
   decision chains and implementation procedures, especially at local
   scales. The present study builds on the collaboration of scientists
   participating in the Global Observations of Forest CoverGlobal
   Observations of Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC-GOLD), South Central and
   Eastern European Regional Information Network (SCERIN). The main
   objective is to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of commonly used
   GCLCs at selected representative study areas in the SCERIN geographic
   area, which is characterized by extreme diversity of landscapes and
   environmental conditions, heavily affected by anthropogenic impacts with
   similar major socio-economic drivers. The employed validation strategy
   for evaluating and comparing the different products is detailed,
   representative results for the selected areas from nine SCERIN countries
   are presented, the specific regional differences are identified and
   their underlying causes are discussed. In general, the four GCLCs
   products achieved relatively high overall accuracy rates: 74-98\% for
   GLC (mean: 93.8\%), 79-92\% for GLOB (mean: 90.6\%), 74-91\% for CLC
   (mean: 89\%) and 72-98\% for GIOS (mean: 91.6\%), for all selected
   areas. In most cases, the CLC product has the lower scores, while the
   GLC has the highest, closely followed by GIOS and GLOB. The study
   revealed overall high credibility and validity of the GCLCs products at
   local scale, a result, which shows expected benefit even for
   local/regional applications. Identified class dependent specificities in
   different landscape types can guide the local users for their reasonable
   usage in local studies. Valuable information is generated for advancing
   the goals of the international GOFC-GOLD program and aligns well with
   the agenda of the NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program to improve the
   quality and consistency of space-derived higher-level products.},

Abstract = {The increasing loss of N and P is one of the greatest negative global
   consequences of agricultural advance. The aim of this study was to
   calculate an apparent N and P balance in the county of Benito Juarez
   during the 1989/90, 2002/03 and 2011/12 agroproductive periods, and
   relating the results achieved with the agriculture surface in each
   campaign. Initially, the N and P balance indicator was applied in all
   three campaigns. Then, the loss of nutrients per unit surface was
   established, based on data from satellite images of the county and the
   value of the N and P balances. As a result, remarkable temporal
   variations were observed with respect to the fertilized surfaces and the
   applied doses. Likewise, the growth of the agricultural area and
   alterations in the production values and yield of the crops stand out.
   The balances of both nutrients were negative in the three campaigns,
   showing a continuous generation of deficit balances, whit greater loss
   of tn of N than P per surface unit (km(2)). Obviously, agricultural
   sustainability is affected, so this study shows the nutrient situation
   in the county, establishing the need for a sustainable management of
   fertilization.},

Abstract = {Sea lice are marine ectoparasitic copepods that infect a wide range of
   fish and other species. Salmonid fish in their marine phase are infected
   by a variety of generalist Caligus species (in Scotland C. elenogatus)
   and the salmonid specialist Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Cost of salmon lice
   is estimated to be sic305M damage worldwide and have also been
   associated with declines in wild salmonid populations.
   Sea lice undergo a planktonic larval phase that consists of two
   non-infectious naupliar stages and the infectious copepodid stage.
   During this planktonic phase the larvae are transported by marine
   currents and so it is of crucial importance for our understanding of how
   lice on different host populations may interact. This is important for
   protecting wild fish and for identifying groups of farms that would
   benefit most strongly from coordinated management.
   We therefore are developing a model of the Loch Linnhe system in the
   western Highlands of Scotland using a modelling approach first developed
   for the smaller Loch Torridon system. Loch Linnhe is Scotland's largest
   sea loch (fjord) being more than 60 km long and containing 10 salmon
   farms operated by two companies. A coupled hydrodynamic-particle model
   is used to derive the distribution of lice under different environmental
   forcing. The hydrodynamic model used is POLCOMS with a 100 m horizontal
   resolution and 15 minute time-step in the first instance. This model is
   forced using tidal forcing at the mouth of the loch (Firth of Lorn and
   Sound of Mull), winds, and freshwater inputs from rivers and side lochs.
   The particle model describes the development of the larvae through the
   different stages and their mortality. Development rate is strongly
   temperature dependent; lice take about 3.6 days from hatching to become
   infectious at 10 degrees C but much longer at lower temperatures.
   Mortality rate is highly sensitive to salinity, increasing rapidly once
   salinity drops below 29 ppt.
   Initial results show that the larvae can be transported over large
   distances, sometimes 20-30 km from their source, before becoming
   infectious. Here they can form elevated but localised concentrations.
   Copepodids may be absent from their parents' hosts.
   A sampling programme has been initiated to validate the model
   predictions. Data has been obtained for May 2011 and a second validation
   exercise is planned for October 2011; further validation data will be
   obtained in 2012 and 2013. The validation consists of the collection of
   hydrodynamic and forcing data, using plankton tows to detect larval lice
   (all phases), and sentinel fish to attract the infectious copepodids.
   The initial sampling was carried out in May 2011 under extremely
   difficult conditions of south-westerly winds reaching up to 85 mph.
   Despite this, planktonic tows were completed for 30 of the planned 31
   locations, 9 out of 10 sentinel cages were recovered, and hydrographic
   measurements were taken. Useful data was thus obtained under poor
   weather conditions which give confidence that validation will be
   practicable under a representative range of forcing conditions.
   The model will be used to evaluate where concentrations of lice form
   under observed environmental forcing and to advise on the management of
   salmon farms.},

Abstract = {This study was performed in two regions of central Chile: Libertador
   Bernardo O'Higgins y del Maule, to locate and characterize the remnants
   of schlerophyllous forests. This ecosystem has been subject of an
   intense and prolonged anthropic pressure resulting in notorious cover
   reduction and fragmentation. Despite its important biodiversity and
   endemism, these forests are ill represented in the Chilean system of
   environmental protection. We located the forest patches using satellite
   imagery and GIS followed by field verification. The patches were
   classified on the basis of forest structure and physiognomy into three
   situations: open, semi-dense and dense, and referred them to the
   municipality within each of the two regions. These municipalities were
   ordered by the size their forest cover, and a fragmentation analysis was
   performed in the top 14 units, using landscape indices. Results showed a
   very fragmented ecosystem, with great variation in patch size and
   spatial distribution. We present the forest cover for each situation in
   each municipality. In the selected municipalities we detail number of
   patches, mean size, density and patch characteristics. The results are
   then discussed in the context of landscape and lend use and, its
   possible value to design management programs at the scale of municipal
   units to protect and recover the forest.},

Title = {Accounting for capacity and flow of ecosystem services: A conceptual

Abstract = {Understanding the flow of ecosystem services and the capacity of
   ecosystems to generate these services is an essential element for
   understanding the sustainability of ecosystem use as well as developing
   ecosystem accounts. We conduct spatially explicit analyses of nine
   ecosystem services in Telemark County, Southern Norway. The ecosystem
   services included are moose hunting, sheep grazing, timber harvest,
   forest carbon sequestration and storage, snow slide prevention,
   recreational residential amenity, recreational hiking and existence of
   areas without technical interference. We conceptually distinguish
   capacity to provide ecosystem services from the actual flow of services,
   and empirically assess both. This is done by means of different spatial
   models, developed with various available datasets and methods, including
   (multiple layer) look-up tables, causal relations between datasets
   (including satellite images), environmental regression and indicators
   derived from direct measurements. Capacity and flow differ both in
   spatial extent and in quantities. We discuss five conditions for a
   meaningful spatial capacity-flow-balance. These are (1) a conceptual
   difference between capacity and flow, (2) spatial explicitness of
   capacity and flow, (3) the same spatial extent of both, (4) rivalry or
   congestion, and (5) measurement with aligned indicators. We exemplify
   spatially explicit balances between capacity and flow for two services,
   which meet these five conditions. Research in the emerging field of
   mapping ES should focus on the development of compatible indicators for
   capacity and flow. The distinction of capacity and flow of ecosystem
   services provides a parsimonious estimation of over- or underuse of the
   respective service. Assessment of capacity and flow in a spatially
   explicit way can thus support monitoring sustainability of ecosystem
   use, which is an essential element of ecosystem accounting. (C) 2013

Title = {Gradient boosting machine learning model to predict aflatoxins in Iowa
   corn},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {IntroductionAflatoxin (AFL), a secondary metabolite produced from
   filamentous fungi, contaminates corn, posing significant health and
   safety hazards for humans and livestock through toxigenic and
   carcinogenic effects. Corn is widely used as an essential commodity for
   food, feed, fuel, and export markets; therefore, AFL mitigation is
   necessary to ensure food and feed safety within the United States (US)
   and elsewhere in the world. In this case study, an Iowa-centric model
   was developed to predict AFL contamination using historical corn
   contamination, meteorological, satellite, and soil property data in the
   largest corn-producing state in the US.MethodsWe evaluated the
   performance of AFL prediction with gradient boosting machine (GBM)
   learning and feature engineering in Iowa corn for two AFL risk
   thresholds for high contamination events: 20-ppb and 5-ppb. A 90\%-10\%
   training-to-testing ratio was utilized in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2021 (n
   = 630), with independent validation using the year 2020 (n =
   376).ResultsThe GBM model had an overall accuracy of 96.77\% for AFL
   with a balanced accuracy of 50.00\% for a 20-ppb risk threshold, whereas
   GBM had an overall accuracy of 90.32\% with a balanced accuracy of
   64.88\% for a 5-ppb threshold. The GBM model had a low power to detect
   high AFL contamination events, resulting in a low sensitivity rate.
   Analyses for AFL showed satellite-acquired vegetative index during
   August significantly improved the prediction of corn contamination at
   the end of the growing season for both risk thresholds. Prediction of
   high AFL contamination levels was linked to aflatoxin risk indices (ARI)
   in May. However, ARI in July was an influential factor for the 5-ppb
   threshold but not for the 20-ppb threshold. Similarly, latitude was an
   influential factor for the 20-ppb threshold but not the 5-ppb threshold.
   Furthermore, soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) influenced
   both risk thresholds.DiscussionDeveloping these AFL prediction models is
   practical and implementable in commodity grain handling environments to
   achieve the goal of preventative rather than reactive mitigations.
   Finding predictors that influence AFL risk annually is an important
   cost-effective risk tool and, therefore, is a high priority to ensure
   hazard management and optimal grain utilization to maximize the utility
   of the nation's corn crop.},

Title = {Modeling of the spatial and temporal dynamics of erosivity in the Amazon},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {513-523},

Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the main factors of soil erosion, and the
   intensity, duration and frequency of precipitation can aggravate the
   erosive process. The objective of the study was to determine the spatial
   and temporal distribution of rainfall erosivity in the Amazon. Data were
   collected from 334 rainfall gauge stations distributed throughout the
   region, composing a series of 20 years (1997-2016). The gaps in this
   series were filled with satellite data using the CPC MORPHing technique.
   The erosivity equations used were those available in the literature and
   based on the modified Fournier index. The values of precipitation and
   erosivity were interpolated using GIS software, and thematic maps were
   generated for these variables. The annual value of rainfall erosivity
   ranged from 7060 to 36767 (Mj mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1)). On the monthly
   scale, the highest rates of erosivity were recorded in the rainy season,
   i.e., February and March, at approximately 1548 and 2651 (Mj mm ha(-1)
   h(-1) month(-1)), respectively. In the context of erosion risk, the
   region was classified as having very strong erosivity. Therefore, it is
   imperative that land management and conservation policies be implemented
   to minimize erosion in the region, which, at its borders, undergoes
   intense land use change, i.e., forests are being transformed into
   pastures and grain crops.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Loktak is the largest natural wetland of Northeast India, the last home
   of endangered brow-antlered deer, and a site of global significance
   recognized under Ramsar convention. Ecological and human-meditated
   spatial patterns of Loktak wetland were characterized and classified
   using a Radarsat-2 C band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data.
   Radarsat-2 quad-pol scene of dry season was preprocessed and classified
   using PolSARpro software. Eigen vector-eigen value decomposition of
   coherency matrix (T3) was performed to characterize the scattering
   properties of wetland targets based on entropy (H)/anisotropy (A)/alpha
   angle (alpha) segmentation. Results illustrate that RGB color display of
   H/A/a images is a useful indicator of wetland structure and composition,
   and provide clear visual discrimination of open water, floating phumdi,
   permanent phumdi cover, and associated man-made features. Six classes,
   namely, floating phumdi, permanent phumdi, scrub/shrub, fallow land,
   built-up, and open water were mapped using Wishart classification of
   H/A/a images. Scattering mechanisms of natural and man-made targets
   synthesized from PolSAR data, and their classification using Wishart
   algorithm have been validated through a visually classified map and
   field reference points. The land cover generated would be useful for
   conservation and management of Loktak wetland and brow-antlered deer
   population. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Title = {First satellite tracks of the Endangered black-capped petrel},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-33},
Abstract = {The black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata is an endangered seabird
   with fewer than 2000 breeding pairs restricted to a few breeding sites
   in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. To date, use areas at sea have been
   determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic
   sightings and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding
   of the species' marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of
   marine use areas, we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels
   breeding on Hispaniola, representing the first tracking study for this
   species and one of the first published tracking studies for any breeding
   seabird in the Caribbean. During chick rearing, petrels primarily used
   marine habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea (ca. 18.0 degrees to 11.5
   degrees N, 70.0 degrees to 75.5 degrees W) between the breeding site and
   the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the breeding
   sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period.
   During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used
   waters west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid-and southern Atlantic
   coasts of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic
   waters east of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites
   ranged from ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding
   period. Petrels used waters located within 14 different exclusive
   economic zones, suggesting that international collaboration will benefit
   the development of management strategies for this species.},

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of land use/land cover change on groundwater
   depletion in Northwestern China - A case study of the Dunhuang oasis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {270-279},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the Dunhuang oasis in the arid Northwest China has
   been undergoing significant changes due to social-economic development
   and expanded irrigation for agricultural production. Groundwater table
   was found to have significantly declined during the period of 1987-2007
   owing to greater pumping. We analyzed the impacts of land use/land cover
   (LU/LC) changes on the groundwater fluctuations in the study area. The
   LU/LC types were derived from the satellite images for the years of
   1987, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007. The water consumptions associated with
   the LU/LC types were estimated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method.
   Results show that during the period of 1987-2007, the area of
   agricultural land sharply increased by 98.7 km(2), and the cash crops
   were the main contributor. Under the current market system, farmers had
   much more autonomy and greater incentives to shift the cropping pattern
   from the traditional food crops to the high value cash crops with
   greater water consumption. The total water consumption of the cash crops
   accounted for 14.1\% of the total water consumption in 1987, but
   increased to 71.6\% in 2007, becoming the largest water consumer. The
   agricultural land use was the main cause of the declining groundwater

Abstract = {This paper principally focuses on the morphological differences, spatial
   pattern and regional types of rural settlements in Xuzhou City of
   Jiangsu Province in China. Using satellite images of Xuzhou City taken
   in 2007 and 2008 and models of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)
   and spatial metrics, the paper conducts a quantitative analysis of the
   morphological pattern of rural settlements, and finds significant
   characteristics. First, rural settlements in Xuzhou City are
   significantly agglomerated in terms of their spatial distribution;
   meanwhile, there is significant variation in the geographical density
   distribution. Second, the scale of rural settlements in Xuzhou City is
   larger than the average in Jiangsu Province, and the histogram of the
   scale data is more even and more like a gamma distribution. There are a
   significant high-value cluster in the scale distribution, and local
   negative correlation between the scale and density distribution of rural
   settlements in Xuzhou City. Third, the morphology of rural settlements
   in Xuzhou City shows relative regularity with good connection and
   integrity, but the spatial variation of the morphology is anisotropic.
   Finally, according to the characteristics of density, scale, and form of
   rural settlements, the rural settlements of Xuzhou City are divided into
   three types: A high-density and point-scattered type, a low-density and
   cluster-like type and a mass-like and sparse type. The research findings
   could be used as the scientific foundation for rural planning and
   community rebuilding, particularly in less-developed areas.},

Title = {Analysis of Spatiotemporal Changes of Ecological Environment Quality and
   Its Coupling Coordination with Urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta
   Urban Agglomeration, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {It is inevitable that urban agglomeration will have a coercive impact on
   the regional Ecological Environment Quality (EEQ) as a consequence of
   high-speed urbanization. Balancing the EEQ and urbanization development
   has become a problem worthy of attention. In order to objectively
   evaluate the EEQ of the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA)
   and explore the impact of the urbanization process on it, this paper is
   based on the Modified Remote Sensing Ecological Index (MRSEI) and the
   Comprehensive Night Light Index (CNLI), respectively, and conducts a
   quantitative assessment of the YRDUA in China from 2000 to 2020. The
   results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the MRSEI of the YRDUA first
   decreased and then increased, and the ecological environment quality
   degraded first and then improved; however, there were significant
   differences between regions. The ecological environment quality in the
   south is obviously better than that in the north, and the ecological
   environment quality in the north changes more drastically, and the low
   value area of MRSEI will gradually move downstream as time changes; (2)
   During the study period, the YRDUA formed a hierarchical and progressive
   urbanization pattern. The inland urbanization process expanded from east
   to west along the Yangtze River, and the urbanization process of coastal
   cities expanded from Shanghai as the center to the north and south with
   high-intensity urbanization cities concentrated in Shanghai and its
   surrounding cities and low-intensity urbanization cities distributed in
   the western part of the urban agglomeration; (3) The Coupling
   Coordination Degree (CCD) between urbanization and EEQ in the YRDUA has
   continuously improved with an increase of 28.57\% in the past 21 years,
   and the number of cities with high level coupling continues to rise,
   while the number of medium level coupling cities and low level coupling
   cities has declined. As a large-scale and long-term analysis of changes
   in the EEQ and the urbanization process, this study can provide
   theoretical support for policymakers to formulate mesoscale development
   planning, EEQ monitoring, and environmental protection policies.},

Abstract = {Patients experiencing a terminal drug related event reflect a sentinel
   event. If this pharmacotherapy is a widely used agent, it may be viewed
   as a catastrophic problem. If patients are dying from illegal drug use
   when the medical establishment fails them by withdrawing or minimizing
   their medically prescribed medication, then the burden rests with their
   health care providers, legislation, and insurance carriers to actively
   participate in a collegial fashion to achieve parity. Causing a decay in
   functionality in previously functional patients, may occur with
   appropriately prescribed opioid medications addressing non-cancer pain
   when withdrawing or diminishing either with or without patient consent.
   The members of the medical profession have diminished their prescribing
   of opioids for their patients out of apparent fear of reprisal, state or
   federal government sanctions, and other concerned groups. Diminishing
   former dosages or deleting the opioid medication, preferably in concert
   with the patient, often results in inequitable patient care. Enforcing
   sanctioned decreases or ceasing to prescribe from their former
   required/established opioid medications precipitate patient discord. In
   absence of opioid misuse, abuse, diversion or addiction based upon
   medical ``guidelines{''} and with a poor foundation of Evidence Based
   Medicine the CDC guidelines, it may be masked as a true guideline
   reflecting a decrement of clinical judgment, wisdom, and compassion.
   This article also discusses the role of pharmacy chains, insurance
   carriers, and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) contribution to
   this multidimensional problem. There may be a potential solution,
   identified in this paper, if all the associated political, medical and
   insurance groups work cohesively to improve patient care. This article
   and the CDC guidelines are not focused at hospice, palliative, end of
   life care pain management. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Assessing the Influence of Tourism-Driven Activities on Environmental
   Variables on Hainan Island, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tourism is a primary socio-economic factor on many coastal islands.
   Tourism contributes to the livelihoods of the residents, but also
   influences natural resources and energy consumption and can become a
   significant driver of land conversion and environmental change.
   Understanding the influence of tourist-related activities is vital for
   sustainable tourism development. We chose Hainan Island in South China
   as a research area to study the influence of tourist-driven activities
   on environmental variables (as Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and
   related ecosystem variables) during the period of 2000 to 2019. In
   Hainan, the local economy relies heavily on tourism, with an
   ever-growing influx of tourists each year. We categorised location-based
   points of interest (POIs) into two classes, non-tourism sites and
   tourism-related sites, and utilised satellite data from the cloud-based
   platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract LST and Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We analysed the LST variations,
   NDVI changes and the land use/land cover (LULC) changes and compared the
   relative difference in LST and NDVI between the tourism-related sites
   and non-tourism-related sites. The main findings of this study were: (1)
   The median LST in the tourism-related sites was relatively higher (1.3)
   than the LST in the non-tourism-related sites for the 20 years.
   Moreover, every annual mean LST of tourism-related sites was higher than
   the LST values in non-tourism-related sites, with an average difference
   of 1.2 degrees C for the 20 years and a maximum difference of 1.7
   degrees C. We found higher annual LST anomalies for tourist-related
   sites compared to non-tourism sites after 2010, which indicated the
   likely positive differences in LST above the average LST during 20 years
   for tourism-related sites when compared against the non-tourism related
   sites, thus highlighting the potential influence of tourism activities
   on LST. (2) The annual mean NDVI value for tourism-related sites was
   significantly lower than for non-tourism places every year, with an
   average NDVI difference of 0.26 between the two sites. (3) The land
   cover changed significantly: croplands and forests reduced by 3.5\% and
   2.8\% respectively, while the areas covered by orchards and urban areas
   increased by 2\% and 72.3\% respectively. These results indicate the
   influence of the tourism-driven activities includes the relatively high
   LST, vegetation degradation and land-use conversion particular to urban
   cover type. The outcome of this work provides a method that combines
   cloud-based satellite-derived data with location-based POIs data for
   quantifying the long-term influence of tourism-related activities on
   sensitive coastal ecosystems. It contributes to designing
   evidence-driven management plans and policies for the sustainable
   tourism development in coastal areas.},

Title = {Novel satellite based analytical model developed to predict microalgae
   yields in open pond raceway systems and applied to Canadian sites},
Journal = {ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Interest in microalgae cultivation continues to increase based on its
   potential commercial value. Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and
   other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels,
   pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active
   compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in
   determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are
   fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict
   yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation
   systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower
   latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to
   cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets
   that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature
   measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To
   address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive
   analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on
   ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient
   temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production
   yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of
   central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model
   predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T
   biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat,
   AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake,
   NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL
   model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area
   information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs),
   techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR
   performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and
   can assist with algae production platform optimization.},

   inter-basin water transfer projects to mitigate water shortage in intake
   areas. Given the multifaceted demands of the Hanjiang to Wei River Water
   Diversion Project, China (referred hereafter as the Project), an
   easy-to-operate multi-objective optimal model based on simulation is
   built and applied to search the multi-objective optimization operation
   rules between power generation and energy consumption. The Project
   includes two reservoirs connected by a water transfer tunnel. One is
   Huangjinxia, located in the mainstream of Hanjiang with abundant inflow
   but no regulation ability, and the other is Sanhekou, located in the
   tributary of Hanjiang with multi-year regulation ability but less water.
   The layout of the Project increases the difficulty of reservoir joint
   optimization operations. Therefore, an improved Non-dominated Sorting
   Genetic Algorithm-II (I-NSGA-II) with a feasible search space is
   proposed to solve the model based on long-term series data. The results
   show that: (1) The validated simulation model is helpful to obtain
   Pareto front curves to reveal the rules between power generation and
   energy consumption. (2) Choosing a reasonable search step size to build
   a feasible search space based on simulation results for the I-NSGA-II
   can help find more optimized solutions. Considering the influence of the
   initial populations of the algorithm and limited computing ability of
   computers, the qualified rate of Pareto points solved by I-NSGA-II are
   superior to NSGA-II. (3) According to the characteristics of the
   Project, water transfer ratio threshold value of two reservoirs are
   quantified for maximize economic benefits. Moreover, the flood season is
   a critical operation period for the Project, in which both reservoirs
   should supply more water to intake areas to ensure the energy balanced
   of the entire system. The findings provide an easy-to-operate
   multi-objective operation model with the I-NSGA-II that can easily be
   applied in optimal management of inter-basin water transfer projects by
   relevant authorities.},

Abstract = {Background: Parents of young athletes play a major role in the
   identification and management of sports-related concussions. However,
   they are often unaware of the consequences of concussions and
   recommended management techniques.
   Hypothesis: This study quantitatively assessed parental understanding of
   concussions to identify specific populations in need of additional
   education. We predicted that parents with increased education and prior
   sports- and concussion-related experience would have more knowledge and
   safer attitudes toward concussions.
   Study Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: Participants were parents of children brought to a pediatric
   hospital and 4 satellite clinics for evaluation of orthopaedic injuries.
   Participants completed a validated questionnaire that assessed knowledge
   of concussion symptoms, attitudes regarding diagnosis and return-to-play
   guidelines, and previous sports-and concussion-related experience.
   Results: Over 8 months, 214 parents completed surveys. Participants
   scored an average of 18.4 (possible, 0-25) on the Concussion Knowledge
   Index and 63.1 (possible, 15-75) on the Concussion Attitude Index.
   Attitudes were safest among white women, and knowledge increased with
   income and education levels. Previous sports experience did not affect
   knowledge or attitudes, but parents who reported experiencing an
   undiagnosed concussion had significantly better concussion knowledge
   than those who did not.
   Conclusion: Parents with low income and education levels may benefit
   from additional concussion-related education.},

Title = {Estimate hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from Himawari-8 TOA
   reflectance directly using geo-intelligent long short-term memory
   network},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has attracted extensive attention
   because of its baneful influence on human health and the environment.
   However, the sparse distribution of PM2.5 measuring stations limits its
   application to public utility and scientific research, which can be
   remedied by satellite observations. Therefore, we developed a
   Geo-intelligent long short-term network (Geoi-LSTM) to estimate hourly
   ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in 2017 in Wuhan Urban Agglomeration
   (WUA). We conducted contrast experiments to verify the effectiveness of
   our model and explored the optimal modeling strategy. It turned out that
   Geoi-LSTM with TOA reflectance, meteorological conditions, and NDVI as
   inputs performs best. The station-based cross-validation R-2, root mean
   squared error and mean absolute error are 0.82, 15.44 mu g/m(3), 10.63
   mu g/m(3), respectively. Based on model results, we revealed
   spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 in WUA. Generally speaking,
   during the day, PM2.5 concentration remained stable at a relatively high
   level in the morning and decreased continuously in the afternoon. While
   during the year, PM2.5 concentrations were highest in winter, lowest in
   summer, and in-between in spring and autumn. Combined with
   meteorological conditions, we further analyzed the whole process of a
   PM2.5 pollution event. Finally, we discussed the loss in removing
   clouds-covered pixels and compared our model with several popular
   models. Overall, our results can reflect hourly PM2.5 concentrations
   seamlessly and accurately with a spatial resolution of 5 km, which
   benefits PM(2.5 )exposure evaluations and policy regulations. (C) 2020

Journal = {LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {438-447},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In animal research, validity and reproducibility of data are critically
   influenced by the microbial status of the experimental animals, One of
   the most crucial aspects of assuring quality in animal research is
   providing research personnel with confidence that experimental results
   will not be invalidated due to interference caused by infectious
   disease. An effective quarantine program is essential to providing this
   assurance. Quarantine programs are generally instituted to prevent the
   introduction of rodent pathogens into established specific-pathogen-free
   colonies in a facility, Therefore, programs should be designed to
   isolate newly acquired rodents until their health status can be
   determined and to maximize the probability that microorganisms of
   interest will be detected before the animals are introduced into (and
   thus, could potentially contaminate) established colonies. Important
   principles that are critical to designing an effective quarantine
   program will be discussed here, as will the practical implementation of
   these principles. Although quarantine programs may be costly in terms of
   time and effort, these costs must be balanced against the potential
   costs of disease outbreaks that could invalidate long-term studies,
   alter normal biological baselines, and cause the loss or necessitate re
   derivation of rare or valuable strains of rodents. Reducing the
   incidence of quarantine failures through appropriate program design and
   implementation helps to maintain the confidence of research personnel in
   the value of quarantine programs and in our competence as specialists in
   laboratory animal management and as partners in the research process.},

Title = {A blind convolutional deep autoencoder for spectral unmixing of
   hyperspectral images over waterbodies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Harmful algal blooms have dangerous repercussions for biodiversity, the
   ecosystem, and public health. Automatic identification based on remote
   sensing hyperspectral image analysis provides a valuable mechanism for
   extracting the spectral signatures of harmful algal blooms and their
   respective percentage in a region of interest. This paper proposes a new
   model called a non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing to
   perform endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation. The
   model is assessed in benchmark datasets, such as Jasper Ridge and
   Samson. Additionally, a case study of the HSI2 image acquired by NASA
   over Lake Erie in 2017 is conducted for extracting optical water types.
   The results using the proposed model for the benchmark datasets improve
   unmixing performance, as indicated by the spectral angle distance
   compared to five baseline algorithms. Improved results were obtained for
   various metrics. In the Samson dataset, the proposed model outperformed
   other methods for water (0.060) and soil (0.025) endmember extraction.
   Moreover, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in terms of
   mean spectral angle distance compared to the other five baseline
   algorithms. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing
   approach achieved better results for abundance map estimation, with a
   root mean square error of 0.091 for water and 0.187 for soil, compared
   to the ground truth. For the Jasper Ridge dataset, the non-symmetrical
   autoencoder for the spectral unmixing model excelled in the tree (0.039)
   and road (0.068) endmember extraction and also demonstrated improved
   results for water abundance maps (0.1121). The proposed model can
   identify the presence of chlorophyll-a in waterbodies. Chlorophyll-a is
   an essential indicator of the presence of the different concentrations
   of macrophytes and cyanobacteria. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for
   spectral unmixing achieves a value of 0.307 for the spectral angle
   distance metric compared to a reference ground truth spectral signature
   of chlorophyll-a. The source code for the proposed model, as implemented
   in this manuscript, can be found at

Abstract = {A debate at the European Union Parliament was held on 13 November 2012
   on the Impact of early diagnosis and control of chronic respiratory
   diseases on Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA). The debate was held under
   the auspices of theCyprus Presidency of the European Union (2012) and
   represents a follow-up of the priorities of the Polish Presidency of the
   European Union (2011). It highlighted the importance of early life
   events on the occurrence of chronic respiratory diseases later in life
   and their impact on active and healthy ageing. Epidemiologic evidence
   was followed by actions that should be taken to prevent and manage
   chronic respiratory diseases in children. The debate ended by practical,
   feasible and achievable projects, demonstrating the strength of the
   political action in the field. Three projects will be initiated from
   this debate: The first will be a meeting sponsored by the Region
   Languedoc-Roussillon on the developmental origins of chronic diseases
   and ageing: from research to policies and value creation. The second
   project is being led by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Asthma and
   Rhinitis: Prevention of Asthma, Prevention of Allergy (PAPA). The third
   project is the GA2LEN sentinel network.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems have emerged as an established
   tool within the construction industry. Concurrent with this trend has
   been the rise in research on RPA, establishing this as a new field of
   study within the construction management domain. What is needed now is
   an assessment of the current state of research in this emerging
   discipline - its strengths and weaknesses - by which future research on
   RPA in construction may be guided. The purpose of this paper is to
   address this need.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A total of 59 peer-reviewed journal articles covering RPAs within the
   construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods
   approach, utilizing qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques.
   Findings
   The results reveal a field of study in its fledgling stage, with a
   limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation, from a
   limited number of institutions. Key publication outlets are identified,
   with the main focus of research being in the technical areas of remote
   sensing, photogrammetry and image processing.
   Practical implications - The study benefits researchers and industry
   practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas
   of high priority in future research. For construction companies,
   particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises
   awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of RPAs
   in the industry.
   Originality/value
   The study exposes what is missing from current research: a broader
   consideration of organizational adjustments needed to accommodate RPA
   usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.},

Title = {A new European service to share GNSS Data and Products},
Journal = {ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3, SI},
Abstract = {This paper describes the new GNSS data and product services that have
   been developed within the context of the EPOS (European Plate Observing
   System) European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), which is
   part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures. These
   services, optimized for Solid Earth research applications, endeavour to
   harmonise, and standardise Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   data collection and processing. They have been implemented by the
   members of the GNSS Data \& Products (EPOS-GNSS), one of the Thematic
   Core Services (TCS) of EPOS with the active support of national and
   pan-European infrastructures (in particular the Regional Reference Frame
   Sub-Commission for Europe (EUREF) of the International Association of
   Geodesy). The optimized use of data from dozens of diverse European GNSS
   networks, installed not specifically for geodynamic studies, created
   additional requirements from an organizational and technical point of
   view, the solutions for which we describe in this article.
   The data flows from data suppliers and analysis centers to the various
   TCS Data \& Product Portals are described, as well as their integration
   into the overall EPOS system. This is made through GLASS (GNSS Linkage
   Advanced Software System), a dedicated software package developed since
   2016, whose architecture and functionalities are detailed here. Time
   series and other GNSS products computed at the several analysis centers
   are described as are the quality control steps that are performed.
   Finally, several user cases are presented that demonstrate how different
   stakeholders (from data providers to scientists) can benefit from the
   efforts being carried out by the EPOS-GNSS community.},

Title = {Scientific and Islamic perspectives in relation to the Halal status of
   cultured meat},
Journal = {SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cultured meat is meat produced from stem cell biopsies of cattle. Stem
   cells were cultured in a bioreactor in the presence of serum to grow the
   flesh to maturity. Cultured meat technology originated from regenerative
   medical technology; however, it has been given a new lease of life to
   produce cultured meat as an innovative food source in the future without
   involving cattle breeding. This technology can reduce the negative
   environmental impacts of global warming, water use, soil, and unethical
   handling of animals. In the excitement of accepting this new technology,
   the halal status of cultured meat is in question, as it can be produced
   from embryonic stem cells and myosatellite cells, each of which can be
   disputed for their halal status. Additionally, the process of culturing
   and maturation of stem cells involves the use of an impure medium
   derived from animal blood. Thus, cultured meat is acceptable to Muslims
   only if the stem cells, medium and scaffold biomaterials used to
   manufacture it are from Halal sources and shall be in line with the six
   principles discussed in this study. The discussion is based on Halal and
   haram animals; Animal slaughtering; Not derived from a source of najs
   (impurity); Istihalah tammah (perfect substance change); Maslahah
   (public interest or benefit) and mafsadah (damage); and Darurat

Title = {A new perspective on the impacts of<i> Spartina</i><i> alterniflora</i>
   invasion on Chinese wetlands in the context of climate change: A case
   study of the Jiuduansha Shoals, Yangtze Estuary},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {868},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, was introduced to the Chinese
   coastal zone in the early 90s. As an eco-engineering species, S.
   alterniflora not only alters saltmarsh species distributions, previously
   described as habitat deg-radation, but it also plays a vital role in
   coastal protection, especially for the development of recently emerged
   inter-tidal shoals. To provide a reference for coastal management under
   global change, we quantified the impact of the invasion process on
   provided ecological and coastal protection functions, exemplified at the
   emerging Jiuduansha Shoals (JDS) in the Yangtze Estuary. Results
   obtained by high-precision satellite monitoring and numerical modelling
   showed that the establishment and growth of S. alterniflora can exert
   considerable changes on local environment. The invasion of S.
   alterniflora to JDS wetland can be divided into three distinct phases,
   (1) establishment 1998-2003, (2) ex-pansion 2003-2009, and (3) dominant
   2009-2018 stages according to the changes in saltmarsh composition.
   Spa-tially, S. alterniflora continuously replaced Scirpus mariqueter,
   forcing S. mariqueter and Phragmites australis slowly to the lower and
   higher intertidal habitats, respectively. Notably, S. alterniflora
   expansion was the main driver that con-tributed to over 70 \% of recent
   JDS wetland expansion even under sediment deficit conditions.
   Established S. alterniflora marsh (directly) dampens more waves because
   of aboveground stems, but it also causes more accretion and indirectly
   leads to higher ``morphological{''} wave dampening. Thus, it increases
   coastal defense provided by the saltmarsh in the context of sea-level
   rise and strengthening storms. In conclusion, the role of S.
   alterniflora invasion to the local environment under global changes is
   controversial. For sustainable coastal management, we need context
   -dependent S. alterniflora management to maximize the benefit of coastal
   protection and minimize the impact on local ecology, especially in
   sediment-starving estuaries with expected coastline retreat.},

Abstract = {The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is an important dataset for various
   applications such as hydrology, environmental sciences, urban planning,
   etc. Majority of the satellite-based medium resolution (30 m - 90 m)
   Digital Surface Model (DSM) products are freely available and widely
   used around the world. The generation of a DTM from these products is a
   tedious process. In this paper, a simple algorithm is developed to
   classify the ground and non-ground pixels in the DSM. The algorithm is
   tested on ALOS - World 3 D 30 m (AW3D30) DSM for small patches in the
   cities of Chennai, Mumbai and Cairo. Based on general assumption of the
   minimum elevation difference that exists between the ground and
   non-ground objects a slope threshold is used to initially classify the
   DSM. The elevations of the classified pixels are then used iteratively
   to assign counter values to the pixels. These counter values are finally
   used to classify the data and the ground pixels are interpolated using
   Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) technique to generate the DTM. The
   proposed algorithm is quantitatively assessed and has a Type I error of
   2.33\%, Type II error of 1.67\%, Total error of 2\% and Kappa
   coefficient value of 96\%. Additionally, R-2 and RMSE values of 0.9589
   and +/- 0.429 m were observed when compared against a reference DTM.},

Title = {Public libraries and difficulties with targeting the homeless},
Journal = {LIBRARY REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to consider the potential for public library
   policies that specifically target ``the homeless{''} to undermine their
   own objectives, and seeks to suggest alternative approaches to extend
   inclusion and ensure that all demographics are served equally.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper was written for a satellite
   meeting of the 78th IFLA Congress entitled ``The Homeless and the
   Libraries - the Right to Information and Knowledge For All{''}. Drawing
   on previous research detailed in Muggleton, and Muggleton and Ruthven,
   the author presents a discursive perspective on the impact that
   assumptions about homelessness might have for policymaking.
   Findings - Extant prejudices and the tendency to create a homeless
   ``other{''} mean that policies specifically addressing the homeless have
   the potential to accentuate difference and patronise and alienate the
   intended beneficiaries of these policies. Moreover, political opposition
   to more inclusive, accommodating policymaking makes it important to
   reject assumptions and prejudices that weaken one's own position.
   Grounding policymaking in the empirical experience of homeless library
   users is argued to be the most effective way to extend inclusion, and
   also avoid false dichotomies and the perpetuation of prejudice.
   Originality/value - Insights into unconscious assumptions gathered from
   previous research have been applied to the conceptualisation and
   implementation of public library policy. The arguments presented in the
   paper will hopefully be of use both for developing effective policies
   and for defending policies relating to homeless library users.},

Title = {Effective management of slums- Case study of Kalaburagi city, Karnataka,
   India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-53},

Abstract = {As urbanization grows, we may expect that slums will tend to grow even
   faster. Kalaburagi is a second tier city and an important commercial hub
   for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region located in the north eastern part of
   Karnataka state. It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts
   and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth
   as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum
   population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11\% of
   city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable
   methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to
   advance the living conditions of slum dwellers.
   Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution
   satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed
   ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field
   photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented.
   As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA)
   model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The
   suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors.
   When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the
   final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding
   current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of
   slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been
   finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for
   developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums
   from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for
   selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS
   model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to
   enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective
   implementation of slum development programs.},

Abstract = {In the southeast in Noffkoping, Sweden, is a small fjord-like bay called
   Slatbaken. The water quality in Slatbaken-with its narrow outlet to the
   Baltic Sea-depends highly on the water quality of the streams that flow
   in it. While point pollution sources can be identified easily in
   general, the non-point sources are harder to find. The most important
   sources for non-point pollution are agricultural areas, and the
   pollutants are mostly nutrients like phosphorus, which come from the
   fertilisation of the fields. One important catchment area for Slatbaken
   is the 57.7 km(2) Gisselo river basin (part of the topographic map
   8GNO), which contains large agricultural areas.
   The transport of water pollutants is based on the same hydrological
   processes as erosion and sediment transport. The implementation of such
   a model in a GIS allows the analysis of a large area with a high
   resolution. When choosing the model, special attention was paid to the
   possibility of using a verified model that is easy to implement in a
   commercial GIS without the need of too much expert knowledge. This may
   allow its widespread use in many administrative applications that need
   non-point source information. A feasibility test for an enhanced GIS
   USLE model was done in the Gisselo drainage basin before it was
   implemented for all river basins in the whole administrative area of
   Norrkopings kommun.
   It is possible to use the suggested simplified USLE model to estimate
   the load of both pollutants and sediments, and it is able to show the
   areas that are critical for the water quality at the outlet of the water
   basin. The model has been evaluated in three studies {[}Int. J. Geogr.
   Inf. Syst. 2 (4) (1988) 365; A GIS to target critical areas for non
   point source management, in: Proceedings of the International Non Point
   Source Management Symposium, Austin, TX, November 7, 1989; Vatten 48
   (1992) 117]. Then, implemented in a very simple GIS that allowed only
   rough estimates of terrain models and distances, the model was able to
   estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP)
   loads in the Svarta river basin of 1539 km(2) in the same region as
   Gisselo and the Bornsjo river basin outside Stockholm. Besides an
   estimated R-2 of 0.91-0.98 (verified by a more than one year measurement
   from manual and automated sampling stations in the whole river basin),
   the benefit with the GIS implemented USLE was the possibility to
   identify the risk areas with high spatial accuracy. During the last
   decade, both available databases and software have changed the
   possibilities to identify areas at risk of nutrient leakage. Schein
   {[}GIS Methods for Monitoring Sustainable Development by Analysis of
   Land-use and Land Cover Changes in the Surroundings of Linkoping
   (Sweden), Institut fur Photogrammetrie und Fernerkundung, Technische
   Universitat Dresden, Germany] and Schein and Sivertun {[}Method and
   models for sustainable development monitoring and analyses in GIS, in:
   Proceedings of the International Workshop on Geo-Spatial Knowledge
   Processing for Natural Resource Management, University of Insubria,
   Varese, Italy, June 28-29, 2001] show that the enhanced land use data
   available through the European Union agricultural support program can be
   used together with remote sensing data to fine tune the modified GIS
   USLE model. The problems with the new 50 x 50 m digital elevation data
   now available are also pointed out here. Obvious errors in the data and
   possibilities to enhance the model by introducing a better terrain model
   were two important suggestions in these works. In this article, two
   modifications to the original model are suggested. One is enhancement of
   the digital terrain model by using height curves from the digital 1:50
   000 scale topographic map, and the other is a smooth distance function
   that better reflects the impact of nutrients on water bodies.
   Because of its easy implementation on standard low cost systems, the GIS
   USLE model is suitable for analysing huge areas for critical places. The
   results can lead to more detailed studies in the risk areas thus
   identified or to investigations on the effect of land use changes, or
   can be used simply for taking care in the use of fertilisers and other
   chemicals in the critical agricultural areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall
   vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and
   nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological
   models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the
   required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping
   is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we
   therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM)
   methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation
   types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca.
   324,000 km(2). Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different
   VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular
   plots of 0.9 km(2). Distribution models for each VT were obtained by
   logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection
   with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in
   100 m x 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by
   applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results
   Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest
   AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest,
   whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather
   spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than
   common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones.
   Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial
   prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a
   regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided
   relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential
   uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international
   vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may
   improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system
   models.},

Title = {The long-term development of temperate woodland creation sites: from

Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-37},

Abstract = {Tree planting is at the forefront of the current environmental agenda to
   mitigate climate change and tackle the biodiversity crisis. In the
   United Kingdom (UK), tree planting has been a priority for more than a
   century and has helped increase woodland cover from a historic low of 5
   per cent at the beginning of the 20th century to a current figure of 13
   per cent. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term
   development of woodland creation sites (particularly of native
   woodlands) over ecologically realistic timescales. We surveyed a
   chronosequence of 133 temperatewoodland patches encompassing 106woodland
   creation sites (10-160 years old) and 27 mature `ancient' woodlands
   (>250 years old), using a combination of field surveys and remote
   sensing techniques to quantify vegetation structural changes associated
   with woodland development. Woodland creation sites displayed similar
   vegetation development patterns to those described for other woodland
   systems, i.e. a gradual transition as woodlands undergo `stand
   initiation', `stem exclusion' and `understorey reinitiation' stages, and
   became more similar to `ancient' woodlands over time. Structural
   heterogeneity, average tree size and tree density were the attributes
   that varied the most among woodland developmental stages. In general,
   structural heterogeneity and average tree size increased with woodland
   age, whilst tree density decreased as would be expected. Younger sites
   in stand initiation were strongly dominated by short vegetation, stem
   exclusion sites by taller trees and older sites had a more even
   vegetation height distribution. There was a large degree of overlap
   between the vegetation characteristics of woodlands in understorey
   re-initiation stages and older ancient woodlands (partly driven by a
   lack of regeneration in the understorey); these results suggest that it
   takes between 80 and 160 years for woodland creation sites to develop
   certain vegetation attributes similar to those of mature ancient
   woodlands included in this study. Woodland management practices to
   create canopy gaps and reducing grazing/browsing pressure to promote
   natural regeneration are likely to accelerate this transition, increase
   the structural heterogeneity and biodiversity value ofwoodland creation
   sites and enable adaptation and resilience to climate change.},

Abstract = {Since implementation of its Economic Recovery Program in 1983, Ghana's
   extractive industries have come to account for 40\% of the total value
   of the country's exports. An adverse impact of this increase, however,
   has been increased extraction-related conflict due to heightened
   competition between large and small-scale operators over mineral-rich
   lands. This paper characterizes these conflicts in the south-central
   section of the country by mapping the spatial overlaps between large and
   small-scale miners. Classification tree analysis of 2013 and 2015
   Landsat-7 and -8 imagery was used to identify small-scale mine sites.
   The overlaps between these sites and large-scale concessions are
   examined in the context of reported mining conflicts. Results reveal
   that there is a large amount of resource competition between the two
   parties, specifically, more than half (i.e., 52\%) of the identified
   small-scale mining activity occurs within the boundaries of large-scale
   concessions. The northwest corner of the study area contains 50\% of the
   identified overlaps; the southwest corner contains 40\%; and the
   northeast corner contains 10\%. In most cases, these overlaps take place
   on prospecting concessions. The work illustrates how mapping and
   quantifying areas of spatial overlap between large and small-scale
   miners can help stakeholders implement more effective policy solutions.

Title = {Predicting annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> in mainland China from 2014 to 2020
   using multi temporal satellite product: An improved deep learning
   approach with spatial generalization ability},
Journal = {ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {The estimation of long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
   concentrations and trend assessments play a critical role in preventing
   health risks to the human body. Deep learning methods based on time
   series have been highly accurate in predicting PM2.5. However, most time
   series models lack the ability for spatial generalization because they
   cannot combine the analysis at different spatial scales. In addition,
   temporal long-term trend analysis have not been reported in most of the
   studies. In this study, to reveal the spatiotemporal variability and
   trends of PM2.5, an improved deep learning framework named the
   SpatioTemporal Enhanced Neural Network (STENN) is developed for
   estimating PM2.5 concentrations with a spatial resolution of 1 km. Based
   on the bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) structure and
   attention mechanisms, the model provides a geographic-data-driven
   approach to incorporate the impact of the spatial heterogeneity and time
   dependence of PM2.5, which demonstrates that it has robust
   spatiotemporal transferable power with an R-2 of 0.89 produced by cross
   validation (CV). High-resolution (1 km) and high-quality annual PM2.5
   products for mainland China from 2014 to 2020 were constructed. In
   comparison with the current 1-km PM2.5 products, our framework
   demonstrates better stability in different regions, especially in terms
   of the high-value estimations and spatial continuity. The spatiotemporal
   PM2.5 distributions were also analyzed based on the time-series
   products. After the implementation of various control policies for
   atmospheric pollution, a declining trend of PM2.5 concentrations was
   observed in 88.79\% of China between 2014 and 2020, with a mean decrease
   rate of 3.35 mu gm(-3) yr(-1). This result indicates that the control
   policies of the Chinese government were effective in reducing PM2.5
   concentrations. The PM2.5 concentrations in China reveal an exponential
   temporal trend, from a rapid decline to a gradual slowdown and a stable
   phase. To realize the vision of the Beautiful China Initiative, a
   regionally targeted policy for air pollution management is required.
   This study provides valuable implications for a more detailed analysis
   of the spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5 at small and medium spatial
   scales by developing an improved deep learning approach with a spatial
   generalization ability and integration with multi-temporal satellite
   products.},

Title = {A high-resolution physical modelling approach to assess runoff and soil
   erosion in vineyards under different soil managements},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Steep-slope viticulture is a common practice in the Mediterranean basin,
   and provides landscapes of considerable socio-economic value. However,
   these complex agricultural systems are intrinsically fragile. One of the
   main problems is soil erosion due to extreme rainfall events. This may
   cause a progressive reduction in soil fertility and the occurrence of
   instabilities and land degradation phenomena. To worsen this condition
   there is the increasing mechanisation of agricultural management causing
   soil compaction, and the pressure of climate change, with an
   intensification of extreme weather events. In this context, vineyard
   soil management plays a key role, as it can accelerate or mitigate
   overland flow and soil erosion phenomena. There are various techniques
   for quantifying these processes, often based on field measurements
   through prolonged data collection using experimental plots. However, the
   advent of new technologies in remote sensing opens new frontiers in the
   acquisition of highresolution spatial data. Indeed, they could be used
   in runoff/erosion simulation models and integrated with site-specific
   data. The aim of this paper is to assess runoff and soil erosion
   processes in vineyard under four different soil managements.
   Specifically, four practices were tested: (1) Reference (inter-row
   managed with standard farm grass cover; RF); (2) Continuous Tillage
   (bare soil obtained by continuous mechanical weeding using roto-tiller;
   CT); Nectariferous (a mix of herbaceous species capable of attracting
   insects favouring inter-row biodiversity; NF); (4) Single Tillage
   (inter-row weeding once a year using roto-tiller; ST). The research
   proposes a modelling approach using a physically-based model (SIMWE)
   using samples of runoff and sediment as an assessment, collected with a
   low-cost methodology. In particular, a cost-effective approach easily
   replicable in different contexts (such as developing countries) is
   sought. In addition to cultivation specifics, areas of soil compacted by
   the passage of agricultural vehicles were also analysed using the
   connectivity index. In general, results show an interesting capacity of
   ST in mitigating soil erosion, as well as for NF. Furthermore, the
   negative role of wheel tracks as preferential pathways for surface
   runoff and sediment is highlighted. Finally, the work shows that CT
   aggravated soil erosion as compared to RF.},

Title = {The economic impact of tourism in Central Finland: a regional
   input-output study},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-547},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic
   impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper
   aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional
   output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional
   input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on
   regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional
   taxes in Central Finland.
   Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that
   tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland
   (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in
   different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on
   employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central
   Finland are quite significant.
   Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem
   from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate
   to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings,
   consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may
   overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism
   jobs are often low paying.
   Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to
   frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in
   planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use
   the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or
   improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries.
   Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at
   the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism
   impact studies using the input-output technique have also been
   conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the
   regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and
   employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have
   focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers
   (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional
   input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism
   expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the
   whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author
   also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The
   results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers
   involved in regional planning and development.},

Title = {Assessing bank dynamics of the Lower Meghna River in Bangladesh: an
   integrated GIS-DSAS approach},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The major conduit of water and sediment discharges from the mighty
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system to the Bay of Bengal, the Lower
   Meghna River (LMR), experiences rapid morphological changes with
   significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences to the
   surrounding areas. This study measures the rate of bankline shifting,
   river widening, and change in the braiding index (BI) in the LMR over a
   period of 30 years (1988-2017) in order to understand the channel
   dynamics. To extract these parameters, we used the Digital Shoreline
   Analysis System (DSAS) together with other geospatial techniques on
   multiple satellite images taken over this period and subsequently
   validated the spatial outcomes through an extensive field investigation.
   Our findings revealed that rapid changes occurred in both banks,
   although at different rates, mostly due to erosion; the right bank has
   retreated at an average rate of 81 m/yr and the left bank at 28 m/yr,
   resulting in widening as well as river migration to the west. The
   channel widening, an overall average increase of about 49\%, has been
   accompanied by a substantial increase in the BI, from 2.2 in 1988 to 6.4
   in 2017. This study suggests that the higher erosion rate in the right
   bank and the consequent westward migration of the river are due to the
   active tectonic setting of the adjoining areas. Enormous volumes of
   water and sediment discharges and their periodic variations,
   heterogeneous bank material properties, climate change, and
   anthropogenic activities are also possible contributors to this bank
   instability. This research shows the value of implementing an integrated
   GIS-DSAS tool for spatiotemporal channel change investigation and could
   be useful in land-use planning and mitigating bank erosion in the LMR
   locality.},

   stable performance, it is necessary to detect and repair the cycle slip
   caused by high dynamics, signal impairments, and loss of lock on the
   signal. Therefore, in this paper, we establish the integration
   positioning model of Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning
   System /INS, we propose a method for using the inertial information to
   assist the Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System for
   cycle slip detection. We use the position information predicted by the
   INS to calculate the cycle slip detection decision, and use the
   hypothesis test to determine whether the cycle slip occurs and correctly
   identify the size and position of the occurrence of the cycle slip. The
   experimental analysis of the simulated and measured scenes validates the
   performance of the proposed algorithm for cycle slip detection,
   effectively detects the occurrence of small cycle slip. For the effect
   of different noise variance, the cycle slip detection method proposed in
   this paper can also keep the probability of accurate detection of cycle
   slips above 86\%. From the positioning result, detection and repair of
   cycle slip can improve positioning accuracy by 64\%.},

Title = {4D-Trajectory Air Traffic Management: Are There `Killer Apps'? - Part 2},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {571-587},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The USA and Europe are developing plans - NextGen and SESAR - to
   transform the processes of Air Traffic Management (ATM). These will
   improve safety and efficiency, and match predicted increases in air
   transportation demand. They use advanced networking technology updated
   with information from satellite navigation and digital non-voice
   communication. The strategic goal, envisaged for 15-20 years hence, is a
   new ATM paradigm. Aircraft would fly on Four-Dimensional (4D)
   trajectories, incorporating altitude, position, time, and other aircraft
   positions and vectors. This vision would involve extremely large
   investments from the airline industry and ATM service providers. Thus,
   development priorities need to be based on sound business cases. But
   will these necessarily lead to the strategic vision of a 4D-trajectory
   system? Will the changes in practice be limited to a series of short and
   medium term operational improvements rather than strategic improvements?
   So, are there `Killer Apps' for 4D-trajectory ATM? `Killer
   App(lication)s' is jargon for innovations so valuable that they prove
   the core value of some larger technology. Killer Apps generate high
   degrees of stakeholder technical and financial cooperation. Ironically,
   most past ATM Killer Apps have improved safety, e. g., modern radar data
   processing led to collision avoidance systems. The analysis here
   attempts to identify and then size potential 4D-trajectory ATM Killer
   Apps. The evidence for Killer Apps has to pass key tests. Killer Apps
   obviously have to offer enormous benefits to stakeholders in the context
   of the potential costs. The bulk of these benefits must not be
   obtainable through technologically `cut down' non-4D-trajectory
   versions. Part 1 of this paper (Brooker, 2012a) sets out the framework
   for investigating these questions. Part 2 examines potential Killer Apps
   derived from improvements in Fuel Efficiency, Capacity and Cost. An
   abbreviated version of this paper was first presented at the European
   Navigation Conference (ENC 2011), London in November 2011.},

Title = {Satellite-based analysis of recent trends in the ecohydrology of a
   semi-arid region},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3779-3794},
Abstract = {We present a regional framework for an integrated and spatiotemporally
   distributed assessment of human-induced trends in the hydrology and the
   associated ecological health of a semi-arid basin where both human
   activities (i.e. agriculture) and natural ecosystems are highly
   groundwater dependent. To achieve this, we analysed the recent trends
   (from year 2000 to 2010) in precipitation, evapotranspiration (actual
   and potential) and vegetation greenness (i.e. NDVI) using a combination
   of satellite and groundbased observations. The trend assessment was
   applied for the semi-arid Konya Basin (Turkey), one of the largest
   endorheic basins in the world.
   The results revealed a consistent increasing trend of both yearly
   evapotranspiration (totally 63 MCM yr(-1) from croplands) and mean NDVI
   (about 0.004 NDVI yr(-1) in irrigated croplands), especially
   concentrating in the plain part of the basin, while no significant
   trends were observed for the precipitation and potential
   evapotranspiration variables. On the contrary, a consistent decreasing
   trend of both yearly evapotranspiration (totally -2.1 MCM yr(-1)) and
   mean NDVI (-0.001 NDVI yr(-1)) was observed in the wetlands, which also
   cannot be explained by trends in precipitation and potential
   evapotranspiration. The emerging picture suggest that the greening trend
   of the vegetation and increasing of evapotranspiration in the plain are
   related to land cover changes (i.e. conversion into irrigated croplands)
   and to the intensification of the supplementary irrigation for
   agriculture, which in turn caused drying out of some wetlands and the
   natural vegetation which mostly depend on the groundwater, the main
   source of irrigation water as well.
   Our study presented an example of the utility of spatially and
   temporally continuous RS data in assessing the regional trends in
   hydrological and ecological variables and their interactions in a
   spatially distributed manner in a semi-arid region, which can also be
   adapted to other regions. Such spatiotemporally distributed analysis at
   the basin level is particularly important considering that most of the
   water management interventions also take place at this scale.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the future land use and land cover (LULC) type in
   some parts of Ethiopia, but not in the study area. This study aims to
   predict and analyze the future scenarios of LULC (2015-2033) using
   cellular automata and Markov Chain model (CA\_Markov) by taking into
   consideration the physical and socio-economic drivers of LULC dynamics.
   The historical LULC change data of 1984-1995, 1995-2015, and 1984-2015
   were used as a baseline. Both transition rules and transition area
   matrix for the period 1984-1995, 1995-2015, and 1984-2015 were produced
   quantitatively using the Markov chain model. After that, the physical
   and socio-economic factors were standardized using fuzzy and then
   Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) was used to produce the transition
   suitability image. The CA\_Markov model was then applied as a standard
   contiguity filter of 5 x 5 to predict the 2033 LULC condition using the
   TerrSet Geospatial Modeling and Monitoring System software. The result
   indicated that forestland are predicted to increase by 108 sq km
   (44.5\%), shrub/bush lands 710 sq km (20\%), built-up area 286.2 sq km
   (48.3\%), and grasslands 31 sq km (15\%), respectively. However,
   significant reductions (losses) in a water body (Wb) 5.2 sq km (11.2\%),
   croplands (Cl) 78.9 sq km (1.3\%), barren lands (Bl) 800 sq km (27.4\%),
   and floodplain area (Fp) 251.68 sq km (33.7\%), respectively.
   Furthermore, the Pearson correlation result between the historical and
   predicted LULC type indicated that there are positive, strongly
   correlated, and are statistically significant relationships (r = 0.981,
   p = 0.000). The increase in forest land and reduction in barren and
   flood plain may benefit the study area. However, the decrease in the
   water body may contribute to the severity of drought in the area. This
   study may help to use as useful information to foster better decisions
   and improve policies in land use within the framework of sustainable
   land use planning system.},

Title = {Assessing the transition from deforestation to forest regrowth with an
   agent-based model of land cover change for south-central Indiana (USA)},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {819-832},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Midwest and Northeast United States has experienced a net increase
   in forest cover since the beginning of the 20th century. However, we
   lack a detailed understanding of the transition to net forest cover
   increase because this forest regrowth occurred prior to the use of tools
   like household-level surveys focused on land use decision-making and
   availability of remote sensing data. Agent-based modeling presents an
   appealing means to explore what social and biophysical dynamics may have
   contributed to this forest regrowth process. In this paper we employ an
   agent-based model to analyze the process of forest regrowth in
   south-central Indiana from 1939 to 1993. Simulation results are
   presented for assumptions regarding pre-existing forest age and the
   stand age at which landowners harvest timber with a goal of
   understanding the influence of these factors on future trajectories of
   land cover change. The results demonstrate both the value and the burden
   of having many time points to evaluate the success of the model. Is the
   best simulation the one with the smallest net residuals across all time
   points? Or is the best simulation the one that best reproduces the
   correct trajectory of land cover change for each time interval? Model
   simulations that assume a harvesting frequency of 30 years all produced
   landscapes within 2\% of the actual forest cover in 1993, the end point
   of the study period. However, the trajectories of these simulations did
   not all mimic the gradual forest regrowth found in our observed data.
   The model simulation with the smallest residual values across all time
   points assumed a initial forest age of 5 years in 1939 and a harvesting
   frequency of 30 years. Ultimately, we cannot definitively conclude that
   one model simulation is a better representation of reality than another
   because we have no way of comprehensively validating the model
   assumptions. However, we can more plausibly conclude that the age of
   forest regrowth in 1939 and the frequency of timber harvesting by
   landowners both had an influence on the successive trajectory of land
   cover change in the study area. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The 13th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2013) Expert
   Panel reviewed and endorsed substantial new evidence on aspects of the
   local and regional therapies for early breast cancer, supporting less
   extensive surgery to the axilla and shorter durations of radiation
   therapy. It refined its earlier approach to the classification and
   management of luminal disease in the absence of amplification or
   overexpression of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)
   oncogene, while retaining essentially unchanged recommendations for the
   systemic adjuvant therapy of HER2-positive and `triple-negative'
   disease. The Panel again accepted that conventional clinico-pathological
   factors provided a surrogate subtype classification, while noting that
   in those areas of the world where multi-gene molecular assays are
   readily available many clinicians prefer to base chemotherapy decisions
   for patients with luminal disease on these genomic results rather than
   the surrogate subtype definitions. Several multi-gene molecular assays
   were recognized as providing accurate and reproducible prognostic
   information, and in some cases prediction of response to chemotherapy.
   Cost and availability preclude their application in many environments at
   the present time. Broad treatment recommendations are presented. Such
   recommendations do not imply that each Panel member agrees: indeed,
   among more than 100 questions, only one (trastuzumab duration) commanded
   100\% agreement. The various recommendations in fact carried differing
   degrees of support, as reflected in the nuanced wording of the text
   below and in the votes recorded in supplementary Appendix S1, available
   at Annals of Oncology online. Detailed decisions on treatment will as
   always involve clinical consideration of disease extent, host factors,
   patient preferences and social and economic constraints.},

Abstract = {Japan has traditionally emphasized international student recruitment and
   exchange as priorities in its internationalization strategy. However,
   little attention has been given to the increasing importance of
   international program and provider mobility (IPPM), which includes
   international branch campuses, franchise programs, international joint
   universities and joint/double degree programs. This article analyzes the
   policies, status and role of IPPM to meet future needs of Japanese
   higher education. The study reveals that the full potential of IPPM is
   not realized given the government's restrictive regulations for the
   establishment of Japanese programs and international branch campuses
   abroad as well as foreign higher education providers in Japan. While
   regulations are necessary to ensure quality and achieve the multiple
   benefits of IPPM provision, there is a need to re-examine and relax some
   of the government regulations that serve as barriers. The success of the
   three Japanese international joint universities provides evidence that
   Japanese universities are motivated and experienced in working
   collaboratively with international partners and looking for new IPPM
   opportunities. Scholars, policy analysts, and academics interested in
   Japan's engagement with the rest of the world through collaborating with
   foreign higher education partners will benefit from this analysis of
   current and past IPPM activities and policies and the call for further
   research.},

Title = {Incorporation of the 40-Gene Expression Profile (40-GEP) Test to Improve
   Treatment Decisions in High-Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
   (cSCC) Patients: Case Series and Algorithm},
Journal = {CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {925-935},
Abstract = {Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has become a significant public
   health issue due to its rapidly rising incidence and an estimated 1.8
   million newly diagnosed cases annually. As with other cancers, treatment
   decisions for patients with cSCC are based primarily on a patient's risk
   for poor outcomes. There has been improvement in clinicopathologic
   factor-based risk assessment approaches, either through informal methods
   or ever evolving staging approaches. However, these approaches
   misidentify patients who will eventually have disease progression as
   low-risk and conversely, over classify patients as high-risk who do not
   experience relapse. To improve the accuracy of risk assessment for
   patients with cSCC, the 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) test has
   been validated to show statistically significant stratification of a
   high-risk cSCC patient's risk of nodal or distant metastasis,
   independent of currently available risk-assessment methods. The 40-GEP
   test allows for a more accurate classification of metastatic risk for
   high-risk cSCC patients, with the aim to influence appropriate
   allocation of clinician time and therapeutic resources to those patients
   who will most benefit. The objective of this article is to present a
   treatment algorithm in which clinicians can easily integrate the results
   of the 40-GEP test into their current treatment approaches to tailor
   patient care based on individual tumor biology. The following modalities
   were considered: surveillance imaging, sentinel lymph node biopsy
   (SLNB), adjuvant radiation therapy (ART), and clinical follow-up. The
   authors have contributed their own cases for discussion as to how they
   have seen the beneficial impact of 40-GEP test results in their own
   practice. Overall, clinicians can identify risk-aligned treatment
   pathway improvements with the use of the 40-GEP test for challenging to
   manage, high-risk cSCC patients.},

Abstract = {GolMexSur, a metadatabase for the oceanographic and meteorological
   information of the southern Gulf of Mexico (SGM) (17N 85W - 26N 99W) was
   designed and implemented in order to organize and manage in a fine and
   regular mesh, oceanic and meteorological data coming from several
   heterogeneous gross-grid-sized or sparse data sources. The metadatabase
   has three organizational components: (1) knowledge base, (2) metadata,
   and (3) data values. Knowledge base component contains three classes of
   knowledge: operating knowledge (triggers, processes, and integrity
   constraints), control knowledge for sequential systems interactions, and
   decision knowledge for parallel systems interactions. Metadata component
   contains organizational information related to the environmental and
   hydrological data: data's spatial and temporal location, measurement
   units, obtaining method, quality, etc. Finally, data values component
   represents the numerical value of each variable or parameter (sea
   surface temperature, wind speed, wind direction, sea level pressure,
   etc). Additionally, metadata and data values components have two
   temporal scopes: recent information, and historical information.
   GolMexSur has information from sources such as coastal airports, coastal
   meteorological stations, oceanographic cruises, buoys, wave gauges, and
   information derived or estimated from satellite imageries or numerical
   models. In a first stage, GolMexSur was designed and implemented using
   MS Visual FoxPro(@), but recently the design was modified to work with
   Oracle(@). The implementation of this metadatabase represents the first
   step of a major project, whose main objective is to build a regional
   operational oceanographic system for the SGM, and at present it is being
   used in studying the oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the SGM oil
   region.},

Abstract = {The actual process of rapid urbanisation is associated with various
   ecological, social and economic changes in both the urban area and the
   adjacent natural environment. To keep up with the effects and impacts of
   this development, effective urban and regional planning requires
   accurate and up-to-date information on the urban dynamics. Recent
   studies have proven the applicability of high resolution optical
   satellite data for the acquisition of some of the requisite spatial and
   socio-economic information.
   Although radar data is more reliably available than optical imagery,
   high resolution radar imagery has barely been employed for urban
   applications so far. This fact is mainly due to a lack of civil space
   borne radar systems featuring a ground resolution which is suitable for
   the analysis of urban structures. Additionally significant difficulties
   concerning the interpretation of according data over highly structured
   urban areas occur. The german TerraSAR-X system will provide radar
   imagery with a spatial resolution comparable to actual high resolution
   optical platforms.
   This study investigates the potential use of high resolution radar data
   in the context of urban applications. Thereby a concept - that was
   developed on the basis of SAR data recorded by DLR's airborne E-SAR
   system - will be adapted to an analysis of TerraSAR-X imagery. It
   introduces a temporally and spatially robust approach towards an
   automated analysis of the urban structure. For that purpose data sets of
   single-polarised X-band imagery are analysed by means of an
   object-oriented classification. This study includes the development of
   an improved image segmentation procedure in order to create meaningful
   spatial entities. Moreover, it contains the definition and application
   of a rule base for the detection of built-up areas, the derivation of
   the urban land cover and the generation of additional value-added
   information related to the urban structure.},

Title = {Analysis of forest fire and climate variability using Geospatial

Abstract = {The dynamic changes in the regimes of forest fires are due to the
   severity of climate and weather factors. The aim of the study was to
   examine the trend of forest fires and to evaluate their relationship
   with climate parameters for the state of Telangana in India. The climate
   and forest fire data were used and uploaded to the GIS platform in a
   specified vector grid (spacing: 0.3 degrees x 0.3 degrees). The data
   were evaluated spatially and statistical methods were applied to examine
   any relationships. The study revealed that there was a 78\% incidence of
   forest fires in the months of February and March. The overall forest
   fire hotspot analysis (January to June) of grids revealed that the seven
   highest forest fire grids retain fire events greater than 600 were found
   in the north east of Warangal, east of Khammam and south east of
   Mahbubnagar districts. The forest fire analysis significantly followed
   the month wise pattern in grid format. Ten grids (in count) showed a
   fire frequency greater than 240 in the month of March and of these,
   three grids (in count) were found to be common where the forest fire
   frequency was highest in the preceding month. Rapid seasonal
   climate/weather changes were observed which significantly enhanced the
   forest fire events in the month of February onwards. The solar radiation
   increased to 159\% in the month of March when compared with the
   preceding month whereas the relative humidity decreased to 47\% in the
   same month. Furthermore, the wind velocity was found to be highest (3.5
   meter/sec.) in the month of February and precipitation was found to be
   lowest (2.9 mm) in the same month. The analysis of Cramer V coefficient
   (CVC) values for wind velocity, maximum temperature, solar radiation,
   relative humidity and precipitation with respect to fire incidence were
   found to be in increasing order and were in the range of 0.280 to 0.715.
   The CVC value for precipitation was found to be highest and equivalent
   to 0.715 and showed its strongest association/relationship with fire
   events. The significant increase in precipitation not only enhances the
   moisture in the soil but also in the dry fuel load lying on the forest
   floor which greatly reduces the fuel burning capacity of the forest. The
   predicted (2050) temperature anomalies data (RCP-6) for the month of
   February and March also showed a significant increase in temperature
   over those areas where forest fire events are found to be notably high
   in the present scenario which will certainly impact adversely on the
   future forest fire regime. Findings from this study have their own
   significance because such analyses/relationships have never be examined
   at the state level, therefore, it can help to fulfill the knowledge gap
   for the scientific community and the state forest department, and
   support fire prevention and control activities. There is a need to
   replicate this study in future by taking more climate variables which
   will certainly give a better understanding of forest fire events and
   their relationships with various parameters. The satellite remote
   sensing data and GIS have a strong potential to analyze various thematic
   datasets and in the visualization of spatial/temporal paradigms and thus
   significantly support the policy making framework.},

Abstract = {Recent flood events along the international border between the USA and
   Mexico resulted in significant economic damage and loss of human life.
   The International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency responsible
   for monitoring US-Mexican flood control levees, had requested funding
   for maintenance and improvement of these levees. However, the Office of
   Management and Budget requires agencies to provide benefits or in this
   case avoided loss estimates to justify the budget request. Due to severe
   time constraints in the budgetary process there was a need for a rapid
   assessment of the potential economic impacts from a failure of this
   ageing flood-control infrastructure. The economic losses avoided by four
   major flood-control projects on the Rio Grande were estimated using an
   innovative combination of satellite imagery, geographic information
   systems, and economic methods. The control projects apply to about 547
   km (340 miles) of levees from Caballo Reservoir in New Mexico to
   Brownsville, Texas, and include several million people, extensive
   industry, and agricultural production. High resolution imagery was used
   to identify and quantify potential flood inundation areas, types of land
   use, and impacts of flood-control infrastructure failure. Value
   estimates of residential, industrial, and commercial property, and
   agricultural production at risk were developed from property assessment
   data, crop enterprise budgets, census data, and community leaders.
   Damage factors accounting for flood inundation levels and building
   contents were then used to develop gross economic losses avoided by
   flood-control infrastructure for each of the different property and land
   use types in each project area. The baseline analysis indicates that the
   four projects cumulatively prevent one time losses of US\$322.9 million
   in flood-control protection.},

Title = {Comparing fine-scale structural and hydrologic connectivity within
   unimproved and improved grassland},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Grasslands vary with diverse forms and functions ranging from
   monocultures of perennial rye grass to more biodiverse unimproved
   grasslands which cover around 5\% of Europe. Despite the broad diversity
   of grassland types, within environmental and flood risk models
   grasslands are frequently represented by a singular set of hydrological
   and structural parameters which belies their diversity and complexity.
   This study aimed to determine empirically the extent to which improved
   versus unimproved grasslands exhibit different hydrological
   connectivity. Working in SW England at neighbouring field sites with
   comparable slopes and rainfall regimes, we used unpiloted aerial
   vehicles to survey a tussocky Molinia caerulea dominated unimproved
   grassland field (MCUG) field and a Lolium perenne dominated improved
   grassland (LPIG) field. Using digital photogrammetry workflows applied
   to the overlapping aerial images, we produced a digital surface model
   (DSM) at 0.03-m resolution from which flow pathways were modelled using
   GIS and compared with 1-m LiDAR and DSM produced by a global navigation
   satellite system (GNSS). MCUG had longer, tortuous pathways through the
   dense tussock network with a drainage density of 2.54 m m(-2). This was
   significantly greater than drainage density in the LPIG (1.82 m m(-2)).
   As a result of this study, we rescaled the Manning's n value for MCUG
   according to photogrammetrically-derived roughness values. We suggest it
   should lie between 0.075 and 0.09. Our data shows that MCUG can play an
   important role in reducing overland flow impacts when compared to LPIG
   through lower connectivity which can delay run-off to rivers.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Variability in White Shark (<i>Carcharodon
   carcharias</i>) Movement Ecology During Residency and Migration Phases
   in the Western North Atlantic},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {08},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Understanding how mobile, marine predators use three-dimensional space
   over time is central to inform management and conservation actions.
   Combining tracking technologies can yield powerful datasets over
   multiple spatio-temporal scales to provide critical information for
   these purposes. For the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), detailed
   movement and migration information over ontogeny, including inter- and
   intra-annual variation in timing of movement phases, is largely unknown
   in the western North Atlantic (WNA), a relatively understudied area for
   this species. To address this need, we tracked 48 large juvenile to
   adult white sharks between 2012 and 2020, using a combination of
   satellite-linked and acoustic telemetry. Overall, WNA white sharks
   showed repeatable and predictable patterns in horizontal movements,
   although there was variation in these movements related to sex and size.
   While most sharks undertook an annual migratory cycle with the majority
   of time spent over the continental shelf, some individuals, particularly
   adult females, made extensive forays into the open ocean as far east as
   beyond the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Moreover, increased off-shelf use
   occurred with body size even though migration and residency phases were
   conserved. Summer residency areas included coastal Massachusetts and
   portions of Atlantic Canada, with individuals showing fidelity to
   specific regions over multiple years. An autumn/winter migration
   occurred with sharks moving rapidly south to overwintering residency
   areas in the southeastern United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico,
   where they remained until the following spring/summer. While broad
   residency and migration periods were consistent, migratory timing varied
   among years and among individuals within years. White sharks monitored
   with pop-up satellite-linked archival tags made extensive use of the
   water column (0-872 m) and experienced a broad range of temperatures
   (-0.9 - 30.5 degrees C), with evidence for differential vertical use
   based on migration and residency phases. Overall, results show dynamic
   inter- and intra-annual three-dimensional patterns of movements
   conserved within discrete phases. These results demonstrate the value of
   using multiple tag types to track long-term movements of large mobile
   species. Our findings expand knowledge of the movements and migration of
   the WNA white shark population and comprise critically important
   information to inform sound management strategies for the species.},

Title = {Mapping oak wilt disease from space using land surface phenology},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {298},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Protecting the future of forests relies on our ability to observe
   changes in forest health. Thus, developing tools for sensing diseases in
   a timely fashion is critical for managing threats at broad scales. Oak
   wilt -a disease caused by a pathogenic fungus (Bretziella fagacearum)-
   is threatening oaks, killing thousands yearly while negatively impacting
   the ecosystem services they provide. Here we propose a novel workflow
   for mapping oak wilt by targeting temporal disease progression through
   symptoms using land surface phenology (LSP) from spaceborne
   observations. By doing so, we hypothesize that phenological changes in
   pigments and photosynthetic activity of trees affected by oak wilt can
   be tracked using LSP metrics derived from the Chlorophyll/Carotenoid
   Index (CCI). We used dense time-series observations from Sentinel-2 to
   create Analysis Ready Data across Minnesota and Wisconsin and to derive
   three LSP metrics: the value of CCI at the start and end of the growing
   season, and the coefficient of variation of the CCI during the growing
   season. We integrate high-resolution airborne imagery in multiple
   locations to select pixels (n = 3872) from the most common oak tree
   health conditions: healthy, symptomatic for oak wilt, and dead. These
   pixels were used to train an iterative Partial Least Square Discriminant
   (PLSD) model and derive the probability of an oak tree (i.e., pixel) in
   one of these conditions and the associated uncertainty. We assessed
   these models spatially and temporally on testing datasets revealing that
   it is feasible to discriminate among the three health conditions with
   overall accuracy between 80 and 82\%. Within conditions, our models
   suggest that spatial variations among three CCI-derived LSP metrics can
   identify healthy (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.98), symptomatic (AUC =
   0.89), and dead (AUC = 0.94) oak trees with low false positive rates.
   The model performance was robust across different years as well. The
   predictive maps were used to guide local stakeholders to locate disease
   hotspots for ground verification and subsequent decision-making for
   treat-ment. Our results highlight the capabilities of LSP metrics from
   dense spaceborne observations to map diseases and to monitor large-scale
   change in biodiversity.},

Title = {REVIEW OF MAN-MADE MINERAL FORMATIONS ACCUMULATION AND PROSPECTS OF
   THEIR DEVELOPING IN MINING INDUSTRIAL REGIONS IN UKRAINE},
Journal = {MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-38},
Abstract = {Purpose. Analysis of the man-made mineral formations of ore mining and
   smelting, fuel and energy complexes development accumulation, location
   and prospects amount in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
   Methods. Comprehensive approach, including analysis of state statistics,
   waste handling sites (WHSs), regional environmental report,
   environmental passport of the region, as well as data from other
   information sources is used in the work. Aerial photographs of man-made
   formations were obtained using the Google Earth 7.1.8 satellite program.
   Findings. The analysis of the main man-made mineral formations of ore
   mining and smelting, fuel and energy complexes accumulation in Ukraine
   (coal and mining industry waste heaps, tailing dumps, ash dumps, smelter
   slag dumps) was conducted, their amount and occupied areas were
   estimated. According to the densest location of man-made formations,
   they are divided into 4 regions: the Prydniprovsk region, the Kryvyi Rih
   region, the Nikopol region, the Pavlohrad region. According to
   information sources, the content of some valuable components in man-made
   formations has been established. Based on the world market prices of
   technogenic deposits components research, it was proposed to grade them
   according to the cost of valuable components. The promising directions
   have been proposed for the use of mineral resources in various economic
   sectors. It is noted that from the perspective of development of mineral
   and raw materials potential, the bulk formations are of interest because
   of their large reserves in the minimum area. But from the perspective of
   environmental protection and the interests of the Ukrainian people, the
   bulk technogenic formations occupying significant areas of agricultural
   land and having smaller mineral reserves are of great interest.
   Originality. The conception of man-made raw material mineral fund for
   further industrial development as an alternative to natural deposits is
   extended and systematized. For the first time, an integrated and
   detailed analysis has been performed of technogenic waste of the largest
   waste storage region in Ukraine, as well as the grouping has been
   proposed of mining and energy sector waste by density of location and by
   the contained components value.
   Practical implications. A sketch-map of the man-made objects location
   was drawn up and their gradation was carried out according to the
   preliminary prospects of their development. This will provide a more
   objective approach to the concept of industrial waste development and
   planning the strategy for the development of mineral and raw materials
   potential both at the state and regional levels.},

Abstract = {This study reports on the evaluation of a skills-enhancement training
   series for direct service providers in home care that was part of a
   federally funded state-level initiative to improve employee recruitment

   to improve problem-solving, communication, and stress management skills
   in order to increase professionalism and self-efficacy. While the first
   year of training utilized a network of ``real-time{''} compressed
   video-teleconferencing broadcast to satellite sites statewide, these
   broadcasts were videotaped and accompanied by trained moderator-led
   scripted case study discussions at each of the sites during the second
   year. As the training series progressed, there was a linear increase in
   the likelihood that training would change the way participants performed
   their jobs in the future. Importantly, the training was more highly
   rated by the participants who had a greater commitment to pursuing their
   care work with geriatric clients. The merit of the program and
   implications of the results for the issue of employee retention are
   discussed. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {ROAD MAP OF EVOLUTION OF NICNET TOWARDS GLOBALIZATION OF

Abstract = {A view is advocated here that the application of computers and
   communication as an integrated technology, has more impact on social and
   economic development than computer technology alone or communication
   technology alone. As social and economic interaction cannot be localised
   artificially in a world moving towards a `global village', globalisation
   of computer-communication networks will become the major enabling
   instrument for this evolution.
   The evolution of NICNET, the computer communication nework of the
   National Informatic Centre, is so oriented that such an integration and
   globalisation is progressively impelemented utilising the latest low
   cost technologies available in the international market. Tracing the
   evolution of NICNET from its genesis in 1985, the choice of the various
   technologies to date, and, the road map for NICNET till 2000 AD is
   projected in step with the forecasting of technological evolution
   towards integration and globalisation of computer and communication
   resources.
   The choice of Spread Spectrum Multiple Access/Code Division Multiple
   Access (SSMA/COMA) based Very Small Aperture Terminal (VAST) Satellite
   Earth Station technology is discussed to support the contention that
   VAST Technology enabled the first level of integration and globalisation
   between 1985 and 1992.
   Discussing the inevitability of the Ku/Ka band choice for the next level
   of integration and globalisation, the potential of Single Channel Per
   Carrier (SCPC) based `hubles' VASTs with two-way as well as data
   broadcast capabilities and dedicated high speed external gateways is
   outlined as the second essential step in the integration and
   globalisation while at the same time, realising a NICNET Info-Highway
   during the period 1993 to 1997. On the ground segment, special
   technologies for effectively linking widely separated local area
   networks, network FAX and image server and multimedia communication
   services are proposed. Special features for accommodating a large number
   or close user groups and offering virtual private networks can increase
   the propensity for the spread of the IT culture as well as prod the
   growth of demand.
   During the period from 1986 to 2001, certain concepts of future space
   data networks are forecast which can propell NICNET to the third level
   of integration and globalisation. Based on the concept of NICSAT earlier
   conceptualised, a series of very low cost microsats will be launched for
   an internally operable dedicated space data network with user end to end
   communication capability, built in features for promoting specialised
   value added services, built in access security and expert system based
   network management. Low cost on-board features, a versatile space link
   scenario and a low cost ground infrastructure scenario are suggested.
   The possibility of introducing BISDN via such a satellite cluster are
   examined.
   Towards the end of the decade, NICNET will be incrementally converted
   for providing global intelligent network services over a strong skeleton
   of data super highway utilising the concept of application gateway in a
   global intelligent network, the interoperability of the service
   management systems, service creation environment and operation systems
   as well as support the interaction of the intelligent network components
   for intra-network and inter-network cases. The intelligent network
   architecture proposed is explicitly designed to support personal
   communication services on a global basis.},

Title = {Cardiac Markers: A Chest Pain Center Focus},
Booktitle = {SHORT STAY MANAGEMENT OF CHEST PAIN},
Series = {Contemporary Cardiology},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {91-113},
Abstract = {Use of cardiac biomarkers for care of patients presenting to the
   emergency department has a rich history beginning in the 1950s.
   Aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, creatine
   kinase and its MB isoenzyme and myoglobin have all been utilized over
   the years. However a sentinel event occurred in the 1990s with the
   availability of assays for the myocardial specific biomarkers cardiac
   troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Along with clinical
   features and the electrocardiogram, cTnI and cTnT measurements are now a
   cornerstone for early risk stratification, the diagnosis of myocardial
   infarction and clinical decision-making in the context of suspected
   acute coronary syndrome patients in the emergency department.
   Point-of-care measurements of cardiac troponin and other markers have
   been implemented at many institutions where the central laboratory is
   unable to provide results in one hour or less from the time of
   collection. Because cTnT and cTnI are believed to be released only upon
   myocardial necrosis, there has been substantial effort in identifying
   markers of myocardial ischemia that do not necessarily have irreversible
   cell death. Promising markers include ischemia modified albumin,
   C-reactive protein, myloperoxidase as well as B-type natriuretic peptide
   and its biologically inactive co-metabolite NT-proBNP. Also, attention
   has turned to measurement of very low troponin concentrations measured
   using assays that are able to measure troponin reliably at
   concentrations 10- to 100-fold lower than the best conventional troponin
   assays, with the idea of specifically detecting subtle cardiac injury
   associated with unstable angina. There are a number of clinical
   confounders for measurements including renal insufficiency, end stage
   renal disease, blunt chest trauma, pulmonary embolism, chemotherapy and
   recent cardiac procedures. Interpretation of cardiac marker results in
   these clinical circumstances can be complicated and the clinical course
   of the patient relative to temporal increase in biomarkers must be taken
   into account.
   Few tests have the clinical value and impact of cTnT and cTnI, and it is
   unlikely that these tests will be replaced for the diagnosis of MI in
   the foreseeable future. For risk stratification and patient management,
   however., other markers of inflammation, heart dysfunction or the
   coagulation process may provide complementary information. Some of these
   novel markers may come from the proteomic, metabolomic and molecular
   diagnostic studies. However, it is critical to note that the real value
   of any new or existing markers will hinge on evidence that their
   utilization can be shown to improve clinical and/or economic outcomes.},

   Reporting Field},
Journal = {CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 9},
Abstract = {Background: Hospital-presenting self-harm is a strong predictor of
   suicide and has substantial human and health service costs. Aims: We
   aimed to identify changes in case ascertainment after implementation of
   a new self-harm reporting field at a tertiary hospital in New South
   Wales, and to report event rates, demographic, and clinical
   characteristics. Method: Self-harm events presenting to the emergency
   department (October 2017 to August 2020) were identified using clinical
   documentation and a new reporting field. Changes in the frequency of
   self-harm in the period after implementation of the self-harm field were
   assessed through Poisson regression models. Results: A twofold increase
   in the frequency of self-harm was detected following the implementation
   of the new reporting field. The annual average age-standardized event
   rate of self-harm was 110.4 per 100,000 (120.8 per 100,000 for females;
   100.1 per 100,000 for males). The highest rates by age and sex were for
   females aged 15-19 years (375 per 100,000) and mates aged 20-24 years
   (175 per 100,000). Limitations: Self-harm identification relies on
   clinician coding practice, which is subject to variability and potential
   under-enumeration. Conclusion: These findings highlight the value of a
   self-harm reporting field in hospital record systems for accurate
   recording and tong-term monitoring of self-harm event rates.},

Title = {The Effects of Urban Warming on Herbivore Abundance and Street Tree
   Condition},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Trees are essential to urban habitats because they provide services that
   benefit the environment and improve human health. Unfortunately, urban
   trees often have more herbivorous insect pests than rural trees but the
   mechanisms and consequences of these infestations are not well
   documented. Here, we examine how temperature affects the abundance of a
   scale insect, Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) (Hemiptera:
   Diaspididae), on one of the most commonly planted street trees in the
   eastern U. S. Next, we examine how both pest abundance and temperature
   are associated with water stress, growth, and condition of 26 urban
   street trees. Although trees in the warmest urban sites grew the most,
   they were more water stressed and in worse condition than trees in
   cooler sites. Our analyses indicate that visible declines in tree
   condition were best explained by scale-insect infestation rather than
   temperature. To test the broader relevance of these results, we extend
   our analysis to a database of more than 2700 Raleigh, US street trees.
   Plotting these trees on a Landsat thermal image of Raleigh, we found
   that warmer sites had over 70\% more trees in poor condition than those
   in cooler sites. Our results support previous studies linking warmer
   urban habitats to greater pest abundance and extend this association to
   show its effect on street tree condition. Our results suggest that
   street tree condition and ecosystem services may decline as urban
   expansion and global warming exacerbate the urban heat island effect.
   Although our non-probability sampling method limits our scope of
   inference, our results present a gloomy outlook for urban forests and
   emphasize the need for management tools. Existing urban tree inventories
   and thermal maps could be used to identify species that would be most
   suitable for urban conditions.},

Title = {Current costs of dialysis modalities: A comprehensive analysis within
   the United Kingdom},
Journal = {PERITONEAL DIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {578-584},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Previous evidence suggests home-based dialysis to be more
   cost-effective than unit-based or hospital-based dialysis. However,
   previous analyses to quantify the costs of different dialysis modalities
   have used varied perspectives, different methods, and required
   assumptions due to lack of available data. The National Institute for
   Health and Care Excellence reports uncertainty about the differences in
   costs between home-based and unit-based dialysis. This uncertainty
   limits the ability of policy makers to make recommendations based on
   cost effectiveness, which also impacts on the ability of budget holders
   to model the impact of any service redesign and to understand which
   therapies deliver better value. The aim of our study was to use a
   combination of top-down and bottom-up costing methods to determine the
   direct medical costs of different dialysis modalities in one UK nation
   (Wales) from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS).
   Methods: Detailed hybrid top-down and bottom-up micro-costing methods
   were applied to estimate the direct medical costs of dialysis modalities
   across Wales. Micro-costing data was obtained from commissioners of the
   service and from interviews with renal consultants, nurses, accountants,
   managers and allied health professionals. Top-down costing information
   was obtained from the Welsh Renal Clinical Network (who commission renal
   services across Wales) and the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust. Results:
   The annual direct cost per patient for home-based modalities was 16,395
   pound for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 20,295 pound
   for automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and 23,403 pound for home-based
   haemodialysis (HHD). The annual cost per patient for unit-based
   modalities depended on whether or not patients required ambulance
   transport. Excluding transport, the cost of dialysis was 19,990 pound
   for satellite units run in partnership with independent sector providers
   and 23,737 pound for hospital units managed and staffed by the NHS. When
   ambulance transport was included, the respective costs were 28,931 pound
   and 32,678 pound, respectively. Conclusion: Our study is the most
   comprehensive analysis of the costs of dialysis undertaken thus far in
   the United Kingdom and clearly demonstrate that CAPD is less costly than
   other dialysis modalities. When ambulance transport costs are included,
   other home therapies (APD and HHD) are also less costly than unit-based
   dialysis. This detailed analysis of the components that contribute to
   dialysis costs will help inform future cost-effectiveness studies,
   inform healthcare policy and drive service redesign.},

Abstract = {The most significant innovations in the field of higher education that
   need to be comprehended by the scientific community include the
   transition of a number of Russian universities to personalized learning
   along individual educational trajectories, which radically changes
   agents' everyday practices within the educational space. Based on an
   empirical study conducted at the University of Tyumen in December 2022
   (N = 1000), the educational strategies of first-year students in the
   context of individual educational trajectories have been considered in
   the article. Regarding studying at a university as a stage of the
   educational trajectory, which is part of the entire life path of a
   student, we use the temporal and value properties of the student's life
   world, their dynamics in the process of moving along an individual
   educational trajectory within the institutional space of the university
   as the basis for the typology of educational strategies. Factor analysis
   included the following components: 1) the meaning of past events ({''}
   Factors of the experience of studying at school{''}); 2) the value of
   relevant learning practices ({''} Factors of readiness for studying at a
   university (competence factors){''} and `` Factors of the principles
   importance of training within the individual educational
   trajectory{''}); 3) anticipation of the future - plans, goals, possible
   personal trajectories of life ({''}Factors of expectations from studying
   at a university{''} and `` Professional prospects factors{''}). These
   groups of factors have been considered as independent empirical
   indicators and used as classification features for the subsequent
   differentiation of respondents into clusters. The result of the factor
   and cluster analysis is the typology of educational strategies of
   first-year students in the context of the implementation of the new
   educational model: ``conformists{''}, ``excellent students{''},
   ``activists{''}, ``nihilists{''}; each of them has its own educational
   strategy at the university. Conclusions are drawn about the expediency
   of building such a typology at the beginning of the student's
   educational trajectory, as this allows making timely management
   decisions on the development of educational strategies desirable for the
   university and the labor market and the correction of tundesirable ones,
   as well as the possibility of further monitoring measurements.},

Abstract = {Remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices improves
   device surveillance and patient clinical management. The greatest
   challenge in implementing remote monitoring in standard practice is the
   need to develop new organizational models, capable of combining clinical
   effectiveness, low resource consumption, and patient acceptance. Since
   2005, we developed a new model based on `Primary Nursing' in which each
   patient is assigned to a nurse responsible for continuity of care. The
   model is essentially based on a cooperative interaction between the
   roles of an expert reference nurse and a responsible physician with an
   agreed list of respective tasks and responsibilities. After a pilot
   experience, the model was tested in a wide registry, the HomeGuide
   Registry, in which 1650 patients were enrolled. In this setting, remote
   monitoring sensitivity in detecting major cardiovascular events was very
   high (84\%) with a positive predictive value of 97\%. Overall, 95\% of
   asymptomatic and 73\% of actionable events were detected during remote
   monitoring sessions with a median reaction time of 3 days. Manpower was
   remarkably low: 55.5 min per health personnel per month every 100
   patients. The strongest points of this model include strict definition
   of workflow, early reaction, traceability, continuity of care,
   maintaining human relationship with the patient. This model has been
   tested successfully even in a multicentre setting in the Model Project
   Monitor Centre study, in which one monitor centre screened daily remote

Abstract = {Geomorphological information can be combined with decision-support tools
   to assess landslide hazard and risk. A heuristic model was applied to a
   rural municipality in eastern Cuba. The study is based on a terrain
   mapping units (TMU) map, generated at 1:50,000 scale by interpretation
   of aerial photos, satellite images and field data. Information
   describing 603 terrain units was collected in a database. Landslide
   areas were mapped in detail to classify the different failure types and
   parts. Three major landslide regions are recognized in the study area:
   coastal hills with rockfalls, shallow debris flows and old rotational
   rockslides denudational slopes in limestone, with very large deep-seated
   rockslides related to tectonic activity and the Sierra de Caujeri scarp,
   with large rockslides. The Caujeri scarp presents the highest hazard,
   with recent landslides and various signs of active processes. The
   different landforms and the causative factors for landslides were
   analyzed and used to develop the heuristic model. The model is based on
   weights assigned by expert judgment and organized in a number of
   components such as slope angle, internal relief, slope shape, geological
   formation, active faults, distance to drainage, distance to springs,
   geomorphological subunits and existing landslide zones. From these
   variables a hierarchical heuristic model was applied in which three
   levels of weights were designed for classes, variables, and criteria.
   The model combines all weights into a single hazard value for each pixel
   of the landslide hazard map. The hazard map was then divided by two
   scales, one with three classes for disaster managers and one with 10
   detailed hazard classes for technical staff The range of weight values
   and the number of existing landslides is registered for each class. The
   resulting increasing landslide density with higher hazard classes
   indicates that the output map is reliable. The landslide hazard map was
   used in combination with existing information on buildings and
   infrastructure to prepare a qualitative risk map. The complete lack of
   historical landslide information and geotechnical data precludes the
   development of quantitative deterministic or probabilistic models. (c)

Title = {Uncertainty quantification in a heterogeneous fluvial sandstone
   reservoir using GPU-based Monte Carlo simulation},
Journal = {GEOTHERMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {114},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The efficient operation and management of a geothermal project can be
   largely affected by geological, physical, operational and economic
   uncertainties. Systematic uncertainty quantification (UQ) involving
   these parameters helps to determine the probability of the focused
   outputs, e.g., energy production, Net Present Value (NPV), etc. However,
   how to efficiently assess the specific impacts of different uncertain
   parameters on the outputs of a geothermal project is still not clear. In
   this study, we performed a comprehensive UQ to a low-enthalpy geothermal
   reservoir using the GPU implementation of the Delft Advanced Research
   Terra Simulator (DARTS) framework with stochastic Monte Carlo samplings
   of uncertain parameters. With processing the simulation results, large
   uncertainties have been found in the production temperature, pressure
   drop, produced energy and NPV. It is also clear from the analysis that
   salinity influences the producing energy and NPV via changing the amount
   of energy carried in the fluid. Our work shows that the uncertainty in
   NPV is much larger than that in produced energy, as more uncertain
   factors were encompassed in NPV evaluation. An attempt to substitute
   original 3D models with upscaled 2D models in UQ demonstrates
   significant differences in the stochastic response of these two
   approaches in representation of realistic heterogeneity. The GPU version
   of DARTS significantly improved the simulation performance, which
   guarantees the full set (10,000 times) UQ with a large model (circa 3.2
   million cells) finished within a day. With this study, the importance of
   UQ to geothermal field development is comprehensively addressed. This
   work provides a framework for assessing the impacts of uncertain
   parameters on the concerning system output of a geothermal project and
   will facilitate analyses with similar procedures.},

Title = {Incidence and etiology of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated
   diarrhea among children under five years of age in low- and

   Study},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},

Abstract = {Diarrhea is a leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in
   low- and middle-income countries. While vaccines may prevent diarrhea
   infections for which children often receive antibiotics, the
   contribution of individual enteropathogens to antibiotic use is
   minimally understood. We used data from the Global Enteric Multicenter
   Study (GEMS) to estimate pathogen-specific incidence of
   antibiotic-treated diarrhea among children under five years old residing
   in six countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia before rotavirus
   vaccine implementation. GEMS was an age-stratified, individually-matched
   case-control study. Stool specimens were obtained from children
   presenting to sentinel health clinics with newly-onset, acute diarrhea
   (including moderate-to-severe and less-severe diarrhea) as well as
   matched community controls without diarrhea. We used data from
   conventional and quantitative molecular diagnostic assays applied to
   stool specimens to estimate the proportion of antibiotic-treated
   diarrhea cases attributable to each pathogen. Antibiotics were
   administered or prescribed to 9,606 of 12,109 moderate-to-severe cases
   and 1,844 of 3,174 less-severe cases. Across all sites, incidence rates
   of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated diarrhea were 12.2 (95\%
   confidence interval: 9.0-17.8), 10.2 (7.4-13.9) and 1.9 (1.3-3.0)
   episodes per 100 child-years at risk at ages 6 weeks to 11 months, 12-23
   months, and 24-59 months, respectively. Based on the recommendation for
   antibiotic treatment to be reserved for cases with dysentery, we
   estimated a ratio of 12.6 (8.6-20.8) inappropriately-treated diarrhea
   cases for each appropriately-treated case. Rotavirus, adenovirus
   serotypes 40/41,Shigella, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia
   coli, andCryptosporidiumwere the leading antibiotic-treated diarrhea
   etiologies. Rotavirus caused 29.2\% (24.5-35.2\%) of antibiotic-treated
   cases, including the largest share in both the first and second years of
   life.Shigellacaused 14.9\% (11.4-18.9\%) of antibiotic-treated cases,
   and was the leading etiology at ages 24-59 months. Our findings should
   inform the prioritization of vaccines with the greatest potential to
   reduce antibiotic exposure among children.
   Author summary Because diarrhea is the second-leading cause of
   antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income
   countries (LMICs), effective vaccines against diarrheal pathogens may
   have the collateral benefit of reducing antibiotic exposure and
   resistance selection in these settings. Whereas antibiotic treatment is
   only recommended for diarrhea cases with blood in the stool (which
   suggestsShigellaetiology), little is known about real-world diarrhea
   treatment practices in LMICs. We used data from a study of children
   experiencing diarrhea and matched, asymptomatic controls residing in
   LMICs of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to understand factors leading
   to antibiotic treatment of diarrhea cases, and the proportion of cases
   attributable to various enteric pathogens. We identify rotavirus
   andShigellaas the predominant causes of antibiotic-treated diarrhea at
   ages 0-23 months and 24-59 months; additional leading causes include
   adenovirus serotypes 40/41, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia
   coli, andCryptosporidium. We estimate that approximately 12.6 diarrhea
   cases receive antibiotics inappropriately for each appropriately-treated
   case in the study settings. Vaccines against prominent enteropathogens
   may substantially reduce antibiotic consumption among children in LMICs.},

Abstract = {Since its introduction in 1992, the Teledyne RDI Instruments (TRDI)
   Workhorse ADCP has become ubiquitous, with literally thousands of
   systems deployed in nearly every body of water on earth. While the
   measurement itself remains relatively unchanged, in the intervening
   years the use of the measurements has changed to an extraordinary
   extent. Originally a novel way to measure currents sorely in need of
   proving and acceptance by the research community, ADCP measurements are
   now the de facto standard for current measurement. What began as a
   useful tool for academic research continues in that role, but has also
   become standard equipment for real time decision making. ADCPs are now
   routinely used to measure river discharge and to aid flood control
   engineers in managing river levels. Since a terrible accident occurred
   in Tampa Bay, ADCPs now provide current information in near real-time to
   the pilots and captains of large vessels as they ply many of the world's
   major ports and waterways. Because offshore platforms cannot safely
   operate in the large currents of the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current and
   the Eddies it generates, ADCPs play a critical role on all offshore
   platforms in the deep Gulf of Mexico. The presence and trajectories of
   these high Gulf of Mexico currents are forecast with great accuracy, the
   ADCPs real utility comes in determining when they are no longer
   affecting the rig. ADCPs provide information on an hourly basis in near
   real time from the TAO/TRITON array for climate forecasting. Returned
   Signal Strength Intensity data, originally provided strictly as an
   ancillary quality control parameter, has developed into a useful tool
   for studies as diverse as the diel migration of zooplankton to aid in
   creating optimal harbor designs based on sediment transport patterns in
   the area.
   The way that ADCPs are deployed has also changed dramatically.
   Originally a speed log for large vessels, the ADCP first morphed to a
   large, and very heavy, instrument for autonomous deployments on
   moorings. It has grown smaller and lighter over the years, with some
   ADCPs now easily hand carried from location to location for spot
   measurements. ADCPs are now available in horizontal configurations, with
   multiple beams, even as single point current meters.
   Perhaps most dramatic of all is the change in the typical user of ADCP
   data. The original early adopters of ADCP technology were members of the
   academic community well versed in marine engineering, computer
   programming and underwater acoustics in addition to their ``main{''}
   interest of measuring ocean currents. Those users are still around of
   course, but they are now the minority. The typical user of today has
   less interest in how the measurement was made than in the robustness,
   accuracy and general utility of the current measurement for their
   purpose at hand. That is, the instrument is a given, the information it
   provides is what is needed. Many users are now no longer nearly as
   familiar with DOS and Unix (if at all) as they are with smart phones and
   touch screens.
   TRDI has been developing a new ADCP with these changes in mind. A
   prototype of the new system was deployed along with a Workhorse used as
   a standard for comparison. We present the results of that deployment,
   and some of the changes made in light of the changing requirements of
   the users.},

Abstract = {A good understanding of acoustic coverage and temporal variation
   relative to environmental conditions is crucial for accurate
   interpretation of results from acoustic tracking studies and ensuing
   appropriate management recommendations.
   In their recent paper, Gjelland \& Hedger (Methods in Ecology and
   Evolution, 2017) suggest that the general detection probability model
   proposed by Gjelland \& Hedger (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2013,
   4, 665-674) was not appropriately used in Huveneers et al. (Methods in
   Ecology and Evolution, 2016, 7, 825-835). The intent of the comparison
   in Huveneers et al. (2016) was to evaluate the Acoustic Propagation
   Model (APM) in a situation when parameterisation is not logistically
   feasible. This can be the case when reference tags have not been
   deployed, or when the distance between tagged animals and receivers
   cannot be accurately estimated or cannot be obtained under sufficiently
   varied weather conditions. Even when parameterisation is possible, there
   will be situations where the APM does not account for all factors
   affecting detection probability, e.g. deep-water receivers where density
   gradients can affect sound propagation.
   Re-parameterisation of the APM based on clarification in Gjelland \&
   Hedger (2017) and application to a deep-water cross-shelf receiver array
   showed similar detection range to a logistic model until about (similar
   to)750m distance, after which the APM resulted in unrealistically high
   detection probability estimates. The need for large amounts of data to
   parameterise the APM and achieve good statistical fit negates the value
   of the theoretical propagation model. Detection range can also be
   affected by a broad range of factors, many of which are not included
   within the APM. The complexity of the way different environmental
   factors can influence acoustic detections and the variability of
   environments in which acoustic tracking studies are undertaken make it
   challenging to develop a general model applicable across environments.
   We support further improvement of the APM and recommend the use of
   reference tags to collect necessary data to parameterise the APM and
   assess factors influencing detection probability.},

Title = {Spatial Estimation and Visualization of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions for
   Campus Sustainability: The Case of King Abdullah University of Science
   and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A total of 21 metric tons of CO2 per person in terms of per capita
   emissions from consumption of energy was recorded in Saudi Arabia in
   2011 and forecasts have shown that this emission of CO2 is increasing.
   This poses the threat of climate change and global warming and therefore
   the need for the sustainability of the country. The Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia's Vision for 2030 addresses environmental sustainability that
   includes a reduction in CO2 emissions as well as diversified economic
   growth. Universities have been regarded as institutions with significant
   responsibilities to resolve the issues of sustainability as well as
   serve as role model to society by implementing a sustainability plan.
   This study established a spatial evaluation, estimation, and
   visualization of the CO2 emissions of King Abdullah University of
   Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. The data required for this
   study were collected from the overall coverage of the university campus
   buildings by transforming raster data from the satellite image to vector
   data in the form of polygons, and then multiplying the area by the
   number of floors of the individual building. ArcGIS 10.3((R)) (ESRI,
   Redlands, CA, USA) software was used for this campus CO2 emissions
   evaluation and visualization. The overall estimate of the CO2 emissions
   for the university campus was 127.7-tons CO2 equivalent. The lowest
   emission was 0.02-tons CO2 equivalent while the maximum value was
   20.9-tons of CO2 equivalent. By this ArcGIS-based evaluation, it is
   evident that geographically integrated model for campus estimation and
   visualization of CO2 emissions provides the information for decision
   makers to develop viable strategies for achieving a higher standard in
   overall campus sustainability and addressing the issue of climate
   change.},

Title = {Multi-source satellite imagery and point of interest data for poverty
   mapping in East Java, Indonesia: Machine learning and deep learning
   approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach to provide a more granular poverty
   map in terms of coverage (up to a grid level with the spatial resolution
   of 1.5 km) with less cost and time to update to support better poverty
   monitoring. Two poverty estimation model development scenarios using
   machine learning and deep learning were evaluated in this study. First,
   the model is constructed using multisource satellite imagery and
   geospatial point of interest location of economic in-frastructures using
   zonal statistics feature extraction, which is the proposed approach in
   this study. The specific multisource satellite imagery to be used as
   poverty indicators are night-time light intensity (NTL) as an approach
   to economic activity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as
   an approach to detect rural areas based on vegetation, built-up index
   (BUI) as an approach to detect urban areas based on building
   distribution, normalized difference water index (NDWI) to detect land
   cover, land surface temperature (LST) as an approach to detecting urban
   areas based on surface temperature, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an approach to detecting
   economic activities based on pollution, as well as point of interest
   (POI) density, and POI distance which show the accessibility of an area.
   Second, the model is constructed from daytime multiband and nighttime
   light intensity satellite imagery using the deep learning architecture
   of Resnet-34 transfer learning feature extraction. In each scenario, we
   compared the performance of different machine learning (support vector
   regression/SVR, decision tree regression/DTR, and random forest
   regression/RFR) algorithms along with deep learning (multiple layer
   perceptron/MLP and one dimensional-convolutional neural network/ CNN-1D)
   algorithms. Based on the results of the model development evaluation,
   the CNN-1D model was chosen as the best model in the first scenario, and
   the Resnet-34 + MLP model was chosen as the best model in the second
   scenario. The two best models from the first and second scenarios are
   then used to predict poverty at the grid level with a spatial resolution
   of 1.5 km. Based on official poverty data, the estimated poverty mapping
   built using the CNN-1D model in the first scenario was chosen as the
   best map with the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.95 and
   adjusted R2 0.84 at the district level. The results of visual
   identification revealed that high estimates of poverty are typically
   found in sparsely inhabited areas surrounded by unoc-cupied land, which
   is usually an agricultural area. Otherwise, low poverty estimates, on
   the other hand, are more likely to be found in highly populated regions
   with convenient access. Our finding is aligned with the official report
   of Statistics Indonesia, which claims that poverty in rural re-gions is
   higher than in urban areas.},

Title = {Techno-economic assessment of application of solar PV in building sector
   A case study from Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-52},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Purpose The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is facing a rapid growth in
   energy demand mainly because of factors like burgeoning population,
   economic growth, modernization and infrastructure development. It is
   estimated that between 2000 and 2017 the power consumption has increased
   from 120 to 315 TWh. The building sector has an important role in this
   respect as it accounts for around 80 percent of the total electricity
   consumption. The situation is imposing significant energy, environmental
   and economic challenges for the country. To tackle these problems and
   curtail its dependence on oil-based energy infrastructure, KSA is aiming
   to develop 9.5 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. The campus of
   the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) has been
   considered as a case study. In the wake of recently announced
   net-metering policy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   prospects of rooftop application of PV in buildings. ArcGIS and PVsyst
   software have been used to determine the rooftop area and undertake PV
   system modeling respectively. Performance of PV system has been
   investigated for both horizontal and tilted installations. The study
   also investigates the economic feasibility of the PV application with
   the help of various economic parameters such as benefit cost ratio,
   simple payback period (SPP) and equity payback periods. An environmental
   analysis has also been carried out with the help of RETScreen software
   to determine the savings in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of PV
   system. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the buildings of
   the university campus for utilizable rooftop areas for PV application.
   Various types of structural, architectural and utilities-related
   features affecting the use of building roofs for PV have been
   investigated to determine the corrected area. To optimize the
   performance of the PV system as well as space utilization, modeling has
   been carried out for both horizontal and tilted applications of panels.
   Detailed economic and environmental assessments of the rooftop PV
   systems have also been investigated in detail. Modern software tools
   such as PVsyst, ArcGIS and RETScreen have also been used for system
   design calculations. Findings Saudi Arabia is embarking on a massive
   solar energy program as it plans to have over 200 GW of installed
   capacity by 2030. With solar energy being the most abundant of the
   available renewable resource for the country, PV is going to be one of
   the main technologies in achieving the set targets. The country has,
   however, unlike global trends, traditionally overlooked the small-scale
   and building-related application of solar PV, focusing mainly on larger
   projects. This study explores the prospects of utilization of solar PV
   on building roofs. Building rooftops are constrained in terms of PV
   application owing to wide ranging obstacles that can be classified into
   five types - structural, services, accessibility, maintenance and
   others. The total building rooftop area in the study zone, calculated
   through ArcGIS has been found to be 857,408 m(2) of which 352,244 m(2)
   is being used as car parking and hence is not available for PV
   application. The available roof area, 505,165 m(2) is further hampered
   by construction and utilities related features including staircases,
   HVAC systems, skylights, water tanks and satellite dish antennas.
   Taking into account the relevant obstructive features, the net rooftop
   area covered by PV panels has been found to be in the range 25-41
   percent depending upon the building typology, with residential buildings
   offering the least. To optimize both the system efficiency and space
   utilization, PV modeling has been carried out with the help of PVsyst
   software for both the tilted and horizontal installations. In terms of
   output, PV panels with tilt angle of 24 degrees have been found to be 9
   percent more efficient compared to the horizontally installed ones.
   Modeling results provide a net annual output 37,750 and 46,050 MWh from
   21.44 and 28.51 MW of tilted and horizontal application of PV panels,
   sufficient to respectively meet 16 and 20 percent of the total campus
   electricity requirements. Findings of the economic analysis reveal the
   average SPP for horizontal and tilted applications of the PV to be 9.2
   and 8.4 years, respectively. The benefit cost ratio for different types
   of buildings for horizontal and tilted application has been found to be
   ranging between 0.89 and 2.08 and 0.83 and 2.15, respectively. As
   electricity tariff in Saudi Arabia has been increased this year by as
   much as 45 percent and there are plans to remove \$54bn of subsidy by
   2020, the cost effectiveness of PV systems will be greatly helped.
   Application of PV in buildings can significantly improve their
   environmental performance as the findings of this study reveal that the
   annual greenhouse gas emission in the KFUPM campus can be reduced by as
   much as 40,199 tons carbon dioxide equivalent. Originality/value The PV
   application on building roof especially from economic perspective is an
   area which has not been addressed thus far. Khan et al. (2017) studied
   the power generation potential for PV application on residential
   buildings in KSA. Asif (2016) also investigated power output potential
   of PV system in different types of buildings. Dehwas et al. (2018)
   adopted a detailed approach to determine utilizability of PV on
   residential building roofs. None of these studies have covered the
   economics of PV systems. This study attempts to address the gap and
   contribute to the scholarship on the subject. It targets to determine
   the power output from different types of building in an urban
   environment by taking into account building roof conditions. It also
   provides detailed economic assessment of PV systems. Subsequent
   environmental savings are also calculated.},

Abstract = {Seabuckthorn (Hippophae sp.), belonging to Elaeagnaceae, is a thorny,
   dioecious bush growing wild in the cold and dry regions of Indian
   Himalayas mainly in Ladakh (J\&K), Lahaul- Spiti and Kinnaur (HP),
   Kumaon-Garhwal (Uttranchal) and Sikkim/Arunachal Pradesh in the
   North-East region. The ripe fruits of seabuckthorn are a rich source of
   vitamins (A, B, C, and K\&E) with antioxidant and anti stress
   properties. The plant has medicinal and fodder value besides food and
   cosmetics properties. However, no attention has been given towards the
   scientific conservation, propagation and utilization of this valuable
   plant. Keeping the above in view, Field Research Laboratory (DRDO),
   located at an altitude of 11500 ft above the MSL, undertook several
   research and development projects on seabuckthorn from 1992 to promote
   cultivation and utilization of seabuckthorn for human welfare.
   Satellite imaginary conducted to estimate the naturally growing areas of
   seabuckthorn had revealed 11,500 ha pure area of seabuckthorn in the
   Ladakh region. However, the total area of seabuckthorn vegetation is
   around 30,000 ha in Ladakh. Extensive explorations have been conducted
   to identify the promising genetic diversity in the crop in the region
   which has considerable variation in the physicochemical properties of
   the fruits. Three promising selections have been made from the natural
   population and Field genmaile banks have been established to conserve
   this natural diversity. In order to popularize scientific cultivation of
   this valuable plant, propagation through seeds, stem cuttings (using
   PBRs) and suckers, has been standardized. Efforts are also in progress
   to develop the protocols for in vitro propagation of seabuckthorn. Model
   seabuckthorn orchards have been established using different planting
   systems/distances and by maintaining proper male: female plant ratio.
   The laboratory has developed and patented the process for preparation of
   nutritive beverage from seabuckthorn fruits which has been
   commercialized by private vendors and products are readily available in
   Indian market. The process for preparation of other food products such
   as jam, pickle, puree, blended/spiced beverages, wine etc have also been
   developed and are in the process of being patented and commercialized.
   The need of the hour is to standardize canopy/orchard management
   practices, post harvest management/value addition techniques, scientific
   method of harvesting and adopting modern breeding approaches for crop
   improvement of seabuckthorn to harness its food and medicinal properties
   for human welfare.},

Title = {Quantifying the impact of terrain-wind-governed close-effect on
   atmospheric polluted concentrations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {367},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Rapid global urbanization and industrial expansion have resulted in
   severe atmospheric pollution sceneries in the past decades. Apart from
   the direct influence of anthropogenic emissions, the coupling of terrain
   and meteorological parameters may be another critical natural factor
   that indirectly impacts the dynamic polluted levels by means of terrain,
   wind, and planetary boundary layer governed accumulation and dilution in
   the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The nature-governed influence
   from the coupling of terrain and wind on air polluted levels can be
   called Terrain-Wind Close Effect (TWCE). As a value to represent the
   height of a geographic location above or below a fixed reference point,
   elevation cannot directly reflect the influence of terrain closed effect
   on air pollution levels at the regional/national scale. Therefore, this
   study aims to propose a Terrain-Wind Close Index (TWCI), which is a
   quantified comprehensive parameter of Earth terrain and atmospheric
   conditions controlling synergistically the localized or inhomogeneous
   concentration of fine particulate matters, to represent the
   nature-governed ability of terrain coupled with wind and boundary layer
   to block the dilution of contaminants. Results show a positive
   correlation (about 0.65) between TWCI and air polluted levels monitored
   by ground sites from January 1 to December 31, 2020 in China, which
   quantitatively exhibits that most of the high polluted levels existed in
   high-TWCI regions. The performance of the comprehensive TWCI in terms of
   its descriptive power on spatial pattern of surface polluted levels is
   superior to the single elevation (about 0.30) that widely used in
   previous studies. Moreover, the TWCI makes the static terrain dynamical
   by considering the synergistic effects of terrain and variational
   meteorological parameters on surface polluted levels. The newly proposed
   TWCI model has a potential to be applied to the research involve
   regional pollution estimation, environmental capacity assessment, urban
   planning and development, and so on.},

Abstract = {The pathfinding analysis has importance for various working such as
   logistics, transportation, operation management, system analysis and
   design, project management, network and production line. Especially,
   game programming technology has effect to economic and dominates
   culture, increasingly. The shortest path analysis is artificial
   intelligent which developed capability about think cause and effect,
   learning and thinking like human. Heuristic technique is method for
   solving a problem which gets result or not. It may return unexpected
   value which depends on each problem. 3D game real-time strategy uses
   shortest path analysis control path for movement of character, wheeled
   vehicle, animals, and fantasy buildings. It uses path for movement ever
   time, both in sea, terra and sky (three layers). The position of 3D

Title = {Study on the mechanism of urban morphology on river cooling effect in
   severe cold regions},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {In the context of global warming, urban climate problems such as heat
   waves, urban heat islands and air pollution are becoming increasingly
   prominent, and the cooling effect of rivers is an effective way to
   mitigate urban hot climate. This study investigates the surrounding
   urban area of the Hun River in Shenyang, a severe cold region of China,
   by calculating satellite inversion surface temperature and urban
   morphology data, and explores the cooling effect of rivers using linear
   regression models and spatial regression models. The results show that
   (1) water bodies have a cooling effect on the surrounding environment,
   with the farthest cooling distance being 4,000 m, but the optimal
   cooling distance being 2,500 m. (2) In the results of the spatial
   regression model analysis, the R-2 value stays above 0.7 in the range of
   0-4,000 m, indicating that urban morphological factors are closely
   related to LST (land surface temperature). The negative correlation is
   most pronounced for NVDI (normalized vegetation index), with a peak of
   -14.8075 calculated by the regression model, and the positive
   correlation is most pronounced for BD (building density), with a peak of
   8.5526. (3) The urban thermal environment can be improved and the heat
   island effect mitigated through measures such as increasing urban
   vegetation cover and reducing building density, and these findings can
   provide data references and case studies to support urban planning and
   development departments.},

Abstract = {Electricity power supply in remote communities and towns are
   traditionally and hitherto supplied by diesel generator sets of varying
   capacities and sizes from few kilowatt to few megawatts. Its proven to
   be versatile, robust, modular, cheaper capital investment, reliable and
   easy to operate and maintain. These features are what make diesel
   generators most preferref choice for generating electric power to power
   hungry remote communities.
   The maindrawback, though, is its increasingly high cost of operation and
   maintenance, largely due to upward trend in the cost of diesel fuel,
   high cost of engines spare parts plus the inflationary nature of salary
   and wages of operators. For these reasons, engineers and technologists
   have for years worked tirelessly to find ways and means to reduce the O
   \& M costs. One of the novel ideas was to hybrid the conventional diesel
   generating system with renewable energy resources, such as mini hydro,
   solar photovoltaic or wind energy. Many prototypes involving severeral
   configurations of energy resources eg diesel/PV/battery,
   diesel/wind/battery, diesel/ minihydro/battey have been tested but none
   has so far has been as successful as SMA/Powercorp's automated
   Intelligent Power System (IPS).
   Based on microprocessor hardware, powerful computer software programming
   and satellite communication technology, the IPS-equipped diesel power
   station can now now be operated fully automatic with capability of
   remote control and monitoring. The system is versatile in maximising the
   use of renewable energy energy resources such as wind, mini hydro or
   solar thereby reducing very significantly the use of diesel fuel.
   Operation and maintenance costs also are reduced due to the use of
   minimum manpower and and increase in fuel efficiency of the engines.
   The tested and proven IPS technology has been operating successfully for
   the last ten years in remote diesel stations in Northern Territory,
   Australia, Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland and its latest and biggest
   system is the 5 MW diesel /minihydro stations in Sabah, Malaysia. This
   technology had brought about radical transformation in the ways remote
   diesel satations are operated and maintained not only in alleviating
   environmental damages related to diesel generation but also in improving
   the occupational health and safety of diesel enegines operators.
   This paper discusses the installation of IPS technology in a local
   electricity grid powered by multidiesel sets and minihydro machines, in
   Ranau/Kundasang, Sabah. The drastic system improvement and significant
   cost savings the system have entailed, have convinced the electric
   utility of its effectiveness and reliability.
   Finally, we believe strongly that Ips technology will pave way for
   modernisation of diesel-based remote power generating station in
   Malaysia, and elsewhere in other developing countries.},

Title = {Ageing mallee eucalypt vegetation after fire: insights for successional
   trajectories in semi-arid mallee ecosystems},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Pages = {363-372},
Abstract = {A critical requirement in the ecological management of fire is knowledge
   of the age-class distribution of the vegetation. Such knowledge is
   important because it underpins the distribution of ecological features
   important to plants and animals including retreat sites, food sources
   and foraging microhabitats. However, in many regions, knowledge of the
   age-class distribution of vegetation is severely constrained by the
   limited data available on fire history. Much fire-history mapping is
   restricted to post-1972 fires, following satellite imagery becoming
   widely available. To investigate fire history in the semi-arid Murray
   Mallee region in southern Australia, we developed regression models for
   six species of mallee eucalypt (Eucalyptus oleosa F. Muell. ex. Miq.
   subsp. oleosa, E. leptophylla F. Muell. ex. Miq., E. dumosa J. Oxley, E.
   costata subsp. murrayana L. A. S. Johnson \& K. D. Hill, E. gracilis F.
   Muell. and E. socialis F. Muell. ex. Miq.) to quantify the relationship
   between mean stem diameter and stem age (indicated by fire-year) at
   sites of known time since fire. We then used these models to predict
   mean stem age, and thus infer fire-year, for sites where the time since
   fire was not known. Validation of the models with independent data
   revealed a highly significant correlation between the actual and
   predicted time since fire (r = 0.71, P < 0.001, n = 88), confirming the
   utility of this method for ageing stands of mallee eucalypt vegetation.
   Validation data suggest the models provide a conservative estimate of
   the age of a site (i.e. they may under-estimate the minimum age of sites
   >35 years since fire). Nevertheless, this approach enables examination
   of post-fire chronosequences in semi-arid mallee ecosystems to be
   extended from 35 years post-fire to over 100 years. The predicted ages
   identified for mallee stands imply a need for redefining what is meant
   by `old-growth' mallee, and challenges current perceptions of an
   over-abundance of `long-unburnt' mallee vegetation. Given the strong
   influence of fire on semi-arid mallee vegetation, this approach offers
   the potential for a better understanding of long-term successional
   dynamics and the status of biota in an ecosystem that encompasses more
   than 250 000 km(2) of southern Australia.},

Abstract = {Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have
   teamed together to demonstrate the multimission capabilities of
   commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record
   testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across
   air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio
   of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are
   uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the
   ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated
   deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios.
   Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and
   civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely
   controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial
   robots providing services and access that was never before considered
   valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and
   taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling
   subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and
   disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same
   potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance,
   rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these
   systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy.
   We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the
   Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle
   systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center
   (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with
   autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature.
   Additional customized, missioncentric sensors may be added to the
   systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase
   autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication
   architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress
   monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the
   remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level
   of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications
   (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite
   communications for navigation and mission data transfer.
   Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to
   accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of
   other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science
   missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the
   sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while
   characterizing the operating conditions for each test series.
   ``Autonomy{''} is a capability that means different things to different
   people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system
   to react to new information, whether from external source or
   self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of
   an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts
   such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications
   with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through
   these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator
   workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the
   system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance.
   Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these
   objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and
   data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous
   underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation
   Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable
   process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime
   unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing
   the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test
   units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at
   least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate
   capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives.
   We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and
   the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for
   unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving
   that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as
   evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes the land-use impacts and land requirements of
   utility-scale photovoltaic (U-PV) systems in the Canadian province of
   Ontario. The empirical research is based on an analysis of approximately
   95 projects representing over 1000MW of U-PV systems province-wide.
   Findings from this empirical assessment are combined with information
   about future technological advances in order to develop a modelling
   framework that can forecast land requirements of U-PV systems within
   evolving market and technology contexts. Specifically, the model is used
   to estimate the land requirements of U-PV systems in a hypothetical
   future in which U-PV systems supply all mid-day electricity needs in
   Ontario, including added demands from a completely electrified
   light-duty vehicle fleet. Under this scenario, on an installed capacity
   basis and assuming that 20\% of mid-day electricity demand is met with
   rooftop PV, an area equivalent to 0.5\% to 8.5\% of Ontario's
   agricultural land would be required, depending on panel efficiencies and
   system packing factors. These land requirements are manageable,
   particularly as more land-efficient technologies are deployed and as
   regulations are designed to mitigate the land-use impacts of U-PV
   systems.
   Mesure et modelisation de la densite d'occupation des sols et des
   besoins fonciers des systemes photovoltaiques commerciaux dans la
   province canadienne de l'Ontario Cet article resume les impacts de
   l'occupation des sols et des besoins fonciers des systemes
   photovoltaiques a des fins commerciales (U-PV) dans la province
   canadienne de l'Ontario. La recherche empirique est fondee sur une
   analyse d'environ 95 projets representant plus de 1000 MW de systemes
   U-PV a l'echelle de la province. Les conclusions de cette evaluation
   empirique sont combinees a l'information concernant les avancees
   technologiques futures afin de developper un cadre de modelisation
   capable de prevoir les besoins fonciers des systemes U-PV dans un
   contexte de marches et de technologies en evolution. Plus
   particulierement, le modele est utilise pour evaluer les besoins
   fonciers des systemes U-PV dans un avenir hypothetique oU ces derniers
   repondent a tous les besoins en electricite de mi-journee en Ontario, y
   compris les demandes additionnelles d'une flotte de vehicules legers
   fonctionnant entierement a l'electricite. En vertu de ce scenario, sur
   la base d'une capacite installee et en supposant que 20 \% de la demande
   d'electricite en mi-journee est comblee grace aux systemes
   photovoltaiques installes sur les toits, un territoire equivalant a de
   0,5 a 8,5 \% des terres agricoles de l'Ontario serait requis, en
   fonction des gains d'efficacite des panneaux et des facteurs
   d'accumulation des systemes. Ces besoins fonciers sont gerables,
   particulierement alors qu'un plus grand nombre de technologies compactes
   sont deployees et que des reglements sont concus pour attenuer les
   impacts de l'occupation des sols par les systemes U-PV.},

Title = {The Changes in Dominant Driving Factors in the Evolution Process of
   Wetland in the Yellow River Delta during 2015-2022},

Abstract = {Most of the previous studies exploring the changing patterns of wetland
   in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) were conducted based on sparse
   time-series images, which ignored its severe environmental gradient and
   rapid evolution process of the wetland. The changes in the dominant
   factors in the evolution of the wetland in the YRD are not clear. This
   study used the dense time-series Sentinel-2 images to establish a
   wetland database of the YRD, and then analyzed the spatial distribution
   characteristics of, and temporal changes in, the wetland during
   2015-2022. Finally, the dominant factors of the spatio-temporal
   evolutions of the wetland were explored and revealed. The results showed
   the following. (1) During 2015-2022, the wetland in the YRD was
   dominated by artificial wetland, accounting for 54.02\% of the total
   wetland area in the study area. In 2015-2022, the total wetland area
   increased by 309.90 km(2), including an increase of 222.63 km(2) in
   natural wetlands and 87.27 km(2) in artificial wetlands. In the
   conversion between wetland types, 218.73 km(2) of artificial wetlands
   were converted into natural wetlands, and 75.18 km(2) of natural
   wetlands were converted into artificial wetlands. The patch density of
   rivers, swamps, and salt pans increased, showing a trend of
   fragmentation. However, the overall degree of landscape fragmentation in
   wetlands weakened. The trend of changes in the number of patches and
   landscape shape index was the same, while the trend of changes in
   Shannon's diversity index and Contagion index was completely opposite.
   (2) Natural factors, such as precipitation (0.51, 2015; 0.65, 2016), DEM
   (0.57, 2017; 0.47, 2018; 0.49, 2020; 0.46, 2021), vegetation coverage
   (0.59, 2019), and temperature (0.48, 2022), were the dominant
   influencing factors of wetland changes in the YRD. The dominant single
   factor causing the changes in artificial wetlands was vegetation
   coverage, while socio-economic factors had lower explanatory power, with
   the average q value of 0.18. (3) During 2015-2022, the interactions
   between the natural and artificial factors of the wetland changes were
   mostly nonlinear and showed double-factor enhancement. The interactions
   between temperature and sunshine hours had the largest explanatory power
   for natural wetland change, while interactions between precipitation and
   vegetation coverage, and between temperature and vegetation coverage,
   had large contribution rates for artificial wetland change. The
   interactions among natural factors had the greatest impacts on wetland
   change, followed by interactions between natural factors and
   socio-economic factors, while interactions among socio-economic factors
   had more slight impacts on wetland change. The results can provide a
   scientific basis for regional wetland protection and management.},

Title = {Regeneration and succession: A 50-year gap dynamic in temperate
   secondary forests, Northeast China},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {484},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Forest gaps are essential small-scale disturbances in forest succession.
   However, little attention has been paid to the long-term effects of gap
   dynamics on woody species regeneration and succession. We selected 20
   medium and 25 large gaps representing a range of age classes (0-10,
   10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 years) from remote-sensing images
   obtained in 1964, 1976, 1986, 1993, 2003, and 2014 to examine long-term
   gap regeneration processes in a secondary forest in Northeast China. We
   conducted field surveys to determine the regeneration status, density
   index (DI), and richness index (RI) of selected gaps. The importance
   value (IV) of each woody species was calculated, and all species were
   classified by shade tolerance. The results showed that in gaps of 0-10
   years, the DI and RI were mainly dominated by shade-intolerant species
   in large gaps and intermediate species in medium gaps. When gap age
   increased to 10-20 years, the greatest RI was observed in large gaps due
   to an increase in intermediate species, and the dominant species (IV >
   0.1) changed from shrubs to trees (Acer mono). The DI and RI decreased
   over time in medium gaps, but A. mono remained the dominant species in
   these gaps. By 20-30 years after gap formation, large gaps showed
   decreased DI and RI, associated with the exclusion of shade-intolerant
   and intermediate species, and Tilia amurensis joined the dominant
   species class. In medium gaps, a decrease in DI was associated with
   self-thinning among intermediate shade-tolerant species. Once gap age
   exceeded 30 years, the DI, RI, and dominant species became stable in
   both large and medium gaps. Our findings indicated that natural gaps can
   improve the regeneration of late-successional species in secondary
   forests, especially at the first 30 years. However, there was a barrier
   in succession of the secondary forests to climax forests relying on
   natural gap regeneration due to the absence of key species such as
   Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.). These results can provide
   a significant reference for close-to-nature management of temperate
   secondary forests in practice.},

Title = {Study on habitat suitability change and habitat network of rare
   wintering cranes in important international wetlands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Chongming Dongtan wetland is a typical estuarine wetland, located in
   Chongming District, Shanghai, China, with high ecological significance.
   The protection of wintering crane's habitat has attracted the wide
   attention of the international community. Because of the importance of
   the region in the protection of international biodiversity and the
   protection of crane habitats, it is of great reference value to study
   the habitat suitability changes of rare wintering cranes with spatial
   and temporal distribution characteristics and the distribution of
   habitat corridors with spatial characteristics, to improve the habitat
   quality of crane habitats in globally important wetlands. Based on the
   remote sensing image data of Chongming Dongtan and the field survey data
   of rare wintering cranes, this study obtained the land use change of
   Chongming Dongtan from 1986 to 2021 by ENVI and ArcGIS10.8 software,
   evaluated the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in 36 years by GIS
   technology, and constructed the habitat corridor of wintering cranes by
   using the minimum cumulative resistance model(MCR). The results showed
   that from 1986 to 2021, the number of four typical wintering cranes in
   Chongming Dongtan showed a general downward trend. In the past 36 years,
   the habitat suitability of wintering cranes in the internationally
   important wetland of Chongming Dongtan has gradually changed from a
   suitable area to an unsuitable area. The suitable areas are mainly
   distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the study area, and the
   unsuitable areas are mainly distributed in the western construction land
   area. The habitat quality of cranes is deteriorating. The overall
   resistance distribution of Chongming Dongtan in 2021 shows a trend of
   low resistance value in the east and high resistance value in the west,
   and the degree of obstruction is strong in the south and weak in the
   north. There are 208 potential habitat corridors for wintering cranes in
   Chongming Dongtan, with a total length of 377.12 km. Get 127 Habitat
   nodes. The density of habitat corridors in the eastern part of the study
   area is significantly higher than that in the western region, and the
   ecological space in the eastern region is well connected. Finally, this
   study proposes the identification of important habitat corridors based
   on gravity model and the analysis of habitat network structure based on
   graph theory, which provides a reference for improving the stability of
   habitat network by means of habitat node optimization, stepping stone
   increase and ecological restoration. This study is different from
   previous studies on large-scale ecological conditions such as cities or
   urban coastal zones. From the perspective of the construction of
   regional wetland rare species habitat network and the protection of
   international important wetland biodiversity with important ecological
   value, it is helpful to optimize the suitable habitat pattern of rare
   overwintering cranes and provide a method basis for the protection of
   rare species habitat and the construction of habitat network in regional
   wetlands. At the same time, Chongming Dongtan is the only
   internationally important wetland in Shanghai. Wintering cranes are the
   most important biological resources of wetlands. The study of habitat
   suitability changes and habitat networks can effectively promote the
   development of internationally important wetland cities in Shanghai.},

Title = {Treatment Persistence in Patients Cycling on Subcutaneous Tumor Necrosis
   Factor-Alpha Inhibitors in Inflammatory Arthritis: A Retrospective Study},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN THERAPY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {244-255},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Biologic treatments including subcutaneous tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha inhibitors (SC-TNFis) have greatly improved disease
   management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and
   spondyloarthritis (SpA) (collectively inflammatory arthritis, IA).
   Nevertheless, some patients discontinue their first-line treatment; for
   them, one option may be a subsequent line of the same treatment class
   (i.e., cycling). The aim of this study was to assess treatment
   persistence between first- and second-line therapy in Swedish IA
   patients cycling on SC-TNFis.
   Methods: Using data from the Swedish Health Data Registers, adult IA
   patients filling prescriptions between May 1, 2010, and October 31,
   2016, for a SC-TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and golimumab)
   were included. Treatment persistence was derived based on information
   from filled prescriptions and a 60-day grace period. Unadjusted and
   adjusted marginal Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to
   estimate the relative risk of discontinuation across treatment lines,
   using robust sandwich covariance matrix estimates to account for
   intrapatient dependence (i.e., multiple treatment lines per patient).
   The analysis was restricted to the first two lines of treatment.
   Results: Of the eligible patients, 3181 were identified as cyclers.
   Among these, most were female (68\%), and 48\%, 28\% and 24\% were
   diagnosed with RA, AS and PsA, respectively. Both the unadjusted and
   adjusted analyses showed that the relative risk of discontinuing SC-TNFi
   treatment was significantly lower in second compared to first line
   (hazard ratio: 0.56 {[}0.53, 0.59] and 0.59 {[}0.56, 0.62],
   respectively). This finding was also consistent across IA indications.
   Conclusions: In this study of patients cycling on SC-TNFis in IA,
   persistence was greater in second-compared to first-line treatment. The
   finding was consistent across all IA indications. Hence, patients who
   discontinue their first-line treatment may still benefit from treatment
   with an alternative SC-TNFi as a second-line therapy in IA.},

Title = {Origin and foraging ecology of male loggerhead sea turtles from southern
   Brazil revealed by genetic and stable isotope analysis},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWA) represents an important foraging
   ground for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Most studies at the
   region have focused on adult females and juveniles, and little is known
   about males. Here, we present the first insights about origin and
   foraging ecology of male loggerheads from the SWA, by integrating
   genetic and stable isotope analysis (SIA). Skin samples were obtained
   from 26 males stranded along the southern coast of Brazil (from 31
   degrees 21S-51 degrees 05W to 33 degrees 44S-53 degrees 22W), from
   February 2014 to March 2017. Samples of potential food sources (benthic
   and pelagic organisms) were also collected for SIA. A fragment of the
   mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced and a Bayesian Mixed
   Stock Analysis was performed to estimate natal origins of male
   loggerheads. Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Models were fitted to assess
   the relative contribution of different food sources assimilated by
   males. Most males exhibit endemic haplotypes from Brazilian rookeries,
   followed by a low frequency of a haplotype from the North Atlantic and
   the Mediterranean Sea, as well as olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivaea)
   haplotype, showing hybridization. SIA showed life stage-related
   differences in feeding and habitat use by male loggerheads, with benthic
   invertebrates dominating the diet of adults, while pelagic prey items
   dominated the diet of juveniles. Our findings demonstrate the importance
   of southern Brazil neritic and oceanic habitats for male loggerheads and
   highlight the value of this area for the maintenance of SWA reproductive
   management units, which are the main contributors to these feeding
   aggregations.},

Title = {Assessing the Potential of Rural Settlement Land Consolidation in China:
   A Method Based on Comprehensive Evaluation of Restricted Factors},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rural settlement land consolidation potential calculation is the basic
   work of land consolidation. An accurate potential is essential to rural
   development planners and policy makers as a project target or
   prediction. The traditional calculation methods include the per
   capita/household construction land method, idle rural residential land
   method, and comprehensive evaluation method. Though there have been some
   improvements, the potential for calculation methods on a national level
   is still limited. This article illustrates a new method for calculating
   the consolidation potential of rural settlement land, based on field
   data and the restructuring restrictions applicable to each rural land
   parcel in China. The field data was from Shandong Province because it
   lies within the country's biggest grain-producing area with the largest
   distribution density of rural settlements. It is an excellent
   representative sample for rural settlement land consolidation, offering
   a microcosm of rural development in China. For the study's comprehensive
   evaluation system, due to the lack of nationwide field survey data, the
   potential of Shandong Province was chosen as the standard value. We
   selected indicators concerning land resources, depopulation,
   transportation accessibility, local economic development, urbanization,
   and natural conditions to build an evaluation system. We then calculated
   the potential of each province according to their coefficients and field
   data from Shandong Province. Every province except Taiwan (for which no
   data were available) was divided into five zones for rural settlement
   land consolidation: the most-suitable zone, suitable zone, general zone,
   restricted zone, and most-restricted zone. The total rate of land
   consolidation is estimated at 0.24 for 2010 and forecast at 0.33 for
   2020, while those years' respective consolidation potentials are
   32,777.92 km(2) and 44,707.81 km(2). The rate is the total rural
   settlement land before land consolidation divided by added cultivated
   land after consolidation. The higher the rate, more effective the land
   consolidation is.},

Title = {The annual cycle for whimbrel populations using the Western Atlantic
   Flyway},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Many long-distance migratory birds use habitats that are scattered
   across continents and confront hazards throughout the annual cycle that
   may be population-limiting. Identifying where and when populations spend
   their time is fundamental to effective management. We tracked 34 adult
   whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) from two breeding populations (Mackenzie
   Delta and Hudson Bay) with satellite transmitters to document the
   structure of their annual cycles. The two populations differed in their
   use of migratory pathways and their seasonal schedules. Mackenzie Delta
   whimbrels made long (22,800 km) loop migrations with different autumn
   and spring routes. Hudson Bay whimbrels made shorter (17,500 km) and
   more direct migrations along the same route during autumn and spring.
   The two populations overlap on the winter grounds and within one spring
   staging area. Mackenzie Delta whimbrels left the breeding ground,
   arrived on winter grounds, left winter grounds and arrived on spring
   staging areas earlier compared to whimbrels from Hudson Bay. For both
   populations, migration speed was significantly higher during spring
   compared to autumn migration. Faster migration was achieved by having
   fewer and shorter stopovers en route. We identified five migratory
   staging areas including four that were used during autumn and two that
   were used during spring. Whimbrels tracked for multiple years had high
   (98\%) fidelity to staging areas. We documented dozens of locations
   where birds stopped for short periods along nearly all migration routes.
   The consistent use of very few staging areas suggests that these areas
   are integral to the annual cycle of both populations and have high
   conservation value.},

Title = {Comparison of Random Forest Model and Frequency Ratio Model for
   Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) in Yunyang County (Chongqing,
   China)},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR)
   model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected
   Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters;
   especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical
   records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a
   geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides
   in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into
   two datasets: 70\% of them were used as the training dataset and 30\% as
   the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors
   (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors;
   human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary
   conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library
   for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model
   training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the
   established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation
   in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis
   results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very
   low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of
   conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was
   explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and
   recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above
   two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances
   between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than
   the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF
   model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high
   and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the
   geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other
   hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable
   for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of
   its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The
   outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine
   learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and
   urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing
   demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility
   assessments.},

Title = {Modeling the global distribution of Culicoides imicola: an Ensemble
   approach},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola is a midge species serving as vector for a number of
   viral diseases of livestock, including Bluetongue, and African Horse
   Sickness. C. imicola is also known to transmit Schmallenberg virus
   experimentally. E nvironmental and demographic factors may impose rapid
   changes on the global distribution of C. imicola and aid introduction
   into new areas. The aim of this study is to predict the global
   distribution of C. imicola using an ensemble modeling approach by
   combining climatic, livestock distribution and land cover covariates,
   together with a comprehensive global dataset of geo-positioned
   occurrence points for C. imicola. Thirty individual models were
   generated by `biomod2', with 21 models scoring a true skill statistic
   (TSS) > 0.8. These 21 models incorporated weighted runs from eight of
   ten algorithms and were used to create a final ensemble model. The
   ensemble model performed very well (TSS = 0.898 and ROC = 0.991) and
   indicated high environmental suitability for C. imicola in the tropics
   and subtropics. The habitat suitability for C. imicola spans from South
   Africa to southern Europe and from southern USA to southern China. The
   distribution of C. imicola is mainly constrained by climatic factors. In
   the ensemble model, mean annual minimum temperature had the highest
   overall contribution (42.9\%), followed by mean annual maximum
   temperature (21.1\%), solar radiation (13.6\%), annual precipitation
   (11\%), livestock distribution (6.2\%), vapor pressure (3.4\%), wind
   speed (0.8\%), and land cover (0.1\%). The present study provides the
   most up-to-date predictive maps of the potential distributions of C.
   imicola and should be of great value for decision making at global and
   regional scales.},

Title = {Biologically Important Areas II for cetaceans within US and adjacent
   waters - Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea Region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {We delineated and scored Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for
   cetaceans in the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea region. BIAs represent
   areas and times in which cetaceans are known to concentrate for
   activities related to reproduction, feeding, and migration, and also the
   known ranges of small and resident populations. This effort, the second
   led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), uses
   structured elicitation principles to build upon the first version of
   NOAA's BIAs (BIA I) for cetaceans. Supporting evidence for BIA II came
   from aerial-, land-, and vessel-based surveys; satellite-tagging data;
   passive acoustic monitoring; Indigenous knowledge; photo-identification
   data; whaling data, including stomach and fecal contents; prey studies;
   and genetics. In addition to narratives, maps, and metadata tables, the
   BIA II products incorporate a scoring and labeling system, which will
   improve their utility and interpretability. BIAs are compilations of the
   best available science and have no inherent regulatory authority. They
   have been used by NOAA, other federal agencies, and the public to
   support planning and marine mammal impact assessments, and to inform the
   development of conservation measures for cetaceans. In the Aleutian
   Islands and Bering Sea region, a total of 19 BIAs were identified,
   delineated, and scored for seven species, including bowhead, North
   Pacific right, gray, humpback, fin, and sperm whales, and belugas. These
   include one hierarchical BIA for belugas that consists of one localized
   ``child{''} BIA within an overarching ``parent{''} BIA. There were 15
   feeding, 3 migratory, and 1 small and resident population BIAs; no
   reproductive BIAs were identified. In some instances, information
   existed about a species' use of a particular area and time, but the
   information was insufficient to confidently delineate the candidate BIA;
   in those cases, the candidate BIA was added to a watch list. A total of
   22 watch list areas were identified and delineated for 10 species,
   including all species mentioned above and minke whales, harbor
   porpoises, and Dall's porpoises. There were 15 feeding, 4 migratory, 2
   reproductive, and 1 small and resident population watch list areas. Some
   BIAs and watch list areas were transboundary between the Aleutian
   Islands and Bering Sea region and the Arctic region.},

Title = {Nordic treatment practices survey and consensus for treatment of eyelid
   sebaceous carcinoma},
Journal = {BMC OPHTHALMOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Background The purpose was to describe the Nordic treatment practices
   and to reach a Nordic consensus for the treatment of sebaceous eyelid
   carcinoma. Methods The treatment practices data was collected by a
   questionnaire with 37 questions to the Nordic oculoplastic surgeons and
   analyzed. A PubMed MEDLINE database search was done to gather data on
   the published treatment practices and recommendations. A working group
   that consisted of in minimum one senior consultant from each leading
   Nordic University Eye Hospital was assigned. A structured interactive
   method was used to establish the consensus. Results Twenty-four doctors
   responded to the questionnaire. 23/24 (96\%) of the respondents took a
   biopsy before surgery. Regional lymph node scanning was routinely done
   by 14/23 (61\%) and a systemic screening of a metastatic disease by
   13/23 (57\%). 6/22 (27\%) never took conjunctival mapping biopsies and
   12/23 (52\%) never screened for Muir- Torre. Respondents used Mohs
   surgery, frozen section or multi-stage excision with delayed closure,
   and 5-6 mm was the mostly preferred margin. Sentinel lymph node biopsy
   was a possible option for 9/22 (41\%) and cryotherapy and Mitomycin C
   for 6/22 (27\%) respondents. 50\% of respondents considered radiation as
   a treatment option. 15/16 (94\%) respondents always followed-up their
   patients, most for 5 years. Two thirds scanned regional lymph nodes
   during the follow-up. Consensus was reached for 18 statements
   representing three domains: preoperative work-up, treatment and
   follow-up. Conclusion Treatment practices differ in between the five
   Nordic countries which have similar public health care systems. In the
   article the authors present a Nordic consensus for the treatment of
   eyelid sebaceous carcinoma.},

Title = {Monitoring and forecasting heat island intensity through multi-temporal
   image analysis and cellular automata-Markov chain modelling: A case of
   Babol city, Iran},

Abstract = {An urban heat island is one of the most vital environmental risks in
   urban areas. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial-temporal
   patterns of land use changes and heat island intensity for the city of
   Babol, Iran, between 1985 and 2015 and to predict likely future heat
   island intensity variations. Multi-temporal Landsat images were acquired
   and analysed in this study. First, single channel algorithms were used
   to calculate the land surface temperature (LST), and a Maximum
   Likelihood Algorithm was utilized to classify images. Second, land use
   changes (LUCs) and LST were examined, and the relationship between the
   fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and land-use changes was analysed
   using the normalized land surface temperature. By using the mean and the
   standard deviation of the normalized thermal images, the area was
   divided into five thermal categories: very low, low, medium, high and
   very high. Then, by applying the heat island intensity index, the heat
   island changes in the studied period were investigated. Possible future
   land use changes were investigated using a cellular automata-Markov
   model, and the heat island intensity changes were anticipated. The
   results indicate that the area of built-up land increased by 92\%
   between 1985 and 2015, and that the area of agricultural land noticeably
   decreased. The built-up land changes trend has an inverse relationship
   with the trend of FVC changes and follows the same trend as the
   normalized surface temperature changes. Most changes in the surface
   temperature of the area are located within 0-800 m of a built-up area.
   The main reason for these changes could be the conversion of
   agricultural and green space land areas into built-up land. The largest
   area of the temperature categories in all years is the medium
   temperature category, which covers the suburban land areas. The low- and
   very low temperature categories, which follow a decreasing trend, are
   related to land areas far from the city. In addition, the high- and very
   high-temperature categories, whose areas increased annually, are
   adjacent to the city core and the exits from the city. The average
   surface temperature in all land uses increased during the studied
   period. Nevertheless, the rate of temperature rise is higher in the
   built-up uses. The index ratio of the heat island during this period
   shows an increasing trend, and its value changed from 0/5 in 1985 to
   0/67 in 2015. An increase in the heat island intensity has a direct
   relationship with the area population growth and, thus, the increase in
   the built-up land area. Anticipation of land use changes and the process
   of heat island intensity variations for the studied area show alarming
   results that call for decision-makers to address this important
   challenge.},

Abstract = {Significant relationship between tree height and ALS-derived topography
   was shown. Taller trees were found on slopes < 10A degrees and southerly
   aspects. Potential value of ALS in forest management applications was
   defined.
   Accurate information on tree height distribution can provide a better
   understanding of forest productivity and biomass estimation. Airborne
   light detection and ranging remote sensing, also known as airborne laser
   scanning (ALS), has proven to be an effective tool for deriving tree
   height information in forests. While tree height has been reported to
   vary in response to many environmental factors, few researchers have
   demonstrated the effect of topography on tree height variation using ALS
   data. This study investigated the relationship between tree height
   variation and ALS-derived topographic aspect and slope factors within
   two even-aged radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) plantation sites in
   Nundle, New South Wales, Australia. A total of 447 trees was sampled
   from 77 plots in two plantation age classes: 193 trees from a
   34-year-old site and 254 trees from a 9-year-old site. ALS height
   estimates were highly correlated with field heights (R (2) = 0.90 and
   RMSE = 0.66 for 2002 and R (2) = 0.87 and RMSE = 1.49 for 1977 sites).
   ALS-derived slope and aspect metrics were shown to have a significant
   relationship with height variation across the stands. The slope (P <
   0.01) and aspect (P < 0.001) were significant in the mixed linear
   models. Overall taller trees were found on slopes below 10A degrees and
   on southerly aspects, while shorter trees dominated steeper slopes (>
   20A degrees) and on northerly aspects. However, aspect gradient appeared
   to have more significant effect on tree heights than slope classes.
   These results were further verified using an additional 2,000 randomly
   located trees sampled across the plantations. The study demonstrates a
   significant relationship between tree height variation and ALS-derived
   ground aspect and slope categories which may have potential benefits for
   improving current wood resource inventories and future productivity
   models.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Despite the great strides made in medical knowledge,
   surgery still remains a necessary part of the breast cancer treatment.
   Surgical procedures still lead to post surgical sequelae. The axillary
   web syndrome (AWS) is one such sequela, which can lead to disability,
   reduced arm mobility and compromised quality of life. It is often
   unidentified and the literature regarding its assessment is limited.
   To improve diagnosis and patient education, the Screening Test AWS
   (ST-AWS) questionnaire was drafted and applied at the European Institute
   of Oncology (EIO).
   Materials and method: We prospectively recruited patients from October
   2012 to December 2012. Patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy
   and/or axillary dissection procedures were registered. Physical
   examination was set as a gold standard.
   Results: 88 patients completed the questionnaire. Among these, 32
   patients had axillary web syndrome diagnosed, thus a 36\% incidence.
   The questionnaire achieved a sensitivity of 94\%, a specificity of 91\%,
   a positive prevalence value (PPV) of 86\%, a negative prevalence value
   (NPV) of 96\% and an accuracy of 92\%.
   Conclusion: Our questionnaire achieves high sensitivity and predictive
   values, and we would recommend it as a screening-tool for auto-diagnosis
   of the AWS.
   The main objective of the questionnaire is to enhance patient and
   therapist awareness of the problem, and prompt management to shorten the
   effects of this disability. Moreover, it may offer a tool to enhance
   body image acceptance after surgery.
   Further studies whereby the efficacy of the questionnaire is
   investigated in a larger, heterogeneous group and in different
   situations are warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline changes and future forecasting:
   the case of Kucuk Menderes Delta, Turkiye},

Abstract = {A delta coastal area is one of the most important regions for human use
   owing to its scenic natural beauty and economic value. However, due to
   the constant interaction between the land and water environments in this
   region, it is also one of the most rapidly changing landforms in the
   world under the impact of natural processes as well as anthropogenic
   activities. Therefore, the determination and the constant monitoring of
   these changes spatiotemporally are of great significance in terms of the
   protection, planning, proper usage, effective management, and
   sustainability of the delta coast. In this study was aimed to determine
   the short-term and long-term shoreline changes that occurred between the
   years 1957 and 2020 along the coast of the Kucuk Menderes Delta and its
   close surroundings. In addition, the underlying causes were explored,
   and the future of the shoreline position was forecasted. The shorelines
   were digitized using seven multi-temporal orthophoto maps based on the
   high water line indicator. The shoreline changes were analyzed using
   different statistical methods, namely, the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM),
   Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear
   Regression Rate (LRR), by employing the Digital Shoreline Analysis
   System (DSAS). The future position of the shoreline was estimated using
   the extended Kalman Filter in the DSAS. The analyses revealed that in a
   period of 63 years, the maximum accretion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR
   and LRR) were 248.99 m, 3.96 m/year, and 3.65 m/year, respectively, the
   maximum erosion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR and LRR) were - 142.37 m,
   - 2.27 m/year, and - 2.19 m/year, respectively, and the delta coastal
   area had increased by 37.01 ha. It is forecasted that the delta coastal
   area will expand by 10.63 ha and 16.16 ha from 2020 to 2030 and 2040. If
   the current conditions that occurred in the last 63 years continue with
   similar effects, it was forecasted that by the years 2030 and 2040,
   significant changes would occur in the shoreline such as retreat into
   the existing facilities/usage areas and decrease of Eleman Wetland area,
   which would greatly alter the ecology, hydrography, and spatial usage of
   the delta region.},

Title = {Radar imaging mechanism of marine sand waves at very low grazing angle
   illumination caused by unique hydrodynamic interactions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {111},
Number = {C10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {{[}1] The investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004 during six
   field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in
   monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for
   coastal management (OROMA) project aimed to improve the effectiveness of
   new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as shipborne imaging
   radars in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS
   Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, is based on a Kelvin Hughes RSR
   1000 X band (9.42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was
   mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the
   experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the
   North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the
   availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of
   the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular
   scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction
   theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have
   been taken at very low grazing angles <= 2.6 degrees of flood and ebb
   tide-oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal
   current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest <=
   0.6 m s(-1) have been measured at wind speeds <= 4.5 m s(-1) and water
   depths <= 25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and
   simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb
   tide-oriented sand wave is 27\%. For the flood tide-oriented sand wave,
   a difference of 21\% has been calculated. The difference between the
   minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide-oriented
   sand wave is 10\%, and for the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a value of
   43\% has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations
   correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated
   NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always
   quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the
   quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a
   first-order theory.},

Title = {Radius based domain clustering for WiFi indoor positioning},
Journal = {SENSOR REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-60},
Abstract = {Purpose - Nowadays, WiFi indoor positioning based on received signal
   strength (RSS) becomes a research hotspot due to its low cost and ease
   of deployment characteristics. To further improve the performance of
   WiFi indoor positioning based on RSS, this paper aims to propose a novel
   position estimation strategy which is called radius-based domain
   clustering (RDC). This domain clustering technology aims to avoid the
   issue of access point (AP) selection.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed positioning approach uses
   each individual AP of all available APs to estimate the position of
   target point. Then, according to circular error probable, the authors
   search the decision domain which has the 50 per cent of the intermediate
   position estimates and minimize the radius of a circle via a RDC
   algorithm. The final estimate of the position of target point is
   obtained by averaging intermediate position estimates in the decision
   domain.
   Findings - Experiments are conducted, and comparison between the
   different position estimation strategies demonstrates that the new
   method has a better location estimation accuracy and reliability.
   Research limitations/implications - Weighted k nearest neighbor approach
   and Naive Bayes Classifier method are two classic position estimation
   strategies for location determination using WiFi fingerprinting. Both of
   the two strategies are affected by AP selection strategies and
   inappropriate selection of APs may degrade positioning performance
   considerably.
   Practical implications - The RDC positioning approach can improve the
   performance of WiFi indoor positioning, and the issue of AP selection
   and related drawbacks is avoided.
   Social implications - The RSS-based effective WiFi indoor positioning
   system can makes up for the indoor positioning weaknesses of global
   navigation satellite system. Many indoor location-based services can be
   encouraged with the effective and low-cost positioning technology.
   Originality/value - A novel position estimation strategy is introduced
   to avoid the AP selection problem in RSS-based WiFi indoor positioning
   technology, and the domain clustering technology is proposed to obtain a
   better accuracy and reliability.},

Abstract = {Changes in soil temperature (ST) and soil moisture (SM) are essential
   for climate change and ecosystem assessments. Previous investigations on
   the ST and SM on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are mainly based on the situ
   observation and the satellite products. In this study, the improved
   Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), with proper parameter
   optimization and surface datasets update, is used to estimate the
   response of ST and SM in the TP to climate change in the long-term time
   series from 1961 to 2010. After validating the reasonability of the
   simulated results using the observations, the spatial distribution of
   changes in ST and SM in annual and seasonal time series since 1960s,
   1980s, 1990s, are investigated respectively and the changes of
   precipitation (Pr) and surface evaporation (Ev) are also analysed to
   understand the cause of changes objectively. As a whole, the soil was
   warming and wetting at the maximum value of 0.31 degrees C/decade and
   0.77\%/decade since the 1960s. However, the warming process in soil
   mainly occurred in the 1980s while the wetting tendency is detected
   since the 1990s extensively. Except for the influence of air warming,
   the enhanced Pr and Ev might also be indispensable factors that caused
   the intensive wetting process but damped warming process in soil. Summer
   is the favourable season for the thermal and hydraulic variation since
   the 1980s. There exists the striking warmer and drier trend in the
   eastern TP since 1980s while the colder and wetter condition in the
   western TP since the 1990s. The magnitude of variation in soil is
   magnified from 1990s under the continuing impact of climate change.},

Title = {The temporal variation of sediment connectivity from 1982 to 2020 in the
   Wei River basin, China},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Sediment connectivity is a valuable metric that characterizes the
   relationship between sediment transport from the source to the sink, and
   the ease of sediment erosion. Over the past four decades, changes in
   land use types and vegetation cover have significantly altered sediment
   dynamics in the Wei River basin. In this study, we used the index of
   connectivity (IC) to assess the temporal changes in sediment
   connectivity at a watershed scale. We employed Landsat images to analyse
   the relationship between changes in vegetation cover or land use type
   and sediment connectivity. We used factor detector and interaction
   detector in Geodetector to analyse the importance and impact of
   vegetation and slope on IC changes. We assessed the correlation of
   sediment yield and connectivity to validate our results and it shows
   that IC has strong or moderate positive correlation with sediment yield
   from eight out of nine stations in the Wei River Basin. Our findings
   demonstrate that soil and water conservation measures, as well as the
   grain for green project, have led to the transformation of cropland and
   grassland into woodland. This change is reflected in the decrease of the
   maximum IC value from 6.24 to 5.72 in the Beiluo sub-basin, indicating a
   decreasing trend in sediment connectivity. Although the maximum IC value
   increased from 5.76 to 5.08 in the Jing sub-basin, driven by human
   activity, showing an increasing trend. Furthermore, the IC value
   decreased in the western part of the Wei sub-basin. Overall, sediment
   connectivity exhibits a weak decreasing trend in most regions of the Wei
   River basin, while it shows an increasing trend slightly in the Jing
   sub-basin. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.47 to 0.86, with
   sediment yield being moderately or strongly correlated with IC. Our
   study identified vegetation, human activity, and slope as the main
   influencing factors of IC. The results of factor detector showed that
   the q value of vegetation was 0.63 and the slope was 0.1, Vegetation
   played a major role in the change of IC. The results of interaction
   detector showed that interaction between vegetation and slope was
   greater than the single factor. The temporal variability of sediment
   connectivity in the basin provides valuable insights for sediment
   transport management. Our research highlights the importance of studying
   sediment connectivity and offers proposals for measures that can be
   taken to address sediment transport challenges in the Wei River basin.

Title = {Enhancing catch-and-release science with biotelemetry},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {79-105},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is widely practised by anglers and is a
   common fisheries management strategy or is a by-product of harvest
   regulations. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research that
   examines not only the mortality associated with C\&R, but also the
   sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences. Biotelemetry
   offers a powerful means of remotely monitoring the behaviour, physiology
   and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment,
   but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars
   and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry
   in C\&R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and
   challenges. There are now about 250 C\&R studies but only one quarter of
   these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C\&R studies that
   have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We
   found that the majority of C\&R telemetry studies used either radio or
   acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite
   technologies. Most C\&R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess
   mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of
   displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies (< 8\%) have used
   physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly
   applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C\&R
   and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as
   death. We conclude that C\&R science has the potential to benefit
   greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to
   providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and
   adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding
   the lethal and sublethal impacts of C\&R. However, there are still a
   number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and
   methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and
   handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in
   assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C\&R
   biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby
   offer C\&R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries
   management and conservation.},

Title = {Measuring Food Security in the United States for More Than 25 years:

Abstract = {This article sets the stage for the ``25 Years of Food Security
   Measurement: Answered Questions and Further Research{''} conference,
   with support from the Economic Research Service of the US Department of
   Agriculture, by providing some history of federal food security
   measurement, summarizing notable findings, and reviewing selected
   special topics in analysis methods. The federal government uses food
   security surveys to monitor national progress toward reducing food
   insecurity and to evaluate federal nutrition assistance programs. For
   the monitoring purpose, there is a tension between focus (on a single
   authoritative measurement approach) and breadth (encompassing multiple
   tools or instruments suitable for diverse populations, contexts, and
   applications). For the program evaluation purpose, challenges include
   coordination with study designs capable of real causal estimation in the
   face of strong self-selection effects and tailored reference periods in
   survey questions that match the timing of program participation. Some
   analysis methods treat the food security survey items as distinct
   experiences of hardship, whereas others treat the food security survey
   items as windows on an underlying latent variable, a food insecurity
   score. The severity of food-related hardship may be assessed
   quantitatively by the number of distinct hardships reported, by the
   estimated value of a latent food insecurity score, or by the frequency
   of occurrence for sentinel hardships. Ongoing work investigates
   statistical approaches that are sufficiently simple for policy
   application and yet sufficiently flexible to accurately match the
   empirical survey evidence.},

Title = {Clinical signs predictive of influenza virus infection in Cameroon},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Influenza virus accounts for majority of respiratory virus infections in
   Cameroon. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
   influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are identified by a measured temperature
   of >= 38 degrees C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days. Other
   symptoms could as well be observed however, none of these are specific
   to influenza alone. This study aimed to determine symptom based
   predictors of influenza virus infection in Cameroon. Individuals with
   ILI were recruited from 2009-2018 in sentinel sites of the influenza
   surveillance system in Cameroon according to the WHO case definition.
   Individual data collection forms accompanied each respiratory sample and
   contained clinical data. Samples were analyzed for influenza using the
   gold standard assay. Two statistical methods were compared to determine
   the most reliable clinical predictors of influenza virus activity in
   Cameroon: binomial logistic predictive model and random forest model.
   Analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2. A total of 11816
   participants were recruited, of which, 24.0\% were positive for
   influenza virus. Binomial logistic predictive model revealed that the
   presence of cough, rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia are significant
   predictors of influenza positivity. The prediction model had a
   sensitivity of 75.6\%, specificity of 46.6\% and AUC of 66.7\%. The
   random forest model categorized the reported symptoms according to their
   degree of importance in predicting influenza virus infection. Myalgia
   had a 2-fold higher value in predicting influenza virus infection
   compared to any other symptom followed by arthralgia, head ache,
   rhinorrhoea and sore throat. The model had a OOB error rate of 25.86\%.
   Analysis showed that the random forest model had a better performance
   over the binomial regression model in predicting influenza infection.
   Rhinorrhoea, headache and myalgia were symptoms reported by both models
   as significant predictors of influenza infection in Cameroon. These
   symptoms could be used by clinicians in their decision to treat
   patients.},

Title = {Planning for the next influenza H1N1 season: a modelling study},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Background: The level of herd immunity before and after the first 2009
   pandemic season is not precisely known, and predicting the shape of the
   next pandemic H1N1 season is a difficult challenge.
   Methods: This was a modelling study based on data on medical visits for
   influenza-like illness collected by the French General Practitioner
   Sentinel network, as well as pandemic H1N1 vaccination coverage rates,
   and an individual-centred model devoted to influenza. We estimated
   infection attack rates during the first 2009 pandemic H1N1 season in
   France, and the rates of pre- and post-exposure immunity. We then
   simulated various scenarios in which a pandemic influenza H1N1 virus
   would be reintroduced into a population with varying levels of
   protective cross-immunity, and considered the impact of extending
   influenza vaccination.
   Results: During the first pandemic season in France, the proportion of
   infected persons was 18.1\% overall, 38.3\% among children, 14.8\% among
   younger adults and 1.6\% among the elderly. The rates of pre-exposure
   immunity required to fit data collected during the first pandemic season
   were 36\% in younger adults and 85\% in the elderly. We estimated that
   the rate of post-exposure immunity was 57.3\% (95\% Confidence Interval
   (95\% CI) 49.6\%-65.0\%) overall, 44.6\% (95\% CI 35.5\%-53.6\%) in
   children, 53.8\% (95\% CI 44.5\%-63.1\%) in younger adults, and 87.4\%
   (95\% CI 82.0\%-92.8\%) in the elderly. The shape of a second season
   would depend on the degree of persistent protective cross-immunity to
   descendants of the 2009 H1N1 viruses. A cross-protection rate of 70\%
   would imply that only a small proportion of the population would be
   affected. With a cross-protection rate of 50\%, the second season would
   have a disease burden similar to the first, while vaccination of 50\% of
   the entire population, in addition to the population vaccinated during
   the first pandemic season, would halve this burden. With a
   cross-protection rate of 30\%, the second season could be more
   substantial, and vaccination would not provide a significant benefit.
   Conclusions: These model-based findings should help to prepare for a
   second pandemic season, and highlight the need for studies of the
   different components of immune protection.},

Title = {Can the watershed non-point source phosphorus flux amount be reflected
   by lake sediment?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {118-130},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {An understanding of the quantitative relationship between watershed
   non-point source (NPS) pollution and lake nutrient enrichment is
   essential for the environmental management of water bodies. However, a
   lack of data availability and integration limit our understanding of
   this relationship. The most critical bottlenecks are the lack of
   adequate support for watershed-lake integrated data, a lack of data of
   the nutrient loading from watersheds into a lake as NPS, and the
   long-term time series data of lake nutrient concentrations. Since lake
   sediment is the ultimate destination of watershed nutrients, this study
   aimed to reveal the relationship between watershed phosphorus (P)
   concentrations that are transported into lakes and lake P concentrations
   by using inlet sediments as an indicator. Three typical sub-basins
   within Hongze Lake, China were selected as the study site, and 30-year
   dataset was calculated using the technology integration of remote
   sensing, sediment chemical analysis and SWAT model assessment. It can be
   concluded that, first, the Mineral-P (Min-P) accounted for nearly 65\%
   of the watershed Total P (TP) loss, which varied over different basins
   and temporal periods. Second, the relationship between watershed P loss
   into lakes and sediment P concentrations represented obvious variation
   among different basins, sediment depths and P states. With respect to
   different basins, the highest correlation appeared in Basin 1, which had
   a R-2 value of 0.65 for Min-P. With respect to different P states, the
   Inorganic-P (IP) showed a closer relationship between watershed and lake
   P than Organic-P (OP), and the correlation coefficient (r) was higher
   than 0.6 in Basin 1 and Basin 3 for IP. In addition, the
   calcium-phosphorus ratio (Ca-P), which is largely sourced from watershed
   rock detritus by eroded runoff, played the most critical role among
   different Min-P states in the relatively ideal relationship of IP. With
   respect to different sediment depths, a stratification phenomenon
   existed in Basin 2 and Basin 3, which differed at specific depths. In
   particular, the ideal relationship only existed within the 7 cm depth
   from the bottom in basin 2, and this value expands to 10 cm for basin 3.
   This diversity was influenced by the integration roles from external and
   endogenous sources. All the findings indicated that lake surface
   sediment can be used as a proxy to represent NPS P loading under
   specific conditions. The relationship between watershed P loss and lake
   sediment P concentration was largely decided by land use/cover change
   (LUCC), meteorological conditions, and lake resuspension.},

Title = {Interpretation of high-resolution imagery for detecting vegetation cover
   composition change after fuels reduction treatments in woodlands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {570-578},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The use of very high resolution (VHR; ground sampling distances <similar
   to 5 cm) aerial imagery to estimate site vegetation cover and to detect
   changes from management has been well documented. However, as the
   purpose of monitoring is to document change overtime, the ability to
   detect changes from imagery at the same or better level of accuracy and
   precision as those measured in situ must be assessed for image-based
   techniques to become reliable tools for ecosystem monitoring. Our
   objective with this study was to quantify the relationship between
   field-measured and image-interpreted changes in vegetation and ground
   cover measured one year apart in a Pinon and Juniper (P-J) woodland in
   southern Utah, USA. The study area was subject to a variety of fuel
   removal treatments between 2009 and 2010. We measured changes in plant
   community composition and ground cover along transects in a control area
   and three different treatments prior to and following P-J removal. We
   compared these measurements to vegetation composition and change based
   on photo-interpretation of similar to 4 cm ground sampling distance
   imagery along similar transects. Estimates of cover were similar between
   field-based and image-interpreted methods in 2009 and 2010 for woody
   vegetation, no vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, and litter (including
   woody litter). Image-interpretation slightly overestimated cover for
   woody vegetation and no-vegetation classes (average difference between
   methods of 1.34\% and 5.85\%) and tended to underestimate cover for
   herbaceous vegetation and litter (average difference of -5.18\% and
   0.27\%), but the differences were significant only for litter cover in
   2009. Level of agreement between the field-measurements and
   image-interpretation was good for woody vegetation and no-vegetation
   classes (r between 0.47 and 0.89), but generally poorer for herbaceous
   vegetation and litter (r between 0.18 and 0.81) likely due to
   differences in image quality by year and the difficulty in
   discriminating fine vegetation and litter in imagery. Our results show
   that image interpretation to detect vegetation changes has utility for
   monitoring fuels reduction treatments in terms of woody vegetation and
   no-vegetation classes. The benefits of this technique are that it
   provides objective and repeatable measurements of site conditions that
   could be implemented relatively inexpensively and easily without the
   need for highly specialized software or technical expertise. Perhaps the
   biggest limitations of image interpretation to monitoring fuels
   treatments are challenges in estimating litter and herbaceous vegetation
   cover and the sensitivity of herbaceous cover estimates to image quality
   and shadowing. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Improving Medium-Range Forecasts of Rain-on-Snow Events in Prealpine
   Areas},

Abstract = {Rain-on-snow (RoS) events have caused severe floods in mountainous
   catchments in the recent past. Challenges in forecasting such events are
   uncertainties in meteorological input variables, the accurate estimation
   of snow cover and deficits in process understanding during runoff
   formation. Here, we evaluate the potential of the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF IFS)
   to forecast RoS disposition (i.e., minimum rainfall amounts, initial
   snow cover, and meltwater contribution) several days ahead. We thereby
   evaluate forecasts of rain and snowfall with disdrometer observations
   and show that ensemble-based forecasts have larger potential than the
   high-resolution forecast of ECMWF IFS. Then, we use ECMWF IFS weather
   forecasts as input to a conceptual hydrological model, which is
   calibrated using estimates of snow-covered area (SCA), snow water
   equivalent (SWE), and discharge observations. We show that the forecast
   skill of this model chain is reasonably high with respect to SCA and
   SWE, even several days ahead. However, a number of RoS events are missed
   in the forecast, mainly due to an underestimation of rainfall amounts.
   These misses can be reduced by lowering the rainfall amount threshold
   for the forecast as compared to the analysis, being accompanied by only
   a moderate increase in false alarm rates. In contrast, the forecast of
   RoS disposition is found to be less sensitive to thresholds of initial
   snow cover and meltwater contribution. We conclude that valuable
   disposition warnings for RoS events can be issued several days ahead,
   and we illustrate this idea with a case study.},

Title = {Modelling biophysical parameters of Indian Sundarbans mangroves using

   observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Mangroves are one of the important coastal ecosystems in the world and
   Sundarbans is one of the major blocks of mangrove ecosystem. Indian
   covers 40\% of the total Sundarbans mangrove area, while the remaining
   60\% is located in Bangladesh. For mangrove forest assessment and their
   sustainable management, there is need to estimate the forest
   biophysical/ structural attributes. The present study investigates some
   of the biophysical properties of mangrove vegetation of south-western
   part of Indian Sundarbans using L-band fully polarimetric Advanced Land
   Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture
   Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data and field observations. The backscattering
   coefficients for all mangrove communities of the study area were
   computed where the cross polarizations (HV and VH) showed better
   potentiality for discrimination of the communities. Biophysical
   parameters of mangrove forest trees were modelled using multiple linear
   regressions. Synthetic Aperture Radar backscattering coefficients and
   some of the biophysical parameters were used as independent variables
   for basal area (BA) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimations with the
   highest model R square value of 0.632 and 0.717, respectively. The
   validation root mean square error (RMSE) achieved in case of BA was 3.66
   m2/ha, while the lowest validation RMSE attained for AGB was 46.10
   Mg/ha. The methodology presented in the work may be applied for the
   entire Sundarbans (including both the remaining Indian part and the
   Bangladesh mangroves).},

Abstract = {Analyses of avian demographic patterns across entire, contiguous
   landscapes are rare, but such analyses are important for understanding
   population dynamics. We selected the Black-throated Sparrow in the
   northern Chihuahuan Desert as a model to test patterns of abundance and
   nest success. across a landscape. We integrated abundance, nest density,
   and nesting success measured on sampling plots with a classified
   satellite map of the distribution of seven habitat types to analyze
   spatial and temporal patterns contributing to the population dynamics of
   this species.
   Adult relative abundance ranged from <1 bird/100 ha in pinyon-juniper
   habitat to 2439 birds/100 ha in shrubland habitats. Nest density was
   consistently high in mesquite, moderate to high in creosotebush, and low
   in black grama grassland; this value exhibited more temporal variability
   than relative abundance of adults. Nest success rates exhibited a strong
   habitat effect and ranged from 8\% in mesquite to 47\% in black grama
   grassland; overall population nest success. was 0.266. In all three
   years, nest success in mesquite was significantly lower than in all
   other habitat types (P < 0.01). There was no correlation between nest
   success and adult relative abundance.
   While mesquite habitat contained about one-third of all adults in the
   three years of the study, it contributed as. little as 10\% of
   successful nests. In creosotebush, the relative contribution to both
   adult abundance and successful nests was relatively high. Mesa grassland
   contained relatively few adults, but up to 44\% of successful nests. We
   discuss how habitat selection theory suggests mechanisms for the
   observed patterns. Mesquite appears to be a population sink for
   Black-throated Sparrows and may be, an ecological trap. While we do not
   propose that there is cause for conservation concern for this widespread
   species, our results, underscore the pitfalls associated with using
   adult abundance as an indicator of habitat quality. The method presented
   here is applicable for man), species and ecosystems and, thus, may be an
   important tool for conservation and management, as well as a new avenue
   for scientific investigation of landscape-level population dynamics.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aims to assess whether research and development
   (R\&D) personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental
   institutions contribute to innovation activities of firms from the Vise
   -grad Group countries.Research Design \& Methods: Fixed effects panel
   regression with robust standard errors was used for hypoth-esis testing
   over the period 2009-2017. The data for the study was extracted from
   Eurostat, the European Innovation Scoreboard and the Organisation for
   Economic Cooperation and Development with a particular focus on R\&D
   personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental
   institutions. The empirical analy-sis was focused on small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Findings: The results provide evidence
   about significant linkage between R\&D personnel from governmental
   institutions and innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group
   countries. The research also highlights the lack of a significant effect
   of R\&D personnel from firms and the research system on firms'
   innovation ac-tivities in the analysed former Soviet satellite economies
   distinguished by innovation performance below the average for the
   European Union.Implications \& Recommendations: Policy and practical
   implications that should be indicated include the ne-cessity to further
   develop knowledge cooperation between governmental institutions and
   firms in order to reinforce innovation processes. There is also a need
   to enhance cooperation between the research system and firms to support
   SMEs from the Visegrad Group countries with highly-skilled human
   resources.Contribution \& Value Added: This article adds to the
   literature on drivers and sources of firms' innovation activities by
   providing new empirical evidence on the effect of R\&D personnel on
   innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group countries, which
   are former Soviet satellite economies with a moderate level of
   in-novativeness and belong to peripheral countries in the European

Title = {An examination of the views of key stakeholders on the development of
   learning spaces at a regional university},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {204+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the degree of
   alignment between the views of key stakeholders on the development of
   learning spaces in a new teaching and learning building at a satellite
   campus of a regional university.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were undertaken
   with six stakeholders including senior executives, technical staff,
   academic staff and students. The interviews were transcribed and the
   data analysed to identify common and differing themes on the part of the
   respective interviewees in relation to learning spaces in general, and
   in relation to the new teaching and learning building in particular.
   Findings - A comprehensive framework should be articulated by the
   university for its theme of personalised learning so that decisions can
   be made at lower levels of the university to operationalise the theme
   across academic and administrative functions. A clear definition of the
   blended learning pedagogy, which is proposed to be implemented as part
   of the personalised learning theme, should be articulated. The
   implications of the blended learning pedagogy for the design of learning
   spaces should be identified and clear design guidelines for learning
   spaces should be articulated. Learning spaces in the new building should
   be reviewed to achieve alignment with the personalised learning
   framework and the guidelines for learning spaces.
   Research limitations/implications - As this is a preliminary study with
   a small number of participants, a qualitative approach was taken to
   identify the indicative views of representatives of key stakeholders.
   The findings relate specifically to the context of this study at a
   regional Australian university.
   Originality/value - This paper provides valuable insights into how a
   university's philosophy on learning spaces manifests itself through
   creation and implementation of high-level policy and how that is
   interpreted and actioned by a range of stakeholders across campuses,
   including staff and students.},

Abstract = {We developed DeepSolar, a deep learning framework analyzing satellite
   imagery to identify the GPS locations and sizes of solar photovoltaic
   panels. Leveraging its high accuracy and scalability, we constructed a
   comprehensive high-fidelity solar deployment database for the contiguous
   US. We demonstrated its value by discovering that residential solar
   deployment density peaks at a population density of 1,000 capita/mile 2,
   increases with annual household income asymptoting at similar to\$150k,
   and has an inverse correlation with the Gini index representing income
   inequality. We uncovered a solar radiation threshold (4.5 kWh/m(2)/day)
   above which the solar deployment is ``triggered.'' Furthermore, we built
   an accurate machine learning-based predictive model to estimate the
   solar deployment density at the census tract level. We offer the
   DeepSolar database as a publicly available resource for researchers,
   utilities, solar developers, and policymakers to further uncover solar
   deployment patterns, build comprehensive economic and behavioral models,
   and ultimately support the adoption and management of solar electricity.},

Title = {Detection of the Coupling between Vegetation Leaf Area and Climate in a
   Multifunctional Watershed, Northwestern China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Accurate detection and quantification of vegetation dynamics and drivers
   of observed climatic and anthropogenic change in space and time is
   fundamental for our understanding of the atmosphere-biosphere
   interactions at local and global scales. This case study examined the
   coupled spatial patterns of vegetation dynamics and climatic
   variabilities during the past three decades in the Upper Heihe River
   Basin (UHRB), a complex multiple use watershed in arid northwestern
   China. We apply empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and singular value
   decomposition (SVD) analysis to isolate and identify the spatial
   patterns of satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) and their close
   relationship with the variability of an aridity index (AI =
   Precipitation/Potential Evapotranspiration). Results show that UHRB has
   become increasingly warm and wet during the past three decades. In
   general, the rise of air temperature and precipitation had a positive
   impact on mean LAI at the annual scale. At the monthly scale, LAI
   variations had a lagged response to climate. Two major coupled spatial
   change patterns explained 29\% and 41\% of the LAI dynamics during
   1983-2000 and 2001-2010, respectively. The strongest connections between
   climate and LAI were found in the southwest part of the basin prior to
   2000, but they shifted towards the north central area afterwards,
   suggesting that the sensitivity of LAI to climate varied over time, and
   that human disturbances might play an important role in altering LAI
   patterns. At the basin level, the positive effects of regional climate
   warming and precipitation increase as well as local ecological
   restoration efforts overwhelmed the negative effects of overgrazing. The
   study results offer insights about the coupled effects of climatic
   variability and grazing on ecosystem structure and functions at a
   watershed scale. Findings from this study are useful for land managers
   and policy makers to make better decisions in response to climate change
   in the study region.},

Title = {Multi-Criteria Assessment for City-Wide Rooftop Solar PV Deployment: A
   Case Study of Bandung, Indonesia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The world faces the threat of an energy crisis that is exacerbated by
   the dominance of fossil energy sources that negatively impact the
   sustainability of the earth's ecosystem. Currently, efforts to increase
   the supply of renewable energy have become a global agenda, including
   using solar energy which is one of the rapidly developing clean
   energies. However, studies in solar photovoltaic (PV) modelling that
   integrates geospatial information of urban morphological building
   characters, solar radiation, and multiple meteorological parameters in
   low-cost scope have not been explored fully. Therefore, this research
   aims to model the urban rooftop solar PV development in the Global South
   using Bandung, Indonesia, as a case study. This research also has
   several specific purposes: developing a building height model as well as
   determining the energy potential of rooftop solar PV, the energy needs
   of each building, and the residential property index. This study is
   among the first to develop the national digital surface model (DSM) of
   buildings. In addition, the analysis of meteorological effects
   integrated with the hillshade parameter was used to obtain the solar PV
   potential value of the roof in more detail. The process of integrating
   building parameters in the form of rooftop solar PV development
   potential, energy requirements, and residential property index of a
   building was expected to increase the accuracy of determining priority
   buildings for rooftop solar PV deployment in Bandung. This study shows
   that the estimated results of effective solar PV in Bandung ranges from
   351.833 to 493.813 W/m(2), with a total of 1316 and 36,372 buildings in
   scenarios 1 and 2 being at a high level of priority for solar PV
   development. This study is expected to be a reference for the Indonesian
   government in planning the construction of large-scale rooftop solar PV
   in urban areas to encourage the rapid use of clean energy. Furthermore,
   this study has general potential for other jurisdictions for the
   governments focusing on clean energy using geospatial information in
   relation with buildings and their energy consumption.},

Title = {Experimental Evaluation of Smartphone Accelerometer and Low-Cost Dual
   Frequency GNSS Sensors for Deformation Monitoring},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Smartphone accelerometers and low-cost Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS) equipment have faced rapid and important advancement,
   opening a new door to deformation monitoring applications such as
   landslide, plate tectonics and structural health monitoring (SHM). The
   precision potential and operational feasibility of the equipment play an
   important role in the decision making of campaigning for affordable
   solutions. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the empirical
   precision, including (auto)time correlation, of a common smartphone
   accelerometer (Bosch BMI160) and a low-cost dual frequency GNSS
   reference-rover pair (u-blox ZED-F9P) set to operate at high rates (50
   and 5 Hz, respectively). Additionally, a high-rate (5 Hz) GPS-only
   baseline-based multipath (MP) correction is proposed for effectively
   removing a large part of this error and allowing to correctly determine
   the instrumental noise of the GNSS sensor. Furthermore, the benefit of
   smartphone-based validation for the tracking of dynamic displacements is
   addressed. The estimated East-North-Up (ENU) precision values
   (sigma<\^{}>) of \& PLUSMN;7.7, 8.1 and 9.6 mms2 are comparable with the
   declared precision potential (sigma) of the smartphone accelerometer of
   \& PLUSMN;8.8mms2. Furthermore, the acceleration noise shows only mild
   traces of (auto)correlation. The MP-corrected 3D (ENU) empirical
   precision values of \& PLUSMN;2.6, 3.6 and 6.7 mm were found to be
   better by 30-40\% than the straight-out-of box precision of the GNSS
   sensor, attesting the usefulness of the MP correction. The GNSS sensors
   output position information with time correlation of typically tens of
   seconds. The results indicate exceptional precision potential of these
   low-power-consuming, small-scale, affordable sensors set to operate at a
   high-rate over small regions. The smartphone-based dynamic displacement
   validation shows that GNSS data of a low-cost sensor at a 5 Hz sampling
   rate can be successfully used for tracking dynamic processes.},

Abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk
   factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing
   national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this
   study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in
   context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for
   previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate
   attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends
   in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural,
   environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks
   from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met
   World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable
   evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from
   randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household
   surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used
   statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate
   covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure
   across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual
   scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of
   deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed
   trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth,
   population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific
   DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a
   Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation,
   household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and
   smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several
   occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased
   by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in
   2015 accounted for 57.8\% (95\% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and
   41.2\% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to
   global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure
   (211.8 million {[}192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking
   (148.6 million {[}134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma
   glucose (143.1 million {[}125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI
   (120.1 million {[}83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood
   undernutrition (113.3 million {[}103.9 million to 123.4 million]),
   ambient particulate matter (103.1 million {[}90.8 million to 115.1
   million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million {[}74.6 million to 105.7
   million]), household air pollution (85.6 million {[}66.7 million to
   106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million {[}77.2 million to 93.0
   million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million {[}49.3 million to
   127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for
   micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation
   and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY
   rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising
   exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from
   high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and
   drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined
   steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting
   plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks,
   such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most
   attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the
   leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries;
   childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early
   death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed
   to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be
   invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting
   plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to
   rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for
   intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain
   major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining.
   Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are
   increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The

Title = {An evaluation of the Zambia influenza sentinel surveillance system,
   2011-2017},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Background Over the past decade, influenza surveillance has been
   established in several African countries including Zambia. However,
   information on the on data quality and reliability of established
   influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information
   would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance
   systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of
   data reliability for policy making and public health interventions.
   Methods We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance
   system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011-2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data
   quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness,
   (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability,
   (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated
   using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the
   proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the
   total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each
   attribute as follows: < 60\% (as obtained in the calculation above)
   scored 1 (weak performance); 60-79\% scored 2 (moderate performance); >=
   80\% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute
   and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated
   attributes. Results The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was
   2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated
   (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral
   pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8),
   acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review
   period and its relatively low cost (\$310,000 per annum). Identified
   weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0),
   timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote
   sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds.
   Conclusions The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key
   improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples
   shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would
   result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia
   is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of
   maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require
   evaluation.},

Title = {Reshaping Publicness: Research on Correlation between Public
   Participation and Spatial Form in Urban Space Based on Space Syntax-A
   Case Study on Nanjing Xinjiekou},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on urban regeneration practices in central urban
   areas, aiming to find key points for reshaping the publicness of urban
   spaces by exploring the morphological features of public spaces and the
   spatial distribution patterns of public activities. Now that China's
   urbanization process has stabilized, large-scale regeneration is no
   longer applicable to the current urban environment, and urban morphology
   has proved to be significantly useful in understanding and designing the
   built environment. However, current research lacks quantitative studies
   on morphology and public activities, and thus is hardly instructive for
   the cognition and design of spatial morphology in specific locations.
   Therefore, this paper attempts to subdivide spatial morphology at the
   level of ``micro-renewal{''} or ``micro-renovation{''} in order to
   explore the impact of spatial morphology on public participation in
   cities. The site chosen for this study is Xinjiekou in Nanjing. As a key
   area of two important arteries in the center of Nanjing, Xinjiekou has
   been a gathering place for a variety of commercial forms, such as
   finance, retail department stores, restaurants, and entertainment, and
   has been the commercial and financial center of Nanjing since the 1940s.
   In an on-site observation of urban development and pedestrian flow in
   the Xinjiekou area, the study found that despite its status as the area
   with the highest degree of spatial accessibility and public
   participation, its public space has gradually lost its attractiveness to
   residents, who lack a sense of participation and place identity. Based
   on the study of urban public spaces, both accessibility and choice play
   an important role in increasing public participation. Therefore, this
   study combined observation and quantitative analysis of Space Syntax to
   obtain the distribution of accessibility, choice, and public activity.
   Based on the results of the analysis, this research uses GWR as the
   statistical method to clarify the correlation between different
   variables. The final conclusion is that when the space type is a path
   with high choice value and the paths are connected, the enhancement of
   accessibility and choice plays an important role in promoting public
   participation. This statistically based empirical study of testable
   correlations is very helpful for the perception of location-specific
   spaces with high levels of interpretability and confidence. Thus, it
   further guides the design and has a high reference value for future
   spatial planning.},

Abstract = {Satellite technology has been used over the years by the countries the
   world over with the benefits percolating down to the society. It has
   contributed in revolutionising communications, improving natural
   resources management systems, facilitating the study of agriculture
   potential and in various fields of economic development. Satellites have
   also been used for surveillance, emergency preparedness and coordinating
   search and rescue operations on a global basis. A unique benefit of this
   technology has been realised in the area of navigation and
   radiopositioning.
   Satellite based navigation and radiopositioning was first implemented by
   the USA with the launch of TRANSIT System. TRANSIT had paved the way for
   worldwide acceptance of satellite navigation although its use, life and
   accuracy of position fixing were limited. These limitations were
   overcome with the introduction of concept of Global Positioning System
   (GPS). GPS was conceived in 1974 by the USA as a better and faster
   navigation system capable of providing three dimensional position and
   velocity information along-with precise time to all types of users
   anywhere on a 24 hours basis. GPS provides for two levels of services
   i.e. Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service
   (PPS). The SPS is intended to provide a position fix that is accurate to
   within 100 meters on 95 percent of occasions, whereas PPS requires
   transfer from Coarse (C/A) code to the more accurate Precision (P) code,
   which allows accuracy of 16 meters on 50 percent of occasions.
   The accuracy of 100 meters available to civil users through SPS may not
   meet the requirements of applications in offshore oil exploration,
   hydrographic survey, physical oceanographic operation, fixing, collision
   avoidance, harbour approach and landing of aircraft, geophysical survey
   of remote locations and conducting search and rescue operations etc.
   This degraded accuracy can however be improved using the concept of
   Differential GPS (DGPS).
   This article deals with various issues related to the GPS technologies,
   their potential applications and system configurations available for
   these applications. An approach for design, development and
   demonstration of GPS and DGPS in Indian conditions with the active
   participation of user departments, industries and R\&D institutions
   engaged in this field has also been discussed. Since the GPS/DGPS is a
   system with potential of revolutionising the concepts in navigation and
   radiopositioning applications, it is hoped that this article will pave
   the way for promoting developmental activities for GPS/DGPS and Indian
   industries will gear up to meet the large requirements anticipated in
   near future for these.},

Title = {Development and validation of a model to estimate postharvest losses
   during transport of tomatoes in West Africa},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {32-47},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In an effort to better understand postharvest losses associated with
   low-cost tomato transport in West Africa we present a spatial-temporal
   simulation model that links the prevailing outside weather conditions,
   estimated using satellite meteorology, to the microclimate observed
   inside truck trailers (cryptoclimate) to determine the deterioration in
   tomato quality during transport. Tomatoes from Burkina Faso are
   transported under sub-optimal circumstances to important Ghanaian
   markets; during a number of these transports conditions for the tomato
   cargo inside trucks were measured while conditions outside the trucks
   were monitored by means of weather satellites. The presented tomato
   quality model analytically combines cryptoclimate, duration since
   harvest, and kinetic modelling to arrive at estimated firmness. Firmness
   of tomatoes in transport was monitored with a portable penetrometer in
   selected trucks, augmented with additional (acoustic firmness) data
   collected in a climate chamber. Half of these observations were used to
   calibrate a firmness loss model and the other half to validate the
   simulation results.
   Our results indicate that outside weather during transport can be
   reasonably well estimated using satellite meteorology. The model
   performance for the estimation of outside global radiation (Rg) and
   land-surface temperature (LST) were found to be satisfactory, with a
   RMSE = 87.98 W m(-2); bias = 57.39 W m(-2) and RMSE = 2.95 degrees C;
   bias = 0.91 degrees C, respectively. Results for the cryptoclimate
   estimation (conditions inside the trucks) for temperature, relative
   humidity, and light intensity were as follows: R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 4.18
   degrees C (T-incargo); R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 19.59\% (RHincargo); and R-2 =
   0.9, RMSE = 137.31 lx (LIincargo). The postharvest loss model that
   relies on these estimates as its input explained on average 77\% of the
   variance in observed tomatoes firmness, with total product losses
   ranging from 30\% to 50\% when integrated over the entire transportation
   period.
   With the accuracy of the model quantified and the causality of losses
   partially demonstrated, we argue that the simulation model can be useful
   as an economic resistor in transport optimization studies to investigate
   the cost-benefit of various measures to reduce postharvest losses. Such
   studies could help to illustrate what net gains can be expected if
   delays along the transportation route are reduced, cargo conditions are
   semi-controlled (e.g. pre-cooling treatment), or if a different
   transport schedule is adopted. The model may also be used to show the
   impact of different climate change scenarios on postharvest losses. (C)

Title = {Spatiotemporal landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning
   models: A case study from district Hattian Bala, NW Himalaya, Pakistan},

Abstract = {The Himalayan region, a rugged mountain zone is among the most
   susceptible zones to the landslide hazard due to its terrain, geography,
   and active tectonics. Machine learning (ML) techniques are most advanced
   and precise methods to develop landslide susceptibility model (LSM). The
   current study was designed to analyze and assess the landslide
   susceptibility using ML approaches for District Hattian Bala, NW
   Himalayas, Pakistan. The historical satellite imageries are used to
   generate spatiotemporal landslide inventories of year 2005, 2007 and
   2012. A spatial database was created pertaining to topographic,
   environmental, geologic, and anthropogenic factors including slope,
   aspect, elevation, curvature, plane curvature, profile curvature,
   topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, distance to faults, distance
   to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) and land use/ land cover (LULC). These LCFs were selected to
   analyze periodic landslide susceptibility in the region. The
   experimental design utilized 349, 393, and 735 landslide inventory of
   2005, 2007, and 2012 respectively. Two ML models, i.e., Random Forest
   (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to assess landslide
   susceptibility determine by thirteen landslide causative factors (LCFs).
   The spatiotemporal landslide inventory was partitioned into training
   (70\%) and testing (30\%) landslides for respective years to check the
   prediction accuracies of selected ML models. Comparative analysis of
   different LSMs was performed by the Receiver Operator Curves - Area
   Under Curves (ROC-AUC). The resultant accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Kappa,
   Precision, Recall, F1 indicated that RF outperformed the LR model. The
   study aims to minimize losses to lives and potential economic damage
   linked with recurrent slope instabilities in the region. It is
   anticipated that use of ML algorithms would support concerned
   authorities and organizations to effectively plan and manage landslide
   hazard in the region.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on

Abstract = {Leeway, defined as the movement of the search object through water
   caused by the action of wind on the exposed surfaces of the object, is
   fundamental to search planning. Over the past several years, the U.S.
   Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (R\&DC) and the
   Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) have participated in leeway studies of
   various drift targets such as life rafts, evacuation vessels, sailboats,
   and other targets of interest. The leeway coefficients computed for each
   drift target generated from these leeway studies will be used in the new
   USCG Search and Rescue (SAR) planning software, the Search and Rescue
   Optimal Planning System (SAROPS), to define potential search areas
   during SAR operations.
   In the fall of 2005, the R\&DC conducted leeway testing of two specific
   drift objects on behalf of the U.S. Naval Submarine Medical Research
   Laboratory: the Mark-10 Submarine Escape and Immersion Equipment (SEIE)
   life raft, and the Submarine Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon
   (SEPIRB). These studies were performed off the coast of St. John's,
   Newfoundland, Canada where open ocean conditions can be obtained within
   several miles from shore. Multiple drift runs were completed for each
   type of object to evaluate their behavior in response to various wind
   and sea conditions, producing object drift data under a wide variety of
   conditions.
   During the course of the study, each target was tracked by an on-board
   GPS receiver and data logger to yield high-resolution speed and
   direction over ground data. Wind velocity and sea conditions were
   measured by meteorological and wave rider buoys deployed within the
   study area to characterize environmental forcing conditions. The leeway
   of one SEIE raft was measured directly by a 1200 kHz acoustic Doppler
   current profiler (ADCP) gimbal-mounted and in a down-looking
   orientation, as well as multiple Self Locating Datum Marker Buoys
   (SLDMBs) that reported their respective positions via satellite at
   30-minute intervals. Leeway of the remaining objects was determined
   indirectly by subtracting the surface current vector of adjacent SLDMBs
   from the drift object vector motion recorded by its onboard GPS
   receiver. Because all search objects were in the vicinity of the SLDMB
   field, a comparison between the direct and indirect leeway motion could
   be made for the ADCP-equipped SEIE raft. This value was then correlated
   to recorded wind speed and direction, and subjected to error analysis
   and statistical validation.
   This paper focuses on the methodology employed during the field study
   and provides a detailed description of the post-processing routines used
   to derive leeway coefficients for the SEIE for U.S. Navy search
   planning, and for use by the USCG in its SAROPS planning software.
   Estimates of the surface current for each drift target to support
   indirect leeway calculations relied on a statistical interpolation
   technique and consisted of steps described in the paper below. The
   resulting time series constituted a data base for the calculation of
   downwind and crosswind leeway coefficients, derived from a least-squares
   linear regression between the corresponding velocity components of wind
   and target drift. The success of the indirect approach is evaluated by
   comparing the estimates with directly measured velocities. It was
   concluded that this statistical interpolation technique performed
   particularly well when the drifting target stayed within an imaginary
   polygon delineated by the available SLDMBs.
   Three of the four rafts considered in the study drifted with 12-15
   degrees leeway angles to the right of the wind direction. Downwind
   leeway coefficient was 0.02 for the drogued rafts and 0.03 for the
   undrogued rafts. Scatter of estimated leeway velocity with respect to
   wind speed suggested a tighter relationship for higher wind speeds (>7
   m/sec).},

Title = {Lightning and Severe Weather: A Comparison between Total and
   Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Trends},
Journal = {WEATHER AND FORECASTING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {744-755},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many studies over the past several decades have attempted to correlate
   trends in lightning (e.g., rates, polarity) to severe weather
   occurrence. These studies mainly used cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning
   information due to the ease of data availability, high detection
   efficiency, and broad coverage across the United States, with somewhat
   inconclusive results. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that trends
   in total lightning are more robustly correlated to severe weather
   occurrence, with rapid increases in total lightning observed 10s of
   minutes prior to the onset of severe weather. Unfortunately, total
   lightning observations are not as numerous, or available over the same
   areal coverage domain, as provided by CG networks. Relatively few
   studies have examined concurrent trends in both total and CG lightning
   within the same severe thunderstorm, or even large sets of thunderstorms
   using an objective lightning jump algorithm. Multiple studies have shown
   that the total flash rate rapidly increases prior to the onset of severe
   weather. What is untested within the same framework is the use of CG
   information to perform the same task. Herein, total and CG lightning
   trends for 711 thunderstorms occurring in four regions of the country
   were examined to demonstrate the increased utility that total lightning
   provides over CG lightning, specifically within the framework of
   developing a useful lightning-based severe weather warning decision
   support tool. Results indicate that while both lightning datasets
   demonstrate the presence of increased lightning activity prior to the
   onset of severe weather, the use of total lightning trends was more
   effective than CG trends {[}probability of detection (POD), 79\% versus
   66\%; false alarm rate (FAR), 36\% versus 53\%; critical success index
   (CSI), 55\% versus 38\%; Heidke skill score (HSS), 0.71 versus 0.55].
   Moreover, 40\% of false alarms associated with total lightning, and 16\%
   of false alarms with CG lightning trends, occurred when a lightning jump
   associated with a severe weather ``warning{''} was already in effect. If
   these false alarms are removed, the FAR drops from 36\% to 22\% for
   total lightning and from 53\% to 44\% for CG lightning. Importantly,
   average lead times prior to severe weather occurrence were higher using
   total lightning as compared with CG lightning (20.65 versus 13.54 min).
   The ultimate goal of this study was to demonstrate the increased utility
   of total lightning information that the Geostationary Lightning Mapper
   (GLM) will provide to operational meteorology in anticipation of severe
   convective weather on a hemispheric scale once Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) is deployed in the next decade.},

Title = {Exploring the upper ocean characteristics of a bay using coastal and
   regional ocean community model},
Journal = {GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-116},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The innovativeness of this study lies in
   achieving a comprehensive understanding of the seasonal variations and
   oceanic characteristics of the Bay of Bengal by addressing the complex
   interplay of large-scale ocean-atmosphere dynamics. The study aimed to
   understand the upper ocean characteristics of the Bay of Bengal by
   analyzing the surface variables such as salinity and temperature using a
   high-resolution model simulation. To accomplish this, advanced
   high-resolution numerical simulations were employed, utilizing the
   coastal and regional ocean community model. This model was crucial for
   investigating and analyzing the circulation features throughout the
   entire Bay of Bengal, contributing knowledge and insights about the
   coastal and regional oceanographic community.METHODS: To investigate the
   temporal variability of the upper ocean in the Bay of Bengal,
   climatological simulations were performed over eight years using the
   coastal and regional ocean community model. Including a three-year
   spin-up phase facilitated the adjustment of the model to initial
   conditions and the attainment of equilibrium, ensuring its fidelity to
   real world conditions. The follow-up analyses and comparisons were
   performed five years after the spin-up phase. The primary objective of
   this study was to examine the temporal evolution of the kinetic energy
   throughout the eight-year simulation. The volume-averaged kinetic energy
   was computed, revealing a gradual increase throughout the simulation,
   with particularly pronounced enhancements observed during the monsoon
   period. A Taylor diagram was used for predicting the model with the
   other data sets.FINDINGS: The analysis is performed above the surface
   and sub-surface oceanic layers with prominent dynamics. The temperature
   and salinity for the surface and sub-surface layers were validated and
   analyzed for their seasonal variations. The simulations were validated
   against the existing satellite, reanalysis, and in situ data.CONCLUSION:
   The innovativeness of this study lies in its successful demonstration of
   the seasonal variability of temperature and salinity in the Bay of
   Bengal. Through extensive validations, it establishes the model to
   accurately simulate the climatological surface features of the Bay of
   Bengal. This study highlights the effectiveness of numerical models when
   combined with observations, and the data were reanalyzed, showcasing
   their utility as valuable tools for studying oceanic conditions. The
   utilization of a Taylor diagram further supports the validation and
   excellent performance of the model compared to other available datasets.
   During the simulation, there is a high correlation (0.96) between the
   evolution of the salinity and temperature values obtained from the model
   and the corresponding data from the World Ocean Atlas. This indicates a
   strong agreement between the model-based simulations and the assimilated
   data, as supported by the notable correlation values of 0.96 for
   salinity and temperature. These findings reinforce the existing
   knowledge regarding the influential role of monsoon winds in shaping the
   circulation patterns within the Bay of Bengal. Overall, this study
   contributes to advancing our understanding of the ocean dynamics of the
   region and underscores the importance of considering seasonal variations
   for comprehensive oceanographic research, coastal management, climate
   modeling, and future studies in the Bay of Bengal.},

Title = {The ozone hole measurements at the Indian station Maitri in Antarctica},
Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Stratospheric ozone is a trace gas of great importance as it filters
   harmful ultraviolet radiations reaching the earth surface. Since ozone
   influences temperature and dynamics of the stratosphere, it is also a
   climate-relevant gas by modifyimg the tropospheric temperature.
   Significant changes in the stratospheric ozone are, therefore, a concern
   for human health and climate. India has a dedicated polar research
   programme with two stations in Antarctica; Maitri (70.4 degrees 5, 11.4
   degrees E, since 1989) and Bharati (69.2 degrees 5, 76.2 degrees E,
   since 2012). Semi-regular measurements of total column ozone (TCO) are
   carried out to monitor the changes in the ozone layer there. Here, we
   use the available TCO measurements from Maitri in the winters of
   1999-2003 and 2006, to estimate the chemical ozone depletion for the
   first time there. We estimate the largest ozone loss (59\% or 180 DU) in
   2006, and smallest in 2002 and 1999 (44\% or 160 DU) among the winters;
   consistent with the meteorology, as the winter 2006 was the coldest and
   2002 was the warmest with the first-ever major sudden stratospheric
   warming over Antarctica. The Maitri ozone loss analysis is found to be
   representative for the whole Antarctica as assessed from the comparisons
   with the average TCO from all Antarctic stations and satellite overpass
   TCO observations. The study, henceforth, demonstrates the value and
   significance of continuous monitoring of the ozone hole at Maitri to
   assist the policy decisions such as the Montreal Protocol and its
   amendments and adjustments.},

Abstract = {Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to
   achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to
   the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study,
   three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting
   seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that
   was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on
   canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in
   intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards.
   A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for
   Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters.
   The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time
   elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system.
   The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In
   addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and
   row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum
   orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed
   significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was
   less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed
   on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the
   harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly
   effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was
   provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured
   orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective
   field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field
   capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in
   alley width for SHD olive harvester. A yield map was plotted using data
   that were acquired by a yield monitor, reflecting the yield gradient in
   spite of the larger differences between tree yields.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the experiences and results of the first GPS MOOC
   (Massive Open Online Course), including a worldwide laboratory involving
   thousands of participants.
   MOOCs have the potential to revolutionize education in the same way that
   the Internet has forever changed other industries. A MOOC is a free
   online course, typically with thousands of participants from all over
   the world. In this talk we describe the first GPS MOOC. This MOOC ``GPS:
   An Introduction to Satellite Navigation{''} was created by the authors
   for Stanford University, and is hosted by Coursera. The course ran for
   the first time in the last quarter of 2014, and will run again in 2015,
   starting shortly after the ION GNSS+ conference. Participation in 2014
   was astonishing: we had over 31,000 registrants from 192 different
   countries (for comparison: the UN has 193 member states). Of these
   registrants approximately six-thousand participated regularly in the
   class; three-thousand completed the whole course; and seventeen hundred
   participated in the handson labs.
   This MOOC was the first to make use of smartphones to create a worldwide
   laboratory for experiments conducted by the students. Since each
   smartphone contains a GNSS receiver, students could get hands-on
   experience, while at the same time collecting data on an unprecedented
   scale. The main idea of the laboratory was pedagogical: to teach the
   students about GNSS, and so the labs were conceived to be relatively
   simple. But the sheer scale of the class was such that we obtained very
   interesting results which we will present in this paper for the first
   time.
   The first lab studied GNSS accuracy, as experienced by smartphone users,
   both in the open and in urban environments. Open-sky GNSS accuracy with
   smartphones has often been claimed to be ``about 5 meters{''}, in fact
   this was the answer to an in-course quiz question in one of the
   lectures. In this lab, with over one thousand participants in one
   hundred countries, the measured mean accuracy, remarkably, came to 4.9
   meters. Even more interesting, the accuracy in urban areas showed a
   remarkable correlation with building height. So well correlated, in
   fact, that we are moved to propose a ``Law of Urban Multipath{''} that
   predicts GNSS position accuracy based on building height. We will
   explain this result in the paper, and show the data distributions
   supporting it.
   In the second lab, the students performed mission planning to predict
   when a particular satellite would pass (close to) overhead on one
   particular day. They then had to go outside at that time, and see if the
   GNSS receiver observed the satellite where it was expected. They
   recorded the time, their location, and where in the sky the satellite
   was observed. They then submitted this data online. Each student
   becoming part of a worldwide relay. As the data came in, they could tell
   who saw the satellite before them, and who would see it next. This was a
   memorable experience for everyone, linking people from a hundred
   different countries with no regard for borders or boundaries of any
   kind.
   In the third lab we returned to quantitative analysis of GNSS. Students,
   after learning about GNSS Front End analysis, compared the measured C/No
   in their phones to the expected value for a nominal design. Thus they
   characterized the RF performance of the GNSS in many of the world's most
   popular smartphones. Following this, they repeated the experiment in
   their homes, thus characterizing the signal loss through the different
   types of buildings. We collected this data and will present the results
   for the first time in this paper.
   We believe that this is the first time that experimental data like this
   has been collected on this scale. The results are interesting in their
   own right, while also a vision for what might be achieved with a
   worldwide team of highly motivated volunteers who will together collect
   data in more environments in a day than most of us will visit in a
   lifetime. Based on the success of this first MOOC, we are modifying the
   labs for the 2015 edition to collect more detailed data that will shed
   further light on the operation of GNSS worldwide. In the paper we will
   discuss the plans for future labs, and we welcome input from the ION
   community for ideas about what may be measureable, and what we can yet
   discover about our GNSS ecosystem.},

Title = {Wrong-Side Thoracentesis Lessons Learned From Root Cause Analysis},
Journal = {JAMA SURGERY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {149},
Number = {8},
Pages = {774-779},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Despite the recognized value of the Joint Commission's
   Universal Protocol and the implementation of time-outs, incorrect
   surgical procedures are still among the most common types of sentinel
   events and can have fatal consequences.
   OBJECTIVES To examine a root cause analysis database for reported
   wrong-side thoracenteses and to determine the contributing factors
   associated with their occurrence.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched the National Center for
   Patient Safety database for wrong-side thoracenteses performed in
   ambulatory clinics and hospital units other than the operating room
   reported from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Data extracted included patient factors,
   clinical features, team structure and function, adherence to bottom-line
   patient safety measures, complications, and outcomes.
   RESULTS Fourteen cases of wrong-side thoracenteses are identified.
   Contributing factors included failure to perform a time-out (n=12),
   missing indication of laterality on the patient's consent form (n=10),
   absence of a site mark on the patient's skin within the sterile field
   (n=12), and absent verification of medical images (n=7). Complications
   included pneumothoraces (n=4), hemorrhage (n=3), and death directly
   attributable to the wrong-side thoracentesis (n=2). Teamwork and
   communication failure, unawareness of existing policy, and a deficit in
   training and education were the most common root causes of wrong-side
   thoracentesis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Prevention of wrong-site procedures and
   accompanying patient harm outside the operating room requires adherence
   to the Universal Protocol and time-outs, effective teamwork, training
   and education, mentoring, and patient assessment for early detection of
   complications. The time-outs provide protected time and place for error
   detection and recovery.},

Title = {Heterogeneous accountingisation Accounting and inter-organisational
   cooperation in home care services},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1080-1112},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the effects of the increased
   influence of accounting on core values and practices within the services
   providing home care in Sweden a public sector setting involving
   inter-organisational cooperation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case study data were obtained primarily
   through semi-structured interviews with managers and front-line staff
   involved in home care.
   Findings - When accountingisation is extended to include
   inter-organisational cooperation, a form of heterogeneous
   accountingisation occurred in the home care services: an internal domain
   (with a low level of accountingisation) could be differentiated from an
   inter-organisational domain (with a high level of accountingisation).
   When the accounting-induced disturbances intensified, there was a
   redefinition of core values. In the internal domain, core values of
   pensioner-oriented focus and flexibility during service delivery
   persisted. In contrast, in the inter-organisational domain, core values
   had the legal boundaries of the organisation as their central
   foundation, standardisation was emphasised, and inter-organisational
   work practices were defined as the other organisation's responsibility.
   The findings also extend the research on absorption groups by indicating
   the rise of a new type of absorption process. Absorption was not
   undertaken by a few individuals, specialist work groups or satellite
   organisations, as described in the literature; instead, all front-line
   welfare professionals were involved in absorbing the accounting-induced
   disturbances when performing their tasks.
   Research limitations/implications - This case study research is
   context-specific and the meaning and consequences of accountingisation
   may differ within the public sector because of the status and strength
   of professional groups concerned.
   Originality/value - To date, research on accountingisation has primarily
   employed an intra-organisational perspective. This paper analyses
   accountingisation in an inter-organisational setting.},

Title = {Estimation of the Value of Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration Services under
   Different Scenarios in the Central China (the Qinling-Daba Mountain
   Area)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Qinling-Daba Mountain area is a transitional zone between north and
   south China and not much is known about its carbon storage, particularly
   its pool of soil organic carbon (SOC). Given this shortcoming, more
   reliable information regarding its SOC is needed. In light of this, we
   quantified above and below-ground carbon sinks using both the
   Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon
   cycle process model. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for
   carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios
   using the NPV model. Our results indicated that the net primary
   productivity (NPP) was lower in places with low density forests that
   were situated at high elevation. The spatial distribution of carbon
   storage depended on NPP production and litter decompositon, which
   reflected specific vegetation as well as temperature and moisture
   gradients. The lowest amounts of carbon storage were in the center of
   the Qinling Mountains and also partly in the Daba area, which is a
   location associated with sparse grassland. Contrastingly, the
   broad-leaved forested area showed the highest amount of carbon storage.
   NPV was positively correlated with discount rate and carbon prices, thus
   resulting in the highest values in the forests and grassland. The net
   present value of total soil carbon sequestration in the six scenarios in
   2015 was 3.555 b yuan, 3.621 b yuan, 5.421 b yuan, 5.579 b yuan, 7.530 b
   yuan, 7.929 b yuan; The net present value of total soil carbon
   sequestration in 6 scenarios in 2017 is 2.816 b yuan, 2.845 b yuan,
   4.361 b yuan, 4.468 b yuan, 6.144 b yuan, 6.338 b yuan (billion = 10(9);
   b; RMB is the legal currency of the China, and its unit is yuan, 1 euro
   = 7.7949 yuan, and 1 pound = 9.2590 yuan). Levying a carbon tax would be
   a notable option for decision makers as they develop carbon emission
   reduction policies. Given this, incorporating discount rates and carbon
   pricing would allow for more realistic value estimations of soil organic
   carbon. This approach would also provide a theoretical basis and
   underscore the practical significance for the government to set a
   reasonable carbon price.},

Abstract = {Oyster areas are widely used as species of biological indicator, and
   they are also the most important shellfish in terms of ecosystem
   economic valuation. Oysters are production on the west coast before 2007
   accounted for about 5 \% of the nation's total production, but the 2007
   Hebei Spirit oil spill caused production to plunge to less than 1 \%.
   Therefore, spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs are required to
   help local authorities define management strategies. In this study,
   Kompsat-2/3 was used to map oyster reef distribution and analyze the
   distribution of oyster reefs based on linear spctral unmixing in Hwangdo
   tidal flat. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions
   with a field spectroradiometer, was used to conduct linear spectral
   unmixing classifications on Kompsat-2/3 data. The classification result
   shows very high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 95 \% or more, and
   there were misclassifications in some areas. The most causes of
   misclassification are the similarity of spectral characteristics and the
   limitations of the spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite images.
   For this reason, it was difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs
   and area distributed with many macrobenthos, and small-young oyster
   reefs were difficult to classify due to very weak reflectivity. In
   addition, the sand bar, it was is difficult to distinguish between
   oyster reefs related to dead reefs and sandbars because of the high
   reflectivity of these areas in the imagery. As a result of analyzing the
   change in the oyster reef area, it increased in 2019 compared to that in
   2015. Especially, the oyster reef area increased in 30-50 \% sand
   content and decreased in 20-30 \% and 60-70 \%. The changes of sand
   sediment seem to affect the distribution of oyster reefs. This study may
   be useful for mapping the distribution of oyster reefs and understanding
   the spatial variation of their habitat.},

Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya is
   performed by integrating 28 causative factors on C-28(28) combinations
   on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression
   (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random
   forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the
   terrain is classified into `None' (with: 0.0 < LSI <= 0.17), `Low'
   (with: 0.17 < LSI <= 0.34), `Moderate' (with: 0.34 < LSI <= 0.51),
   `High' (with: 0.51 < LSI <= 0.68),'Very High' (with: 0.68 < LSI <= 0.85)
   and `Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated
   through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation
   analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing
   comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best
   integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of
   0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like
   population density, number of households, building types, building
   height and building density has demarketed approximately 21\% of the
   region under `Very High' to `Severe' socioeconomic risk zone while about
   36\% area are classified under `Very High' to `Severe' structural risk
   zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region.
   Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in
   the `Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein
   near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and
   microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified
   debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface
   conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure
   analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value
   that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is
   seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the `Low to Moderate' landslide
   susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the `High'
   landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the `Very High
   to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both
   gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability
   analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2)
   and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these
   parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison
   demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the `High to Severe'
   landslide susceptible zones.},

Title = {Landslide Susceptibility Assessment of a Part of the Western Ghats
   (India) Employing the AHP and F-AHP Models and Comparison with Existing
   Susceptibility Maps},
Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {Landslides are prevalent in the Western Ghats, and the incidences that
   happened in 2021 in the Koottickal area of the Kottayam district
   (Western Ghats) resulted in the loss of 10 lives. The objectives of this
   study are to assess the landslide susceptibility of the high-range local
   self-governments (LSGs) in the Kottayam district using the analytical
   hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-AHP (F-AHP) models and to compare the
   performance of existing landslide susceptible maps. This area never
   witnessed any massive landslides of this dimension, which warrants the
   necessity of relooking into the existing landslide-susceptible models.
   For AHP and F-AHP modeling, ten conditioning factors were selected:
   slope, soil texture, land use/land cover (LULC), geomorphology, road
   buffer, lithology, and satellite image-derived indices such as the
   normalized difference road landslide index (NDRLI), the normalized
   difference water index (NDWI), the normalized burn ratio (NBR), and the
   soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The landslide-susceptible zones
   were categorized into three: low, moderate, and high. The validation of
   the maps created using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   technique ascertained the performances of the AHP, F-AHP, and TISSA maps
   as excellent, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value above 0.80,
   and the NCESS map as acceptable, with an AUC value above 0.70. Though
   the difference is negligible, the map prepared using the TISSA model has
   better performance (AUC = 0.889) than the F-AHP (AUC = 0.872), AHP (AUC
   = 0.867), and NCESS (AUC = 0.789) models. The validation of maps
   employing other matrices such as accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE),
   and root mean square error (RMSE) also confirmed that the TISSA model
   (0.869, 0.226, and 0.122, respectively) has better performance, followed
   by the F-AHP (0.856, 0.243, and 0.147, respectively), AHP (0.855, 0.249,
   and 0.159, respectively), and NCESS (0.770, 0.309, and 0.177,
   respectively) models. The most landslide-inducing factors in this area
   that were identified through this study are slope, soil texture, LULC,
   geomorphology, and NDRLI. Koottickal, Poonjar-Thekkekara, Moonnilavu,
   Thalanad, and Koruthodu are the LSGs that are highly susceptible to
   landslides. The identification of landslide-susceptible areas using
   diversified techniques will aid decision-makers in identifying critical
   infrastructure at risk and alternate routes for emergency evacuation of
   people to safer terrain during an exigency.},

Abstract = {Low spring temperatures have been found to benefit mobile herbivores by
   reducing the rate of spring-flush, whereas high rainfall increases
   forage availability. Cold winters prove detrimental, by increasing
   herbivore thermoregulatory burdens. Here we examine the effects of
   temperature and rainfall variability on a temperate sedentary herbivore,
   the Eurasian beaver, Castor fiber, in terms of inter-annual variation in
   mean body weight and per territory offspring production. Data pertain to
   198 individuals, over 11years, using capture-mark-recapture. We use
   plant growth (tree cores) and fAPAR (a satellite-derived plant
   productivity index) to examine potential mechanisms through which
   weather conditions affect the availability and the seasonal phenology of
   beaver forage. Juvenile body weights were lighter after colder winters,
   whereas warmer spring temperatures were associated with lighter adult
   body weights, mediated by enhanced green-up phenology rates.
   Counter-intuitively, we observed a negative association between rainfall
   and body weight in juveniles and adults, and also with reproductive
   success. Alder, Alnus incana, (n=68) growth rings (principal beaver food
   in the study area) exhibited a positive relationship with rainfall for
   trees growing at elevations >2m above water level, but a negative
   relationship for trees growing <0.5m. We deduce that temperature
   influences beavers at the landscape scale via effects on spring green-up
   phenology and winter thermoregulation. Rainfall influences beavers at
   finer spatial scales through topographical interactions with plant
   growth, where trees near water level, prone to water logging, producing
   poorer forage in wetter years. Unlike most other herbivores, beavers are
   an obligate aquatic species that utilize a restricted central-place'
   foraging range, limiting their ability to take advantage of better
   forage growth further from water during wetter years. With respect to
   anthropogenic climate change, interactions between weather variables,
   plant phenology and topography on forage growth are instructive, and
   consequently warrant examination when developing conservation management
   strategies for populations of medium to large herbivores.},

Title = {Measuring the U.S. outdoor recreation economy, 2012-2016},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND
   MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper summarizes the methodology and results of newly-released
   federal statistics describing the U.S. outdoor recreation economy. These
   new statistics show that outdoor recreation represented 2.2\% of the
   U.S. economy from 2012 to 2016, similar in size to the utilities and
   mining industries. Boating/fishing contributed \$38.2 billion to gross
   output in 2016, followed by game areas (includes golfing and tennis)
   (\$36.3 billion) and RVing (\$30.8 billion). Additionally, more than 4.5
   million jobs were generated by the outdoor recreation economy in 2016,
   resulting in \$213.6 billion of compensation paid to U.S. workers. These
   new statistics provide for the first time a comprehensive and consistent
   measure of the value of outdoor recreation to the U.S. economy. Any
   future updates to these statistics may consider adding regional data and
   a longer time series to provide even more meaningful statistics to
   researchers and policymakers.
   Management implications: New statistics provide estimates of the outdoor
   recreation economy from an unbiased source: the outdoor recreation
   satellite account (ORSA). The ORSA provides a solid framework to measure
   the outdoor economy and can be used
   -To show the significance of the outdoor recreation economy
   -To compare its relevance with other economic sectors
   -To examine the growth of the outdoor recreation economy over time in a
   detailed manner
   -To pay attention to specific outdoor recreation activities and their
   respective changes over time.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES. Public funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
   Program has never been sufficient to serve more than a small minority of
   income-eligible households. Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
   funding has not increased with recent rapidly rising energy costs, harsh
   winter conditions, or higher child poverty rates. Although a national
   performance goal for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is to
   increase the percentage of recipient households having <>= 1 member <= 5
   years of age, the association of income-eligible households' receipt of
   the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program with indicators of
   well-being in young children has not been evaluated previously. The goal
   of the current study was to evaluate the association between a family's
   participation or nonparticipation in the Low Income Home Energy
   Assistance Program and the anthropometric status and health of their
   young children.
   METHODS. In the ongoing Children's Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Project
   from June 1998 through December 2004, caregivers with children < 3 years
   of age in 2 emergency departments and 3 primary care clinics in 5 urban
   sites participated in cross-sectional surveys regarding household
   demographics, child's lifetime history of hospitalizations, and, for the
   past 12 months, household public assistance program participation and
   household food insecurity, measured by the US Food Security Scale. This
   scale, in accordance with established procedures, classifies households
   as food insecure if they report that they cannot afford enough
   nutritious food for all of the members to lead active, healthy lives. On
   the day of the interview, children's weight, length, and whether the
   children were admitted acutely to the hospital from the emergency
   departments were documented. The study sample consisted only of Low
   Income Home Energy Assistance Program income-eligible renter households
   without private insurance who also participated in >= 1 other
   means-tested program.
   RESULTS. In this sample of 7074 caregivers, 16\% of families received
   the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, similar to the national
   rate of 17\%. Caregivers who received the Low Income Home Energy
   Assistance Program were more likely to be single (63\% vs 54\%), US born
   (77\% vs 68\%), and older (mother's mean age: 28.1 vs 26.7 years) but
   were less likely to be employed (44\% vs 47\%). Households who received
   the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were more likely to
   receive Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
   (85\% vs 80\%), Supplemental Security Income (13\% vs 9\%), Temporary
   Assistance for Needy Families (38\% vs 23\%), and food stamps (59\% vs
   37\%) and to live in subsidized housing (38\% vs 19\%) compared with
   nonrecipients. Children in families participating in the Low Income Home
   Energy Assistance Program were older than children in nonparticipating
   families (13.6 vs 12.5 months), were less likely to be uninsured (5\% vs
   9\%), and were more likely to have had a low birth weight <= 2500 g
   (17\% vs 14\%). Families participating in the Low Income Home Energy
   Assistance Program reported more household food insecurity (24\% vs
   20\%) There were no significant group differences between recipients and
   nonrecipients in caregiver's education or child's gender. After
   controlling for these potentially confounding variables, including
   receipt of other means-tested programs, compared with children in
   recipient households, those in nonrecipient households had greater
   adjusted odds of being at aggregate nutritional risk for growth
   problems, defined as children with weight-for-age below the 5th
   percentile or weight-for-height below the 10th percentile, with
   significantly lower mean weight-for-age z scores calculated from age-
   and gender-specific values from the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention 2000 reference data. However, in adjusted analyses, children
   aged 2 to 3 years in recipient households were not more likely to be
   overweight (BMI > 95th percentile) than those in nonrecipient
   households. Rates of age- adjusted lifetime hospitalization excluding
   birth and the day of the interview did not differ between Low Income
   Home Energy Assistance Program recipient groups. Among the 4445 of 7074
   children evaluated in the 2 emergency departments, children from
   eligible households not receiving the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
   Program had greater adjusted odds than those in recipient households of
   acute hospital admission on the day of the interview.
   CONCLUSIONS. Even within a low-income renter sample, Low Income Home
   Energy Assistance Program benefits seem to reach families at the highest
   social and medical risk with more food insecurity and higher rates of
   low birth-weight children. Nevertheless, after adjustment for
   differences in background risk, living in a household receiving the Low
   Income Home Energy Assistance Program is associated with less
   anthropometric evidence of undernutrition, no evidence of increased
   overweight, and lower odds of acute hospitalization from an emergency
   department visit among young children in low-income renter households
   compared with children in comparable households not receiving the Low
   Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The Low Income Home Energy
   Assistance Program in many states shuts down early each winter when
   their funding is exhausted. From a clinical perspective, pediatric
   health providers caring for children from impoverished families should
   consider encouraging families of these children to apply for the Low
   Income Home Energy Assistance Program early in the season before funding
   is depleted. From a public policy perspective, although this
   cross-sectional study design can only demonstrate associations and not
   causation, these findings suggest that, particularly as fuel costs and
   children's poverty rates increase, expanding the Low Income Home Energy
   Assistance Program funding and meeting the national Low Income Home
   Energy Assistance Program performance goal of increasing the percentage
   of recipient households with young children might potentially benefit
   such children's growth and health.},

Abstract = {The satellite imagery data naturally exists as raster data. Useful
   information that can empower the domain experts to improve their
   decision-making abilities lies hidden in this data. However, finding
   this hidden knowledge is non-trivial and challenging due to the lack of
   open source integrated software to discover knowledge from raster data.
   In particular, existing open-source general-purpose data mining
   libraries, such as Knime {[}1], Mahout {[}3], Weka {[}5], Sci-kit {[}4],
   and SPMF {[}2], are inadequate to find knowledge hidden in raster
   datasets.
   In this talk, we present rasterMiner an integrated open-source software
   to discover knowledge from raster imagery datasets. It currently
   provides unsupervised learning techniques, such as pattern mining and
   clustering, to discover knowledge hidden in raster data. The key
   features of our software are as follows: (i) provides four pattern
   mining algorithms and four clustering algorithms to discover knowledge
   from raster data, (ii) Our software also provides ``elbow method{''} to
   choose an appropriate k value for k-mean and k-means++ algorithms, (iii)
   Our software presents an integrated GUI that can facilitate the domain
   experts to choose algorithm(s) of their choice, (iv) Our software can
   also be accessed as a python-library, (v) The knowledge discovered by
   our software can be stored in standard formats so that the generated
   knowledge can be visualized using any GIS software.},

Abstract = {Vegetation species maps are useful for forestry managements and
   environmental ecological study. From the forestry management, broad and
   conifer leaf forest should be mapped. In addition to them, land-cover
   mapping data with high resolution is needed as validation data sets for
   low resolution's land-cover mapping results. SGLI sensor on board GCOM-C
   satellite, which will be launched in 2014, has 250m spatial resolution
   and it's data will be used for making global land-cover data set. ALOS
   satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor and PRISM sensor.
   AVNIR-2 sensor has four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830nm with 10-m
   spatial resolution. PRISMsensor has panchromatic band from 520nm to 770
   nm with 2.5m spatial resolution. If use the both of image, pseudo high
   spatial multi-spectal image can be processed. Because of the spatial
   resolution and multi-spectral information, these sensor data are
   expected to useful for making high resolution land-cover data set. We
   have developed Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM)(Zhang, L.F.
   et. al, 2006 (Zhang et al., 2006)) and Modified Vegetation Index based
   on UPDM (MVIUPD)(Zhang, L. F. et. al, 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) and
   Xiong, Y., 2005 (?)) for satellite sensor data analysis for land cover
   mapping and vegetation monitoring. In the UPDM method, three
   coefficients of water, vegetation and soil is calculated using three
   standard patterns of water, vegetation and soil. One of this method's
   characteristics is the UPDM coefficients from different sensors for the
   same object being same as each other. The capability of vegetation
   species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR-2 data and UPDM method.
   Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest,
   orchard and grass land can be classified using AVNIR-2 summer and winter
   data. In this study, AVNIR-2 and PRISM data are used for vegetation
   types mapping using universal pattern decomposition method. Firstly, the
   pan-sharpen image was processed using AVNIR-2 and PRISM data. Each
   band's Digital Number (DN) value of AVNIR-2's band is calculated using
   DN of PRISM and AVNIR-2. The reflectance of AVNIR-2 is calculated from
   calculated DN values. UPDM method is applied to the set of re-calculated
   reflectance. Using the coefficients of UPDM and vegetation index,
   evergreen forest and deciduous forest were classified using two seasonal
   data. These results are compared with forest resource information. The
   tendency was agree with each other, although detailed validation is
   needed. From these results, the UPDM method can be applied to
   pan-sharpen image and the pan-sharpen image can be used for vegetation
   type classification. In the near future, calculation methods with
   retaining the original reflectance should be improved.},

Abstract = {Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of
   transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with
   wireless Internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways.
   If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be
   enormous.
   This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group
   endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G
   and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of
   the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG
   (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed
   access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals
   cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on
   this planet.
   While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the
   world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination
   to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost
   of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin
   down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important.
   But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the
   goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can
   bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create
   large global projects and influence the network service providers,
   manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU
   working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the
   relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes
   into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach
   to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those
   living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and
   industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are
   available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems
   level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable.
   In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to
   be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer
   interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who
   are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the
   devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible
   spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to
   increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable
   deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is
   intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology
   gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is
   affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the
   targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative
   business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the
   long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural
   population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE)
   Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service
   providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation
   Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting
   from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.},

Title = {Evaluating the climate and air quality impacts of short-lived pollutants},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},

Abstract = {This paper presents a summary of the work done within the European
   Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ECLIPSE (Evaluating the
   Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants). ECLIPSE had
   a unique systematic concept for designing a realistic and effective
   mitigation scenario for short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs; methane,
   aerosols and ozone, and their precursor species) and quantifying its
   climate and air quality impacts, and this paper presents the results in
   the context of this overarching strategy. The first step in ECLIPSE was
   to create a new emission inventory based on current legislation (CLE)
   for the recent past and until 2050. Substantial progress compared to
   previous work was made by including previously unaccounted types of
   sources such as flaring of gas associated with oil production, and wick
   lamps. These emission data were used for present-day reference
   simulations with four advanced Earth system models (ESMs) and six
   chemistry transport models (CTMs). The model simulations were compared
   with a variety of ground-based and satellite observational data sets
   from Asia, Europe and the Arctic. It was found that the models still
   underestimate the measured seasonality of aerosols in the Arctic but to
   a lesser extent than in previous studies. Problems likely related to the
   emissions were identified for northern Russia and India, in particular.
   To estimate the climate impacts of SLCPs, ECLIPSE followed two paths of
   research: the first path calculated radiative forcing (RF) values for a
   large matrix of SLCP species emissions, for different seasons and
   regions independently. Based on these RF calculations, the Global
   Temperature change Potential metric for a time horizon of 20 years
   (GTP(20)) was calculated for each SLCP emission type. This climate
   metric was then used in an integrated assessment model to identify all
   emission mitigation measures with a beneficial air quality and
   short-term (20-year) climate impact. These measures together defined a
   SLCP mitigation (MIT) scenario. Compared to CLE, the MIT scenario would
   reduce global methane (CH4) and black carbon (BC) emissions by about 50
   and 80 \%, respectively. For CH4, measures on shale gas production,
   waste management and coal mines were most important. For non-CH4 SLCPs,
   elimination of high-emitting vehicles and wick lamps, as well as
   reducing emissions from gas flaring, coal and biomass stoves,
   agricultural waste, solvents and diesel engines were most important.
   These measures lead to large reductions in calculated surface
   concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. We estimate that in the
   EU, the loss of statistical life expectancy due to air pollution was 7.5
   months in 2010, which will be reduced to 5.2 months by 2030 in the CLE
   scenario. The MIT scenario would reduce this value by another 0.9 to 4.3
   months. Substantially larger reductions due to the mitigation are found
   for China (1.8 months) and India (11-12 months). The climate metrics
   cannot fully quantify the climate response. Therefore, a second research
   path was taken. Transient climate ensemble simulations with the four
   ESMs were run for the CLE and MIT scenarios, to determine the climate
   impacts of the mitigation. In these simulations, the CLE scenario
   resulted in a surface temperature increase of 0.70 +/- 0.14 K between
   the years 2006 and 2050. For the decade 2041-2050, the warming was
   reduced by 0.22 +/- 0.
   07 K in the MIT scenario, and this result was in almost exact agreement
   with the response calculated based on the emission metrics (reduced
   warming of 0.22 +/- 0.09 K). The metrics calculations suggest that
   non-CH4 SLCPs contribute similar to 22 \% to this response and CH4 78
   \%. This could not be fully confirmed by the transient simulations,
   which attributed about 90 \% of the temperature response to CH4
   reductions. Attribution of the observed temperature response to non-CH4
   SLCP emission reductions and BC specifically is hampered in the
   transient simulations by small forcing and co-emitted species of the
   emission basket chosen. Nevertheless, an important conclusion is that
   our mitigation basket as a whole would lead to clear benefits for both
   air quality and climate. The climate response from BC reductions in our
   study is smaller than reported previously, possibly because our study is
   one of the first to use fully coupled climate models, where unforced
   variability and sea ice responses cause relatively strong temperature
   fluctuations that may counteract (and, thus, mask) the impacts of small
   emission reductions. The temperature responses to the mitigation were
   generally stronger over the continents than over the oceans, and with a
   warming reduction of 0.44 K (0.39-0.49) K the largest over the Arctic.
   Our calculations suggest particularly beneficial climate responses in
   southern Europe, where surface warming was reduced by about 0.3 K and
   precipitation rates were increased by about 15 (6-21) mm yr(-1) (more
   than 4 \% of total precipitation) from spring to autumn. Thus, the
   mitigation could help to alleviate expected future drought and water
   shortages in the Mediterranean area. We also report other important
   results of the ECLIPSE project.},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land
   cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage
   are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to
   maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be
   considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring
   habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the
   connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index
   (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for
   restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances
   among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas
   surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of
   probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds
   and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting
   SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao
   Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images
   for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land
   cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the
   SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also
   a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover
   category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover
   category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban
   (10.6\%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4\%). Although the
   land cover class ``wood sites{''} increased, the data of SIR revealed
   that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both
   decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor
   increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions
   where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able
   to use this model to determine local patches of high value for
   conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects.

Title = {The feasibility study of offshore wind energy potential in Kijal,
   Malaysia: the new alternative energy source exploration in Malaysia},
Journal = {ENERGY EXPLORATION \& EXPLOITATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {329-344},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many countries have been endeavoring to explore and exploit
   the offshore wind energy in terms of solving the problem of limitations
   of onshore wind energy. Wind energy is one of potential alternative for
   generating electricity in Malaysia. The offshore wind speed is better
   compared to onshore, so there is more potential contribution by offshore
   wind power in terms of electricity generation. This paper provides a
   summary of the offshore wind resources of the Kijal, Malaysia by
   analyzing the QuikSCAT satellite data which is available and can be
   downloaded from the WindPRO application. Based on these datasets, wind
   resources are assessed, and economical efficiency is evaluated by means
   of the expected capacity factor. Research was conducted using WindPRO
   and WAsP software to assess the potential of wind energy along the South
   China Sea in Kijal, Terengganu. Seven models of the wind turbines with
   different rated power; 110kW, 225kW, 275kW, 600kW, 850kW, 1000kW and
   1250kW are taken for energy and economic feasibility analyses. The wind
   turbine with rated power 850 kW was indicated as the best wind turbine
   for installation in Kijal based on its best capacity factor, 26.8\% In
   economical aspect, Malaysia does not have Feed in Tariff (FiT) rates for
   offshore wind projects, thus the range of predicted FiT rates, RM 0.30
   to RM 2.00 were tested by using Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback
   Period (PBP) calculation. Finally, the conducive FiT rates for wind
   projects with secured investment were identified and the rates were in
   range RM 0.80 to RM 1.38. The overall results suggest that the wind
   energy has a bright future for use as an alternative source for
   generating electricity in Kijal, Malaysia.},

Title = {Factor analysis for aerosol optical depth and its prediction from the
   perspective of land-use change},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {458-469},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents the non-stationarity and autocorrelation (with a
   Moran's I index score of 0.75) of the MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical
   depth (AOD) of the Wuhan agglomeration (WHA) in Central China, using
   geographically weighted regression (GWR) to identify the spatial
   relationships between AOD and its impact factors. In addition to the
   socio-economic factors, i.e., GDP and population, vegetation cover,
   elevation, land-use density and landscape metrics are also considered.
   Faced with the rapid process of urbanization and the impact of land use
   change on AOD, which has been confirmed in previous studies, we propose
   an AOD prediction method, combining a land-use change simulation model,
   a cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model, and spatial
   relationships built by GWR to represent the spatial distribution of AOD
   in 2030. The results suggest that the GWR model is able to address the
   spatially varying relationships, with an R-squared value, corrected
   Akaike's information criterion (AICc), and standard residual better than
   those of the ordinary least squares (OLS) model. Land-use simulation,
   with an accuracy of 89.76\%, indicates that an increase in the built-up
   area and a decrease in the forest area will be the major trends of
   land-use change and will lead to increased AOD. The AOD simulation
   results indicate that the most developed areas, i.e., the cities of
   Wuhan and Huangshi, will be the AOD increase hot spots in the WHA. This
   study provides an alternative method to identify the varying spatial
   relationships between AOD and its impact factors. A spatial prediction
   method for AOD is developed from the perspective of land-use change,
   which will help land-use planners in decision making.},

Title = {Managing Water Level for Large Migratory Fish at the Poyang Lake Outlet:
   Implications Based on Habitat Suitability and Connectivity},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {River-lake interaction is important for maintaining biodiversity, yet it
   is vulnerable to hydrological alteration. The connectivity of the
   channel connecting Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River not only ensures
   the regular migration of fish but also makes Poyang Lake a feeding and
   fattening ground for them. Unfortunately, human activities have
   dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions of Poyang Lake, which
   is experiencing severe drought due to the obvious decline in the water
   level in autumn and winter, especially since 2003. However, the possible
   impacts of the changes in the water level on the habitats of migratory
   fish remain unclear due to the limitation of traditional techniques in
   spatiotemporal analysis. Here, we combined a hydrodynamic model and
   habitat suitability model to simulate variations in the suitable habitat
   area and their connectivity under different water-level conditions. The
   conditions for the migration pathway of the target fish were obtained by
   a hydroacoustic survey using the Simrad EY60 echosounder. The results
   showed that the change in water level will significantly affect the
   spatiotemporal change in the suitable habitats and their connectivity.
   In particular, we found the existence of two thresholds that play a
   dominant role in illuminating the connectivity of effective suitable
   habitats (HC). Firstly, the maximum value of the weighted usable area
   (WUA) and HC can be achieved when the water level is more than 16 m.
   Secondly, when the water level is between 10 and 16 m, the changes in
   the HC are sensitive and rapid, and the area flooded at this stage is
   called the sensitive area. HC is a crucial element in fish migration and
   habitat conditions. Under the condition of continuous drought in the
   middle reaches of the Yangtze River, our research contributes to
   clarifying the influence of water level on key habitats for fish and
   optimizes the practice of river-lake ecological management.},

Title = {Detecting collective behaviour in animal relocation data, with
   application to migrating caribou},

Abstract = {1. Collective behaviour can allow populations to have emergent responses
   to uncertain environments, driven by simple interactions among nearby
   individuals. High-throughput ethological studies, where individual
   behaviour is closely observed in each member of a population (typically
   in the laboratory or by simulation), have revealed that collective
   behaviour in populations requires only rudimentary cognitive abilities
   in individuals and could therefore represent a widespread adaptation to
   life in an uncertain world. However, the ecological significance of
   collective behaviour is not yet well understood, as most studies to date
   have been confined to specialized situations that allow intensive
   monitoring of individual behaviour.
   2. Here, we describe a way to screen for collective behaviour in
   ecological data that is sampled at a coarser resolution than the
   underlying behavioural processes. We develop and test the method in the
   context of a well-studied model for collective movement in a noisy
   environmental gradient. The large-scale distribution patterns associated
   with collective behaviour are difficult to distinguish from the
   aggregated responses of independent individuals in this setting because
   independent individuals also align to track the gradient. However, we
   show that collective idiosyncratic deviations from the mean gradient
   direction have high predictive value for detecting collective behaviour.
   We describe a method of testing for these deviations using the average
   normalized velocity of the population.
   3. We demonstrate the method using data from satellite tracking collars
   on the migration patterns of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), recovering
   evidence that collective behaviour is a key driver of caribou migration
   patterns. We find moreover that the relative importance of collective
   behaviour fluctuates seasonally, concurrent with the timing of migration
   and reproduction.
   4. Collective behaviour is a potentially widespread dynamic property of
   populations that can, in some cases, be detected in coarsely sampled
   ecological data.},

Title = {A design of real-time unipath polarization imaging system based on
   Wollaston prism},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {A real-time polarization imaging system employing the Wollaston prism
   and a single charge-coupled device (CCD) chip covering a wavelength
   range of 400-650 nm is proposed to avoid the false polarization
   information from dynamic scenes in non-real-time polarization detection
   imaging method. An architecture consisting of telescope lens,
   collimation lens, Wollaston prism, the imaging lens and a single CCD
   chip is employed in the system. The telescope lens is used to focus the
   incoming light on an intermediate image. And after collimation, the beam
   is angularly separated by the Wollaston prism. Two beams corresponding
   to ordinary light and extraordinary light are subsequently focused on
   the CCD plane via the imaging lens. The telescope lens is designed to
   have a telecentric structure in the imaging space, and the invert of
   which is used as the collimation lens, the completely symmetrical
   structure design is used to reduce the influence of aberrations. More
   abundant details from this system can be obtained by using matched image
   post-processing strategy, which is beneficial to high-quality target
   detection with enhanced working distance and improved environment
   adaptability. After joint-designing and optimization, the system
   modulation transfer function value at cutoff frequency is higher than
   0.55, and the root-mean-square radius of the system is less than 5.3 mu
   m, which is smaller than the pixel size of the CCD detector.
   Additionally, the lateral chromatic aberration of the system is much
   smaller than the diameter of airy disk, and the absolute values of all
   kinds of aberrations are kept smaller than 0.02 at the same time. The
   calculation results show that all the aberrations are mostly corrected.
   The system imaging is numerically modeled and analyzed, and it is
   demonstrated that two intensity images with perpendicular polarization
   states appear adjacently on the CCD plane simultaneously in the imaging
   simulation. One image is formed with the fraction of the backscattered
   light polarized parallelly to the incident light, and the other with
   light polarized orthogonally to the incidence, indicating that the
   expected design is accomplished. Compared with the traditional
   amplitude-split polarization imaging system, the proposed real-time
   polarization imaging system shows that the improved performance for
   real-time detection with promoted power efficiency, spatial resolution,
   and the light crosstalk in focal plane is well handled. Moreover, the
   joint design of the whole system can compensate for the distortion
   aberration in the vertical direction of the CCD detector, which means
   that a further improvement of image quality can be expected. The
   proposed system has a promising perspective in the fields of underwater
   imaging detection, astronomical observation, remote sensing, biological
   tissues inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate acquisition of crop area is of great significance
   for monitoring crop growth and estimation of crop yields. And it's
   important for strengthening agricultural management, ensuring food
   security and supply of agricultural products. The combination of remote
   sensing data with traditional sampling methods is an effective way to
   monitor and estimate crop area on a large scale. The traditional
   sampling method, on the basis of traditional statistics theory which
   studies the laws of random variables, requires that the sampling units
   should satisfy the principle of mutual independence. However, the
   regional crops, which are affected by natural conditions and
   socioeconomic factors, are often spatial variable. There is no report on
   whether and how spatial variability will influence the sampling
   efficiency of crop acreage. Therefor the further improvement of sampling
   efficiency is limited. To solve this problem, a variation function model
   was constructed with the area ratio between maize or rice and sampling
   units as object variable on 10 sampling unit scales combining remote
   sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods with
   Dehui, Jilin as study area. Selecting base value as index for spatial
   variability within the sampling unit, the effect of sampling unit scales
   on spatial variability of maize and rice were quantitatively analyzed.
   Three commonly used sampling schemes (random sampling, systematic
   sampling and stratified sampling) were selected for sample selection,
   overall extrapolation and error estimation. The sampling efficiency was
   quantitatively evaluated using overall relative error (r) of the
   sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total
   estimate and the sample size (n) on different sampling unit scales. The
   results show that the spatial variability of maize and rice decreases
   with the increase of the sampling unit scale. The range of base value is
   {[}0.15, 0.20] and {[}0.05, 0.14] for maize and wheat respectively.
   Using the three sampling methods to extrapolate the maize and rice area
   separately: 1) Under the same sampling ratio, the relative sampling
   errors of the two crops' area estimations gradually increase with the
   decrease of spatial variability (the sampling unit size increases), the
   coefficient of variation also shows an increasing trend, and the
   sampling accuracy and extrapolation stability is affected by spatial
   variability; 2) The relative error in estimation of the two crop areas
   varies with the sampling method,when using simple random sampling and
   systematic sampling, the relative error of the two crops was within the
   range of (1`)/0, 50\%) and (0.5\%, 40\%), and the coefficient of
   variation was limited to (1\%, 75 A) and In the range of (1\%, 88\%),
   the relative errors at all scales were limited to 10\% or less with
   stratified sampling, and the fluctuations of the coefficient of
   variation were small (both within 0.3\% and 20\%). Therefore, the
   stratification was selected. Sampling is the best sampling method; 3)
   When the sampling method is determined, the sampling ratio is the main
   factor determining the sampling efficiency.
   As the sampling ratio increases, the rate of change of the relative
   error of the two crop area estimators gradually decreases, when the
   sampling fraction reaches S\%, The relative error is basically limited
   to 5\%, and the coefficient of variation is stable within 12\% On this
   basis, the effect of increasing the sampling ratio to increase the
   sampling progress is minimal; 4) According to the conclusions of 2) and
   3), Stratified sampling method is used to extrapolate crop area by 5\%
   sampling ratio. The sampling efficiency decreases with the increase of
   sampling unit size. When the sampling unit size is limited within
   3500mx3500m, the overall sampling satisfies 95\% sampling accuracy
   requirements., And the coefficient of variation is stable within 7\%,
   the stability of the extrapolation of the area is also high; 5) Based on
   the above research conclusions, the quantitative evaluation sampling
   efficiency scheme and the optimal sampling model composed of the
   combination of sampling unit scale (spatial variability), sampling
   fraction, extrapolated total relative error, and variation coefficient
   were finally obtained. This study provides a reference for the design of
   a rational spatial sampling schemes of spatial variable crops.},

Title = {Improved Classification Models to Distinguish Natural from Anthropic Oil
   Slicks in the Gulf of Mexico: Seasonality and Radarsat-2 Beam Mode
   Effects under a Machine Learning Approach},

Abstract = {Distinguishing between natural and anthropic oil slicks is a challenging
   task, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where these events can be
   simultaneously observed and recognized as seeps or spills. In this
   study, a powerful data analysis provided by machine learning (ML)
   methods was employed to develop, test, and implement a classification
   model (CM) to distinguish an oil slick source (OSS) as natural or
   anthropic. A robust database containing 4916 validated oil samples,
   detected using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was employed for this
   task. Six ML algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural
   networks (ANN), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes
   (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR).
   Using RF, the global CM achieved a maximum accuracy value of 73.15. An
   innovative approach evaluated how external factors, such as seasonality,
   satellite configurations, and the synergy between them, limit or improve
   OSS predictions. To accomplish this, specific classification models
   (SCMs) were derived from the global ones (CMs), tuning the best
   algorithms and parameters according to different scenarios. Median
   accuracies revealed winter and spring to be the best seasons and ScanSAR
   Narrow B (SCNB) as the best beam mode. The maximum median accuracy to
   distinguish seeps from spills was achieved in winter using SCNB (83.05).
   Among the tested algorithms, RF was the most robust, with a better
   performance in 81\% of the investigated scenarios. The accuracy
   increment provided by the well-fitted models may minimize the confusion
   between seeps and spills. This represents a concrete contribution to
   reducing economic and geologic risks derived from exploration activities
   in offshore areas. Additionally, from an operational standpoint,
   specific models support specialists to select the best SAR products and
   seasons for new acquisitions, as well as to optimize performances
   according to the available data.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to develop a methodological approach to the
   problem of a quantitative assessment of the technical level (technical
   excellence) of geostationary telecommunication satellites (GTS). The
   technical level indicator is a quantitative measure for assessing the
   perfection of the design of a product and the quality of products
   (services) produced with its use. This is an important technical and
   economic indicator of experimental design work. The value of the
   technical level indicator is one of the determining factors in the
   competitiveness of the created space system. The paper discusses the
   existing methodological approaches to the quantitative assessment of the
   technical level of science-intensive and technically complex products.
   We present a new approach to determine the composition of technical
   performance markers for calculating the GTS technical level indicator
   allowing a formal description of the beneficial effect and a logical
   scheme for quantifying the technical level. The methodological approach
   to calculate the degree of influence of technical efficiency indicators
   on the value of the beneficial effect of the use of GTS is stated as
   well. It is based on a mathematical model of the hierarchy analysis
   introduced by T Saaty, complemented by us with mathematical models for
   the best consideration of GTS technical features. It allowed us to
   ensure control of errors and contradictions in expert judgments involved
   in the preparation of initial data of =measurable or hardly measurable
   techno-economic indicators of GTS. Due to the higher level of
   formalization of the process of quantifying the technical level and the
   application of mathematical methods used in modern decision theory, the
   developed methodological approach serves to improve the quality of
   calculations significantly and to reduce the influence of the subjective
   factor in determining the value of the technical level indicator. Based
   on the above, we developed a method for quantitative assessment of the
   GTS technical level that meets the modern requirements.},

Abstract = {In agriculture, soil and crop conditions change from day to day and
   throughout the growing season. Agricultural targets also vary spatially
   with differences observed from field to field, as well as within
   individual fields. The heterogeneity of corn-growing conditions in
   Mexico makes accurate data for crop type, crop condition and crop yield
   prediction difficult to obtain. Yield predictions are needed by the
   federal government to estimate, ahead of harvest time, the amount of
   corn required to be imported in order to meet the expected domestic
   shortfall. In this project a methodology for the estimation of corn
   yield ahead of harvest time is developed which uses radar and optical
   remote sensing and which specifically considers the corn-growing
   situation in Central Mexico. Radar based crop type classification
   requires data sets with multiple polarizations. Recent research to
   assess relative classification accuracies of multi-polarized
   combinations for target crops using airborne data has been reported. In
   addition to identifying crop type and variety, identifying crop growth
   stage is valuable. Crop condition, loosely defined as the vigor or
   health of a crop in a particular growth stage, is related to crop
   productivity and yield; however, the relationship is complex. Main crop
   condition indicators include biomass, height, leaf area and contents (if
   plant water, chlorophyll and nitrogen. Crop-type and crop-condition
   mapping are among the applications that are expected to benefit the most
   from the technical enhancements embodied by RADARSAT-2. The potential of
   RADARSAT-1 data for these applications has been rated as ``limited{''},
   whereas for RADARSAT-2 data this potential is anticipated to be
   ``strong{''}. The Science and Operational Applications Research for
   RADARSAT-2 Program (SOAR) is promoting the evaluation of Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities by providing images to selected
   research projects which include the present one.
   The objectives of this project are: a) use RADARSAT-2 data and optical
   data to determine cultivated areas and monitor crop condition for
   obtaining better estimations of crop yield; b) obtain polarization
   signatures from RADARSAT-2 data for corn and relate these to Leaf Area
   Index and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) crop parameters and
   vegetation indexes, to establish indicators of crop condition and
   produce estimates for crop yield; c) use field data collected for three
   key corn crop growth stages over 300 pilot plots during 2001-2006, and
   increase the number of plots to build a database to support accuracy
   studies using RADARSAT-2 data.
   The expected benefits of this project are: to obtain knowledge about
   crop type, crop condition and crop yield with better accuracy than with
   current methodologies; to support national corn farmers associations; to
   design agriculture related activities within State agriculture plans; to
   support the corn product industry and aid government decision making.
   Relevant results and economical impact will imply operational usage of
   RADARSAT- 2 data in the agricultural sector in Mexico.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {An extensive literature review on clinical trials and economic studies
   published on the use of IFN-alpha as adjuvant therapy in stage II - III
   (AJCC 1992) malignant melanoma was performed. Large clinical trials with
   sufficient follow-up were selected to assess the efficacy.
   Medico-economic studies, based on the results of several of these
   trials, were analysed to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratios of IFN
   in this disease. IFN-alpha demonstrated efficacy as adjuvant therapy in
   malignant melanoma with high-dose regimens in patients with overt
   regional nodal disease (so-called high-risk patients) and with low-dose
   regimens in stage IIA and -B patients without clinically detectable
   nodes (so-called intermediate risk patients). This efficacy was
   associated with high rates of severe side effects using a high-dose
   regimen. Based on these assumptions, economic analyses performed in
   different settings and using several methods to extrapolate clinical
   results are producing similar results of extra costs for IFN associated
   with a medical benefit. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios provided
   are (< US\$50,000 per life year gained) in the range of current and
   widely used medical strategies in different diseases and settings. This
   should allow the recommendation of the use of IFN-a therapy in malignant
   melanoma, using high doses in high-risk patients and low doses in
   intermediate-risk patients. In the final decision of whether or not to
   treat, however, the patient has to be informed that IFN will probably
   only delay events, with the possibility of any curative effect being
   uncertain. This limited effect has to be balanced with the severe impact
   on quality of life of high-dose regimen and with the fact that many
   patients in whom low doses are indicated would not recur in the absence
   of treatment. It is also clear that patients with only a positive
   sentinel node are to be considered with the intermediate risk group in
   which they were evaluated.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health
   care professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control
   hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women).
   Options: For people at risk for hypertension, there are a number of
   lifestyle options that may avert the condition-maintaining a healthy
   body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, exercising, reducing
   sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium, and
   reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce the
   risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the
   options for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification,
   antihypertensive medications or a combination of these options; with no
   treatment, these people remain at risk for the complications of
   hypertension.
   Outcomes: The health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure
   and in morbidity and mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence,
   no economic outcomes were considered.
   Evidence: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1966 to
   September 1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists
   were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors
   were used to identify other studies. All relevant articles were
   reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to
   level of evidence.
   Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular
   morbidity and premature death caused by untreated hypertension.
   Benefits, harms and costs: Lifestyle modification by means of weight
   loss (or maintenance of healthy body weight), regular exercise and low
   alcohol consumption will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected normotensive and hypertensive people. Sodium restriction and
   stress management will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected hypertensive patients. The side effects of these therapies are
   few, and the indirect benefits are well known. There are certainly costs
   associated with lifestyle modification, but they were not measured in
   the studies reviewed. Supplementing the diet with potassium, calcium and
   magnesium has not been associated with a clinically important reduction
   in blood pressure in people consuming a healthy diet.
   Recommendations: (1) It is recommended that health care professionals
   determine the body mass index (weight in kilograms/{[}height in
   metres](2)) and alcohol consumption of all adult patients and assess
   sodium consumption and stress levels in all hypertensive patients. (2)To
   reduce blood pressure in the population at large, it is recommended that
   Canadians attain and maintain a healthy body mass index. For those who
   choose to drink, alcohol intake should be limited to 2 or fewer standard
   drinks per day (maximum of 14/week for men and 9/week for women). Adults
   should exercise regularly (3) To reduce blood pressure in hypertensive
   patients, individualized therapy is recommended. This therapy should
   emphasize weight loss for overweight patients, abstinence from or
   moderation in alcohol intake, regular exercise, restriction of sodium
   intake and, in appropriate circumstances, individualized cognitive
   behaviour modification to reduce the negative effects of stress.
   Validation: The recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring
   organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth
   International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They are similar to
   those of the World Hypertension League and the Joint National Committee,
   with the exception of the recommendations on stress management, which
   are based on new information. They have not been clinically tested.

   High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, the Laboratory Centre for
   Disease Control at Health Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of

Title = {AIRBORNE LIDAR IN SUPPORT OF COASTAL MAPPING AND HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING},
Booktitle = {GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {175-195},
Abstract = {Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play
   a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by
   recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and
   feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are
   being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to
   mankind is not fully acknowledged.
   The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France
   (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This
   trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely
   the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed
   a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas.
   Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the
   return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation
   with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system
   is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system.
   The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density
   reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are
   respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground.
   Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in
   integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of
   tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among
   which:
   - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the
   bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion
   and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone
   or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to
   shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal,
   transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been
   carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic
   models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont
   Saint Michel and Morbihan bays.
   - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and
   facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has
   been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites.
   By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne
   ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced
   describing sediment facies and habitat units to a high level of detail.
   Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the
   flooding frequency, a key driver to the presence of sea weed belts or
   salt marsh vegetation.
   - Coastal morpho-dynamics are concerned with understanding coastline and
   seashore changes under natural or human pressure. Natural events include
   storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal
   developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in
   shellfish fanning areas. Repeated LIDAR surveys would allow monitoring
   the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to
   risk management.},

Title = {Use of the pediatric symptom checklist to screen for psychosocial
   problems in pediatric primary care - A national feasibility study},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS \& ADOLESCENT MEDICINE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {153},

Abstract = {Background: Routine use of a brief psychosocial screening instrument has
   been proposed as a means of improving recognition, management, and
   referral of children's psychosocial morbidity in primary care.
   Objective: To assess the feasibility of routine psychosocial screening
   using the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) in pediatrics by using a
   brief version of the checklist in a large sample representative of the
   full range of pediatric practice settings in the United States and
   Canada. We evaluated large-scale screening and the performance of the
   PSC in detecting psychosocial problems by (1) determining whether the
   prevalence of psychosocial dysfunction identified by the PSC was
   consistent with findings in previous, smaller samples; (2) assessing
   whether the prevalence of positive PSC screening stores varied by
   population subgroups; and (3) determining whether the PSC was completed
   by a significant proportion of parents from all subgroups and settings.
   Patients and Methods: Twenty-one thousand sixty-five children between
   the ages of 4 and 15 years were seen in 2 large primary care networks:
   the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network and the Pediatric Research in
   Office Settings network, involving 395 pediatric and family practice
   clinicians in et states, Puerto Rico, and 4 Canadian provinces. Parents
   were asked to complete a brief questionnaire that included demographic
   information, history of mental health services, the 35-item PSC, and the
   number of pediatric visits within the past 6 months.
   Results: The overall prevalence rates of psychosocial dysfunction as
   measured by the PSC in school-aged and preschool-aged pediatric
   outpatients (13\% and 10\%, respectively) were nearly identical to the
   rates that had been reported in several smaller samples (12\%-14\% among
   school-aged children and 7\%-14\% among preschoolers). Consistent with
   previous findings, children from low-income families were twice as
   likely to be scored as dysfunctional on the PSC than were children from
   higher-income families. Similarly, children from single-parent as
   opposed to those from 2-parent families and children with a past history
   of mental health services showed an elevated risk of psychosocial
   impairment. The current study was the first to demonstrate a 50\%
   increase in risk of impairment for male children. The overall rate of
   completed forms was 97\%, well within an acceptable range, and at least
   94\% of the parents in each sociodemograghic subgroup completed the PSC
   form.
   Conclusions: Use of the PSC offers an approach to the recognition of
   psychosocial dysfunction that is sufficiently consistent across groups
   and locales to become part of comprehensive pediatric care in virtually
   all outpatient settings. In addition to its clinical utility, the
   consistency and widespread acceptability of the PSC make it well suited
   for the next generation of pediatric mental health services research,
   which can address whether earlier recognition of and intervention for
   psychosocial problems in pediatrics will lead to cost-effective
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Statistical analysis of the daily course of exposures to TL-01 tube
   radiation for 93 psoriatic patients from the Medical University of Lodz
   during 20-day phototherapy shows that the dose of 1 J/cm(2) represents a
   unit of single exposure necessary for psoriasis healing. This value is
   converted to the antipsoriatic effective dose of 317.9 J/m(2) using the
   TL-01 lamp irradiance spectrum and the antipsoriatic action spectrum. It
   is proposed that the daily exposure of 317.9 J/m2 serves as the standard
   antipsoriatic dose (SAPD) providing a link between the cabinet and the
   out-door exposures and it could be used for planning heliotherapy in
   Poland. A model is proposed to calculate ambient antipsoriatic doses for
   3 h exposures around the local noon (9 am-12 am GMT) based on satellite
   measurements of ozone and cloud characteristics. The model constants are
   determined by a comparison with pertaining antipsoriatic doses measured
   by the Brewer spectrophotometer in central Poland. It is found that 3 h
   exposures to solar radiation in the period 15 May-15 September provides
   the mean (2005-2013) doses in the range 2.7-3.1 SAPD over Poland. Thus,
   heliotherapy could be treated as an alternative to the cabinet
   phototherapy for almost 4 months. It seems that the most effective site
   for antipsoriatic heliotherapy is the south/east part of Poland (the
   Bieszczady Mountains). The heliotherapy could be carried out in existing
   national health centers equipped with the standard easy-to-use biometers
   for on-line monitoring of UV level and controlling duration of
   sunbathing to avoid erythema risks. It is even possible to control the
   antipsoriatic heliotherapy by a patient himself, using low-cost
   hand-held instruments measuring UV index. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Maps of coral ecosystems are needed to Support many conservation and
   management objectives, as well as research activities. Examples include
   ground-truthing aerial and satellite imagery, characterizing essential
   habitat, assessing changes, and monitoring the progress of restoration
   efforts. To address some of these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey
   developed the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based
   sensor package for mapping shallow-water bcnthic environments. ATRIS
   consists of a digital still camera, a video camera, and an acoustic
   depth sounder affixed to a moveable pole. This design, however,
   restricts its deployment to clear waters less than 10 in deep. To
   overcome this limitation, a towed version has been developed, referred
   to as Deep ATRIS. The system is based on a light-weight,
   computer-control led, towed vehicle that is capable of following a
   programmed diving profile. The vehicle is 1.3 in long with a 63-cm wing
   span and can carry a wide variety of research instruments, including
   CTDs, fluorometers, transmissometers, and cameras. Deep ATRIS is
   currently equipped with a high-speed (20 frames s(-1)) digital camera,
   custom-built light-emitting-diode lights, a compass, a 3-axis
   orientation sensor, and a nadir-looking altimeter. The vehicle
   dynamically adjusts its altitude to maintain a fixed height above the
   seafloor. The camera has a 29 degrees x 22 degrees field-of-view and
   captures color images that are 1360 x 1024 pixels in size. GPS
   coordinates are recorded for each image. A gigabit ethernet connection
   enables the images to be displayed and archived in real time on the
   surface computer. Deep ATRIS has a maximum tow speed of 2.6 in s(-1) and
   a theoretical operating tow-depth limit of 27 in. With an improved tow
   cable, the operating depth can be extended to 90 in. Here, we present
   results from the initial sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico and Biscayne
   National Park, Florida, USA, and discuss the utility of Deep ATRIS for
   mapping coral reef habitats, Several example mosaics illustrate the
   high-quality imagery that can be obtained with this system. The images
   also reveal the potential for unobtrusive animal observations; fish and
   sea turtles are unperturbed by the presence of Deep ATRIS. Rev. Biol.

Title = {Quantitative Precipitation Estimation of Extremes in CONUS With Radar
   Data},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale,
   long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal
   changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the
   extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative
   precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily
   return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky
   Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than
   similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether
   rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate
   extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between
   gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at
   locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges
   is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics
   derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial
   resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern
   United States.
   Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of
   precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is
   crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and
   resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is
   desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on
   average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event,
   such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that
   certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated
   on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This
   means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings
   of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to
   accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is
   imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way
   that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest
   requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step
   toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term,
   high-resolution precipitation data set.},

Title = {Estimate of daytime single-layer cloud base height from advanced
   baseline imager measurements},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter to describe cloud
   state and is highly related to the vertical motions in the atmosphere.
   CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic
   analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from
   Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16)
   Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis
   (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine
   learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as
   GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16
   and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from
   the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard
   Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations
   (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class
   of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine
   learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine
   learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning
   technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH
   estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE)
   of 1.87 km and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) of 0.92
   before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low
   confidence (19.2\% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km,
   Pearson's r increases to 0.97, and 96\% of the estimates are within 2 km
   of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance,
   cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate,
   although all input features have positive impact on the estimate
   accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for
   clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy
   (Pearson's r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud
   optical depth {[}COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained
   in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds
   with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded.
   Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat
   measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of
   1.41 km and Pearson's r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian,
   CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with
   small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low
   clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are
   not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence
   with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65\% of cloudy
   pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH
   with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived
   from ABI measurements using this methodology.},

Title = {Reclamation-oriented spatiotemporal evolution of coastal wetland along

Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands are located in the ecotone of interaction between the
   land surface and sea, and anthropogenic activities extensively interfere
   with these wetlands through the reclamation of large tidal wetlands and
   destruction of the function of the ecosystems. In this study, we
   investigated the dynamic evolutionary characteristics of the Bohai Rim
   coastal area over the past 40 years using the Modified Normalized
   Difference Water Index, the fractal dimension, object-oriented
   classification, the land-use transfer trajectory, and regression
   analysis. Additionally, we quantified and monitored the evolution of
   reclamation and analyzed the correlation between reclamation and coastal
   wetlands based on 99 Landsat-2, -5, and -8 images (at 60 m and 30 m
   spatial resolution) over the period 1980-2019. The results are as
   follows. (1) The coastline of the Bohai Rim increased by 1 631.2 km from
   1980 to 2019 with a zigzag variation. The artificial coastline increased
   by 2 946.1 km, whereas the natural coastline decreased by 90\%. (2) The
   area of man-made wetlands increased by 3 736.9 km(2), the area of
   construction land increased by 1 008.4 km(2), and the natural wetland
   area decreased by 66\%. The decrease of tidal flats is the main
   contributor to the decrease of natural wetland area (takes account for
   91.1\%). Coastal areas are affected by intense human disturbance, which
   was taken place across a large area of tidal flats and caused the
   landscape to fragment and be more heterogeneous. The coastal zone
   development activities were primarily concentrated in the southern
   Laizhou Bay, the Yellow River Delta, the Bohai Bay, the northern
   Liaodong Bay, and the Pulandian Bay. The solidified shorelines and
   increase in sea level have resulted in intertidal wetlands decreasing
   and impaired wetland ecology. (3) There is a good agreement between
   reclamation and the size of the coastal wetlands. Both land reclamation
   and the reduction in coastal wetland areas are significantly related to
   the population size, fishery output value, and urbanization rate. In
   summary, human activities, such as the construction of aquaculture ponds
   and salt pans, industrialization, and urbanization, are the primary
   forces that influence the environmental changes in the coastal region.
   This study is beneficial for establishing and improving the systems for
   the rational development and utilization of natural resources, and
   provides theoretical references for restoring wetland ecology and
   managing future reclamation activities in other coastal zone-related
   areas.},

Title = {Health-related quality of life in breast cancer patients: A
   bibliographic review of the literature from 1974 to 2007},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Background: Quality of life in patients with breast cancer is an
   important outcome. This paper presents an extensive overview on the
   topic ranging from descriptive findings to clinical trials.
   Methods: This was a bibliographic review of the literature covering all
   full publications that appeared in English language biomedical journals
   between 1974 and 2007. The search strategy included a combination of key
   words `quality of life' and `breast cancer' or `breast carcinoma' in
   titles. A total of 971 citations were identified and after exclusion of
   duplicates, the abstracts of 606 citations were reviewed. Of these,
   meetings abstracts, editorials, brief commentaries, letters, errata and
   dissertation abstracts and papers that appeared online and were indexed
   ahead of publication were also excluded. The remaining 477 papers were
   examined. The major findings are summarized and presented under several
   headings: instruments used, validation studies, measurement issues,
   surgical treatment, systemic therapies, quality of life as predictor of
   survival, psychological distress, supportive care, symptoms and sexual
   functioning.
   Results: Instruments-Several valid instruments were used to measure
   quality of life in breast cancer patients. The European Organization for
   Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Cancer Quality of Life
   Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its breast cancer specific
   complementary measure (EORTC QLQ-BR23) and the Functional Assessment
   Chronic Illness Therapy General questionnaire (FACIT-G) and its breast
   cancer module (FACIT-B) were found to be the most common and well
   developed instruments to measure quality of life in breast cancer
   patients. Surgery-different surgical procedures led to relatively
   similar results in terms of quality of life assessments, although
   mastectomy patients compared to conserving surgery patients usually
   reported a lower body image and sexual functioning. Systemic
   therapies-almost all studies indicated that breast cancer patients
   receiving chemotherapy might experience several side-effects and
   symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. Adjuvant hormonal
   therapies also were found to have similar negative impact on quality of
   life, although in general they were associated with improved survival.
   Quality of life as predictor of survival-similar to known medical
   factors, quality of life data in metastatic breast cancer patients was
   found to be prognostic and predictive of survival time. Psychological
   distress-anxiety and depression were found to be common among breast
   cancer patients even years after the disease diagnosis and treatment.
   Psychological factors also were found to predict subsequent quality of
   life or even overall survival in breast cancer patients. Supportive
   care-clinical treatments to control emesis, or interventions such as
   counseling, providing social support and exercise could improve quality
   of life. Symptoms-Pain, fatigue, arm morbidity and postmenopausal
   symptoms were among the most common symptoms reported by breast cancer
   patients. As recommended, recognition and management of these symptoms
   is an important issue since such symptoms impair health-related quality
   of life. Sexual functioning-breast cancer patients especially younger
   patients suffer from poor sexual functioning that negatively affect
   quality of life.
   Conclusion: There was quite an extensive body of the literature on
   quality of life in breast cancer patients. These papers have made a
   considerable contribution to improving breast cancer care, although
   their exact benefit was hard to define. However, quality of life data
   provided scientific evidence for clinical decision-making and conveyed
   helpful information concerning breast cancer patients' experiences
   during the course of the disease diagnosis, treatment, disease-free
   survival time, and recurrences; otherwise finding patient-centered
   solutions for evidence-based selection of optimal treatments,
   psychosocial interventions, patient-physician communications, allocation
   of resources, and indicating research priorities were impossible. It
   seems that more qualitative research is needed for a better
   understanding of the topic. In addition, issues related to the disease,
   its treatment side effects and symptoms, and sexual functioning should
   receive more attention when studying quality of life in breast cancer
   patients.},

Title = {An integrated economic-ecological index based on satellite-derived
   carbon sequestration and carbon price: A case study during 2015-2020 in
   Shaanxi, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Carbon sequestration reflecting vegetation productivity is essential for
   global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystems. Exploring the spatial
   and temporal variation of carbon sequestration and corresponding
   ecological values yields insights for policy formulation to mitigate
   carbon emission and achieve carbon neutrality. Hence, taking Shaanxi
   China as the case study, we developed an integrated index (named C-GDP)
   based on vegetation carbon sequestration estimated by the CASA model and
   carbon prices acquired from carbon trading market in China to explore
   tradeoffs between economic and ecological development. The
   spatiotemporal distributions of carbon sequestration and C-GDP were
   characterized using hotspot analysis and variation coefficient during
   2015-2020. The estimated carbon sequestrations were assessed with
   promising accuracy, depicting high values in the south and low values in
   the north, with provincial averages of 1761.37gC/m2a. Temporally, carbon
   sequestrations increased with fluctuation between 2015 and 2020, with
   significant seasonality. Summertime, especially July, has the highest
   sequestration, while winter is the season with the lowest values. The
   C-GDP calculated by carbon sequestration and carbon price exhibited a
   distinct pattern with sequestration, with the highest C-GDP in Central
   Shaanxi and the lowest in the south. The multi-year provincial-mean
   C-GDP is 20.44 billion yuan. The C-GDP exhibited an increase trend with
   miniscule fluctuation, peaking at 23.66 billion yuan in 2020. The
   results imply the ecological value of carbon sequestration monetizing by
   carbon prices is much lower than economical value of production,
   suggesting that strict carbon policies, such as improving carbon prices
   or taxes, may be warranted for China because of high carbon mitigation
   costs.},

Title = {The influence of spatial patterning on modeling PM<sub>2.5</sub>
   constituents in Eastern Massachusetts},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {682},
Pages = {247-258},

Abstract = {Geostatistical exposure methods for air pollution have inherent
   uncertainties, resulting in varying levels of exposure
   misclassification. In this study, we propose that areas representing
   dusters of PM2.5 elements are potential predictor variables to be
   included in spatial models for particle composition. The inclusion of
   these clusters may minimize the exposure misclassification. We evaluated
   the influence of spatial patterning on modeling of 10 components of
   ambient PM2.5, which included Al, Cu, Fe, K. Ni. Pb, S, Ti, V, and Zn.
   This study was performed in three stages. First, we applied a hybrid
   approach (combination of Empirical Bayesian Kriging and land use
   regression) to estimate spatial variability for each one of the 10
   components of ambient PM2.5. In this stage, we accounted for numerous
   predictors representing land use, transportation, demographic, and
   geographical characteristics. In the second stage, we applied the same
   hybrid approach adding clusters of each PM2.5 component to the set of
   predictor variables. The clusters here were estimated by a multivariate
   clustering approach based on k means. Finally, in the last stage, we
   compared the estimates obtained from the model without clusters (first
   stage) and the model with clusters (second stage). Overall, our findings
   suggest significant influence of spatial dusters on modeling some PM2.5
   components. We observed that the clusters may affect the error of the
   prediction values and especially the proportion of explained variance
   for most of the PM2.5 constituents evaluated in this study. The model
   with cluster presented a better performance for all PM2.5 components,
   except for Pb. which the R-2 value decreased 8.51\% when we included the
   clusters in the analysis; and for V. which the R-2 value did not change
   with the clusters. Models for Cu and Fe explained the highest
   concentration variance. The R-2 value for the model without cluster was
   0.55 for both pollutants. When we accounted for clusters, R-2 value
   increased 13 and 7\% for Cu (R-2 = 0.62) and Fe (R-2 = 0.59),
   respectively. The models for K and S presented the lowest performance
   for both models with and without cluster (although the model with
   cluster improved substantially the R-2 values). Better knowledge of the
   influence of spatial patterns on air pollution modeling should be of
   interest to policy makers to devise future strategies to improve human
   exposure assessment to air particulates while controlling for spatial
   patterns of ambient PM2.5 elemental concentration. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {Mobile telemedicine integrates wireless communications for different
   telemedical applications, such as mobile phones and personal digital
   assistants, and with the implementation of modern wireless
   telecommunication, wireless local area network and satellite
   communication is a reality. New generation cellular phones or personal
   digital assistants have overcome limitations of image quality seen in
   older devices and, with dermatology being a visual profession, mobile
   teledermatology is perhaps the most recent development in this field.
   Mobile teledermatology may provide a triage service aimed toward
   management of patients with emergent skin disease or for follow-up with
   patients requiring systemic treatment. Teledermoscopy enables rapid
   transmission of dermoscopic images via e-mail or specific
   web-application and studies have demonstrated a high, 91\%, concordance
   between face-to-face diagnosis and remote diagnosis of such images.
   Further to this, telediagnosis of melanocytic skin neoplasms achieved a
   diagnostic accuracy of 83\% versus the conventional histopathologic
   diagnosis. Mobile teledermoscopy is the combination of such approaches
   enabling transfer of images captured with cellular phones coupled with a
   pocket dermatoscope and preliminary studies have demonstrated the
   feasibility and potential of its use in triage of pigmented lesions.
   Such applications are of benefit to physicians in enabling easy storage
   of data for follow-up or referral of images for expert second opinion
   and may facilitate a ``person-centered health system{''} for patients
   with numerous moles and pigmented skin lesions who could forward images
   for evaluation. The incidence of skin cancers has reached epidemic
   proportions among whites and the trend is still going upward. Mobile
   teledermatology and teledermoscopy may be implemented as a triage or
   screening tool for malignant tumors to facilitate early detection and
   diagnosis, which is crucial for improved patient outcomes. While the
   legal aspects concerning teleconsultations need to be evaluated, the
   communications technologies provide a unique opportunity for physicians
   and patients alike and we foresee a place for these tools in dermatology
   soon. Semin Cutan Mad Surg 28:203-205 (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The knowledge management, like a strategic resource, has gained great
   importance for business development and knowledge transfer processes
   became a key issue in allowing firms to get new sources of information.
   The study looks at the reality of industrial districts, where, normally,
   equality and fairness create the conditions upon which firms share their
   own knowledge. However, often, these contexts, in contrasts to the
   traditional Marshallian industrial district (Marshall, 1879, Becattini,
   1981), are characterized by an asymmetric power relationship among the
   parties, according to the Hub and Spoke district (Markusen, 1996). The
   case study of Val d'Agri, the most important Italian oil district, is an
   example of Hub-and-spoke District, with the dominance of a bigger firm
   (Eni) to manage all the relationship along the chain. The discovery of
   the Val d'Agri was made by ENI, in 1988.
   Purpose - Starting from the description of Val d'Agri district, our
   paper aims at mapping the local relationships, in order to define the
   way firms relate along the district value chain, with reference to both
   their position, and their own ``contractual power{''}; and to understand
   how firms position, as well as their different contractual power, affect
   knowledge transfer process within the district. Taking into account the
   ``Hub and Spoke{''} morphology, we support the idea that knowledge
   transfer is deeply affected by firms' contractual power, as well as by
   their position within the district. Explicit knowledge transfer is
   mainly linked to the development of production process; on the contrary,
   the transfer of tacit knowledge depends, above all, by the action people
   place within the district; so, human capital plays a very important role
   in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social
   interaction.
   Design/methodology/approach - We propose an empirical approach. This
   work will start providing an analysis of the main characteristics of the
   relational structure of Val d'Agri, in order to identify the main issues
   that can impact the development process of knowledge transfer. The study
   consists of two parts: in the first part, it will develop an analysis of
   the main national and international literature on the field, from both
   economic and managerial perspectives; in the second part, an empirical
   analysis will be developed. For the analysis were contacted about 100
   firms of satellite ENI industries (the biggest ones), both the same ENI.
   Were sent questionnaires for asking questions about the company
   structure, specialization, the typology of formal relationships exists
   with the leader, the company's distinctive knowledge, the existence of
   knowledge management systems.
   Originality/value - Since the importance that both industrial districts
   and knowledge transfer have for firms competition, the paper aims at
   giving a new and valuable framework useful to understand, not only the
   district dynamics, but also the way knowledge transfer may be fostered
   among all the firms related along a given value chain.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the application puts in
   evidence the peculiarity of an oil district, because the birth of this
   form of district is closely related to land resources. In addition,
   national laws and regulations that govern the exploitation of oil in
   Italy, create positions of power within the production chain, which
   alter the relationship between the companies, compared to what happens
   in the traditional type of Marshallian districts.},

   vineyard scale, i.e., zoning. We performed samplings at four different
   locations in California, United States, with three different cultivars
   of table and wine grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Crimson-Seedless).
   Leaf physiology (photosynthesis,A(N), stomatal conductance,g(s)) and
   stem water potentials (psi(stem)) were routinely measured. The delta
   C-13 was measured at harvest and strong relationships were found between
   psi(stem)(R-2= 0.71), stomatal conductance (R-2= 0.71), net carbon
   assimilation (R-2= 0.59) and WUEi (R-2= 0.53). The role of leaf nitrogen
   on the signal was assessed by evaluating relationships between leaf
   nitrogen and WUEi(R-2= 0.54), Ci/Ca (R-2= 0.51), delta C-13 (R-2= 0.44),
   and psi(stem)(R-2= 0.37). Although nitrogen can be among the
   environmental factors able to affect the delta C-13 signal, this
   difference is only observable when variability inNis very large, by
   pooling different vineyards/varieties, but not at the within-vineyard
   scale. The utility of delta C-13 was further tested and measured on
   grape berries sampled on an equidistant grid in a 3.5 ha vineyard where
   psi(stem)was also measured throughout the field season and used to
   delineate management zones. Physiological measurements and grape
   composition were correlated to soil electrical resistivity and
   satellite-derived vegetation index. The two management zones obtained by
   delta C-13 or psi(stem)were spatially similar at 67\% and allowed to
   separate the harvest in two pools having statistically different grape
   composition (soluble solids, organic acids, and anthocyanin profiles).
   Zoning by delta C-13 performed as well as zoning by psi(stem)to separate
   grape phenolic composition, e.g., for selective harvest. Our results
   provided evidence that delta C-13 of grape must is a reliable and
   repeatable assessor of plant water status and gas exchange in vineyard
   systems that are crucial for zoning vineyards, even when irrigated, and
   for ground-truthing sensor maps in precision viticulture.},

Title = {Delta dynamics: Effects of a major earthquake, tides, and river flows on
   Cienega de Santa Clara and the Colorado River Delta, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {144-156},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intertidal portion of Mexico's Colorado River Delta is a dynamic
   environment subject to complex interactions of tectonic, fluvial, and
   tidal forces at the head of the Gulf of California. We review the
   historical interactions of these forces, use sequential satellite
   images, overflights, ground observations, and interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (InSAR) data to study the effects of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El
   Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake on changing patterns of tidal inundation within
   the Delta, and assess effects of these changes to the
   fluvial/hydrological regime of the Colorado River estuary and nearby
   Cienega de Santa Clara wetland. The objectives of this study are to
   highlight for environmental scientists, land managers, and ecological
   engineers the contribution of tectonic forces in shaping the intertidal
   Delta environment and to provide information on the effects of the 2010
   earthquake which will be of practical value in planning and designing
   management measures and restoration projects for the estuary and
   Cienega.
   The Colorado River estuary is at present blocked by a tidal sand bar
   which restricts access by marine species to the upper estuary and
   obstructs the flow of fresh water into the lower estuary. Located 13 km
   east of the estuary, the Cienega is a 6000 ha wetland supported by
   agricultural drain water from Arizona and Mexico. South of the Cienega
   is the Santa Clara Slough, an unvegetated 26,000 ha basin subject to
   periodic inundation from the northern Gulf's high amplitude tides, which
   have historically reached the margins of the Cienega several times each
   year.
   The El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake ruptured the previously unknown Indiviso
   Fault which extends into the intertidal zone just west of the Cienega.
   The Cienega experienced only minor surface deformation having no direct
   effects to the wetland. Most of the significant ground movement and
   surface deformation occurred west of the Indiviso Fault adjacent to the
   estuary, where portions of the intertidal flats underwent extensive
   liquefaction, northward coseismic displacement and post-seismic
   subsidence. These surface deformations changed the pattern of tidal
   inundation, triggering development of a new system of natural tidal
   channels and creating conditions favorable for installation of projects
   to restore connectivity between the upper and lower estuary. The changed
   pattern of tidal inundation may also have contributed to an observed
   reduction in the occurrence of tidal flooding along the southwestern
   margin of the Cienega following the earthquake. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Embrace through the universe: Sound design with cosmic muons and the
   parameters of solar wind},

Abstract = {Although humans are destined to live in a world of chaos, there is also
   hidden beauty within it. Analogically, this implies that there can be a
   creative way of living through the exploration of the unknown.
   Considering humans are part of the dynamism of the whole universe that
   consists of matter and energy, what would it be like if they could feel
   being embraced through the universe? Having continuous dialogues with
   the organizer throughout the planning phase, an artistic performance
   with the sounds of the universe is presented at the cultural event
   Connected Ink 2021 in Tokyo. This performance is entitled Life, the
   Universe and Everything in homage to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy by Douglas Adams. In this paper, the background, concepts,
   physics, sound design, and the process and result of the project are
   discussed in collaboration with artists, sound designers, and
   experimental physicists. Regarding the sound design, it had been
   developed, in part, based on what the authors have shown through the
   preliminary sound the installation: Particle Post - Letters from the
   Universe in 2019, through which the signals from cosmic muons that are
   captured by a scintillation detector are poetically designed.
   Transforming imperceivable elements of the universe into an appreciable
   form in a poetic manner is one of the crucial essences of the authors'
   research and practice. With this, we believe that we could approach the
   wonders of the universe aesthetically. Hence, imperceivable elements
   such as cosmic muons and the parameters of solar wind (density, speed,
   and temperature in particular) captured from the satellite DSCOVR
   orbiting the L1 Lagrange point, are brought into the audio system in
   almost real time. Five iron fuurin, Japanese wind bells, ring triggered
   by cosmic muons that constantly arrive on Earth, while the stylized
   sounds of solar wind surround the large space at the venue.
   Consequently, these two different kinds of `wind' sounds create harmony
   within the space, hoping to create a similar harmony through the bodies
   and minds of the audience as well. This project also signifies the value
   of genuine dialogue and communication with the purpose of deepening an
   interdisciplinary collaboration and opening up further creation.},

Title = {Estimation of NO<sub>2</sub> emission strengths over Riyadh and Madrid

Abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution provides valuable information for
   quantifying NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions and exposures. This study
   presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2
   emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018-June 2022) TROPOspheric
   Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a
   wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the
   so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly
   applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and
   yields a total emission rate of 1:09 x 1026 molec. s(-1). The ML-trained
   anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R-2
   value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent
   at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over
   areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1 :99
   x 10(25) molec. s(-1) is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area,
   Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the
   Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. Weekly
   variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic
   activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced
   by 16\% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the
   city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction
   estimate of 28\% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources
   are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the
   Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19
   lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21\% in March-June 2020 in
   Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction
   (62 \%) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was
   implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in
   the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared
   with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during
   lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities.
   Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the
   method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is
   expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions.
   However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated
   emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in
   different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These
   impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further
   reduce the uncertainty budget.},

Title = {Has Current French Training for Military Orthopedic Surgeons Deployed in
   External Operations Been Appropriately Adapted?},
Journal = {MILITARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {183},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {E411-E415},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction: The current evolution of surgical practices is
   increasingly trending toward hyper-specialization. For military
   surgeons, their practice in France does not differ from their civilian
   counterparts. In contrast, in external operations, they have to deal
   with specific war injuries in austere conditions. They are also required
   to take care of local populations. Therefore, specific training is
   necessary, and the French Military Health Service Academy (Ecole du
   Val-de-Grace) Paris has set up a specific training called Advanced
   Course for Deployment Surgery (ACDS) in 2007. The aim of this study is
   to assess the relevance of this teaching regarding pathologies
   encountered during current conflicts. Materials and Methods: The
   activity of deploying orthopedic surgeons during the three recent major
   external operations (Afghanistan, Mali, and Central African Republic)
   has been retrospectively recorded in terms of global volume, types of
   trauma, status of patients who had been operated on, and indications.
   These data have been compared with teaching during the ACDS. Results:
   Our study found a high variability in terms of operating volume, types
   of trauma, patients' statuses, and types of operations performed
   depending on the operation theaters. The volume of surgical activity
   carried out within Role 3 is much more important than that in Role 2
   with more than half of the surgeries performed as scheduled surgery to
   the benefit of the local population. Within advanced Role 2 surgical
   structures deployed in Mali and Central Africa, more than 70\% of the
   activity was performed as emergencies. Surgical indications were varied,
   ranging from emergency surgery to limb reconstructive surgery. A lot of
   non-orthopedic procedures such as vascular repairs and decompressive
   craniotomies were also performed. All of the encountered pathologies
   were taught during ACDS. Discussion: The large variety and technical
   nature of the performed operations requires the training of highly
   qualified military orthopedic surgeons with both experience in war
   surgery and management of after-effects and complications. Orthopedists
   are also required to carry out procedures dealing with neurosurgery,
   general, and/or vascular surgery on missions. These data highlight the
   complexity of military surgeons' training along with the
   hyper-specialization of the civilian medical world. For more than 10 yr,
   French military surgeons have benefited from a training program called
   ACDS to meet these objectives. This initial training seems to be
   appropriated adapted in view of the managed pathologies.},

Abstract = {One of the problems of Russian tax science that we have to face in
   practice is the lack of clear legal mechanisms and forms of coordination
   of antinomic interests.The ``balance of interests{''} construct is used
   as often as it is unintelligent in legal literature and judicial acts.
   Many questions remain unanswered: what exactly is the balance of
   interests and what are its criteria, how it is achieved, what tools and
   algorithms exist for this.The balancing itself is almost always
   implicit.Both in the theory of tax law and in practice, it is something
   new (terra incognita).Due to a lack of understanding of the essence of
   the balance and how to achieve it, in the absence of a developed
   methodology for assessing and weighing interests, tax hard cases are
   resolved more intuitively, based on the law enforcement officer's own
   ideas about what is due. This approach does not add legitimacy and
   openness to judicial acts, and often causes misunderstandings in the
   professional law community.The problem of subjectivism creates a real
   threat of infringement of the legitimate interests not only of the
   parties to tax relations, but also of the rule of law in general.The
   subject of this study is the principle of proportionality, which is
   considered as a methodological basis for achieving a balance of private
   and public interests in tax relations field.The aim of the work is to
   identify possibilities of the proportionality doctrine hidden from the
   Russian law enforcement, and thereby to add rationality to the issue of
   achieving (justifying) legal balance in the resolution of tax
   conflicts.With the help of dogmatic, comparative legal and other methods
   developed by legal science, instrumental potential of principle of
   proportionality is revealed.The article considers possibility of
   receiving achievements of foreign legal thought in the domestic theory
   of tax law and adapting it to practice of tax relations. The article
   analyzes the proportionality test (the structure of criterion and the
   content) in foreign and Russian jurisdictions.Additional requirements
   for the court to substantiate the conclusions of the decision are
   identified.With the help of a mathematical model, a problem of the
   commensurability of weight of the value of interests, as well as issue
   of formalization of the process of weighing interests, is investigated;
   the concept of the weight formula promoted by Robert Alexy is critically
   evaluated.The article analyzes application of principle of
   proportionality in foreign practice and in Russia.It is concluded
   principle mentioned is the legal embodiment of the Pareto-optimum
   principle.},

Abstract = {For much of the last two decades, the Central and East European (CEE)
   economies have experienced a deep structural reform, moving away from a
   socialist economic system towards a market economy. The political
   situation of the second half of the 20th century had a significant
   impact on the economic development and competitiveness of these
   transition countries, when compared with their Western European
   counterparts. A vast number of studies have been conducted to analyze
   the structural changes required for resource-dependent economies to
   achieve long-term development and to understand the synergies between
   commodities and diversification. Yet, the dynamics of resource
   extraction and the resource dependence of regions that have experienced
   periods of sustained levels of growth have largely been overlooked,
   especially the Central and Eastern European region. In this context,
   this article presents an analysis of the level of resource dependence of
   six countries which joined the European Union between 2004 and 2007.
   Using data spanning from the year 2000 to 2017, we calculate the
   Extractives Dependence Index (EDI) of six former Soviet satellite
   nations and one former Soviet state. Our results indicate that the
   commodity structure of trade in the six countries which joined the
   European Union has changed considerably. These countries have reduced
   their economic dependence on extractive resources by developing their
   high value-added and technology-intensive sectors. Our findings also
   reveal that Poland experienced the highest decrease in EDI scores among
   the six CEE countries.},

Title = {USING GEOSTATISTICS IN FOREST MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {SUMARSKI LIST},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {134},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {249-259},
Abstract = {The possibilities of forest measurements have been significantly
   improved nowadays, by using georeferenced maps, implementing remote
   sensing, developing artificial intelligence, using the global
   positioning system and geographical information system. Moreover the
   exact position (x, y) of the measurement (of variables) of the specific
   location (Z) in the forest allows the monitoring of the information and
   the analysis of the so called continuous model of spatial variation, as
   opposed to the discrete model of spatial variation which is assumed to
   be homogeneous.
   Ever since geostatistics was introduced to geoscinces (Krige 1951,
   Matheron 1965), it has been implemented in many areas whose interest
   lies in analyzing spatial data. Geostatistics is based on the concept of
   regionalized variable (which means that the value of the variable
   depends on the sampling area).
   The goal was research and presentation of using geostatistics in the
   forest management, with the aim of improving the present approach to
   using and mapping the forest inventory data for Croatia. The
   geostatistical analysis was performed on apart of an management unit
   ``Banov Brod{''}, Pitomaca forestry administration, for three structural
   elements (variables): number of trees (N), basal area (G) and volume
   (V). The research included the compartments /sub-compartments 9a, d, e,
   10 a, b (Figure 1), with the total area of 69, 57 ha.
   In order to determine the anisotropy, semivariogram surface maps of each
   of the elements were made. The semivariograms were used as a measure of
   spatial dependence, and experimental and theoretical semivariograms were
   calculated. The experimental semivariogram for each structural element
   was calculated after multiple fitting of number and width of lags. The
   parameters used for Ordinary Kringing interpolation of each of the
   structural elements were obtained from the theoretical semivariogram
   model.
   The interpolation of structural elements was also conducted by using the
   inverse distance method. The testing of the interpolation model was done
   by using a numeric cross-validation approach. Furthermore, the
   usefulness of making a variogram cloud in the spatial structural
   elements' analysis was shown. Three programs were used during this
   project: VARIOWIN 2.21; SURFER 8.0 (TM), and STATISTICA 7.1 (TM).
   Semivariogram surface maps for the three analyzed structural elements
   did not indicate the presence of anisotropy (Figure 2). As anisotropy
   was not determined and omnidirectional experimental semivariogram were
   calculated (Figure 3). All experimental semivariograms can be considered
   reliable because they contain a great number of pairs of data. What they
   have in common is the existence of hardly explainable high nugget, that
   is the difference in the values of close samples or measurement errors,
   as well as the range, which is bigger than the sampling interval. The
   omnidirectional experimental semivariogram of the tree volume and basal
   area (Figures 3a, b) start oscillating very soon, which shows that there
   is no large range of these two structural elements in any direction. The
   omnidirectional experimental semivariogram of the number of trees
   increases relatively quickly so this structural element shows the
   poorest spatial correlation (Figure 3c). The omnidirectional
   experimental semivariogram is approximated with the theoretical (Table
   2, Figure 3). Sample distribution maps (Figures 4, 5 and 6) show an
   estimated value of structural elements on either coordinates (x, y).
   Structural elements' assessments through kriging and inverse distance
   method are tested with cross-validation and a root mean square error was
   used as an accuracy benchmark (Table 4). The mean square errors of
   assessment methods are very similar and therefore inconclusive when
   determining which interpolation method is more acceptable. Thus, a
   testing of the value differences between the measured data and
   interpolation methods for the three structural elements (number of
   trees, basal area and volume) was done by using the analysis of variance
   of repeated measurements. As visible in Table 5, statistically
   significant difference between the measurement data and interpolation
   methods of kriging and inverse distance was not determined.
   During the assessment of structural elements' value (Figures 7, 8, 9) it
   is visible that the kriging assessment is more compatible with range of
   measurement values for all three structural elements, while inverse
   distance method measurements have a significantly lower value range (in
   other words model cells assessment tend to be around the mean value of
   incoming data). Consequently, this research considers kriging as the
   acceptable interpolation method when compared to inverse distance
   method.
   The making of semivariogram cloud is a useful tool because it allows the
   observation of each variable (structural element) as a distance function
   (shown on the x-axis) between measured data (variogram values between
   pairs are shown on the y-axis) within the analyzed area (view of the
   forest are with locations where measurements were done) on an
   interactive interface.
   In geostatistics the size of area and variable is not a limiting
   element. Any variable obtained through forest inventory, by tree type or
   total, can be observed by using a geostatistical analysis. The only
   condition is that some form of autocorrelation is assumed between them.
   Since forest inventory is conducted periodically, the geostatistical
   method which allows the possibility of monitoring forests in space
   (spatial structure), also allows monitoring forests in time. The changes
   of variable(s) in space and time (change of structural elements' values
   by tree type and total, health of forests, etc.), as well as the forest
   management itself can thus be monitored by continuously mapping two or
   more successive measurements. In addition, the above mentioned approach
   also enables the control of forest measurements.
   By doing the forest inventory, a lot of information is gathered on the
   state of forests. Geomathematical tools (geostatistical and neural)
   enable the data to be used in a more relevant and rational way in space
   and time, in order to manage forests in a more optimal way.},

Title = {Assessment of skin response in T4b breast carcinoma patients
   post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy},
Journal = {ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Background: Breast cancer patients with skin ulcerations, satellite
   nodules or Peau d'orange at presentation are classified with stage 4
   breast cancer (T4b). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), followed by
   mastectomy, is the commonly accepted treatment in such patients for fear
   of adverse outcomes with breast conservation surgery (BCS) and
   uncertainty over sparing initially involved skin irrespective of the
   response to chemotherapy. Identifying patients with skin resolution
   post-NACT can help surgeons in decision-making.
   Aim: To assess skin response in T4b breast cancer patients post-NACT and
   find the correlation between various clinical and pathological factors
   associated with no skin involvement on final histology.
   Methodology: Records of breast cancer patients managed at the Tata
   Medical Center, Kolkata, with NACT for T4b breast carcinoma patients who
   underwent mastectomy were reviewed between January 2014 and December
   2018. Final histology was checked for dermal involvement with the
   tumour. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables for
   descriptive data, and Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact tests
   were applied for categorical data. p-value < 0.05 was taken as
   significant.
   Results: A total of 285 records mentioning skin involvement were
   reviewed, out of which 111 patients fulfilled the AJCC criterion. The
   median age at diagnosis of T4b breast cancer was 50 years. The median
   clinical size pre-chemotherapy was 7 cm. Residual median tumour size on
   final histology was reported as 1 cm. 78/111 patients showed a postNACT
   response of 50\% or more, and 43/111 showed a response of more than
   90\%. 57 (51.4\%) patients showed skin involvement on final
   histopathology, while 54 (48.6\%) patients did not. ER negative tumours
   were more likely to show no dermal involvement (p = 0.006). Residual
   tumour size of less than 1 cm on final histology (p < 0.05) and nodal
   stage were significant predictors of dermal response.
   Conclusion: Approximately half of the T4b breast cancer patients showed
   resolution of dermal skin involvement post-NACT. ER negative and those
   with residual tumour size less than 1 cm post-NACT are more likely to
   show dermal resolution. This can help surgeons plan a BCS or skin
   sparing mastectomy for such patients who usually end up having a
   mastectomy.},

Title = {Torrential Hazard Prevention in Alpine Small Basin through Historical,
   Empirical and Geomorphological Cross Analysis in NW Italy},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Debris flow is one of the most dangerous natural processes in mountain
   regions and it occur in a wide variety of environments throughout the
   world. In the Italian Alps, some tens of thousands of damaging debris
   flow and, in general, torrential floods associated to intense sediment
   transport in secondary catchments have been documented in the last 300
   years. These have caused socio-economic damage, damage to anthropogenic
   structures or infrastructures and in many cases casualties. Often, in
   the same basins, the occurrence of debris-flow processes recurs many
   years later. Prediction can often be spatial and based on the magnitude
   of the largest known process, while the temporal forecast is the most
   uncertain. It is also possible to increase the resilience of the
   population and of the territory. The present study aims at investigating
   different levels of debris-flow hazard in urban areas on Alpine alluvial
   fans and proposes a strategy for debris-flow prevention based on
   historical research and on a simplified analytical approach, methods
   that also involve relatively low costs. For such analysis, Ischiator
   stream catchment (ca. 20 km(2)) and its alluvial fan (NW Italy) were
   selected. This area was partly affected by historical torrential flood
   associated to intense sediment transport and debris-flow processes.
   Present-day instability conditions along the slope and the stream
   network were detected and synthesized through surveys and aerial photo
   interpretation integrated by satellite images (period 1954-2021). An
   estimation of the potential amount of moving detritus, referred to as
   debris flow, was carried out regarding the June 1957 debris-flow event,
   based on the predictive models. The individual hazard index value was
   estimated based on different methods. The results indicate that 56\% of
   the area is exposed to flood associated to intense sediment transport
   hazard, which fluctuates from high to very high levels; such results are
   supported by debris-flow historical records. Since today almost half of
   the settlement (Bagni di Vinadio) is located on potentially risk-exposed
   areas, the urban evolution policy adopted after the 1957 event failed to
   manage the risk connection to debris-flow activity.},

Abstract = {Generating land capability class guidelines at a watershed scale has
   become a priority in sustainable agricultural land use. This study
   analyzed the area of cultivated land use situated on the non-arable
   land-capability class in the Jema watershed in the Upper Blue Nile River
   Basin. Soil surveys, meteorological ground observations, a digital
   elevation model (DEM) at 30 m, Meteosat at 10 km x 10 km and Landsat at
   30 m were used to generate the sample soil texture class, average annual
   total rainfall (ATRF in mm), terrain, slope (\%), elevation (m a.s.l)
   and land-use land cover (\%). The land capability class was analyzed by
   considering raster layers of terrain, the average ATRF and soil texture.
   Geo-statistics was employed to fit a surface of soil texture and average
   ATRF estimates. An overlay technique was used to compute the proportion
   of cultivated land placed on non-arable land. As per the results of the
   terrain analysis, the elevation (m a.s.l) of the watershed is in the
   range of 1895 to 3518 m. The slope was found to be in the range of 0 to
   45\%. The amount of estimated rainfall ranged from 1640 to 131 mm with
   value declined from the lower to the higher elevation. Clay loam, clay
   and heavy clay were found to be the major soil texture classes. Four
   land capability classes, i.e., II, III, IV (arable) and V (non-arable),
   were identified with proportions of 28.56\%, 45.74\%, 22.16\% and
   3.54\%, respectively. Seven land-use land covers were identified, i.e.,
   annual crop land, grazing land, bush land, bare land, settlement land,
   forestland and water bodies, with proportions of 42.1, 35.9, 8.90, 8.3,
   2.6, 2.1, and 0.2, respectively. Around 1707.7 ha of land in the
   watershed is categorized under non-arable land that cannot be used for
   annual crop cultivation at any level of intensity. Around 437 ha (3.5\%)
   of land was cultivated on non-arable land. To conclude, the observed
   unsustainable crop land use could maximize soil loss in upstream regions
   and siltation and flooding downstream. The annual crop land use that was
   observed on non-arable land needs to be replaced with perennial crops,
   pasture and/or forest land uses.},

Title = {SGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy practice for right-sided breast cancer
   combined with RNI: A retrospective study on dosimetry and setup accuracy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {BackgroundWe retrospectively studied the dosimetry and setup accuracy of
   deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) radiotherapy in right-sided breast
   cancer patients with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who had completed
   treatment based on surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT) technology by
   Sentinel/Catalyst system, aiming to clarify the clinical application
   value and related issues. MethodsDosimetric indicators of four organs at
   risk (OARs), namely the heart, right coronary artery (RCA), right lung,
   and liver, were compared on the premise that the planning target volume
   met dose-volume prescription requirements. Meanwhile, the patients were
   divided into the edge of the xiphoid process (EXP), sternum middle (SM),
   and left breast wall (LBW) groups according to different positions of
   respiratory gating primary points. The CBCT setup error data of the
   three groups were contrasted for the treatment accuracy study, and the
   effects of different gating window heights on the right lung volume
   increases were compared among the three groups. ResultsCompared with
   free breath (FB), DIBH reduced the maximum dose of heart and RCA by
   739.3 +/- 571.2 cGy and 509.8 +/- 403.8 cGy, respectively (p < 0.05).
   The liver changed the most in terms of the mean dose (916.9 +/- 318.9
   cGy to 281.2 +/- 150.3 cGy, p < 0.05). The setup error of the EXP group
   in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction was 3.6 +/- 4.5 mm, which is
   the highest among the three groups. The right lung volume increases in
   the EXP, SM, and LBW groups were 72.3\%, 69.9\%, and 67.2\%,
   respectively (p = 0.08), and the corresponding breath-holding heights
   were 13.5 +/- 3.7 mm, 10.3 +/- 2.4 mm, and 9.6 +/- 2.8 mm, respectively
   (p < 0.05). ConclusionsSGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy can better protect
   the four OARs of right-sided breast cancer patients with RNI. Different
   respiratory gating primary points have different setup accuracy and
   breath-hold height.},

Title = {An Optimized Random Forest Model and Its Generalization Ability in

Abstract = {Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide
   susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the
   same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the
   models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been
   explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest
   (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then
   explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model
   is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two
   typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological
   conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide
   inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images,
   and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in
   Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of
   topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were
   prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical
   ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were
   adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based
   model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was
   applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix
   and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value
   (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model
   delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County,
   indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where
   the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the
   Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the
   Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other
   than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study
   could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain
   and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting
   landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve
   efficiency in practice.},

Abstract = {Psoriasis is a chronic, disabling disease in which adherence to
   treatment is often poor. The aim of this article is to highlight the
   problem of adherence to long-term treatment in psoriasis and the factors
   that contribute to it, and to discuss how adherence, and thus outcomes,
   can be improved. This article is based on a presentation given by the
   authors at a satellite symposium held during the 19th Congress of the
   European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, 6-10 October, 2010, in
   Gothenburg, Sweden. Adherence to topical medication is a major problem
   in psoriasis. Not only are prescriptions not being filled by patients
   (primary adherence) but topical medications are not being used as
   recommended (secondary adherence). The issue is complex due to the many
   factors which affect adherence, including efficacy, ease of use and
   convenience of application, and the healthcare professional-patient
   relationship. Due to the nature of the disease, patients suffer poor
   self-image and feel stigmatized, particularly when psoriasis is present
   on a visible part of the body. Consequently, the negative impact of
   psoriasis on patient quality of life underlies many adherence issues. It
   is therefore important for treatment to address the psychological
   aspects as well as the physical symptoms of psoriasis. Improvements in
   several areas of disease management may lead to benefits in medication
   adherence and hence clinical benefit. Prescribing therapy in line with
   patient preference for treatment vehicle and improving the healthcare
   professional-patient relationship may be key factors. Nurses have an
   important role in educating patients and delivering long-term care. This
   individualized, personal, approach may help improve treatment adherence,
   outcomes, and the quality of life for patients with psoriasis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {324-325},

Abstract = {One problem during offshore well-test operations, stimulations, and
   routine workovers are discharges into the air and sea while flaring.
   These procedures are usually performed by mobile drilling rigs with no
   storage capacity, and thus, hydrocarbons sequestered must be burned off
   from the rig flare booms. Another major problem has been the inability
   of the flare to operate at high flow rates. Because the burning process
   slows the pace of a test, restricting full flow testing, valuable well
   information is lost. Flaring of hydrocarbons also represents an economic
   loss. In the case of oil rigs, for example, flaring not only emits CO2
   into the atmosphere but also burns off usable oil.
   The Crystal Sea well-test vessel was designed to address the problems
   inherent to flaring and, at the same time, provide cost efficiency by
   salvaging usable oil during well testing. The success of her initial two
   jobs on the Statfjord North satellite field in the Norwegian sector of
   the North Sea confirms that sale of the salvaged oil normally lost
   during the flaring process could generate sufficient economic return to
   pay for the vessel. In addition, with its capability to receive products
   at twice the flow rate of conventional methods, the increased accuracy
   of the technical information obtained from the well test further
   enhances its value for improved reservoir management.},

Title = {A Statistical Approach to Mapping Flood Susceptibility in the Lower
   Connecticut River Valley Region},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region
   attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a
   quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors
   considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or
   flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial
   materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at
   point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within
   or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year
   Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley
   Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess
   the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between
   different region types; for each region flood risk factors were
   extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or
   outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were
   obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the
   greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal
   subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate
   in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood
   susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban
   regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional
   logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk
   (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and
   included several types of infrastructure critical for human health,
   safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic
   regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood
   susceptibility.
   Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and
   potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can
   come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding.
   Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term
   planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all
   critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas
   that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future
   is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such
   awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of
   regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to
   natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study
   estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River
   Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not
   related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood
   risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a
   statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent
   variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1,
   respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent
   variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to
   flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which
   sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk
   factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope,
   land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land
   cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to
   drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The
   objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent
   variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood
   event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It
   was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the
   LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current
   analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency
   Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate
   areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the
   SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they
   allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be
   estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify
   additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The
   LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to
   accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk
   factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between
   inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were
   randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor.
   An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were
   within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each
   flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location
   was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between
   each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that
   regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the
   magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk
   factor's influence on flooding in a subregion.
   It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most
   influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas
   distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion.
   The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase
   the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for
   each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all
   locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each
   subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of
   the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low
   risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very
   high risk (80-100\%). It was observed that several areas classified as
   very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several
   types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education
   were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets
   that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require
   additional flood risk mitigation.},

Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) have gained importance due to
   their widespread distribution, their host range and damage potential
   (Hussey \& Janssen, 2002). A recent survey on root-knot nematodes in
   Europe by Wesemael et al. (2011) showed that out of the 90 species
   described so far, 23 have been found in Europe. Furthermore, this survey
   showed that three species, namely Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and
   M. javanica, are the most prevalent in southern European countries and
   in protected cultivation systems in the northern parts of Europe. These
   species can cause significant economic losses due to yield and quality
   reduction on high value crops. Rootknot nematode species are normally
   identified using morphological features and morphometrics on
   second-stage juveniles (J2), males, on the perineal patterns of mature
   females or isozyme phenotyping of females (Hunt \& Handoo, 2009). As the
   J2 stage is readily available from soil, and identifying this stage is
   most useful for making appropriate management decisions, several
   molecular methods, such as the use of restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms (RFLP), satellite DNA probes, sequence characterised
   amplified regions (SCAR) and real-time PCR assays, have become the
   preferred method for identification (Blok \& Powers, 2009). However, few
   of these methods enable the simultaneous identification of several
   nematode species within one sample.},

Title = {Dataset on the global distribution of shallow groundwater},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Shallow groundwater (GW), defined as the water table of unconfined or
   perched aquifers that is near enough to the land surface to influence
   the vadose zone and the surface soil moisture, impacts land surface
   water, energy, and car -bon cycles by providing additional moisture to
   the root zone via capillary fluxes. Although the interactions of shallow
   GW and the terrestrial land surface are widely recognized,
   in-corporating shallow GW into the land surface, climate, and
   agroecosystem models is not yet possible due to the lack of groundwater
   data. Groundwater systems are affected by var-ious factors, including
   climate, land use/land cover, ecosys-tems, GW extractions, and
   lithology. Although GW wells are the most direct and accurate way of
   monitoring water table depths at point scales, upscaling GW levels from
   point scale to areal or regional scale poses significant challenges.
   Here, we provide high spatiotemporal resolution global maps of the
   terrestrial land surface areas influenced by shallow GW from mid-2015 to
   2021 (a separate NetCDF file for each year) in a 9 km spatial and daily
   temporal resolution. We derived this data from NASA's Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) mission spaceborne soil moisture observations with
   a temporal resolution of 3 days and approximately 9 km grid resolution.
   This spatial scale corresponds to SMAP's ``Equal Area Scalable Earth ``
   (EASE) grids. The central assumption is that the monthly moving average
   of soil moisture observa-tions and their coefficient of variation are
   sensitive to shal-low GW regardless of the prevailing climate. We
   process the Level-2 enhanced passive soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP\_E)
   product to detect shallow GW signals. The presence of shal-low GW data
   is calculated by an ensemble machine learn-ing model, which is trained
   using simulations from a variably saturated soil moisture flow model
   (Hydrus-1D). The simula-tions span various climates, soil textures, and
   lower bound-ary conditions.The spatiotemporal distribution of shallow GW
   data based on SMAP soil moisture observations is provided for the first
   time with this dataset. The data are of value in a wide variety of
   applications. The most direct use is in climate and land sur-face models
   as lower boundary conditions or as a diagnostic tool to verify model
   results. Some other applications may in-clude flood risk analyses and
   regulation, identifying geotech-nical issues such as shallow
   GW-triggered liquefaction, global food security, ecosystem services,
   watershed management, crop yield, vegetation health, water storage
   trends, and track-ing mosquito-borne diseases by identifying wetlands,
   among other applications.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {This article describes a spatial prediction method that predicts the
   monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly field from the land only
   data. The land data are from the Global Historical Climatology Network
   (GHCN). The prediction period is 1880-1999 and the prediction ocean
   domain extends from 60degreesS to 60degreesN with a spatial resolution
   5degrees x 5degrees. The prediction method is a regression over the
   basis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), The EOFs are computed
   from the following data sets: (a) the Climate Prediction Center's
   optimally interpolated sea surface temperature (OI/SST) data
   (1982-1999); (b) the National Climatic Data Center's blended product of
   land-surface air temperature (1992-1999) produced from combining the
   Special Satellite Microwave Imager and GHCN: and (c) the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research Reanalysis data (1982-1999). The optimal prediction method
   minimizes the first-M-mode mean square error between the true and
   predicted anomalies over both land and ocean. In the optimization
   process, the data errors of the GHCN boxes are used, and their
   contribution to the prediction error is taken into account. The
   area-averaued root mean square error of prediction is calculated.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate that this EOF prediction method can
   accurately recover the global SST anomalies during some circulation
   patterns and add value to the SST bias correction in the early history
   of SST observations and the validation of general circulation models.
   Our results show that (i) the land only data can accurately predict the
   SST anomaly in the El Nino months when the temperature anomaly structure
   has very large correlation scales, and (ii) the predictions for La Nina,
   neutral. or transient months require more EOF modes because of the
   presence of the small scale structures in the anomaly field. Copyright

Title = {Factors Associated With a Patient's Decision to Select a Cost-effective
   vs the Most Effective Therapy for Their Own Eye Disease},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Importance Ten percent of the Medicare Part B budget is spent on
   aflibercept, used to treat a myriad of ocular neovascular diseases. A
   substantial portion of these costs can be attributed to a few hundred
   ophthalmologists, raising concerns regarding the influence of
   pharmaceutical companies on the choice of medication by a relatively
   small group of clinicians. One approach to protect patients' health care
   interests is to include them in deliberations on the choice of therapy
   for their eye disease.
   Objective To examine factors associated with patients' choice between an
   effective and less expensive off-label drug or a more effective, but
   also more expensive, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
   drug.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort analysis
   used data from the satellite office of a tertiary referral center from
   August 2, 2013, to April 9, 2018. Insured patients initiating treatment
   with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor were included in the
   analysis. Data were analyzed from March 26, 2018, to June 10, 2020.
   Interventions Patients were asked to choose between bevacizumab
   (approximately \$100 per dose), a chemotherapy that is effective, but
   not FDA approved, for the treatment of ocular vascular disease, or
   aflibercept (approximately \$2000 per dose), an FDA-approved drug for
   ocular vascular disease that may be more effective than bevacizumab in
   some patients. Independent of this choice, patients were separately
   asked by a study coordinator to participate in an invasive clinical
   study for which they would not be compensated, there was a small risk
   for an adverse event, and they would not personally benefit from
   participating (a surrogate marker for altruism).
   Main Outcomes and Measures Factors associated with patients' choice of
   medication, including age, sex, ocular disease, race, and participation
   in an invasive clinical study.
   Results A total of 189 patients were included in the analysis (106 women
   {[}56\%]; mean {[}SEM] age, 74.6 {[}0.8] years). Despite being told that
   it may not be as effective as aflibercept, 100 patients (53\%) selected
   bevacizumab for their own eye care. An act of altruism (ie,
   participation in an invasive clinical study) when the patient was making
   a choice between the 2 drugs was associated with a patient's choice of
   bevacizumab (odds ratio {[}OR], 7.03; 95\% CI, 2.27-21.80; P < .001);
   the OR for selecting bevacizumab for patients who never agreed to
   participate in the clinical study was 0.45 (95\% CI, 0.25-0.83; P =
   .001). Age (OR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.03; P = .86), race (OR, 0.70; 95\%
   CI, 0.41-1.22; P = .21), sex (OR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.39-1.35; P = .31),
   presence of diabetes (OR, 1.52; 95\% CI, 0.59-3.93; P = .39), and type
   of eye disease (OR, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.30-1.04; P = .07) were not
   associated with choice of therapy.
   Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that clinicians must
   consider the ethical implications of the influence of altruism when
   patients participate in the decision between cost-effective vs the most
   effective medicines for their own health care.},

Abstract = {Throughout the VEGETATION programme, the Flemish Institute for
   Technological Research (VITO) uninterruptedly hosted the prime user
   segment of both VEGETATION 1 and VEGETATION 2 multispectral instruments
   on board the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre 4 (SPOT 4) and
   SPOT 5 satellites. Operational since the launch of SPOT 4 in March 1998,
   and foreseen to continue at least until the end of the SPOT 5 mission
   (anticipated in spring 2014), this user segment comprises a processing
   facility (PF), actively receiving, processing, correcting, archiving,
   and distributing the VEGETATION data and derived added-value products.
   First and foremost, the VEGETATION programme has been serving the needs
   of operational users - both institutional and commercial - requesting
   data in near-real time. However, scientific and educational users too
   benefited significantly, in particular from VEGETATION's unique time
   series of the Earth's land cover, and more specifically the vegetation
   cover. Over the years, the centralized archive houses processed data
   covering the equivalent of 11,000 times the Earth's surface, and
   delivered more than 50 terapixels to around 10.000 users. As such,
   VEGETATION's mission is a prime example of what Europe wants to achieve
   through the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES)
   initiative: truly operational services providing reliable and up-to-date
   information.This article describes the processing facility, the way the
   data and products are archived, the different dissemination channels as
   well as the data policy adopted and the users served. One of the recent
   evolutions, the development of an entirely new product distribution
   facility (PDF), implemented as part of the Project for On-Board Autonomy
   - Vegetation (PROBA-V) user segment is discussed.},

Title = {Low efficiency of large volcanic eruptions in transporting very fine ash
   into the atmosphere},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Volcanic ash clouds are common, often unpredictable, phenomena generated
   during explosive eruptions. Mainly composed of very fine ash particles,
   they can be transported in the atmosphere at great distances from the
   source, having detrimental socio-economic impacts. However, proximal
   settling processes controlling the proportion (epsilon) of the very fine
   ash fraction distally transported in the atmosphere are still poorly
   understood. Yet, for the past two decades, some operational
   meteorological agencies have used a default value of epsilon = 5\% as
   input for forecast models of atmospheric ash cloud concentration. Here
   we show from combined satellite and field data of sustained eruptions
   that e actually varies by two orders of magnitude with respect to the
   mass eruption rate. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the most intense
   eruptions are in fact the least efficient (with epsilon = 0.1\%) in
   transporting very fine ash through the atmosphere. This implies that the
   amount of very fine ash distally transported in the atmosphere is up to
   50 times lower than previously anticipated. We explain this finding by
   the efficiency of collective particle settling in ash-rich clouds which
   enhance early and en masse fallout of very fine ash. This suggests that
   proximal sedimentation during powerful eruptions is more controlled by
   the concentration of ash than by the grain size. This has major
   consequences for decision-makers in charge of air traffic safety
   regulation, as well as for the understanding of proximal settling
   processes. Finally, we propose a new statistical model for predicting
   the source mass eruption rate with an unprecedentedly low level of
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The geographic patterns of dentists have seldom been studied beyond very
   broad assessment. This article demonstrates, with location quotient and
   hot-spot analyses, the unevenness of general dentist and dental
   specialist resources throughout the Canadian province of Ontario and the
   presence of dental clusters within the metropolitan areas of Toronto,
   Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Windsor. While many municipalities in the
   province have no or relatively few dental offices, municipalities that
   are comparatively rich in both general and specialized dentists are rare
   and tend to be part of larger urban environments (typically census
   metropolitan areas), characterized by higher growth rates, higher median
   incomes, and lower median ages. Dentist office hot-spots within
   metropolitan areas occur in or near the downtown and in more
   peripheral/suburban locales. High sales dentist offices in suburban
   hot-spots appear to benefit from prosperous locations and supply
   deficits nearby, whereas inner-city dentist districts may form in part
   because of localization economies. Understanding where relative dentist
   under-supply occurs within a jurisdiction and why other locations are
   dentist-rich is important from a policy perspective so that geographic
   inequities, and associated spatial accessibility issues, can be more
   comprehensively appraised.

   Les profils geographiques des dentistes ont fait l'objet d'etudes qui,

   et specialistes dans la province canadienne de l'Ontario et de la
   presence de << grappes dentaires >> dans les regions metropolitaines de
   Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, London et Windsor. S'il est vrai que de
   nombreuses municipalites de la province disposent de peu, voire d'aucun
   cabinet de dentiste, les municipalites oU abondent les dentistes
   generalistes et specialistes sont rares et ont tendance a faire partie

Abstract = {The expansion of terrestrial applications including location-based
   services and transportation means such as road or train has fostered the
   design of complex location systems to comply with the needs of these
   applications. In the frame of the service provision ensured by the
   application towards a user or an external entity, these location systems
   are in charge of providing a consolidated information based on the
   position of one or more mobile platforms.
   The complexity of the information reported depends on the type of
   service targeted. It can range from a simple position reporting in the
   case of a low end asset management, to the provision of a reliable
   information (e.g. authenticated and with a mastered uncertainty) on the
   mobile's trajectory for liability critical services such as road
   charging or Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This wide spectrum of
   required technical features calls for a new and broader concept at
   location system level taking into account hybrid solutions in which the
   use of GNSS technologies is complemented with other technology sensors
   to improve the robustness and the performance of the solution.
   Several standards have been generated by different dedicated bodies, in
   order to support the GNSS market development across the various
   application domains mentioned above. For instance, 3GPP Location
   Services (LCS) standards provide minimum performance requirements mainly
   for Assisted-GNSS in the frame of terrestrial telecommunications and
   OMA-LOC LPPe (LTE Positioning Protocol Extensions) defines a
   communication protocol supporting hybridised positioning.
   Nevertheless, there is still a lack of performance specification for a
   large number of terrestrial applications (e.g. electronic fee
   collection, fleet management, container tracking.), including
   multi-modal applications (i.e. those involving various means of
   transport), leading to the development and use of sub-optimal GNSS-based
   systems and solutions.
   The need to unify the different initiatives by concentrating the
   positioning-related standardisation effort for terrestrial applications
   within a single dedicated entity was identified some time ago
   Accordingly, an initiative triggered by a number of industrial and
   institutional stakeholders materialized in the frame of the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This initiative is led by
   the group Satellite Communication and Navigation (SCN) of the Technical
   Committee Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (TC SES), the main
   objective being to elaborate a firm and common standard for GNSS-based
   Location systems. Up to now, the TC-SES has already approved end of 2012
   two Technical Reports related to architectures and application inventory
   which paved the way for the technical specifications to be developed.
   The present paper provides an overview of this on-going standardisation
   work, its objectives and the added-value it will bring. In addition, the
   already approved Technical Specifications will also be presented.
   Thus, the structure of the targeted standard encompasses the four
   following specifications:
   The location system minimum performance requirements, which can be
   considered as the core of the specification work. These requirements are
   determined function of the type of location systems (i.e. association of
   technical enablers), the applicable environmental conditions (depending
   on the type of application), and finally the type of features needed
   (e.g. accuracy, authentication, anti-spoofing, robustness to
   interference).
   The GNSS-based location system reference architecture including the
   interface definition, which is expected to capture a generic and modular
   definition of location systems, thus adaptable to all targeted
   applications.
   The data exchange protocol at location system level (covering in
   particular the handling of the requests from an external application
   provider and the protocol to ensure proper information delivery).
   The test specification (including procedure, scenario and data),
   enabling location system validation versus the previous requirements
   (protocol and performance).
   The methodology used to define the perimeter of the above specifications
   looks for:
   The definition of terrestrial application classes to be covered by the
   standard, including the identification of the key requirements
   (functional and performance) applicable for each application.
   The inventory of the technological enablers taken onboard in the
   standard. These enablers are understood as much as sensor technologies
   (GNSS receivers, Network sensors, inertial sensors, hybridization
   layer), as system layer features allowing Quality of Service (QoS)
   improvements (A-GNSS, D-GNSS, RTK, integrity functions, authentication
   functions).
   The definition of reference environments, derived from the applications'
   typical use cases, and which provide the necessary conditions to
   determine the minimum performance requirements.
   With the ambition to satisfy a wide range of terrestrial applications,
   the standard under preparation, once approved, will surely benefit to
   other standardization groups. Indeed, care is being taken to harmonize
   the work done under TC SES SCN, with standardisation groups in other
   domains. Furthermore, it will also be valuable to actors from markets
   whose specificities do not justify the existence of a dedicated
   standard. All these stakeholders will thus benefit from a more important
   variety of solutions, components and functions available, all of them
   simultaneously compatible to the standard.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest conservation and management can significantly benefit
   from information about the spatial distribution of tree species.
   Very-high resolution (VHR) spaceborne platforms have been hailed as a
   promising technology for mapping tree species over broad spatial
   extents. WorldView-3, the most advanced VHR sensor, provides spectral
   data in 16 bands covering the visible to near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040
   nm) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 1210-2365 nm) wavelength ranges. It
   also collects images at unprecedented levels of details using a
   panchromatic band with 0.3-m of spatial resolution. However, the
   potential of WorldView-3 at its full spectral and spatial resolution for
   tropical tree species classification remains unknown. In this study, we
   performed a comprehensive assessment of WorldView-3 images acquired in
   the dry and wet seasons for tree species discrimination in tropical
   semi-deciduous forests. Classification experiments were performed using
   VNIR individually and combined with SWIR channels. To take advantage of
   the sub-metric resolution of the panchromatic band for classification,
   we applied an individual tree crown (ITC)-based approach that employed
   pan sharpened VNIR bands and gray level co-occurrence matrix texture
   features. We determined whether the combination of images from the two
   annual seasons improves the classification accuracy. Finally, we
   investigated which plant traits influenced species detection. The new
   SWIR sensing capabilities of WorldView-3 increased the average
   producer's accuracy up to 7.8\%, by enabling the detection of
   non-photosynthetic vegetation within ITCs. The combination of VNIR bands
   from the two annual seasons did not improve the classification results
   when compared to the results obtained using images from each season
   individually. The use of VNIR bands at their original 1.2-m spatial
   resolution yielded average producer's accuracies of 43.1 +/- 3.1\% and
   38.8 +/- 3\% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The ITC -based
   approach improved the accuracy to 70 +/- 8\% in the wet and 68.4 +/-
   7.4\% in the dry season. Texture analysis of the panchromatic band
   enabled the detection of species-specific differences in crown
   structure, which improved species detection. The use of texture
   analysis, pan-sharpening, and ITC delineation is a potential approach to
   perform tree species classification in tropical forests with WorldView-3
   satellite images.},

Abstract = {The current work is aimed to realizing land suitability and water use
   efficiency and determining the optimum land use system. The main aims
   were to identify the physiographic futures and calculate the crop water
   requirements for specific crops. The study area was observed through a
   soil survey inventory in Paris Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt. Ten soil
   profiles plus a number of auger observations and mini pits were selected
   to represent the different mapping units. A fieldwork and morphological
   description were carried out, and soil samples were collected for
   demonstrating the physical and chemical soil properties. Based on
   satellite data that can integrate with GIS utility, field work, and
   laboratory analysis, the physiographic map was generated. The study
   found that the main land type units are plateaus, hills, dunes, and
   depression floor. Concerning the second aim, the main land qualities of
   different mapping units were rated and matched to obtain the current and
   potential land suitability using automated land evaluation system. This
   research concluded that the best crops adapted with the soil conditions
   and could be feasible for economic use are clover, wheat, beans, sugar
   beet, onions, maize, sunflower, tomato, potato, groundnut, pea, lentil,
   barley, sesame, and carrots. Crop water requirements were determined in
   variable rate according to the actual plant requirements using the aid
   of FAO-Cropwat model. Irrigation schedule and consumptive use of
   suitable crops were calculated and adopted. The crop water requirements
   for each selected crop were determined as follow: 828.0, 596.7, 410.3,
   679.95, 409.52, 791.60, 712.2, 902.93, 456.55, 529.95, 231.4, 217.95,

Abstract = {Geomagnetic storms play a critical role in space weather physics with
   the potential for far reaching economic impacts including power grid
   outages, air traffic rerouting, satellite damage and GPS disruption. The
   LFM-MIX is a state-of-the-art coupled magnetospheric-ionospheric model
   capable of simulating geomagnetic storms. Imbedded in this model are
   physical equations for turning the magnetohydrodynamic state parameters
   into energy and flux of electrons entering the ionosphere, involving a
   set of input parameters. The exact values of these input parameters in
   the model are unknown, and we seek to quantify the uncertainty about
   these parameters when model output is compared to observations. The
   model is available at different fidelities: a lower fidelity which is
   faster to run, and a higher fidelity but more computationally intense
   version. Model output and observational data are large spatiotemporal
   systems; the traditional design and analysis of computer experiments is
   unable to cope with such large data sets that involve multiple
   fidelities of model output. We develop an approach to this inverse
   problem for large spatiotemporal data sets that incorporates two
   different versions of the physical model. After an initial design, we
   propose a sequential design based on expected improvement. For the
   LFM-MIX, the additional run suggested by expected improvement diminishes
   posterior uncertainty by ruling out a posterior mode and shrinking the
   width of the posterior distribution. We also illustrate our approach
   using the Lorenz `96 system of equations for a simplified atmosphere,
   using known input parameters. For the Lorenz `96 system, after
   performing sequential runs based on expected improvement, the posterior
   mode converges to the true value and the posterior variability is
   reduced.},

Title = {DEPLOYMENT: SWIM COMMON PKI AND POLICIES \& PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHING
   A TRUST FRAMEWORK},

Abstract = {The project aims at developing and deploying a common framework for both
   integrating local PKI (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509 digital
   certificates) deployments in an interoperable manner as well as
   providing interoperable digital certificates to the users of SWIM. The
   resulting PKI and its associated trust framework, which will be part of
   the cyber security infrastructure of aviation systems, are required to
   sign, emit and maintain digital certificates and revocation lists as
   required in the PCP (Pilot Common Project) family 5.1.4. The digital
   certificates will allow user authentication and encryption/decryption
   when and where needed in order to ensure that information can be
   securely transferred. All aviation Stakeholders (ANSPs, Airspace users,
   MIL, Airport, etc ...) will benefit from the project.
   The scope of the project includes the definition and development of a
   dedicated common PKI and its associated trust framework for European
   aviation, its integration and validation with some Stakeholders. It will
   ensure the interoperability of digital certificates within Europe and
   with other regions. Although the initial intent was to deliver
   certificates for SWIM, this solution will provide its services to other
   potential users such as e.g. ATS Message Handling System (AMHS), future
   Data Link Services, Satellite Based Augmentation System, Radar sensors.
   The project will develop interoperability/cross-certification framework
   (criteria, checklist). This sub-task will define the criteria that will
   have to be satisfied by the developed and deployed Bridge/PKI platform
   in order to be cross-certified by another Bridge/PKI. The
   cross-certification criteria (some kind of audit list) will be both ways
   as they will also have to be applied to other Bride(s)/PKI(s). The
   cross-certification process, steps and outcome (form) will be described
   to ensure that the full process is known and can be communicated to
   other candidate regional Bridges/PKIs.
   The project will aim at ensuring interoperability with others PKIs e.g.
   US Federal Bridge (USFB). Once developed, the cross-certification
   criteria will be submitted the USFB for validation. A prototype will be
   as well developed to demonstrate the concept based on scenarios defined
   jointly with the FAA as part of this sub-task. Such demonstration will
   also support the validation of the platform function, technical and
   operational requirements. The FAA will develop its part of the
   demonstrator.
   This project will work in close cooperation with the ICAO related
   initiatives so-called INNOVA/ACORNS (Aviation Community Operational
   Resilience Network Services) which intend to set a global framework for
   the use of digital certificates in aviation.
   The project was initiated on November 12th 2018. It is planned to be
   completed by no later than end 2021. The main challenge of this project
   lies in the governance and business model that will be accepted to
   develop (through Call For Tenders) and operate the service (e.g. a la
   NewPENS or other model).},

Note = {Meeting on Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Whistler, CANADA,
   SEP, 2006},
Abstract = {There is a continuing increase in gastroesophageal reflux disease
   (GERD), its diverse manifestations and complications worldwide. Indeed
   the substantial increase in Asia remains is a major epidemiologic and a
   developing health care issue. This manifesto provides a contemporary
   review of the current status of areas of uncertainty and in particular
   highlights the lack of knowledge and unmet needs in the field of GERD
   biology and especially management. There seems to be no widely accepted
   rationale for the increasing incidence and prevalence of GERD globally.
   Although consideration has been given to the decline in Helicobacter
   pylori infection, others consider the steadily growing problem of
   obesity as the most likely etiologic factor. What actually comprises the
   disease entity of GERD continues to confound physicians, and the steady
   increase in new definitions suggests that a clear picture is still
   emerging. Of note, however, is the rising awareness of its protean
   systemic manifestations and the fact that while erosive reflux disease
   is easily recognizable endoscopically, nonerosive disease (NERD)
   comprises the majority of presentations in many populations. In view of
   this, GERD-specific questionnaires and other evaluative tools have been
   designed to capture the multidimensional nature of the symptom complexes
   in GERD patients who for the most part may have no endoscopic evidence
   of disease. Such tools have obvious utility in the evaluation of changes
   with treatment, especially because there is no endoscopic abnormality
   detectable. The recognition that NERD is becoming a major clinical
   entity that requires substantial further investigation is now clearly
   apparent. At this time, however, little is known of the cellular barrier
   mechanisms of the esophagus and what is responsible for their
   reconstitution after injury. Similarly, the neural basis of esophageal
   pain appreciation, or its relation to the visceral sensory mechanisms
   that may link NERD with aspects of functional bowel disease are as yet
   ill understood. Apart from the clinical concern with symptom-focused
   issues, it is the specter of Barrett esophagus, the most-feared
   complication of GERD that mostly continues to drive endoscopic practice
   in GERD. At this time, however, current surveillance strategies remain
   severely limited in their ability to adequately detect or prevent most
   esophageal adenocarcinoma. Although considerable effort has been
   directed at defining the neural circuitry of the esophagus in terms of
   both motility and sensation, the topography and function of the
   esophageal-brain-gut axis in respect of the generation of esophageal
   symptoms remains terra incognita. At this time therefore acid
   suppression remains the mainstay of therapy in terms of treating the
   GERD/NERD disease process. Despite the efficacy of the currently
   available proton pump inhibitor class of drugs, there are clearly unmet
   needs in this area and agents with a more rapid onset of action and
   prolonged effect, particularly at night remain important goals in the
   future advance of pharmacotherapy.},

Title = {Advancements in Imaging Technology: Do They (or Will They) Equate to

Abstract = {It is generally accepted that up to 50\% of those with a whiplash injury
   following a motor vehicle collision will fail to fully recover.
   Twenty-five percent of these patients will demonstrate a markedly
   complex clinical picture that includes severe pain-related disability,
   sensory and motor disturbances, and psychological distress. A number of
   psychosocial factors have shown prognostic value for recovery following
   whiplash from a motor vehicle collision. To date, no management approach
   (eg, physical therapies, education, psychological interventions, or
   interdisciplinary strategies) for acute whiplash has positively
   influenced recovery rates. For many of the probable pathoanatomical
   lesions (eg, fracture, ligamentous rupture, disc injury), there remains
   a lack of available clinical tests for identifying their Presence.
   Fractures, particularly at the craniovertebral and cervicothoracic
   junctions, may be radiographically occult. While high-resolution
   computed tomography scans can detect fractures, there remains a lack of
   prevalence data for fractures in this population. Conventional magnetic
   resonance imaging has not consistently revealed lesions in patients with
   acute or chronic whiplash, a ``failure{''} that may be due to
   limitations in the resolution of available devices and the use of
   standard sequences. The technological evolution of imaging techniques
   and sequences eventually might provide greater resolution to reveal
   currently elusive anatomical lesions (or, perhaps more importantly,
   temporal changes in physiological responses to assumed lesions) in those
   patients at risk of poor recovery. Preliminary findings from 2
   prospective cohort studies in 2 different countries suggest that this is
   so, as evidenced by changes to the structure of skeletal muscles in
   those who do not fully recover. In this clinical commentary, we will
   briefly introduce the available imaging decision rules and the current
   knowledge underlying the pathomechanics and pathophysiology of whiplash.
   We will then acknowledge known prognostic factors underlying functional
   recovery. Last, we will highlight emerging evidence regarding the
   pathobiology of muscle degeneration/regeneration, as well as
   advancements in neuroimaging and musculoskeletal imaging techniques (eg,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetization transfer imaging,
   spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging) that may be used as
   noninvasive and objective complements to known prognostic factors
   associated with whiplash recovery, in particular, poor functional
   recovery.},

Title = {COMPARISON OF LANDUSE AND LANDCOVER CHANGES, DRIVERS AND IMPACTS FOR A

Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {47},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Land use and land cover changes are driven by human actions and, in
   turn, drive changes that alter the availability of products and services
   for people and livestock. For proper planning, these cause-and-effect
   interrelations need to be understood. This is especially important for
   Ethiopia where the resource base is declining and should be improved in
   order to feed the growing population. To better understand these
   interrelations, we studied trends in the natural resource base over is
   35-year period for two contrasting sites in the Ethiopian Highlands:
   semi-arid and water-short Lenche Dima, and sub-humid and
   moisture-sufficient Kuhar Michael. Information was obtained using
   time-series satellite images, geographical positioning system, a
   socio-economic survey and a document review Results showed that for
   sub-arid Lenche Dima there were minimal changes in land use and land
   cover patterns, while in water-sufficient Kuhar Michael cropland greatly
   increased at the expense of the grazing land and bare soil. At the same
   time land holding size and cattle numbers decreased in lair die Dima
   while they remained the same in Kuhar Michael, although overall land
   holdings remained larger in Lenche Dima than in Kuhar Michael. This
   study thus found large differences in development of agriculture since
   the 1970s: intensification of agriculture is possible in the
   water-sufficient sub-humid climate by displacing animal husbandry with
   high value crops that need irrigation during the dry monsoon season.
   This is not possible for he semi-arid area where water is the limiting
   factor in production even if a market is close by Agriculture in the
   semi-arid areas also requires larger land holdings because of the risk
   of droughts and low yields during some years. This comparative analysis
   suggests that without sufficient water, the shift from subsistent to
   commercial market-driven agriculture cannot be easily accomplished.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal changes in rate of soil loss and erosion vulnerability
   of selected region in the tropical forests of Borneo during last three
   decades},
Journal = {EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An attempt has been made to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics
   of soil erosion vulnerability and soil loss from the forested region in
   the north-eastern Borneo, Sarawak, Malaysia during the last three
   decades (1991-2015) using the revised universal soil loss equation
   (RUSLE) and geographical information systems (GIS). The components of
   RUSLE such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope-length
   and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P)
   factors were grouped into two categories by keeping one set as
   temporally changing and others as static. Among them the R and C factors
   are calculated for the years 1991, 2001 and 2015 whereas the K and LS
   factors are considered for the single time frame. Because of the
   forested nature of the study area, the P factor is kept constant for the
   whole analysis. The R factor and C factor is shown changes in values and
   its distribution over the years, which reflected in the final soil loss
   and erosion vulnerability map as a change in the rate of erosion and
   spatial domain. The analysis of three time slices has shown that the
   maximum value of the soil loss per unit area i.e. at erosion hotspots,
   is relatively similar throughout at around 1636 to 1744 t/ha/y. This is
   the result of maximum values of R factor and C factor i.e. high rainfall
   erosivity combined with lack of vegetation cover in those hotspots,
   which are generally steeply sloping terrain. The reclassification of
   annual soil loss map into erosion vulnerability zones indicated a major
   increase in the spatial spread of erosion vulnerability from the year
   1991 to 2015 with a significant increase in the high and critical
   erosion areas from 2.3\% (1991) to 31.5\% (2015). In 1991, over 84\% of
   the study area was under low erosion vulnerability class but by the year
   2015 only 12\% was under low erosion vulnerability class. Moreover, a
   dynamic nature in the erosion pattern was found from the year 1991 to
   2015 with more linear areas of land associated with higher rate of soil
   loss and enhanced erosion vulnerability. The linearity in the spatial
   pattern is correlated with the development of logging roads and logging
   activities which has been confirmed by the extraction of exposed areas
   from satellite images of different years of analysis. The findings of
   the present study has quantified the changes in vegetation cover from
   dense, thick tropical forest to open mixed type landscapes which provide
   less protection against erosion and soil loss during the severe rainfall
   events which are characteristic of this tropical region.},

Title = {An optimisation model for incentivising the development of marginal oil
   and gas fields amidst increasingly complex ownership patterns: UKCS case
   study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many recent discoveries in the UKCS have been economically marginal and
   comparatively small such that they are unable to be developed on a
   standalone basis. Nevertheless, there is a proliferation of production
   facilities and transport infrastructure that can, on accepting a tariff,
   process hydrocarbons from these smaller-sized oil and gas fields,
   thereby contributing to the UK Government's strategy of maximising
   economic recovery (MER). However, the empirical dimensions of
   cost-sharing arrangements between a field owner (host field or hub) and
   tie-in (satellite) fields are not well examined in the literature
   although they influence long-term economics in matured oil provinces. In
   this paper, we develop a mixed integer programming optimisation model to
   analyse how these third-party access to infrastructure issues impact MER
   in the UKCS. A first-best situation with only one regional operator is
   empirically compared with the actual situation of multiple ownership. We
   then assess the impact of different infrastructure unbundling provisions
   via pipeline tariff choices and their interaction with the fiscal regime
   on the net present value (NPV) and other project metrics such as timings
   of hub and field shutdowns. We find that differences in field ownership,
   tariff choice and changes to the fiscal regime impact the overall NPV of
   field developments. Our results also show that having a progressive
   fiscal regime in a mature basin such as the UKCS is important to support
   continued operations under low oil prices while increasing the
   government's take at high prices. The cost-sharing effect shows that
   imposing strict cost-sharing rules does not change overall project
   valuations, even in a low oil price scenario. An additional contribution
   to the extant literature is that tariff determination could be based on
   cost-sharing rules that enjoin each field tieback to a hub to pay a
   split tariff, comprised of a fixed cost of service (access charge) and
   variable (marginal) costs.},

Title = {``These Trees Have Stories to Tell{''}: Linking Denesoline Oral History
   of Caribou Use with Trample Scar Frequency on Black Spruce Roots at
   `edacho Kue},

Abstract = {For thousands of years edacho Kue (Artillery Lake, Northwest
   Territories) has been a key water crossing site for barren-ground
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). Human disturbance of
   barren-ground caribou habitat in northern Canada has emerged as an
   important focus of study in the last decade; particularly in the
   Bathurst range of the Northwest Territories where caribou populations
   have declined by more than 95\% since the 1980s. Guided by local
   Indigenous leaders and Elders, a collaborative research project was
   developed with the Denesoline people of Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation
   (2012 - 14). This paper describes linkages between knowledge derived
   from Denesoline oral history and quantitative dendroecological analysis
   of trample scars on black spruce (Picea mariana) root samples collected
   at.edacho Kue to provide a better understanding of caribou use at this
   location. Findings from oral histories and dendroecology analysis were
   consistent with one another and with previous dendroecology study in the
   region, although some discrepancies were detected in data from 1995 -
   2006 that require further study to elucidate. Key findings include
   relatively low caribou use at.edacho Kue during the 1930s and late
   1960s, with use increasing into the 1970s and peaking in the late 1980s,
   as well as Elder and hunter reports of no caribou in some years between
   2005 and 2012. This work addresses a gap in scientific data about
   barren-ground caribou movements at.edacho Kue prior to satellite collar
   use in 1996 and corroborates previously documented oral histories about
   the enduring value of `edacho Kue as critical habitat to barren-ground
   caribou. Given the drastic decline of the Bathurst caribou over the last
   two decades, more research is needed to understand movements and their
   relationship to population dynamics. In this context, the research
   approach described in this paper could be used as an example of how to
   meaningfully bring together place-based Indigenous knowledge and science
   in addressing an urgent issue of Arctic sustainability.},

Title = {Correlation Between Oncotype DX, PREDICT and the Nottingham Prognostic
   Index: Implications for the Management of Early Breast Cancer},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Introduction
   Breast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosis in the UK. The
   current clinical practice utilises two different types of modalities to
   estimate the prognosis, risk of recurrence and benefit from adjuvant
   chemotherapy treatment in patients with early breast cancer. The first
   set of modalities includes risk calculators based on clinicopathological
   features, e.g. PREDICT or the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI); the
   second includes genetic profiling of tumour tissue using Oncotype DX
   (ODX; Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) testing. PREDICT, NPI and ODX
   stratify breast cancers into high-, intermediate- and low-risk
   categories to help guide adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions. This
   study compares PREDICT, NPI and ODX Recurrence Scores (RS), with the aim
   of assessing 1) the correlation between the RS for PREDICT, NPI and ODX
   and 2) whether early breast cancer patients are stratified into similar
   risk categories by all three modalities.
   Methods
   This retrospective study included early breast cancer patients treated
   at a National Health Service (NHS) hospital over a 12-month period
   (October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria: consecutive
   patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth
   factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative and lymph node-negative breast cancer.
   All patients were discussed at the local multidisciplinary team (MDT)
   meeting and underwent ODX testing. Exclusion criteria: patients without
   ODX test scores; patients with an in-breast recurrence; patients who did
   not undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); and patients with
   ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only. NPI and PREDICT scores were
   calculated for each patient using online tools, and ODX data was
   obtained through Genomic Health and MDT records. Patients were
   risk-stratified into high, intermediate and low risk of recurrence
   groups based on their PREDICT, NPI and ODX scores. The thresholds for
   risk stratification were based on current practice, which is
   evidence-based. Correlations between PREDICT, NPI and ODX scores were
   analysed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.
   Results
   Forty-six patients (mean age: 56 years), with a total of 57 early breast
   cancers, underwent ODX testing. Risk categories generated by PREDICT
   very strongly correlated with NPI for all patients (r=0.92; P<0.0001).
   However, the RS generated by ODX testing only strongly correlated for
   patients with low-risk PREDICT scores (r=0.51; P=0.0134), while no
   correlation between RS and PREDICT was observed for patients with
   intermediate- or high-risk PREDICT scores (r=-0.0064; P=0.9767). Similar
   results were seen between NPI and RS. Overall, only 19/46 (41.3\%)
   patients had an RS which corresponded to PREDICT risk category, while
   18/46 (39.1\%) patients had an RS that indicated a higher risk of
   recurrence than PREDICT, and 9/46 (19.6\%) patients had an RS indicating
   a lower risk of recurrence than PREDICT. Similar results were found when
   comparing RS and NPI.
   Conclusion
   The risk of recurrence estimated by ODX in patients deemed low risk by
   PREDICT or NPI highly correlated, while no such correlation existed in
   patients with an estimated intermediate- or high-risk breast cancer. In
   PREDICT- or NPI-estimated intermediate- and high-risk patients, ODX
   provided valuable additional prognostic information to guide adjuvant
   treatment, while the potential avoidance of ODX testing in low-risk
   patients presents significant cost-savings.},

Abstract = {B-learning (blended learning) usually combines classical face-to-face
   classroom methods and computer-mediated activities. It emerges to
   overcome the total absence of human contact in the e-learning
   (electronic learning) which tends to compromise the learning outcomes.
   Professors have an important role in oral explanations and at the same
   new technologies also offer some advantages. Related to the face to face
   methods, they can be partially replaced by virtual classrooms (in mobile
   devices, m-learning) and computer-mediated activities can include
   pre-recorded lectures to improve this method. In this way, students, in
   some subjects, can receive the face education from anywhere without the
   necessity of being physically at the same location where the class
   physically takes place. Therefore, students who do not have the means or
   time to be present can benefit from the advantages of receiving the
   student class anywhere. This paper will explain experiences on Masters,
   Seminars and Courses conducted at the Universidad Catolica of Avila
   (UCAV) and Universidad Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M) during the 2013-2014
   academic year, which has combined both specialties b-learning and
   m-learning. They have combined the (physical or virtual) face education
   taught by teachers with computer-mediated activities.
   Master of Forestry Engineering, Remote Sensing Seminar and GIS
   (Geographical Information Systems) course applied to the Territorial
   Planning could be followed, depending on the personal student
   circumstances, either in person at Universidad Catolica of Avila or from
   their own homes or mobiles devices in virtual classroom (through the
   Blackboard Collaborate platform). Live Audio \& Video panel,
   Participants panel, dynamic Collaboration toolbar whit digital
   slideshows provided students access to the same presentation they would
   see in the actual lecture hall. Chat simulated conversations students
   would have in study groups. Virtual classroom simulated a real-world
   interaction asking frequently questions and using tools as raising hands
   and stepping away from the session and menus for selecting polling
   responses and feedback options. Main drawbacks resulted from video
   issues, poor Internet connections, and mainly Java updating and firewall
   issues. Training (workshop for teachers) and technical support are both
   very important to obtain good results in the frame of virtual
   classrooms.
   Industrial Engineering Master at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid was
   composed of a series of slideshow material focusing on the background
   that the student should master previously to the Master Courses
   ({''}0-course{''}) and pre-recorded lectures offered in moodle-like
   platforms. Students could consult them several times or choose the parts
   of the presentation they need to listen at with more attention. These
   pre-recorded videos were useful to close the gap of some students in a
   not too large interval of time, so they could also focus on the proper
   Master Course subjects. At the same time, students who already had the
   necessary background on the considered topics also took profit of these
   lectures, by consolidating their knowledge on the basis and strengthen
   its application to real practical engineering problems.
   This article will talk about these experiences, academic results and
   discuss about the benefits and drawbacks found by the implementation of
   these techniques.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture estimation is an integral component of operational
   hydrology including flood forecasting, drought monitoring, catchment
   management, and groundwater recharge estimation. Typically, soil
   moisture information is required at variable spatial scales for the
   above applications. As a result, soil moisture data at one spatial scale
   are often aggregated to larger areas or disaggregated to smaller areas
   for a particular application. There is also increasing demand for
   accurate downscaling of satellite derived data to smaller spatial
   resolutions. This transition in spatial scale is often fraught with
   uncertainties because of the high spatio-temporal variability of soil
   moisture. However, the rank of soil moisture at a particular location in
   relation to other spatial locations is widely known to be temporally
   stable at a certain probability. The concept of temporal persistence of
   soil moisture offers the potential to better estimate soil moisture
   across spatial scales. The application of temporal persistence for
   estimation of soil moisture across spatial scales has not been
   thoroughly investigated in the literature. As a result, this study
   examines the relationship between the rank stability of soil moisture
   and physiographic features including vegetation types and soil texture
   groups. This investigation provides physiographic explanations for
   temporal persistence of soil moisture, and therefore facilitate soil
   moisture estimation across scales.
   To assess the estimation across scales, soil moisture data for three
   spatial resolutions of 12-k m, 5-k m, and 1-km data for the Yanco region
   in New South Wales, Australia were used. The soil moisture data for the
   12-k m, 5-k m and 1-k m resolutions are land surface model estimates
   obtained from the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES). The
   vegetation data set was obtained from the Australian National Dynamic
   Land Cover Data set (DLCD). The DLCD was generated from a 16-day
   Enhanced Vegetation Index composite collected at 250-m resolution from
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) for the period
   from 2000 to 2008. The DLCD has land cover features clustered into 34
   ISO classes with descriptions for the structural character of
   vegetation, ranging from cultivated and managed land covers (crops and
   pastures) to natural land covers such as closed forest and sparse, open
   grasslands.
   The soil texture data set was derived from the Digital Atlas of
   Australian Soils which was obtained from the Australian Soil Resource
   Information System (ASRIS). ASRIS provides a digital map of soil types
   and their descriptions, typical ranges for soil properties for each soil
   type, morphology, and physical properties of soil profiles. The soil
   classification in ASRIS has six main textural groups including sands,
   sandy loams, loams, clay loams, clay, and light clays. Moreover, the
   meteorological forcing data including short and long wave incoming
   radiation, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, pressure, and
   specific humidity were obtained from the Australian Community Climate
   Earth-System Simulator - Australian (ACCESS-A) at hourly time step with
   approximately 12-k m spatial resolution. The ACCESS-A precipitation data
   set was bias corrected using a 5-k m gridded precipitation data from the
   Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) data obtained through the
   Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
   The results identified temporally stable locations between the three
   resolution pairs with a percent relative difference of about 6\% maximum
   and 0.1\% minimum; indicating that the overall difference for
   downscaling soil moisture across the three resolution pairs is about 3\%
   of the original value. It was found that temporal stability of soil
   moisture can facilitate downscaling of soil moisture across different
   spatial scales, with improved accuracy for decreasing size of spatial
   resolution. Soil texture and vegetation land cover do not provide strong
   indicators to identify temporally stable locations, with vegetation
   cover having a higher correlation than soil texture because of its high
   homogeneity in the Yanco area.},

Title = {Species-related single dead tree detection using multi-temporal ALS data
   and CIR imagery},

Abstract = {The assessment of the health conditions of trees in forests is extremely
   important for biodiversity, forest management, global environment
   monitoring, and carbon dynamics. There is a vast amount of research
   using remote sensing (RS) techniques for the assessment of the current
   condition of a forest, but only a small number of these are concerned
   with detection and classification of dead trees. Among the available RS
   techniques, only the airborne laser scanner (ALS) enables dead tree
   detection at the single tree level with high accuracy.
   The main objective of the study was to identify spruce, pine and
   deciduous trees by alive or dead classifications. Three RS data sets
   including ALS (leaf-on and leaf-off) and color-infrared (CIR) imagery
   (leaf-on) were used for the study. We used intensity and structural
   variables from the ALS data and spectral information derived from aerial
   imagery for the classification procedure. Additionally, we tested the
   differences in the classification accuracy of all variants contained in
   the data integration. In the study, the random forest (RF) classifier
   was used. The study was carried out in the Polish part of the Bialowieia
   Forest (BF).
   In general, we can state that all classifications, with different
   combinations of ALS features and CIR, resulted in high overall accuracy
   (OA >= 90\%) and Kappa (kappa > 0.86). For the best variant
   (CIR\_ALS(WSn-FH)), the mean values of overall accuracy and Kappa were
   equal to 94.3\% and 0.93, respectively. The leaf -on point cloud
   features alone produced the lowest accuracies (OA = 75-81\% and x =
   0.68-0.76). Improvements of 0-0.04 in the Kappa coefficient and 0-3.1\%
   in the overall classification accuracy were found after the point cloud
   normalization for all variants. Full -height point cloud features (F)
   produced lower accuracies than the results based on features calculated
   for half of the tree height point clouds (H) and combined FH.
   The importance of each of the predictors for different data sets for
   tree species classification provided by the RF algorithm was
   investigated. The lists of top features were the same, independent of
   intensity normalization. For the classification based on both of the
   point clouds (leaf on and leaf-off), three structural features (a
   proportion of first returns for both half -height and full -height
   variants and the canopy relief ratio of points) and two intensity
   features from first returns and half -height variant (the coefficient of
   variation and skewness) were rated as the most important. In the
   classification based on the point cloud with CIR features, two image
   features were among the most important (the NDVI and mean value of
   reflectance in the green band).},

Abstract = {Balloon-based astronomical missions offer a potential for cost-effective
   large and complex astronomical infrastructure in between ground and
   space-based observatories. Balloons are particularly suitable for UV and
   IR observations. Even though stratospheric observations have a long
   history, they have been up to recently they have been one-shot missions.
   The design of balloon platforms is usually formed around one or more
   specific instruments and their requirements. Not surprisingly, flight
   and ground software architecture in these missions may often seem like a
   second thought, with very limited flexibility intended. The relatively
   limited budget and short operations time of these platforms to some
   extent justifies the decision to not invest in a flexible flight or
   ground software. The same applies to the onboard autonomy of these
   scientific systems, including autonomous scheduling, data processing,
   and Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery methods implemented onboard.
   The implemented autonomy is relatively limited and only answers the
   expected circumstances of one mission. Autonomy is usually implemented
   in the form of separated scripts miming automatically in parallel with
   some communications in between them, but not as autonomous adaptive
   operations.
   However, the progress in development of super-pressure balloons, would
   provide access to longer balloon missions, and safe landing technologies
   would help to reuse these platforms and launch them several times. The
   European Stratospheric Balloon Observatory infrastructure (ESBO) is an
   on-going effort to improve the way scientific balloons have been used up
   to now, by creating an autonomous, highly flexible, and reusable
   platform, capable of integrating different instruments, long autonomous
   flights, and frequent launches. The promise of reusability and
   exchangeability of the instruments at the core of ESBO requires a
   flexible design both at hardware and software levels.
   The goal of this paper is to describe the flexible and autonomous
   payload control software developed for ESBO's first prototype, STUDIO,
   and its various elements. The essential elements covered are the
   instrument independent telescope stabilization system based on COTS
   elements, the autonomous and highly flexible science data downlink
   manager, the onboard scheduler, mode-based telescope operations and
   finally, the fault detection, isolation, and recovery routines onboard.
   The software is developed based on an open-source flight software
   framework for space systems and is open-source to benefit the community
   working on similar missions. In addition to the flight software, the
   paper briefly describes the flexible autonomous science pipeline on
   ground, designed to perform arbitrary chain of processing steps based on
   specific type of data received, and the pointing monitoring software.
   Both these web-based elements use web-based tools to enhance remote
   operations in the future.},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well
   documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern
   depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This
   first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species
   richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups
   in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal
   variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index
   (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each
   vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations
   in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination
   method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25
   each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season
   respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during
   2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed
   that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1.
   Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2.
   Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus
   Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or
   CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the
   majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The
   majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas
   therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the
   most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were
   recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher
   mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields,
   suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical
   correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local
   climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most
   important in controlling the variations in the weed species data
   followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI
   and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are
   required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area.
   Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their
   distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing,
   quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and
   intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity,
   quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing,
   quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their
   relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are
   recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.},

Title = {Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for
   Prioritizing Dam Removal},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation
   benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow
   regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present
   study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of
   Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance
   between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological
   benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four
   sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream
   connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities
   for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the
   movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The
   proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir
   (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However,
   before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the
   connectivity results will be balanced with other important
   socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an
   inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an
   observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of
   any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on
   surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the
   riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others.
   All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also
   included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network.
   The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were
   processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for
   inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability.
   These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to
   calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used
   to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria.
   The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega
   and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed
   obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For
   the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may
   constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this
   case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this
   connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity,
   it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that
   critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of
   field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement
   along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the
   implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam
   removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define
   exclusion areas for additional obstacles.},

Title = {Role of sunshades in space as a climate control option},

Abstract = {Placing reflectors in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to
   shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for
   use as a countermeasure against climate change. While the sunshade
   technology has been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoints, no study
   has evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a
   cost-effectiveness viewpoint, presuming that it is used in combination
   with CO2 abatement options as a pillar of the mitigation of climatic
   change. Nor have the contributions of geoengineering research and
   development to the economics of overall climate control measures been
   evaluated. Such evaluations are attempted in this study, which focuses
   on a space-based sunshade technology. As a result, it is recommended
   that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m(2) through the sunshades
   over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the
   21st century. In this case, an increase in global CO2 emissions by some
   15\% is allowed in the former half of the 21st century, and the total
   climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US\$ on a
   present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshades are
   unavailable. To enjoy the above advantages, the mass of the sunshade
   stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a
   doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration should be lower than 100
   Mt/2xCO(2) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing
   (space-launching) sunshades from 6000 to 1000 US\$/kg over a
   half-century. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Multi-decadal shoreline change in coastal natural world heritage sites -
   a global assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Natural World Heritage Sites (NWHS), which are of Outstanding Universal
   Value, are increasingly threatened by natural and anthropogenic
   pressures. This is especially true for coastal NWHS, which are
   additionally subject to erosion and flooding. This paper assesses
   shoreline change from 1984 to 2016 within the boundaries of 67
   designated sites, providing a first global consistent assessment of its
   drivers. It develops a transferable methodology utilising new
   satellite-derived global shoreline datasets, which are classified based
   on linearity of change against time and compared with global datasets of
   geomorphology (topography, land cover, coastal type, and lithology),
   climate variability and sea-level change. Significant shoreline change
   is observed on 14\% of 52 coastal NWHS shorelines that show the largest
   recessional and accretive trends (means of -3.4 m yr(-1)and 3.5 m
   yr(-1), respectively). These rapid shoreline changes are found in
   low-lying shorelines (<1 m elevation) composed of unconsolidated
   sediments in vegetated tidal coastal systems (means of -7.7 m yr(-1)and
   12.5 m yr(-1)), and vegetated tidal deltas at the mouth of large river
   systems (means of -6.9 m yr(-1)and 11 m yr(-1)). Extreme shoreline
   changes occur as a result of redistribution of sediment driven by a
   combination of geomorphological conditions with (1) specific natural
   coastal morphodynamics such as opening of inlets (e.g.Rio Platano
   Biosphere Reserve) or gradients of alongshore sediment transport
   (e.g.Namib Sea) and (2) direct or indirect human interferences with
   natural coastal processes such as sand nourishment (e.g.Wadden Sea) and
   damming of river sediments upstream of a delta (e.g.Danube Delta).The
   most stable soft coasts are associated with the protection of coral reef
   ecosystems (e.g.Great Barrier Reef) which may be degraded/destroyed by
   climate change or human stress in the future. A positive correlation
   between shoreline retreat and local relative sea-level change was
   apparent in theWadden Sea. However, globally, the effects of
   contemporary sea-level rise are not apparent for coastal NWHS, but it is
   a major concern for the future reinforcing the shoreline dynamics
   already being observed due to other drivers. Hence, future assessments
   of shoreline change need to account for other drivers of coastal change
   in addition to sea-level rise projections. In conclusion, extreme
   multi-decadal linear shoreline trends occur in coastal NWHS and are
   driven primarily by sediment redistribution. Future exacerbation of
   these trends may affect heritage values and coastal communities. Thus
   shoreline change should be considered in future management plans where
   necessary. This approach provides a consistent method to assess NWHS
   which can be repeated and help steer future management of these
   important sites.},

Abstract = {The people of northwestern Alaska have had a long relationship with
   local populations of Rangifer tarandus. During the last 200 years this
   relationship has changed from one of subsistence to overexploitation of
   caribou (the name for wild reindeer in North America), to commercial
   livestock production of semi domesticated reindeer and now may be
   returning to a subsistence economy based on caribou. Reindeer were
   introduced to Alaska in 1892 because of the disappearance of caribou, a
   subsistence resource. Until recently, reindeer meat and velvet antler
   production generated significant employment and revenue important to the
   economies of rural Alaskan communities. However, from 1976 to 1996 the
   Western Arctic Caribou Herd (WACH) increased from about 75,000 to
   463,000 animals. Concurrently, winter range use of the WACH shifted
   westward onto traditional reindeer ranges of the Seward Peninsula for
   the first time in over 100 years. This event has produced socio-economic
   and ecological consequences for the region. Many reindeer herders have
   lost 75-100 percent of their herds through commingling and out-migration
   with wild caribou. This loss, amounting to over 17,000 reindeer,
   represents a potential economic value of millions of dollars. Many
   herders have adopted new technologies, such as satellite telemetry and
   intensive herding to salvage what is left of their herds. Here we
   discuss the role of grazing animals and patterns of human resource use
   in an Arctic system. We then discuss our findings on the effects and
   changes in management practices brought about by caribou incursion in
   the context of the regional economy on the Seward Peninsula.},

Title = {Vegetation responses to climate change in the Qilian Mountain Nature
   Reserve, Northwest China},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of vegetation responses to climate change can
   provide important information for environmental management. The Qilian
   Mountain Nature Reserve in Northwest China, a high-altitude mountainous
   region that is of critical ecological importance, has been affected by
   drastic climate change. However, the response of vegetation to climate
   change in this area has not been established. This study aims to address
   three unanswered questions. First, what is the relative importance of
   temperature and precipitation change in driving regional vegetation
   change? Second, how does this vegetation-climate relationship manifest
   itself across different timescales (e.g., seasonal)? Third, what is the
   spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation-climate relationship? Based on
   MODIS data and daily meteorological data from 41 stations within and
   adjacent to the reserve, we used Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition
   (EEMD), Theil-Sen median trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall nonparametric
   test, and Pearson correlation analysis to study the evolution of
   temperature, precipitation, and the normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI). The key results are as follows: (1) during 1985-2019, the
   temperature in the reserve has increased by an average of 0.048 degrees
   C/a, with the largest average annual increases occurring in spring
   (0.069 degrees C) and summer (0.056 degrees C); (2) during the same
   period, precipitation in the reserve increased by an average of 1.17
   mm/a, with the largest annual increases occurring in autumn (0.669 mm)
   and summer (0.545 mm); (3) during 2001-2019, the NDVI increased by an
   average of 0.004/a; an average annual increase was experienced in all
   seasons, although the largest increase occurred in summer; (4) there is
   a statistically significant positive correlation (0.619) between the
   NDVI and temperature at the annual scale; (5) in contrast, the
   correlation between the NDVI and precipitation is weaker and not
   statistically significant (0.368), which indicates that temperature is
   the dominant factor affecting vegetation changes in the reserve; (6)
   there exist seasonal differences in the vegetation-climate relationship.
   The positive correlation between NDVI and temperature is strongest in
   spring whereas the positive correlation between NDVI and precipitation
   is strongest in summer; (7) the vegetation-climate relations demonstrate
   a degree of spatial heterogeneity driven by variability in climate
   factors and ecosystems. The value of this research is that it analyzes
   the response characteristics of vegetation to climate change using
   multiple methods and at multiple scales, providing a useful reference
   for understanding vegetation changes and their response to climate
   change in high-altitude mountain regions.},

Abstract = {Purpose We tried to investigate the role of Schwann and satellite cells
   in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction; following
   spinal cord injury in the rabbit model. Methods Twelve male New Zealand
   rabbits underwent induction of neurogenic bladder by spinal cord injury.
   Rabbits underwent the fiber tractography analysis to confirm the
   induction of spinal cord injury. Then, animals were randomly divided
   into two groups. In group I (n = 4), Schwann cells were obtained from
   autologous peroneal nerve. In group II (n = 4), the co-culture of
   nerve-muscle cells was obtained from autologous peroneal nerve and
   quadriceps muscle. Animals in the control group (n = 4) did not undergo
   any rehabilitation therapy. One and 4 months after injection of cells
   into the external anal sphincter, electromyography, urethral pressure
   profiles, urodynamic studies, voiding cystourethrogram, and manometry
   was performed to confirm the efficacy of treatment in short- (1 month)
   and long-term (4 months) follow-ups. Results The investigations
   validated that no statistically significant difference was detected
   between the two experimental groups in a short-term follow-up (p-value >
   0.05). However, the functional features were improved in group II in
   long-term follow-up. In both groups, the external anal sphincter
   contracted in response to electrical signals delivered to the muscle.
   However, more signals were detected in group II in electromyography
   evaluation. The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the
   histological features of the bladder and spinal cord were more
   satisfactory in group II in all follow-ups compared to group I, in terms
   of less edema, inflammation, presence of progenitor cells, and
   expression of muscle and nerve markes. Conclusion Our results suggested
   that the injection of nerve-muscle co-culture cells into the external
   anal sphincter may be a helpful tactic for ameliorating the urological
   complications; following spinal cord injury induction in the rabbit
   model.},

Year = {1994},

Abstract = {The developments taking place in Information Technology (IT),
   particularly, the convergence between computers and communication has
   made the world a global village.  Indeed competitive advantage would be
   primarily determined by a nation's or firm's IT infrastructure.  This is
   all the more compelling in the context of our economic reforms programme
   where India is all set to get plugged into the global economy.  The
   shift from analogue to digital technology has brought a major transition
   which has completely altered the communications landscape.  `'anytime
   anywhere'' communications based on mobile cellular, satellite and
   Personal Communication System (PCS) technologies are fast becoming a
   global reality.  This coupled with the development of `'Information
   Superhighways'' based on optical fibre is making the integration of
   voice, data and video available through the Integrated Services Digital
   Network.  While wireless and optical fibre based local loops loom on the
   horizon, `the last mile problem' has resulted in the amalgamation of
   major switching and cable networks in the USA, in order to bring
   multimedia to tomorrow's home.  It is anticipated that several of these
   possibilities would become commonplace by the year 2000 and in this
   context it is extremely important that developing countries like our
   own, chalk out strategies in order to leapfrog technologies in the most
   cost effective manner with a view to successfully managing the
   tremendous changes underway.
   The output of global electronics reached \$700 billion in 1990 and is
   expected to reach about \$1.3 trillion by the year 2000.  The value
   added by the electronics industry is growing at about 6 per cent per
   year, compared with about 3.8 per cent for all manufacturing industries
   and 3.1 per cent for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (all in real terms). 
   At this pace by the year 2000 electronics will account for about 4 per
   cent of world GDP and 14 per cent of value added in manufacturing.  In
   comparison, the Indian electronics industry reached an output level of a
   little over \$ 4 billion in 1992 representing 0.7 per cent of the global
   electronics industry.  If India were to achieve a production level of \$
   20 billion by the year 2000, this would increase to 1.5 per cent.
   In the context of the next decade China whose current electronics output
   is almost 3 times that of India provides a very useful point of
   reference.  What is alarming is the rate at which electronics
   applications are growing in China, in TV, telecom and Information
   Technology (IT).  Thus, China's production of TV sets, both colour and
   Black \& White, is 5 times that of India; it proposes to install over 3
   times the number of telephones by the year 2000; and its IT industry
   currently is also 3 times of India's.  These in turn provide rapidly
   improving economies of scale, when compared to those of the Indian
   electronics industry, thus promoting greater vertical integration,
   increasing cost competitiveness, makes exports more viable and attracts
   greater foreign direct investment and technology to feed its burgeoning
   market.  Consequently, there is an imperative need to provide a
   strategic vision at this juncture to address the Chinese challenge and
   to ensure the future health of the Indian electronics industry
   commensurate with our size and capabilities.
   The background paper provides the current status of the electronics
   industry both nationally as well as internationally and the development
   strategies pursued by different countries.  From these, the major issues
   in devising an appropriate strategy for future development of the Indian
   Electronics Industry are derived.  This is to lay the ground work for
   further deliberation.  The paper is divided into following parts:
   Development of the Indian Electronics Industry

Title = {Detecting <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in community surveys: a
   comparison of Paracheck Pf® Test and ICT Malaria Pf® Cassette Test to
   polymerase chain reaction in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe},

Abstract = {BackgroundMicroscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the main
   techniques used to diagnose malaria. While microscopy is considered the
   gold standard, RDTs have established popularity as they allow for rapid
   diagnosis with minimal technical skills. This study aimed to compare the
   diagnostic performance of two Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
   protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based RDTs (Paracheck Pf (R) Test (Paracheck) and
   Malaria Pf (TM) ICT (ICT)) to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a
   community survey.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted between
   October 2012 and December 2014 in Mutasa District, Manicaland Province,
   eastern Zimbabwe. Households were randomly selected using satellite
   imagery, and 224 households were visited. Residents present in the
   household on the date of the visit were recruited for the study.
   Participants of all age groups from the selected households were
   screened with Paracheck and ICT RDTs in parallel. Dried blood spots
   (DBS) and thin and thick smears were collected. Parasite DNA extracted
   from the DBS was subjected to nested PCR targeting the Plasmodium
   cytochrome b mitochondrial gene. Data analysis was performed using the
   Cohen's Kappa test to determine the interrater agreement and the
   sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test were
   reported.ResultsResults from a total of 702 participants were analysed.
   Most were females, 397 (57\%), and the median age of participants was 21
   years with an interquartile range of 9-39 years. Of those who were
   screened, 8 (1.1\%), 35 (5.0\%), and 21 (2.9\%) were malaria parasite
   positive by microscopy, RDT and PCR, respectively. Paracheck and ICT
   RDTs had a 100\% agreement. Comparing RDT and PCR results, 34
   participants (4.8\%) had discordant results. Most of the discordant
   cases were RDT positive but PCR negative (n=24). Half of those RDT
   positive, but PCR negative individuals reported anti-malarials to use in
   the past month, which is significantly higher than reported
   anti-malarial drug use in the population (p<0.001). The participant was
   febrile on the day of the visit, but relying on PfHRP2-based RDT would
   miss this case. Among the diagnostic methods evaluated, with reference
   to PCR, the sensitivity was higher with the RDT (52.4\%) while
   specificity was higher with the microscopy (99.9\%). The positive
   predictive value (PPV) was higher with the microscopy (87.5\%), while
   the negative predictive values were similar for both microscopy and RDTs
   (98\%). Overall, a strong correlated agreement with PCR was observed for
   the microscopy (97.9\%) and the RDTs (95.2\%).ConclusionsParacheck and
   ICT RDTs showed 100\% agreement and can be used interchangeably. As
   malaria transmission declines and Zimbabwe aims to reach malaria
   elimination, management of infected individuals with low parasitaemia as
   well as non-P. falciparum infection can be critical.},

Abstract = {The 14th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2015)
   reviewed substantial new evidence on locoregional and systemic therapies
   for early breast cancer. Further experience has supported the adequacy
   of tumor margins defined as `no ink on invasive tumor or DCIS' and the
   safety of omitting axillary dissection in specific cohorts. Radiotherapy
   trials support irradiation of regional nodes in node-positive disease.
   Considering subdivisions within luminal disease, the Panel was more
   concerned with indications for the use of specific therapies, rather
   than surrogate identification of intrinsic subtypes as measured by
   multiparameter molecular tests. For the treatment of HER2-positive
   disease in patients with node-negative cancers up to 1 cm, the Panel
   endorsed a simplified regimen comprising paclitaxel and trastuzumab
   without anthracycline as adjuvant therapy. For premenopausal patients
   with endocrine responsive disease, the Panel endorsed the role of
   ovarian function suppression with either tamoxifen or exemestane for
   patients at higher risk. The Panel noted the value of an LHRH agonist
   given during chemotherapy for premenopausal women with ER-negative
   disease in protecting against premature ovarian failure and preserving
   fertility. The Panel noted increasing evidence for the prognostic value
   of commonly used multiparameter molecular markers, some of which also
   carried prognostic information for late relapse. The Panel noted that
   the results of such tests, where available, were frequently used to
   assist decisions about the inclusion of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the
   treatment of patients with luminal disease, but noted that threshold
   values had not been established for this purpose for any of these tests.
   Multiparameter molecular assays are expensive and therefore unavailable
   in much of the world. The majority of new breast cancer cases and breast
   cancer deaths now occur in less developed regions of the world. In these
   areas, less expensive pathology tests may provide valuable information.
   The Panel recommendations on treatment are not intended to apply to all
   patients, but rather to establish norms appropriate for the majority.
   Again, economic considerations may require that less expensive and only
   marginally less effective therapies may be necessary in less resourced
   areas. Panel recommendations do not imply unanimous agreement among
   Panel members. Indeed, very few of the 200 questions received 100\%
   agreement from the Panel. In the text below, wording is intended to
   convey the strength of Panel support for each recommendation, while
   details of Panel voting on each question are available in supplementary
   Appendix S2, available at Annals of Oncology online.},

Title = {Generating digital terrain model: joint use of airborne lidar data and
   optical images},
Journal = {TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The knowledge of an accurate topography is a prerequest for monitoring
   natural hazards and for environmental management (e.g. hydrologic and
   erosion models). Remote sensing lidar systems are active sensors which
   record altimeter data of the Earth's surface as 3D point clouds: from an
   emitted laser pulse, the receptor detects backscaterred photons from the
   reflecting target. The altimeter accuracy is often higher than in the
   case of using stereoscopic conventional techniques, even if the ground
   density of the data is often lower. Additionnaly, beyond the altimeter
   information, these data contain spectral information related to the
   target reflectance in the infra-red domain. Depending on the target
   geometry, lidar systems can acquire several echos for a single laser
   pulse. This property is particularly interesting in forests or in areas
   of urban vegetation since it provides not only the canopy height, but
   also, under certain conditions, the terrain height under the vegetation
   layer.
   Many algorithms have been implemented to sort out the automatic
   classification problem of 3D point clouds providing ground and
   off-ground points as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). This is
   mainly due to the various aspects of landscapes within a global survey
   which can include urban, forest or mountainous areas.
   This paper presents the generation of DTMs based on the joint use of
   optical images and lidar data. The study is focused on rural areas where
   a large scale mapping is a major issue. We propose an algorithm based on
   a predictive Kalman filter for which the temporal component is replaced
   by a spacial indexation. The algorithm consists in analyzing the
   altimeter distribution of the point cloud of a local area in the local
   slope frame. We insist on the role of local slopes for determining the
   ground height especially in case of steep slope terrain. We assume that
   points of the first altimeter mode (lowest points) belong to the
   terrain. The mean height of these points correspond to the measured DTM
   value. The final DTM value at a specific position is obtained by a
   linear combination between the measured value and the predicted value.
   The predicted value depends on the neighboring pixels through their
   respective uncertainties. The slopes are also integrated in the
   predictive filter. The local slope is estimated by robust M-estimator,
   based on the local first altimeter mode. The final slope for each site
   depends on the corresponding neighborhood uncertainties. This process
   makes the slope estmation more robust. Finally, the predictive Kalman
   framework provides not only a robust terrain surface, but also an
   uncertainty for each DTM pixel as well as a map of normal vectors.
   The local window size is a critical parameter in filtering algorithms.
   It should be small enough to keep all ground details but large enough to
   ensure the removal of off-ground objects such as trees or/and buildings.
   Consequently, we S introduce an adaptation of the local neighborhood
   based on the integration of image and lidar data within a predictor of
   high vegetation areas. In this context, we decided to investigate the
   potential of using raw uncalibrated lidar intensity in case of a joint
   indice computation, which is generally derived from image-based infrared
   data. Consequently, lidar intensity and optical images are combined to
   generate a Hybrid Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (HNDVI). The
   lidar provides the infrared band whereas the aerial image provides RGB
   spectral bands.
   A vegetation mask is then calculated with HNDVI and lidar variance
   information. In fact, higher values of HNDVI are likely to correspond to
   vegetated areas and vegetation is described as non-ordered point cloud
   with a high variance compared to human-made structures. Based on the
   vegetation mask, the local neighborhood size continuously varies from a
   predefined minimum distance to an automatically processed upper boundary
   depending on the vegetated area density. Lidar data have been collected
   in 2004 by the Institut Frangais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la
   Mer (IFREMER) over the Morbihan Gulf, France. It has been funded by
   TOTAL. The entire survey is composed of 230.106 points with intensities
   and has been acquired with an ALTM (Optech) system 1210. The point
   density is 0.7 pt/m(2). The lidar wavelength is 1064 nm. Optical images
   are extracted from the BDOrtho (R) French orthophoto data basis of the
   Institut Geographique National with a nominal resolution of 0.5 m, but
   resampled at 2.5 m for the generation of the Hybrid-NDVI image.
   Conclusive results show the potentiality of a full combination of lidar
   data and RGB optical images for improving the generation of fine DTMs on
   rural environments. The filtering process is more robust, DTM are less
   picked due to vegetation filtering. However, in case of dense
   vegetation, the window size can be large and the average terrain height
   may be underestimated. As future work, further area predictors can be
   developed to adapt the proposed methodology to various landscapes and
   relieves.},

Title = {Changes in crop type distribution in Zhangye City of the Heihe River
   Basin, China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {22-36},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With rapid economic development in China, crops have undergone
   remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and
   accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and
   agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural
   production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in
   planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such
   knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural
   competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee
   national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in
   the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated
   upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on
   multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial
   distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and
   analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition,
   some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern
   of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four
   conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural
   network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in
   Zhangye was high, at 89.38\%. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land
   area in Zhangye increased from 463.81 x 10(3) ha to 493.89 x 10(3) ha.
   The sowing area of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39.21 x 10(3) ha
   and 5.99 x 10(3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the sowing
   area decreased by 3.61 x 10(3) ha and 9.14 x 10(3) ha, respectively.
   Considering other crop types as a group, their sowing area decreased by
   only 2.37 x 10(3) ha. The increase in corn sowing area mainly came from
   the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43.09\% of
   its total sowing area in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed
   a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the
   tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high
   conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while
   wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle
   and Shandan counties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On the Future of Argo: <i>A Global</i>, <i>Full</i>-<i>Depth</i>,

Abstract = {The Argo Program has been implemented and sustained for almost two
   decades, as a global array of about 4000 profiling floats. Argo provides
   continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus
   pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar. The successful installation
   of the Argo array and its innovative data management system arose
   opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and
   technological innovation. Through the data system, Argo provides
   fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable
   applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of
   autonomous profiling floats. Following recent advances in platform and
   sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years
   ago to (i) improve Argo's global coverage and value beyond the original
   design, (ii) extend Argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add
   biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of
   carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental
   sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document
   the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and
   each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression
   along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to
   global implementation is described. The objective is to create a fully
   global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary Argo
   Program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in
   situ elements of the Global Ocean Observing System (Legler et al.,
   2015). The integrated system will deliver operational reanalysis and
   forecasting capability, and assessment of the state and variability of
   the climate system with respect to physical, biogeochemical, and
   ecosystems parameters. It will enable basic research of unprecedented
   breadth and magnitude, and a wealth of ocean-education and outreach
   opportunities.},

   Chlorophyll-a in the Indonesian Seas},

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability of oceanic fronts in the Indonesian seas
   was investigated using high-resolution satellite observations. The study
   aimed to understand the underlying mechanism driving these fronts and
   their impact on chlorophyll-a variability. A high value of frontal
   probability was found near the coasts of major islands, exhibiting a
   distinct seasonal cycle with peaks occurrences during austral winter.
   The distribution variability of chlorophyll-a was generally consistent
   with the presence of active frontal zones, although a significantly
   positive relationship between fronts and chlorophyll-a was limited to
   only some specific areas, e.g., south Java Island and the Celebes Sea.
   Wind-driven upwelling played a major role in front generation in the
   Java upwelling region and enhanced frontal activity can promote the
   growth of phytoplankton, leading to higher chlorophyll-a. Furthermore,
   the study demonstrated that wind patterns preceded variations in front
   probability and chlorophyll-a by approximately two months. This lag
   suggests that the spatiotemporal variability of fronts and chlorophyll-a
   in this region is primarily influenced by the monsoon system. In
   addition, the sea surface temperature (SST) simultaneously modulated the
   chlorophyll-a variability. Negative SST anomalies were typically
   associated with positive anomalies in front probability the
   chlorophyll-a in most areas. Notably, the interannual variability of
   fronts and chlorophyll-a are prominent in the Java upwelling region.
   During El Nino years, this region experienced an enhanced monsoon,
   resulting in a negative SST anomaly alongside positive anomalies in
   front probability and chlorophyll-a. A comprehensive description and
   underlying dynamics of frontal activity in the Indonesian seas are
   provided by this study. The findings are helpful to delineate the
   variability in chlorophyll-a, thereby facilitating the future
   understanding of local primary production and the carbon cycle.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As typical mesoscale processes, oceanic fronts
   have significant impacts on biological processes and fisheries in
   marginal seas. The complex spatiotemporal variability of fronts and
   their effects on biological processes in the Indonesian seas remain
   poorly understood. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap by
   investigating the seasonal and interannual variability of fronts and
   their influence on chlorophyll-a, a key indicator of phytoplankton
   biomass and primary productivity. The study identified a high frontal
   probability in south Java Island during austral winter and El Nino
   years. Wind-driven upwelling was found to be a major factor in front
   generation and promoting phytoplankton growth. The findings of this
   study will improve the theoretical knowledge of regional dynamics, local
   primary production, and the carbon cycle in the Indonesian seas,
   benefiting fisheries management and ecosystem conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to undertake process evaluation
   of the implementation of tele-care in a large care-providing
   organization in the Netherlands.. Method: The study was executed as a
   satellite study of the actual implementation of the Quiet Care tele-care
   system within the Proteion Care group in the south of the Netherlands.
   Data on the process of implementation was gathered through extensive
   document analysis, semi-structured interviews and participant
   observation. Based on these data the implementation performance and the
   caregivers' implementation, evaluated by the
   caregivers/staff/professionals, were investigated, guided by the
   framework for implementation from Grol and Wensing (2006). Results: The
   implementation was started with an introduction to some of the
   stakeholders at the home-care organization. After several months of
   practice, there were some misconceptions on the use of the facility,
   i.e. the fit thereof into daily care practice. Therefore, a restart of
   the implementation was organized with a customized training programme
   focusing on the relationship between innovation and professional
   behaviour as the subject matter. The implementation process involved
   professional training conveying the (evidence-based) added value of the
   implemented system. This training was positively evaluated by most of
   the participants. After the completion of the course the care providers
   enrolled more new clients for the Quiet Care system and used the outcome
   from the data to improve daily care and adjust the nursing care plan.
   The outcome of this changed approach was that the innovation was more
   accepted by caregivers. Analysis of the implementation process revealed
   the lack of a formal approach: there was no underlying implementation
   model resulting in the lack of coherence/commitment/sense of importance
   from an organizational viewpoint. Caregivers in the organization found
   the guidance by the staff of the implementation programme very
   supportive to their learning needs. But such a strongly imbedded ethos
   in the implementation staff introduced some reluctance in other
   management staff involved in the programme in taking over the ownership
   of the implemented innovation and thereby guaranteeing a continuous
   improvement of the innovation over time. Conclusion: The impact of the
   implementation of Quiet Care on the business processes could not
   previously be fully overseen. Ad hoc decisions had to be made to
   guarantee a continuous roll-out throughout the organization. The
   training participants perceived the training to be valuable because it
   was a) supportive in the use of the technology and b) supportive in
   their daily professional performances. This outcome supports the aim of
   the training to provide a meaningful learning environment in which the
   transfer of the experimental approach to daily practice could occur. The
   training was well evaluated and turned out to be a key element for
   success. The absence of a pre-formulated implementation plan proved to
   be a barrier for acceptance of the system at management level and
   hindered the uptake of the approach as part of the standard care
   provision. It is concluded that an implementation plan and
   evidence-based training programme have to be included as part of a
   strategy to implement health care technology in professional practice.
   This should be accompanied by an applied research path to observe the
   performance.},

Abstract = {Understanding the global carbon (C) cycle is of crucial importance to
   map current and future climate dynamics relative to global environmental
   change. A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed
   information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes.
   However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their
   coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of
   integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland
   freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a
   data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based
   spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to
   identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data
   limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans,
   continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes
   related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical
   aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and
   cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through
   geostatistical and/ or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby
   minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in
   process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE)
   between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere.
   Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study
   is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that
   need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories.
   Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling.
   In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates
   from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric
   inversions. This holds for Europe (mean +/- 1 SD: 0.8 +/- 0.1 PgC
   yr(-1), positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 +/-
   0.4 PgC yr(-1)), East Asia (1.6 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), South Asia (0.3 +/-
   0.1 PgC yr(-1)), Australia (0.2 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), and most of the
   Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in
   tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and
   because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global
   bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of 5.4 +/- 2.0 PgC yr(-1). By
   contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2
   over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source
   of 4.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr(-1)
   highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in
   tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment
   provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon
   observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land
   regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second,
   extensive pCO(2) data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack
   observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and
   inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data
   uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria
   optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS)
   and atmospheric inversions, without over-or under-stating bottom-up data
   credibility.
   In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at
   national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2
   fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which
   future emission reductions are proposed.},

Abstract = {Background: A handful of previous studies have reported the association
   between exposure to outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) and sleep
   problems. However, evidence for such association is limited in low- and
   middleincome countries. This study aimed to examine the association
   between outdoor ALAN exposure and sleep quality in veterans across
   different regions of China. Methods: Within the network of the Chinese
   Veteran Clinical Research Platform, we selected 7258 participants from
   277 veteran communities in 18 cities across China during December 2009
   and December 2011, using a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling
   strategy. Face-to-face interviews with the participants were conducted
   by trained investigators. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
   (PSQI) to assess participants' sleep quality. We defined poor sleep
   quality as a PSQI global score >7. The 3-year average exposure to
   outdoor ALAN prior to the baseline interview was calculated using
   satellite imagery data, according to participants' geolocation
   information. The association of ALAN exposure with sleep quality was
   examined using the mixed-effects logistic regression models with natural
   cubic splines. Results: The exposure-response curve for sleep quality
   associated with ALAN exposure was nonlinear, with a threshold value of
   49.20 nW/cm2/sr for the 3-year average exposure to outdoor ALAN prior to
   the baseline interview. Higher ALAN exposure above the threshold was
   associated with increased risk of poor sleep quality. After adjusting
   for potential confounders, the odds ratios (and 95\%CI, 95\% confidence
   intervals) were 1.15 (0.97, 1.36) and 1.45 (1.17, 1.78) at the 75th and
   95th percentiles of ALAN against the threshold. The association of ALAN
   exposure with poor sleep quality was more pronounced in veterans with
   depression than those without. Higher OR of poor sleep quality at the
   75th percentile of ALAN against the threshold was observed in veterans
   with depression than those without {[}2.09 (1.16, 3.76) vs. 1.09 (0.92,
   1.30)]. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to outdoor ALAN was associated
   with higher risk of poor sleep quality in Chinese veterans. Effective
   outdoor ALAN management may help to reduce the burden of sleep disorders
   in Chinese veterans.},

Author = {MRLs Concern Active Subst Vincloz},
Title = {MRLs of concern for the active substance vinclozolin},
Journal = {EFSA JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The European Commission requested EFSA to provide an opinion on the
   safety of the existing MRLs of vinclozolin without specifying the actual
   MRLs of concern. In order to focus the assessment mainly on the MRLs
   that are of concern, EFSA decided to follow a tiered approach which
   resulted into the following conclusions and recommendations.
   The existing EC MRLs for scarole, kiwi, table grapes, peppers, melons,
   lettuce, watermelons, apples, currants, witloof, pears, strawberries,
   aubergines, Chinese cabbage, plums, apricots and wine grapes were
   identified as the MRLs of concern as the calculated acute exposure
   amounted more than 100\% of the ARFD. Additionally, acute concerns were
   also identified for 3 processed commodities: grape juice, kiwi and
   currant juices.
   In the chronic intake assessment potential consumer risks were
   identified for 26 diets out of the 27 diets available. The calculated
   TMDI for these populations ranged between to 110 \% and 644 \% of the
   ADI. However, this screening is expected to overestimate the real
   situation with regard to consumer exposure and further refinements for
   these MRLs of concern were therefore undertaken.
   The active substance vinclozolin was subject to the peer review under
   Directive 91/414/EEC (list 1). Vinclozolin was not included in Annex I
   because no decision for inclusion/non inclusion in Annex I has been
   taken by the deadline of 31/12/2006 for finalization of the review
   programme for substances in list 1. Therefore, the use of vinclozolin on
   any crop grown in Europe was formally no longer authorised starting 1
   January 2007. Nevertheless, considering any period of grace possibly
   granted at Member State level, treated commodities resulting from those
   uses might have circulated on the European market still after 1 January
   2007. However, it is considered that to date no crops should be on the
   EU market with residue of vinclozolin arising from EU uses of this
   active substance.
   EFSA proposed to withdraw the MRLs for scarole, watermelons, apples,
   pears, aubergines, Chinese cabbage, plums, apricots, peas (without pods
   - fresh), carrots, peas (dry), shallots, spring onions, pumpkins, peas
   (with pods - fresh), okra, lamb's lettuce, cress, land cress, rocket,
   red mustard, leaves and sprouts of Brassica as the use on these food
   commodities is not authorised in Europe and as no CXLs are in place. A
   new MRL, corresponding to the LOQ (0.05 mg/kg), was therefore proposed
   by EFSA.
   For the following crops, EFSA proposed to withdraw the MRLs because the
   use in Europe on those crops is not authorised and because a risk for
   consumers could not be excluded if the data supporting the CXLs are
   considered: table grapes, melons, lettuce, currants, witloof and
   strawberries.
   For the following crops, EFSA proposed to withdraw the MRLs because the
   use in Europe on those crops are not authorised and because the existing
   CXLs were set on the basis of European GAPs which are no longer
   supported: peppers, beans (with pods - fresh), hops and rape seeds.
   Finally, EFSA recommend maintaining the MRL for kiwi (for varieties with
   inedible peel) and wine grapes as, after the refinement of the acute
   consumer exposure, risk to the consumers' health could be excluded.
   Considering these proposals, which are summarized in the following
   table, the acute intake calculations resulted in exposure levels below
   the toxicological reference values. The chronic intake slightly exceeds
   the ADI for one diet, but this is mainly attributed to MRLs at the LOQ
   value.},

Title = {Impact of information technology on the earth sciences},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Abstract = {The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with
   the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal
   plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight
   quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and
   geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to
   construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front
   the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the
   controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly
   the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the
   building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data
   gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example,
   digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the
   earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the
   earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly
   available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to
   propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into
   a new era. The component information technologies are now available to
   allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world.
   Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques
   have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's
   crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved
   pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas
   reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at
   best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this,
   geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow
   through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic
   reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir
   and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made
   about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is
   analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques
   means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences
   yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in
   understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers
   which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake
   belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems
   within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their
   colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is
   such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone.
   Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies
   will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The
   key components of the information technologies that will enable this
   revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and
   computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components
   needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from
   observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making.
   Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic
   sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within
   the earth.
   Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can
   be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful
   information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this
   particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir
   through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil.
   The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through
   the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed.
   From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior
   of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists
   and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to
   various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and
   manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being
   developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data
   overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data.
   Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by
   data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is
   probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age.
   Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which
   by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to
   picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously,
   the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple
   two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing
   rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated,
   and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff
   the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many
   complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of
   complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments
   conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to
   project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special
   glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a
   three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are
   already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly
   with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and
   workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies
   and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the
   application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the
   generalist. This is a very important development because it allows
   models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights
   and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the
   specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily
   available technology. Application of this entire suite of information
   technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced
   processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete
   cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and
   improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory
   to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a
   major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the
   value of their application and integration with other technical
   disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely
   not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic
   prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from
   companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of
   the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Title = {Report of the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and

Journal = {CELESTIAL MECHANICS \& DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {130},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This report continues the practice where the IAU Working Group on
   Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements revises recommendations
   regarding those topics for the planets, satellites, minor planets, and
   comets approximately every 3 years. The Working Group has now become a
   ``functional working group{''} of the IAU, and its membership is open to
   anyone interested in participating. We describe the procedure for
   submitting questions about the recommendations given here or the
   application of these recommendations for creating a new or updated
   coordinate system for a given body. Regarding body orientation, the
   following bodies have been updated: Mercury, based on MESSENGER results;
   Mars, along with a refined longitude definition; Phobos; Deimos; (1)
   Ceres; (52) Europa; (243) Ida; (2867) Steins; Neptune; (134340) Pluto
   and its satellite Charon; comets 9P/Tempel 1, 19P/Borrelly,
   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and 103P/Hartley 2, noting that such
   information is valid only between specific epochs. The special
   challenges related to mapping 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are also
   discussed. Approximate expressions for the Earth have been removed in
   order to avoid confusion, and the low precision series expression for
   the Moon's orientation has been removed. The previously online only
   recommended orientation model for (4) Vesta is repeated with an
   explanation of how it was updated. Regarding body shape, text has been
   included to explain the expected uses of such information, and the
   relevance of the cited uncertainty information. The size of the Sun has
   been updated, and notation added that the size and the ellipsoidal axes
   for the Earth and Jupiter have been recommended by an IAU Resolution.
   The distinction of a reference radius for a body (here, the Moon and
   Titan) is made between cartographic uses, and for orthoprojection and
   geophysical uses. The recommended radius for Mercury has been updated
   based on MESSENGER results. The recommended radius for Titan is returned
   to its previous value. Size information has been updated for 13 other
   Saturnian satellites and added for Aegaeon. The sizes of Pluto and
   Charon have been updated. Size information has been updated for (1)
   Ceres and given for (16) Psyche and (52) Europa. The size of (25143)
   Itokawa has been corrected. In addition, the discussion of terminology
   for the poles (hemispheres) of small bodies has been modified and a
   discussion on cardinal directions added. Although they continue to be
   used for planets and their satellites, it is assumed that the
   planetographic and planetocentric coordinate system definitions do not
   apply to small bodies. However, planetocentric and planetodetic
   latitudes and longitudes may be used on such bodies, following the
   right-hand rule. We repeat our previous recommendations that planning
   and efforts be made to make controlled cartographic products; newly
   recommend that common formulations should be used for orientation and
   size; continue to recommend that a community consensus be developed for
   the orientation models of Jupiter and Saturn; newly recommend that
   historical summaries of the coordinate systems for given bodies should
   be developed, and point out that for planets and satellites
   planetographic systems have generally been historically preferred over
   planetocentric systems, and that in cases when planetographic
   coordinates have been widely used in the past, there is no obvious
   advantage to switching to the use of planetocentric coordinates.
   The Working Group also requests community input on the question
   submitting process, posting of updates to the Working Group website, and
   on whether recommendations should be made regarding exoplanet coordinate
   systems.},

Title = {Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by lymph node dissection for
   localised primary cutaneous melanoma},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Background
   Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer-associated mortality. The
   vast majority of newly diagnosed melanomas are confined to the primary
   cutaneous site. Surgery represents the mainstay of melanoma treatment.
   Treatment strategies include wide excision of the primary tumour and
   sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to assess the status of the regional
   nodal basin(s). SLNB has become an important component of initial
   melanoma management providing accurate disease staging.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects and safety of SLNB followed by completion lymph
   node dissection (CLND) for the treatment of localised primary cutaneous
   melanoma.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases up to February 2015: the Cochrane
   Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of
   Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 1),
   MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS ((Latin American and
   Caribbean Health Science Information database, from 1982). We also
   searched the following from inception: African Index Medicus, IndMED of
   India, Index Medicus for the South-East Asia Region, and six trials
   registers. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded
   studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials
   (RCTs). We searched ISI Web of Science Conference Proceedings from
   inception to February 2015, and we scanned the abstracts of major
   dermatology and oncology conference proceedings up to 2015.
   Selection criteria
   Two review authors independently assessed all RCTs comparing SLNB
   followed by CLND for the treatment of primary localised cutaneous
   melanoma for inclusion. Primary outcome measures were overall survival
   and rate of treatment complications and side effects.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted and analysed data on survival
   and recurrence, assessed risk of bias, and collected adverse effect
   information from included trials.
   Main results
   We identified and included a single eligible trial comparing SLNB with
   observation and published in eight different reports (from 2005 to 2014)
   with 2001 participants. This did not report on our first primary outcome
   of overall survival. The study did report on the rate of treatment
   complications. Our secondary outcomes of disease-specific and
   disease-free survival, local recurrence and distant metastases were
   reported. There were 1347 participants in the intermediate-thickness
   melanoma group and 314 in the thick melanoma group.
   With regard to treatment complications, short-term surgical morbidity
   (30 days) in 1735 participants showed no difference between SLNB and
   observation (risk ratio {[}RR] 1.11; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.9
   to 1.37) for wide excision of the tumour site but favoured observation
   for complications related to the regional nodal basin (RR 14.36; 95\% CI
   6.74 to 30.59).
   The study did not report the actual 10-year melanoma-specific survival
   rate for all included participants. Instead, melanoma-specific survival
   rates for each group of participants: intermediate-thickness melanoma
   (defined as 1.2 to 3.5mm) and thick melanomas (defined as 3.50 mm or
   more) was reported.
   In the intermediate-thickness melanoma group there was no statistically
   significant difference in disease-specific survival between study groups
   at 10 years (81.4 +/- 1.5\% versus 78.3 +/- 2.0\%, hazard ratio {[}HR]
   0.84; 95\% CI 0.65 to 1.09). In the thick melanoma group, again there
   was no statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival
   between study groups at 10 years (58.9.3 +/- 4.1\% versus 64.4 +/-
   4.6\%, HR 1.12; 95\% CI 0.77 to 1.64). Combining these groups there was
   some heterogeneity (I-2 = 34\%) but the total HR was not statistically
   significant (HR 0.92; 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.14). This study failed to show
   any difference for its stated primary outcome.
   The summary estimate for disease-free survival at 10 years favoured SLNB
   over observation in participants with intermediate-thickness and thick
   melanomas (HR 0.75; 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.89).
   With regard to the rate of local and regional recurrence as the site of
   first recurrence, a benefit of SLNB uniformly existed in both groups of
   participants with intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (RR 0.56;
   95\% CI 0.45 to 0.69). This is in contrast with a uniformly unfavourable
   effect of SLNB with regard to the rate of distant metastases as site of
   first recurrence, in both groups of participants with
   intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (HR 1.33; 95\% CI 1.03 to
   1.72).
   Authors' conclusions
   We contacted the trial authors querying the lack of data on overall
   survival which was the primary outcome of their important study. They
   stated ``there are numerous additional analyses that have yet to be
   reported for the trial{''}. We expect that overall survival data will be
   available in a future update of this review.
   Disease-free survival and rate of local and regional recurrence favoured
   SLNB in both groups of participants with intermediate-thickness and
   thick melanomas but short-term surgical morbidity was higher in the SLNB
   group, especially with regard to complications in the nodal basin.
   The evidence for the outcomes of interest in this review is of low
   quality due to the risk of bias and imprecision of the estimated
   effects. Further research may have an important impact on our estimate
   of the effectiveness of SLNB in managing primary localised cutaneous
   melanoma. Currently this evidence is not sufficient to document a
   benefit of SLNB when compared to observation in individuals with primary
   localised cutaneous melanoma.},

Title = {Evaluating rainfall datasets to reconstruct floods in data-sparse
   Himalayan region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Floods are widespread natural disasters having significant
   socio-economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management
   strategies. Flood modelling is an enduring challenge, especially over
   the data-sparse mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, due to the
   lack of accurate rainfall measurements. Global datasets are often
   employed for flood modelling; however, their applicability over the
   Himalayan terrain is still uncertain. In this regard, the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model is
   increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates. This work aims
   at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets,
   satellite product, and the WRF model to represent heavy rainfall over
   the Himalayan terrain. Further, these datasets are used to drive the
   Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to assess their
   ability to reconstruct floods in the Himalayan region. A Rainfall-Flood
   Skill Score (RFSS) is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall
   datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the
   region. The range of RFSS can vary from - infinity to 1, with positive
   values as the desired value. The analysis is conducted over the upstream
   part of the Upper Ganga Basin, spanning from high elevation mountains to
   the foothills of the Himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that
   caused flooding in the region. Quantitative evaluation of rainfall
   datasets in terms of bias, RMSE, and scale errors shows high spatial
   variability with different datasets performing differently over various
   regions of the study area. The topography is observed to influence the
   performance of rainfall datasets. Based on the error metrics, it is
   found that the rainfall simulated using the WRF model exhibits least
   error in high elevation and valley regions of the Himalayas, whereas,
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation
   Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR, in some
   cases) datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the
   Himalayas. On forcing the VIC model with these datasets, the WRF model
   with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest
   RFSS score of 0.97 among all the datasets and, therefore, considered
   most suitable for simulating floods in the study region.},

Abstract = {Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act
   (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of
   them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide
   range of health services, including prevention and public health
   promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the
   Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public
   health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social
   workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some
   changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained.
   According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located
   with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the
   European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which
   otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the
   last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have
   recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of
   patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of
   these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting
   older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity
   would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but
   actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too.
   Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper
   care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the
   challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of
   collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is
   secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality
   per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a
   care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and
   secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national
   guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need
   more in the future is more research on new practices and models.
   Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not
   achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful
   hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of
   addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the
   quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication?
   Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was
   conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland,
   randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites
   (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed
   antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication
   in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist,
   filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The
   treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group
   without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were
   included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n =
   59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When
   initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19\% of the
   patients in the control group and for 68\% in the intervention group.
   Shortly after the appointment, only 14\% of the patients in the control
   group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32\%
   in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to
   more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64\% in the
   control group vs 95\% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even
   highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have
   significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a
   checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to
   substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use
   of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new
   antihypertensive medications.
   Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical
   education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation.
   Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and
   assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP)
   trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018,
   trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data
   about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of
   recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information
   about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of
   satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of
   their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44
   of them 65.7\% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings
   and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5\%)
   refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording
   with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it
   possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their
   achievements. `Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the
   most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was
   the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in
   favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion:
   Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs
   to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This
   teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication
   skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence
   near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It
   could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the
   place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could
   also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.
   Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric
   morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the
   prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of
   women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic
   and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including
   sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are
   associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi
   Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
   (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs)
   were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical,
   lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive
   symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women
   who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3\%) were classified as having peripartum
   depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant
   medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab
   background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and
   age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal
   depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the
   periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs.
   Incidences of depression were 17.4\% in women with a history of
   antidepressant medication, 16\% among women with diabetes, and 11.8\%
   among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and
   lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among
   women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without.
   Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy
   may help identify women in need of support.
   Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of
   general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the
   Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund
   through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of
   this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions
   used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative
   research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions.
   This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general
   practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them
   responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared
   test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is
   qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general
   practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102
   were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most
   general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49
   years. The participants' age had a significant influence on
   sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438
   participants, 33.3\% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7\%
   general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned
   significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that
   worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were
   significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons
   for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals
   above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification
   of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education.
   `Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction:
   49.8\% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who
   were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently.
   Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the
   workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.
   Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies,
   reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of
   the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial.
   According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is
   a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a
   scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests
   the term `effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed
   studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We
   updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE.
   Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3,
   2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and
   August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword `Hawthorne
   Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of
   an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles
   defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without
   defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent
   readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by
   consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All
   the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant
   or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods
   and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in
   time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or
   indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their
   previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and
   to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting.
   Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis
   is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of
   the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its
   implication as an experimental artefact.
   Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise.
   Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of
   multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health
   outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such
   patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming.
   Recent eHealth tools, such as the `systematic tool to reduce
   inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for
   GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research
   question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help
   GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid
   patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled
   trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10
   patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic
   medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of
   using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to
   usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria
   (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth
   setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their
   electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are
   followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness
   is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and
   fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients'
   willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and
   enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient
   recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the
   study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software
   in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP
   assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid
   patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on
   the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss
   primary care in this new eHealth environment.
   Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is
   becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide.
   Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions.
   How often it happened towards young doctors working as general
   practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely
   studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of
   WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and
   violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The
   cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their
   postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed
   anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians
   of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and
   forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself
   and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9\%,
   female 87\%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of
   the residents were working in an urban practice (63\%), others in the
   rural and the suburban once (27\%, 10\%). All GP residents experienced
   patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them.
   High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was
   experienced by 44\%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual
   harassment) by 84\% while all residents experienced verbal violence.
   Only 13.2\% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most
   of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the
   one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of
   violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact
   that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions.
   Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.
   Background: About 50\% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France.
   Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's
   difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because
   there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How
   can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient
   compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate
   scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic
   review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO
   databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the
   database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All
   articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection
   criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability
   of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One
   reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then
   abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development,
   validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were
   included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and
   18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in
   primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially
   hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication
   adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple
   chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65
   years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two
   scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the
   instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic
   adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been
   developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with
   multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by
   Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale
   would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence:
   motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE
   protocol.
   Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining
   quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research
   question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between
   increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently
   occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe
   how these associations differ across different European countries and
   regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of
   the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe
   (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+
   years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined
   as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were
   self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire
   containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by
   participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure
   questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between
   increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear
   regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of
   diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis
   will take into account differences between countries and regions.
   Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and
   included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits,
   social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants
   (49.09\%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per
   person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis
   showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95\%CI: -1.29, -1.24)
   with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be
   the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95\%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in
   Israel, -0.67 (95\%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will
   identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as
   well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between
   increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.
   Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically
   estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs
   often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall
   burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research
   questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which
   multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what
   extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension
   and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and
   NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free
   participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective
   Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes,
   chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We
   quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a
   competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking,
   hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy.
   Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were
   diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004
   with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with
   neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7\%) were
   diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the
   age of 45 onwards was 94.0\% (95\%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8\%
   (95\%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was
   associated with a 9.0-year delay (95\%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset
   of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants
   without risk factors was 6.0 years (95\%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those
   with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent
   21.6\% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8\% for
   those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45
   years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining
   lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up.
   Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of
   morbidity of NCDs.
   Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases
   the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following
   visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic
   reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research
   question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in
   improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how:
   financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational
   retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried
   out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient
   chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The
   quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the
   intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of
   diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of
   recording diagnoses was about 40\% in the primary care units. After four
   years, the recording rate had risen to 90\% (p < 0.001). The rate of
   change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year
   of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild
   respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type
   II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording
   of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced
   data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life
   in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.
   Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and
   communities and remains undiscovered in 90\% of the cases. In total,
   80\% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the
   Netherlands, at least 3\% (118 000) of children are victims of child
   abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3\% of abuse cases are
   reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services
   agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs'
   experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion
   of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon
   their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their
   management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four
   focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different
   levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the
   Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results:
   Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling
   that `something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by
   gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They
   often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because
   parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and
   differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual
   abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases
   they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most
   GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the
   risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate
   by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients'
   trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other
   professionals.
   Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic
   conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is
   known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts,
   especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing
   number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life
   (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific
   patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among
   patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to
   measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research
   question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with
   multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM
   for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize
   the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to
   measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity
   of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus
   group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant
   QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft
   questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with
   multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft
   questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement
   quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients
   with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results:
   There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under
   development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with
   multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's
   number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no
   statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL
   among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated
   PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of
   QoL among patients with multimorbidity.
   Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and
   qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners
   Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive
   definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the
   biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more
   than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care.
   Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute
   hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk
   factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity.
   Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity
   could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e.
   decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up?
   Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's
   multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of
   inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status
   `decompensation' or `nothing to report' was collected. A logistic
   regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival
   analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months
   follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were
   identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6\% of the population,
   had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days.
   Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number
   of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and
   total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95\%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039).
   Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid
   outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters
   or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others
   in medical literature.
   Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family
   medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and
   Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the
   20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the
   observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods:
   Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia
   recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure
   using electronic medical records based on the International
   Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the
   doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of
   care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of
   both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in
   one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family
   practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint
   top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations
   were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds
   ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological
   gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the
   causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the
   observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to
   assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family
   medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent
   with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most
   observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness
   diversity.
   Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning
   of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was
   then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic
   model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected
   the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess
   therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to
   translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to
   assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations.
   Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous
   between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods:
   Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating
   countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi
   procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing
   the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP
   teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of
   the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the
   assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A
   consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the
   `homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original
   version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage
   permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation
   issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions
   of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be
   helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in
   daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training,
   and for further research in these five countries.
   Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established
   patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a
   GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient
   immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to
   evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a
   single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the
   PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre
   patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with
   brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before
   and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview
   two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures
   were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and
   negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with
   different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients
   with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations
   between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively.
   Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive
   value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The
   reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2.
   Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure
   patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but
   it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement
   scores.
   Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research,
   which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science
   approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important
   shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct
   might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health
   services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now.
   There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations
   for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as
   polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these
   recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also
   help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health
   services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that
   `intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different
   challenges to researchers and health services compared to `active
   psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but
   tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward.
   This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and
   illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas
   where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care
   design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more
   coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve
   medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy.
   These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also
   the scale.
   Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases
   (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over
   time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health
   and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to
   describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and
   polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients
   in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care
   sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR)
   database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records.
   Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of
   >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of
   Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified
   using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the
   Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses
   will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The
   prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be
   presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and
   older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and
   permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented,
   stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other
   factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health
   service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to
   identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy
   in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This
   research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
   mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These
   findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to
   contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in
   the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed
   medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the
   context of multimorbidity.
   Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for
   general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate
   medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains
   challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from
   guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among
   patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify
   barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with
   polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with
   multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular
   medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of
   whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and
   chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards
   deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions
   and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards
   deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so
   far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants
   were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48\% female. Thirty-one percent
   lived alone, and 85\% prepared their medication themselves, all others
   required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular
   medicines and 24\% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76\%)
   were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78\% did
   not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were
   not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers
   to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96\%), long-term drugs
   (56\%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92\%). When it
   comes to deprescribing, 89\% of participants wanted as much information
   as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP
   was a further key factor to them (85\%). Conclusion: Most older adults
   are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their
   medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared
   decision-making with the GP they trust.
   Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity,
   general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice
   are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need'
   patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to
   automatically create a list of possible `high need' patients could be a
   quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients.
   Research question: Can `high need' patients with multimorbidity be
   identified automatically from their primary care medical records?
   Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity
   (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel
   primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely
   recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare
   use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was
   conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general
   practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were
   age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication
   use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were
   identified, of which 48\% were above the age of 65 and 57\% female. More
   than 42\% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62\% used five
   or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general
   practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts
   in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including
   specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the
   model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for
   ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC:
   0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: `High need' patients with
   multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical
   records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in
   the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to
   identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.
   Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow
   progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity
   patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying
   pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is
   necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies.
   Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which
   longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up?
   Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health
   records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people
   aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes
   for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied
   for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis
   to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their
   progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted,
   estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2)
   the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each
   individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected
   ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP.
   Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total,
   916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster
   including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific
   (42.0\% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the
   following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases
   (19.3\%), osteometabolic (7.9\%), cardio-circulatory (6.6\%), and
   others. Most patients, minimum 59.2\%, remained in the same cluster
   during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state
   were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1\%) and nervous (31.8\%)
   MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The
   application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the
   study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method
   is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.
   Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative
   surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed
   on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the
   creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to
   determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected
   quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the
   general population. Research question: What is the best possible
   reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general
   population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to
   April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA
   (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses)
   protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for
   each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or
   those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values
   were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected
   articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's
   coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency
   data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36,
   SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the
   SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to
   0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully
   validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and
   Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most
   validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and
   clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality
   of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the
   one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as
   no external validity is available.
   Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection
   among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies
   if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question:
   This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of
   type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An
   HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test
   during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an
   infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test.
   We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to
   those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer,
   receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment,
   anaemia less than 9 mg\%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637
   patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September
   2017. The following information was collected: age, gender,
   socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication
   in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA,
   CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In
   total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c
   test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and
   sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection
   (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression
   analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of
   infection between 29 and 60\%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c
   increased the risk by 8.5\%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the
   infection increases the chance of infection by 734\%. Conclusion:
   Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection
   among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much
   more significant risk factor.},

   Tunnel Wall and Target Sphere},

Abstract = {Objective The quality of tunnel engineering is crucial factor for
   ensuring traffic operation safety. In this regard, tunnel construction
   analysis, tunnel deformation monitoring, and tunnel disaster prediction
   and early warning can be realized by using three-dimensional laser
   scanner to scan the tunnel regularly or irregularly to generate a point
   cloud model and then analyze the point cloud data. The segmentation of
   tunnel wall and target sphere from scanned tunnel laser point cloud
   scenes is an important part of tunnel 3D reconstruction and is the key
   technology for realizing the automatic monitoring of tunnel scenes.
   However, the tunnel 3D point cloud obtained by laser scanning often
   contains noise points and outliers, a high proportion of which is
   attributable to the ground points, which are connected with the tunnel
   wall, in the tunnel point cloud scenes. Direct processing of the tunnel
   point cloud data affects the extraction and recognition of the target
   sphere and tunnel wall. Considering the challenge of tunnel ground
   filtering and the lack of application platforms directly usable to
   segment the tunnel wall and extract the point cloud of the tunnel target
   ball, a ground filtering algorithm suitable for tunnel scenes and
   extraction method of the tunnel wall and target ball are proposed
   herein. Methods Given that extant point cloud filtering algorithms are
   not suitable for tunnel point cloud scenes, this paper proposes a ground
   filtering algorithm based on a combination of RANSAC plane fitting and
   pass -through filtering based on normal evaluation. A normal estimation
   process is added to the plane based on RANSAC fitting to ensure that the
   fitting optimal plane model is on the tunnel ground level. Then, the
   points below the optimal plane level are filtered out in conjunction
   with the pass -through filtering to obtain the tunnel ground points.
   Considering that it is challenging to extract the tunnel wall and target
   sphere, a segmentation method for laser point cloud on the tunnel wall
   (from coarse to fine) and a target sphere extraction method are proposed
   herein. First, the region of interest is extracted from the tunnel
   feature points, and the noise point clusters of the non -tunnel wall are
   then filtered out based on the DBSCAN method under constraints so as to
   obtain the tunnel wall model and possible distribution area of the
   target ball. The DBSCAN fine segmentation of the possible distribution
   area of the target ball under constraints is performed to obtain the
   target ball point clusters, and the nonlinear least squares (NLS)
   fitting is employed to obtain the ball center coordinates and related
   parameters of the target ball.Results and Discussions This paper also
   presents the verification of the effectiveness of the proposed ground
   filtering algorithm and target ball and tunnel wall extraction method in
   two tunnel scenes. Table 3 indicates that the proposed ground filtering
   method is superior to the conventional CSF filtering, slope filtering,
   and ground filtering methods in terms of the regional growth and
   elevation change for three types of errors, Kappa coefficient values,
   and time efficiency values. Thus, the effectiveness and advantages of
   the proposed filtering algorithm in tunnel scenes are demonstrated.
   Table 3 and Fig. 7 (b) show that the Kappa coefficient value of the
   proposed filtering algorithm is the highest, indicating its high
   robustness.
   As indicated by the results of the fusion comparison experiment, as
   compared to the RANSAC plane fitting, the fusion of normal estimation,
   pass-through filtering, and downsampling has a better effect on the
   ground filtering, and the comprehensive filtering effect is stronger
   than that of the comparison methods. This paper presents a comparison of
   the target sphere cluster (DBRTS) obtained by the DBSCAN condition
   constraint method and the manually intercepted target sphere cluster
   (Manual) by using ball fitting experiments. The final ball center error
   and fitting rate verify the effectiveness of the method of obtaining the
   target sphere and fitting method proposed herein. It is evident from the
   comparison in Table 4 that among the three target balls, the fitting
   effect of the proposed method is not as good as that of the NLS fitting.
   This is because the manually intercepted target ball point cloud retains
   more target points, and the more the details, the better the fitting
   effect. However, the proposed method can be employed to automatically
   obtain the target ball point cloud; this is more applicable and robust
   than the method of manually intercepting the target ball. Moreover, the
   spherical center error of DBRTS on the second and third fitting target
   balls is smaller than that of the NLS fitting method of manually
   intercepting the target ball; this indicates that the spherical center
   coordinates of the target ball fitted by this method are closer to the
   true values. In general, the target sphere point cloud obtained with our
   method and sphere fitting method proposed in this paper have evident
   advantages and are applicable in tunnel point cloud scenes.Conclusions
   Considering the 3D point cloud data of tunnel scenes as the research
   object, this paper first proposes a ground filtering algorithm that
   entails a combination of the RANSAC plane fitting method based on normal
   evaluation and pass-through filtering. This method dynamically adjusts
   the threshold according to the point cloud scene and realizes adaptive
   filtering, which has good applicability and robustness. Second, a target
   sphere and tunnel wall extraction scheme based on DBSCAN constraint
   conditions and NLS sphere fitting is also proposed. The clustering
   segmentation is mainly realized using the density property of point
   cloud. The tunnel wall and target sphere point clusters are extracted by
   filtering the noise point clusters in the tunnel by standardizing the
   constraint conditions, and the relevant parameters and distribution are
   then obtained by fitting the target sphere point clusters based on the
   NLS sphere. The target sphere point cloud obtained by this method is
   compared with the manually intercepted target sphere point cloud. The
   experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this method and also
   highlight the advantages of the NLS sphere fitting, which completed the
   target sphere extraction task in tunnel scenes. Although the proposed
   algorithm achieves good results, a few deficiencies still exist. For
   example, regarding large-scale laser point cloud scenes, adoption of
   DBSCAN clustering segmentation is time-consuming, and some methods to
   improve the efficiency of clustering optimization algorithm can be
   studied in the future.},

Title = {Axillary treatment for operable primary breast cancer},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background
   Axillary surgery is an established part of the management of primary
   breast cancer. It provides staging information to guide adjuvant therapy
   and potentially local control of axillary disease. Several alternative
   approaches to axillary surgery are available, most of which aim to spare
   a proportion of women the morbidity of complete axillary dissection.
   Objectives
   To assess the benefits and harms of alternative approaches to axillary
   surgery (including omitting such surgery altogether) in terms of overall
   survival; local, regional and distant recurrences; and adverse events.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register,
   MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization
   International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov
   on 12 March 2015 without language restrictions. We also contacted study
   authors and checked reference lists.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including women with clinically
   defined operable primary breast cancer conducted to compare axillary
   lymph node dissection (ALND) with no axillary surgery, axillary sampling
   or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); RCTs comparing axillary sampling
   with SLNB or no axillary surgery; RCTs comparing SLNB with no axillary
   surgery; and RCTs comparing ALND with or without radiotherapy (RT)
   versus RT alone.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed each potentially relevant
   trial for inclusion. We independently extracted outcome data, risk of
   bias information and study characteristics from all included trials. We
   pooled data according to trial interventions, and we used hazard ratios
   (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for binary
   outcomes.
   Main results
   We included 26 RCTs in this review. Studies were at low or unclear risk
   of selection bias. Blinding was not done, but this was only considered a
   source of bias for outcomes with potential for subjectivity in
   measurements. We found no RCTs of axillary sampling versus SLNB,
   axillary sampling versus no axillary surgery or SLNB versus no axillary
   surgery.
   No axillary surgery versus ALND
   Ten trials involving 3849 participants compared no axillary surgery
   versus ALND. Moderate quality evidence showed no important differences
   between overall survival of women in the two groups (HR1.06, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.17; 3849 participants; 10 studies)
   although no axillary surgery increased the risk of locoregional
   recurrence (HR ranging from 1.10 to 3.06; 20,863 person-years of
   follow-up; four studies). It was uncertain whether no surgery increased
   the risk of distant metastasis compared with ALND (HR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.87
   to 1.30; 946 participants; two studies). Low-quality evidence indicated
   no axillary surgery decreased the risk of lymphoedema compared with ALND
   (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.43; 1714 participants; four studies).
   Axillary sampling versus ALND
   Six trials involving 1559 participants compared axillary sampling versus
   ALND. Low-quality evidence indicated similar effectiveness of axillary
   sampling compared with ALND in terms of overall survival (HR 0.94, 95\%
   CI 0.73 to 1.21; 967 participants; three studies) but it was unclear
   whether axillary sampling led to increased risk of local recurrence
   compared with ALND (HR 1.41, 95\% CI 0.94 to 2.12; 1404 participants;
   three studies). The relative effectiveness of axillary sampling and ALND
   for locoregional recurrence (HR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.46 to 1.20; 406
   participants; one study) and distant metastasis was uncertain (HR 1.05,
   95\% CI 0.74 to 1.49; 406 participants; one study). Lymphoedema was less
   likely after axillary sampling than after ALND (OR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.13 to
   0.81; 80 participants; one study).
   SLNB versus ALND
   Seven trials involving 9426 participants compared SLNB with ALND.
   Moderate-quality evidence showed similar overall survival following SLNB
   compared with ALND (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.89 to 1.25; 6352 participants;
   three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Differences in local
   recurrence (HR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.24 to 3.77; 516 participants; one study),
   locoregional recurrence (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.24; 5611
   participants; one study) and distant metastasis (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.42
   to 1.53; 516 participants; one study) were uncertain. However, studies
   showed little absolute difference in the aforementioned outcomes.
   Lymphoedema was less likely after SLNB than ALND (OR ranged from 0.04 to
   0.60; three studies; 1965 participants; low-quality evidence). Three
   studies including 1755 participants reported quality of life:
   Investigators in two studies found quality of life better after SLNB
   than ALND, and in the other study observed no difference.
   RT versus ALND
   Four trials involving 2585 participants compared RT alone with ALND
   (with or without RT). High-quality evidence indicated that overall
   survival was reduced among women treated with radiotherapy alone
   compared with those treated with ALND (HR 1.10, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.21;
   2469 participants; four studies), and local recurrence was less likely
   in women treated with radiotherapy than in those treated with ALND (HR
   0.80, 95\% CI 0.64 to 0.99; 22,256 person-years of follow-up; four
   studies). Risk of distant metastasis was similar for radiotherapy alone
   as for ALND(HR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.93 to 1.25; 1313 participants; one
   study), and whether lymphoedema was less likely after RT alone than ALND
   remained uncertain (OR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.16 to 1.44; 200 participants; one
   study).
   Less surgery versus ALND
   When combining results from all trials, treatment involving less surgery
   was associated with reduced overall survival compared with ALND (HR
   1.08, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.17; 6478 participants; 18 studies). Whether
   local recurrence was reduced with less axillary surgery when compared
   with ALND was uncertain (HR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.09; 24,176
   participant-years of follow up; eight studies). Locoregional recurrence
   was more likely with less surgery than with ALND (HR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.31
   to 1.78; 26,880 participant-years of follow-up; seven studies). Whether
   risk of distant metastasis was increased after less axillary surgery
   compared with ALND was uncertain (HR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.95 to 1.20; 2665
   participants; five studies). Lymphoedema was less likely after less
   axillary surgery than with ALND (OR 0.37, 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.46; 3964
   participants; nine studies).
   No studies reported on disease control in the axilla.
   Authors' conclusions
   This review confirms the benefit of SLNB and axillary sampling as
   alternatives to ALND for axillary staging, supporting the view that ALND
   of the clinically and radiologically uninvolved axilla is no longer
   acceptable practice in people with breast cancer.},

Title = {Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Denoising Algorithm Based on Deep
   Learning},
Journal = {ACTA OPTICA SINICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) is a kind of sensor to capture
   microwaves. Its principle is to establish images through the reflection
   of waveforms, so as to solve the problem that traditional optical remote
   sensing radars are affected by weather, air impurities, and other
   environmental factors when collecting images. The most widely used SAR
   is change detection (CD). CD refers to the dynamic acquisition of image
   information from a certain target, which includes three steps: image
   preprocessing, generation of difference maps, and analysis and
   calculation of difference maps. It is applied to the estimation of
   natural disasters, management and allocation of resources, and
   measurement of land topographic characteristics. However, in the process
   of CD, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images will reduce the
   performance of CD. Therefore, the image denoising method has become a
   basic method of preprocessing in CD. How to restore a clean image from a
   noisy SAR image is an urgent problem to be solved.
   Methods Traditional denoising algorithms of SAR images generally use the
   global denoising idea whose principle is to use the global similar
   information in images to perform processing and judgment. In the case of
   the high resolution of images, these algorithms need a series of
   preprocessing such as smoothing and then complete pixel distinction
   through the neighborhood processing of each image block. The algorithms
   usually occupy huge computing resources and have certain spatial and
   temporal limitations in practical applications. In addition, they cannot
   efficiently complete the denoising task. In terms of deep learning, some
   algorithms perform well, but there is still room for improvement in
   network convergence speed, model redundancy, and accuracy. To solve
   these problems, this paper proposes a denoising algorithm based on a
   multi-scale attention cascade convolutional neural network (MALNet). The
   network mainly uses the idea of multi- scale irregular convolution
   kernel and attention. Compared with a single convolution kernel, a
   multi-scale irregular convolution kernel has an excellent image
   receptive field. In other words, it can collect image information from
   different scales to extract more detailed image features. Subsequently,
   the convolution kernels of different scales are concat layers in the
   network, and an attention mechanism is introduced into a concat feature
   map to divide the attention of the features so that the whole model has
   a positive enhancement ability for the main features of the image. In
   the middle of the network, the dense cascade layer is used to further
   strengthen the features. Finally, the image restoration and
   reconstruction are realized by network subtraction.
   Results and Discussions In this paper, qualitative and quantitative
   experiments are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed MALNet model in denoising. The WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-
   CNN algorithms are compared with our proposed method. The clear state
   and complete signs of the denoised images are visually observed. In
   order to make a fair comparison, we use the default settings of the
   three algorithms provided by the authors in the literatures. Peak
   signal-to- noise ratio ( PSNR), structural similarity index measure
   (SSIM), and image entropy are used as objective evaluation indexes. The
   PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy are calculated as error metrics. Three
   denoising algorithms are compared, and airpoirt, mountain, and coast are
   selected as verification images. The denoising effects of airport images
   (Fig. 7), coast images (Fig. 8), and mountain images (Fig. 9) are
   analyzed. It shows the visual effect comparison of denoising results of
   different algorithms. In Figs. 7-9, 6 figures are successively noise-
   free image, noise image, denoised image obtained by WNNM, denoised image
   obtained by SAR-BM3D, denoised image obtained by SAR-CNN and denoised
   image obtained by MALNet. It is obvious that the WNNM denoised image has
   many defects that are not removed completely, and the texture loss is
   quite serious. SAR-BM3D denoised image retains some details, but the
   aircraft fuselage is very vague, and the tail part has gotten most of
   the edge information erased. Although the aircraft wing in the SAR- CNN
   denoised image is recovered, the whole aircraft at the bottom is still
   far from the reference image, and the recovered small objects are
   blurred. It can be seen from Table 3 that the average PSNR value of the
   proposed MALNet is about 9. 25 dB higher than that of SAR-BM3D, about 0.
   75 dB higher than that of SAR-CNN, and about 14. 45 dB higher than that
   of WNNM. Moreover, in terms of the noise level, MALNet is 0. 01 dB less
   than that SAR-CNN. The PSNR value of the proposed MALNet model at each
   noise level is higher than that of other algorithms. Especially, when
   the noise parameter is 20, the proposed method is 2. 56 dB higher than
   that of the SAR- CNN algorithm. In terms of structural similarity (Table
   4), it can be seen that the SSIM of MALNet is mostly the highest among
   all methods. Only when the noise parameter is 50, it is slightly lower
   than that of SAR- CNN, but the average SSIM is still the highest. The
   average information entropy of the denoised images by the four
   algorithms is 7. 113492 bit/pixel for WNNM, 6. 842258 bit/pixel for SAR-
   BM3D, 7. 499375 bit/ pixel for SAR-CNN, and 6. 6917 bit/pixel for
   MALNet. The proposed algorithm outperforms WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-CNN
   by 0. 42179 bit/ pixel, 0. 15056 bit/pixel, and 0. 80768 bit/pixel,
   respectively. Therefore, in terms of the three objective evaluation
   indexes of PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy, the proposed network in this
   paper has better denoising performance than other comparison methods.
   Conclusions In this paper, a new denoising model MALNet is proposed for
   solving the noise in SAR images. This model uses an end-to-end
   architecture and does not require separate subnets or manual
   intervention. The solution includes three modules, i. e., multi-scale
   irregular convolution module, feature extraction module based on
   attention mechanism, and feature enhancement module based on dense
   cascade network. The model also adds batch normalization and global
   average pooling to improve its adaptability. It can complete convergence
   without massive data sets. The image data can complete convergence after
   150 rounds of training. The training efficiency is outstanding, and the
   portability is positive. The experimental results show that compared
   with those of other traditional image denoising algorithms, the PSNR and
   SSIM of the proposed algorithm are improved by 0. 75 dB-14. 45 dB and 0.
   01-0. 16, respectively. The proposed algorithm is superior to other
   algorithms in image entropy and can better recover the details of
   images.},

Title = {Spring Migration Ecology of the Mid-Continent Sandhill Crane Population
   with an Emphasis on Use of the Central Platte River Valley, Nebraska},
Journal = {WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {189},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-41},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We conducted a 10-year study (1998-2007) of the Mid-Continent Population
   (MCP) of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) to identify spring-migration
   corridors, locations of major stopovers, and migration chronology by
   crane breeding affiliation (western Alaska-Siberia {[}WA-S], northern
   Canada-Nunavut {[}NC-N], west-central Canada-Alaska {[}WC-A], and
   east-central Canada-Minnesota {[}EC-M]). In the Central Platte River
   Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, we evaluated factors influencing staging
   chronology, food habits, fat storage, and habitat use of sandhill
   cranes. We compared our findings to results from the Platte River
   Ecology Study conducted during 1978-1980. We determined spring migration
   corridors used by the breeding affiliations (designated subpopulations
   for management purposes) by monitoring 169 cranes marked with platform
   transmitter terminals (PTTs). We also marked and monitored 456 cranes in
   the CPRV with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to evaluate length
   and pattern of stay, habitat use, and movements. An estimated 42\% and
   58\% of cranes staging in the CPRV were greater sandhill cranes (G. c.
   tabida) and lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis), and they stayed
   for an average of 20 and 25 days (2000-2007), respectively. Cranes from
   the WA-S, NC-N, WC-A, and EC-M affiliations spent an average of 72, 77,
   52, and 53 days, respectively, in spring migration of which 28, 23, 24,
   and 18 days occurred in the CPRV. The majority of the WA-S subpopulation
   settled in the CPRV apparently because of inadequate habitat to support
   more birds upstream, although WA-S cranes accounted for >90\% of birds
   staging in the North Platte River Valley. Crane staging duration in the
   CPRV was negatively correlated with arrival dates; 92\% of cranes stayed
   >7 days. A program of annual mechanical removal of mature stands of
   woody growth and seedlings that began in the early 1980s primarily in
   the main channel of the Platte River has allowed distribution of crane
   roosts to remain relatively stable over the past 2 decades. Most cranes
   returned to nocturnal roost sites used in previous years. Corn residues
   dominated the diet of sandhill cranes in the CPRV, as in the 1970s,
   despite a marked decline in standing crop of corn residues. Only 14\%
   (10 of 74) of PTT-marked migrant cranes stayed at stopovers for >= 5
   days before arriving in the CPRV, which limited the contribution of
   sites south of the CPRV for fat accumulation needed for migration and
   reproduction. Body masses of cranes (after adjusting for body size {[}an
   index of fat]) at arrival in the CPRV varied widely among years
   (1998-2006), indicating the importance of maintaining productive
   habitats on the wintering grounds to condition cranes for migration and
   reproduction. Average rates of fat gain by adult females while in the
   CPRV remained similar from 1978-1979 to 1998-1999 but declined among
   males. Distances cranes flew to feeding grounds in the CPRV increased as
   the percentage of cropland planted to soybeans increased and as density
   of cranes on nocturnal roosts increased. These results suggest that as
   habitats of limited or no value to cranes increase on the landscape,
   more flight time and higher maintenance costs may reduce fat storage. An
   estimated 40\% of diurnal use occurred north of Interstate 80 (I-80)
   where <= 5\% of lands dedicated to crane conservation are located.
   Seventy-four and 40\% of PTT-marked EC-M and WC-A cranes had spring
   migrations that included staging in eastern South Dakota for an average
   of 11 and 10 days, respectively.
   Cranes of the NC-N, WA-S, and WC-A subpopulations staged an average of
   25, 17, and 12 days in central and western Saskatchewan/eastern Alberta.
   Females in these affiliations increased their fat reserves after leaving
   Nebraska by an estimated 450, 451, and 452 g, respectively, underscoring
   the key role of these staging areas in preparing the 3 subpopulations
   for reproduction. After departing Nebraska, MCP cranes roosted primarily
   in basin wetlands. Most of these wetlands are in private ownership and
   lack adequate protection, emphasizing the need for effective laws and
   policies to ensure their long-term protection. The continued success of
   the current management goal of maintaining the MCP at approximately its
   current size and providing diverse recreational opportunities over a
   wide area of midcontinent and western North America is predicated on the
   ability of MCP cranes to continue to store large fat reserves in the
   CPRV in advance of breeding. For the CPRV to remain a key fat storage
   site, active channel maintenance (e. g., clearing of woody vegetation)
   likely will need to continue, along with establishing minimum stream
   flows. These actions would help ensure nocturnal roosting habitat
   remains sufficiently dispersed to provide cranes with daily intake of
   high-energy food adequate for major fat storage and limit risk of high
   mortality from storms and disease. Published 2014. This article is a

Abstract = {The Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS) is a comprehensive
   prototype integrated coastal ocean observing system that was established
   in the summer or 2001. its current configuration includes eleven
   solar-powered buoy-monitored locations with physical and optical
   sensors, four shore-based long-range HF radar systems for surface
   current measurement, operational circulation and wave models, satellite
   observations, inshore nutrient monitoring, and hourly web-delivery of
   data. It serves a broad array of real-time oceanographic and marine
   meteorological data and data products to scientists, state and federal
   regulators, the National Weather Service, both the US and Canadian Coast
   Guards, the National Data Buoy Center, educators, regional
   natural-resource managers, the Gulf of Maine fishing and maritime
   industries, local airports and airlines, sailors, and the general
   public. The ocean observing system that can be thought of as consisting
   of four major subsystems: the data acquisition subsystem; the data
   handling, processing, and archiving subsystem; the system of numerical
   nowcast and forecast models; and a web-based data
   distribution/presentation subsystem.
   The Gulf of Maine is a harsh operational environment. Winter storms pose
   severe challenges including the build up of sea ice on buoy, its solar
   panels, and its meteorological sensors. In summer the productive waters
   of the gulf can present severe biofouling problems that affect the
   operation of optical sensors. Thus, the periods of most difficult field
   operations coincide with the periods of greatest data value in terms of
   marine safety, search and rescue, and the monitoring biological
   productivity. Never-the-less, the data returns for the GoMOOS ocean
   sensor array has averaged approximately 90\% over the first seven years
   of operation. This unusually high rate of data return is due in large
   part to our operational six-month duty/maintenance cycle on all
   equipment. We have 22 buoys for I I locations, and 22 complete sets of
   instrumentation that are rotated in and out of service on a six month
   schedule.
   The challenges of the Gulf of Maine physical environment were largely
   understood a priori, and were incorporated into the system design
   criteria and the blueprints for the service and maintenance protocols.
   However, there were unanticipated challenges in the funding process that
   have caused the greatest difficulties, and which continue to pose a
   serious threat to continued operation and success of this ocean
   observing system, as well as others observing systems in the United
   States. Funding for the system has been chronically short and subject to
   the unpredictable fluctuations of a US congressional appropriations
   process. The inadequacy and variability of funding has substantially
   hampered the operations of many of the Integrated Ocean Observing
   Systems (IOOS), including CoMOOS, and has hindered technological
   improvements. The funding crisis has deepened to the point that, unless
   this trend is quickly reversed, the number of monitoring stations will
   be substantially reduced and system will no longer be able to serve many
   of citizens, organizations, and agencies that have come to rely upon the
   data it currently provides.
   Ocean sensors, ocean platform technologies, and modeling and
   visualization techniques are in a period of rapid technical development.
   If stable funding can be achieved, the capabilities of operational ocean
   observing systems could increase dramatically over the next decade.
   Autonomous vehicles could become the fast response survey fleet of the
   IOOS, as well as taking on routine, sustained marine survey functions
   that are already prohibitively expensive to perform using ships, and
   will become even more costly as energy costs rise in the future.
   Practical autonomous vehicles will likely expand beyond gliders and AUVs
   to include surface sail vessels and energy-efficient autonomous aerial
   drones. The combination of time series measurements from profiling
   packages on buoy arrays with the repeatedly spatial surveys of the
   autonomous fleets will provide a new look at our coastal oceans that
   could transform coastal ocean science and management. Coupled with these
   new platform advances will be significant growth in the areas of
   real-time biochemical sensors, sensor miniaturization, high-speed data
   telemetry technologies, increases in onboard data processing
   capabilities, routine two-way communications with submerged sensors, and
   advances in data visualization techniques that will amount to virtual
   presence. The single greatest enabling factor of these broad
   improvements to ocean observing operations and science appears, at
   present, to be the establishment of an adequate, stable, and predictable
   funding process.},
