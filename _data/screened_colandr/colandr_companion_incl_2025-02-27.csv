7037221,"Remote Sensing Products And Services In Support Of Agricultural Public Policies In Africa: Overview And Challenges","In the last decade, governments, international institutions, donors, the private sector, etc. have shown a renewed interest in agricultural issues in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This interest came with a strong need for information in countries where the lack of reliable and timely basic information can be a problem. Thanks to its capacity to observe the Earth at local, regional, and global scales and from various vantage points, satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to streamline the monitoring and improvement of the existing systems, and thus to support decision-making. However, the path from satellite images to public policy decisions is not straightforward, and today, only few operational information services are available in SSA countries (e.g., early warning systems for food security and desert locust plagues prevention, rangeland production forecasting). This paper aims to analyze the gap between the technical aspects of the remote sensing sciences and the pragmatic need for relevant data to address agricultural policies in Africa and produce operational recommendations. To achieve this goal, the authors (1) determine the information, and in particular the geoinformation, needed to develop, implement and evaluate agricultural public policies (2) illustrate the role of remote sensing as a public policy tool in SSA through an overview of the current off-the-shelf products and services derived from Earth Observation systems, and (3) propose an analysis of the existing gap between the remote sensing research community and the policy makers. Based on this review, the authors conclude that to benefit from this technological advancement and bridge the gap between technical analysts and policy makers, some key points are fundamental: capacity building, political will and institutional commitment, public-private partnership, and proofs of concept.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/fsufs.2020.00058","{""notes"": ""('begue_remotesensingproductsservices_2020',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 17:18:19,"included",NA,NA
6691716,"Future earth observation strategy for societal benefits","This invited paper presents the future intelligent observing system (FIEOS) and event-driven earth observation concepts as well as their connections to societal benefits for both decision-makers and the general public. The elucidated linkage and flow of information from FIEOS to societal benefits is interoperable. With the envisioned FIEOS, this paper places an emphasis on (i) How to apply the FIEOS to increase the efficiency of monitoring natural disaster, to improve the natural disaster management, and to mitigate disasters through providing highly accurate, and reliable surveillance data for experts, analysts, and decision-makers; (ii) How to significantly increase and extend societal benefits to the future U.S. Earth observation application strategy in, for example, realtime response to time-critical events, and disastrous environmental monitoring. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of FIEOS to society benefit in the realms: (i) reducing loss of life and property from natural and human-induced disasters, (ii) improving human health and well-being, (iii) improving wealth forecasting, (iv) supporting sustainable agriculture, and (v) serving lay people.",2005,"{""Zhou, Guoqing""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2005.1526433","{}","{maybe}",2024-04-22 02:38:22,"included",NA,NA
7037354,"Solar Project Financing, Bankability, And Resource Assessment","This chapter deals with issues involved during solar project financing and resource assessment. In the first half of the chapter, an overview of financing and bankability of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants is provided, with a slight touch on microgrid PV financing. The discussion revolves around risk management, which requires rigorous assessment of the financial viability. Since a robust solar radiation dataset is essential for securing competitive financing for solar-power projects, the second half of the chapter discusses solar resource assessment—a data-oriented exercise. The best practices on solar resource calculation are exemplified through various case studies using data collected at a tropical site: Singapore. Subsequently, 5 latest satellite-derived irradiance products and 2 latest global reanalysis products are reviewed. Detailed instruction for data downloading is also provided to facilitate the worldwide uptake of these high-quality data. Latest scientific methods on site adaptation—a class of procedures to reduce the uncertainties embedded in gridded products—are presented with a Brazilian case study. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/978-3-030-41952-3_8","{""notes"": ""('yang_solarprojectfinancingbankability_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-17 04:28:29,"included",NA,NA
7038064,"Disaster Management And Virtual Globes: A High Potential For Developing Countries","Today, the added value of geoinformation for crisis management is well known and accepted. However, experiences show that disaster management units on local administrative levels in the developing world often lack the use of Geographic Information Systems for analysing spatial interrelations and making their own maps. Various studies mention the shortage of financial resources, human capacity, and adequate knowledge as reasons for that. In recent years publically available virtual globes like Google Earth (TM), Microsoft (R) Bing T Maps 3D or Nasa World Wind enjoy great popularity. The accessibility of worldwide high resolution satellite data, their intuitive user interface, and the ability to integrate own data support this success. In this chapter, the potential of these new geospatial technologies for supporting disaster preparedness and response is demonstrated, using the example of Google Earth T. Possibilities for the integration of data layers from third parties, the digitization of own layers, as well as the analytical capacities are examined. Furthermore, a printing module is presented, which supports the production of paper maps based on data previously collected and edited in Google Earth T. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a disaster management scenario in Legazpi, a Philippine city exposed to several natural hazards due to the vicinity to Mayon volcano and the annually occuring typhoons in the region. With this research, current technological trends in geospatial technologies are taken up and investigated on their potential for professional use. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by using freely available software general constraints for using GIS in developing countries can be overcome. Most importantly, the approach presented guarantees low cost for implementation and reproducibility, which is essential for its application in developing countries.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.4018/978-1-4666-2038-4.ch095","{""notes"": ""('zeug_disastermanagementvirtualglobes_2013',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 19:38:38,"included",NA,NA
7037579,"Management Of Humanitarian Relief Operations Using Satellite Big Data Analytics: The Case Of Kerala Floods","Disasters lead to breakdown of established Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. ICT breakdown obstructs the channel to gather real-time last mile information directly from the disaster-stricken communities and thereby hampers the agility of humanitarian supply chains. This creates a complex, chaotic, uncertain, and restrictive environment for humanitarian relief operations, which struggles for credible information to prioritize and deliver effective relief services. In this paper, we discuss how satellite big data analytics built over real-time weather information, geospatial data and deployed over a cloud-computing platform aided in achieving improved coordination and collaboration between rescue teams for humanitarian relief efforts in the case of 2018 Kerala floods. The analytics platform made available to the stakeholders involved in the rescue operations led to timely logistical planning and execution of rescue missions. The developed platform improved the accuracy of information between the distressed community and the stakeholders involved and thereby increased the agility of humanitarian logistics and relief supply chains. This research proves the utility of fusing data sources that are normally sitting as islands of information using big data analytics to prioritize humanitarian relief operations. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s10479-020-03593-w","{""notes"": ""('nagendra_managementhumanitarianreliefoperations_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 20:07:55,"included",NA,NA
6903586,"Modelling And Evaluation Of Land Use Changes Through Satellite Images In A Multifunctional Catchment: Social, Economic And Environmental Implications","Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. ""S-Upstream"", ""S-Downstream"" and ""S-Total"". Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11\%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3\% for S-Up; 8.6\% for S-Down and 13\% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101777","{""notes"": ""('acunaalonso_modellingevaluationlandsatellite_2022',)""}","{}",2024-09-26 00:50:29,"included",NA,NA
7037121,"The Utility Of Airborne Hyperspectral And Satellite Multispectral Images In Identifying Natura 2000 Non-Forest Habitats For Conservation Purposes","Aerial hyperspectral and multispectral satellite data are the two most commonly used datasets to identify natural and semi-natural vegetation. However, there is no documented analysis based on data from several areas concerning the difference in the classification accuracy of non-forest Natura 2000 habitat with the use of aerial hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data. Also, there is no recommendation, on which habitat can be classified with sufficient accuracy using free multispectral images. This study aimed to analyse the difference in classification accuracy of Natura 2000 habitats representing: meadows, grasslands, heaths and mires between data with different spectral resolutions and the results utility for nature conservation compared to conventional maps. The analysis was conducted in five study areas in Poland. The classification was performed on multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) and hyperspectral HySpex (HS) images using the Random Forest algorithm. Based on the results, it can be stated that the use of HS data resulted in higher classification accuracy, on average 0.14, than using S2 images, regardless of the area of the habitat. However, the difference in accuracy was not constant, varying by area and habitat characterisation. Greater differences in accuracy were observed for areas where habitats were characterised by high alpha-diversity or beta-diversity. The HS and S2 data make it possible to create maps that provide a great deal of new knowledge about the distribution of Natura 2000 habitats, which is necessary for the management of protected areas. The obtained results indicate that by using S2 images it is possible to identify, at a satisfactory level, alluvial meadows and grassland. For heaths and mires, using HS data improved the results, but it is also possible to acquire general distribution of these classes, whereas HS images are obligatory for mapping salt, Molinia and lowland hay meadows.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1038/s41598-023-31705-6","{""notes"": ""('jarocinska_utilityairbornehyperspectralsatellite_2023',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 02:21:21,"included",NA,NA
6691648,"CEOS contributions to informing energy management and policy decision making using space-based Earth observations","Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the ""space arm"" for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan. This paper describes a coordinated program of demonstration projects conducted by CEOS member agencies and partners to utilize Earth observations to enhance energy management end-user decision support systems. We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers. These projects show the utility of Earth observations to enhance renewable energy resource assessment in the developing world, forecast space weather impacts on the power grid, and improve energy efficiency in the built environment.",2012,"{""Eckman, Richard S.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.001","{}","{}",2024-04-22 02:30:27,"included",NA,NA
7036902,"Drone-Based Harvest Data Prediction Can Reduce On-Farm Food Loss And Improve Farmer Income","On-farm food loss (i.e., grade-out vegetables) is a difficult challenge in sustainable agricultural systems. The simplest method to reduce the number of grade-out vegetables is to monitor and predict the size of all individuals in the vegetable field and determine the optimal harvest date with the smallest grade-out number and highest profit, which is not cost-effective by conventional methods. Here, we developed a full pipeline to accurately estimate and predict every broccoli head size (n > 3,000) automatically and nondestructively using drone remote sensing and image analysis. The individual sizes were fed to the temperature-based growth model and predicted the optimal harvesting date. Two years of field experiments revealed that our pipeline successfully estimated and predicted the head size of all broccolis with high accuracy. We also found that a deviation of only 1 to 2 days from the optimal date can considerably increase grade-out and reduce farmer's profits. This is an unequivocal demonstration of the utility of these approaches to economic crop optimization and minimization of food losses.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.34133/plantphenomics.0086","{""notes"": ""('wang_dronebasedharvestdata_2023',)""}","{}",2024-12-18 18:32:36,"included",NA,NA
6659922,"Earth Observation Satellite Data In Support Of Water Management For Agriculture","The Earth Observation (EO) satellite data provided within the Copernicus Programme supports the monitoring and sustainable management of agriculture. For example, satellite data are useful for agriculture mapping, crop health monitoring, land planning, disease mitigation, crop yields estimation, precise agriculture, and sustainable irrigation water management. The identification of non-authorised water abstractions for irrigation is of high importance since the drought phenomenon is increasingly in the past decades due to climate change. This aspect is addressed by DIANA - ""Detection and Integrated Assessment of Non-authorised water Abstractions using EO"", a project funded by the European Commission in the frame of H2020 (European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation). The project will integrate data acquired by the Sentinel missions (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3) and as well Landsat and MODIS. Other types of data (meteorological, land use/land cover, digital elevation models, soil, etc.) will support the satellite data processing and the generation of value-added products. In addition, the project aims at significantly improve the monitoring and assessment of the water management policies and practices. As the project is in its initial phase, the results presented in this article are preliminary.

7038182,"Use Of Satellite Image Derived Products For Early Warning And Monitoring Of The Impact Of Drought On Food Security In Africa","African and other countries in theworld suffer from regular occurrence of extreme weather events of which droughts form a significant part. This is seriously affecting the ability of those countries to cover their population needs in food supply and to maintain their livelihood. However, the pattern of droughts is extremely variable both temporally and spatially and it is crucial that decision makers be informed in advance of the extent and location of potential drought conditions to target relief measures. Approaches to food security monitoring based on the temporal and spatial analyses of Satellite image derived products are presented. These approaches demonstrate that the extent and severity of a drought can effectively be characterised in near real time. Examples of previouswork in Zambia showed the benefit of integrating historical agricultural statistics with satellite derived products to better attribute vegetation development variability to agricultural production thus providing a means to predict potential crop production levels for the current growing season. Other work in Namibia, Niger, Senegal, South Sudan and Botswana shows that such techniques can be used to monitor rangeland primary production levels for a given season. Lessons from the implementation of these approaches operationally are summarized, emphasizing the importance of institutional support. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

6863498,"The Value Of Site-Specific Information And The Environment: Technology Adoption And Pesticide Use Under Uncertainty","Remote sensing technology offers an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of site-specific information about field characteristics such as pest populations. Coupled with variable rate application technologies, this added information has the potential to provide environmental benefits through reduced pesticide applications. However, producers face a complicated adoption decision because output prices and crop yields are uncertain. A model is developed to examine the potential value of remote sensing information to pesticide applications in an option-value framework under uncertainty. Simulations suggest that remote sensing information could decrease pesticide use, but uncertainty and irreversibility are likely to limit technological adoption by farmers.

6863048,"Where Have All The People Gone? Enhancing Global Conservation Using Night Lights And Social Media","Conservation prioritization at large scales is complex, combining biological, environmental, and social factors. While conservation scientists now more often aim to incorporate human-related factors, a critical yet unquantified challenge remains: to identify which areas people use for recreation outside urban centers. To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media ""big data"" and remote sensing tools. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between 2004 and 2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and seminatural areas attracting visitors were defined as areas both highly photographed and non-lit. The number of Flickr photographers within protected areas was found to be a reliable surrogate for estimating visitor numbers as confirmed by local authority censuses (r = 0.8). Half of all visitors' photos taken in protected areas originated from under 1\% of all protected areas on Earth (250 of 27 000). The most photographed protected areas globally included Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks (USA), and the Lake and Peak Districts (UK). Factors explaining the spatial variation in protected areas Flickr photo coverage included their type (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites have higher visitation) and accessibility to roads and trails. Using this approach, we identified photography hotspots, which draw many visitors and are also unlit (i.e., are located outside urban centers), but currently remain largely unprotected, such as Brazil's Pantanal and Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni. The integrated big data approach developed here demonstrates the benefits of combining remote sensing sources and novel geo-tagged and crowd-sourced information from social media in future efforts to identify spatial conservation gaps and pressures in real time, and their spatial and temporal variation globally.",2015,"{""Crandall, David"",""Kark, Salit"",""Levin, Noam""}","article",NA,"10.1890/15-0113.1.sm","{""notes"": ""('levin_peopleenhancingglobalconservation_2015',)""}","{}",2024-07-12 19:45:45,"included",NA,NA

The aim of the study was to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 to quantify soil conditions, which can improve the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics in organic agriculture in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan and improve productivity management of Linum usitatissimum. In the course of the research, the influence of individual factors of the general environmental impact, such as the influence of humidity, meteorological conditions, the content of individual nutrient components of the soil on the yield, was studied. The meteorological conditions in this region in 2021 and the data of agrochemical analysis of the soil on which the oilseed crop was grown were evaluated. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to determine the NDVI and GNDVI indices. A high content of nitrate nitrogen (12.3-16.2 mg/kg), a very low level of available phosphorus (3-10 mg/kg), and a high content of potassium (289-420 mg/kg) were found in the soil. A low content of humus (2.68-3.31%) and sulfur (1.1-4.9 mg/kg) was found. A study of the NDVI growth index showed that the highest value was reached by the period of July 20, 2021. After this period, a decrease in the vegetation index was observed. In conditions of severe drought, this change occurred earlier than under favorable conditions, and correlated with low flax yield (1.6-6.9 c/ha). This study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 for quantifying soil conditions, which not only improves our understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics and environmental components in organic agriculture in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan, but also improves the management of Linum usitatissimum productivity. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

7037711,"Mapping Of Environmental Sensitivity Index To Oil Spill From Landsat Tm Images: ""A Study Case On The Amazon Coastal Plain""","The environmental sensitivity index (ESI) is represented by a scale ranging from 1 to 10, where the intensity of the impact caused by the oil spill is specified and, the higher the value the higher the sensitivity index. Oil spills impact the environment and are not exclusive to certain regions of the world. Therefore, the production of maps representing the ESI has become important for the implementation of contingency and emergency plans. Curuçá city, located in northeastern Pará state, does not have a map of semi-detailed environmental sensitivity, for that reason, this study aimed to generate a tactical map, scale of 1:100,000, with recognition of coastal environments identified by digital processing of Landsat images and field surveys. The map will help identify the areas more prone to suffer from a possible oil spill. Thus, eight indices were classified as follows: ESI 1B retaining wall, ESI 1C cliffs, ESI 3A sandy beaches and exposed dunes, ESI 7 sandy tidal flat, ESI 9 ebb tide delta, ESI 10A salt marsh, ESI 10B freshwater marsh and ESI 10 mangrove. Finally, the ESI represented in these maps can support the decision making process to prevent and control accidents that may happen during oil production and transportation.

7036939,"A Real Options Approach To Satellite Mission Planning","Satellite missions are one instrument of Earth observation targeted at obtaining information for improved decision making in sustainable development. But satellite missions are expensive undertakings involving large sunk costs and facing uncertain benefit streams. In the area of avoiding damages through, for example, better weather forecasts or better-informed rescue missions, the benefits are high, but also difficult to quantify. Using real options to optimize the timing of the launch of a satellite enables us not only to optimize the timing of the mission, but also to derive the value that such information conveys when it can be used to reduce the extent of the damage from disasters and their consequences: with low benefit expectations or large uncertainty, launching will be postponed, so ex ante Earth observation benefit assessment is an important task.

7036801,"Data Integration For Climate Vulnerability Mapping In West Africa","Vulnerability mapping reveals areas that are likely to be at greater risk of climate-related disasters in the future. Through integration of climate, biophysical, and socioeconomic data in an overall vulnerability framework, so-called hotspots of vulnerability can be identified. These maps can be used as an aid to targeting adaptation and disaster risk management interventions. This paper reviews vulnerability mapping efforts in West Africa conducted under the USAID-funded African and Latin American Resilience to Climate Change (ARCC) project. The focus is on the integration of remotely sensed and socioeconomic data. Data inputs included a range of sensor data (e.g., MODIS NDVI, Landsat, SRTM elevation, DMSP-OLS night-time lights) as well as high-resolution poverty, conflict, and infrastructure data. Two basic methods were used, one in which each layer was transformed into standardized indicators in an additive approach, and another in which remote sensing data were used to contextualize the results of composite indicators. We assess the benefits and challenges of data integration, and the lessons learned from these mapping exercises.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/ijgi4042561","{""notes"": ""('desherbinin_dataintegrationclimatevulnerability_2015',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 21:14:19,"included",NA,NA
7036856,"Deriving Water Quality Parameters Using Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Case Study In The Sado Estuary, Portugal","Monitoring water quality parameters and their ecological effects in transitional waters is usually performed through in situ sampling programs. These are expensive and time-consuming, and often do not represent the total area of interest. Remote sensing techniques offer enormous advantages by providing cost-effective systematic observations of a large water system. This study evaluates the potential of water quality monitoring using Sentinel-2 observations for the period 2018-2020 for the Sado estuary (Portugal), through an algorithm intercomparison exercise and time-series analysis of different water quality parameters (i.e., colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and turbidity). Results suggest that Sentinel-2 is useful for monitoring these parameters in a highly dynamic system, however, with challenges in retrieving accurate data for some of the variables, such as Chl-a. Spatio-temporal variability results were consistent with historical data, presenting the highest values of CDOM, Chl-a, SPM and turbidity during Spring and Summer. This work is the first study providing annual and seasonal coverage with high spatial resolution (10 m) for the Sado estuary, being a key contribution for the definition of effective monitoring programs. Moreover, the potential of remote sensing methodologies for continuous water quality monitoring in transitional systems under the scope of the European Water Framework Directive is briefly discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

6863050,"Quantifying Pruning Impacts On Olive Tree Architecture And Annual Canopy Growth By Using Uav-Based 3d Modelling","Background: Tree pruning is a costly practice with important implications for crop harvest and nutrition, pest and disease control, soil protection and irrigation strategies. Investigations on tree pruning usually involve tedious onground measurements of the primary tree crown dimensions, which also might generate inconsistent results due to the irregular geometry of the trees. As an alternative to intensive field-work, this study shows a innovative procedure based on combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and advanced object-based image analysis (OBIA) methodology for multi-temporal three-dimensional (3D) monitoring of hundreds of olive trees that were pruned with three different strategies (traditional, adapted and mechanical pruning). The UAV images were collected before pruning, after pruning and a year after pruning, and the impacts of each pruning treatment on the projected canopy area, tree height and crown volume of every tree were quantified and analyzed over time. Results: The full procedure described here automatically identified every olive tree on the orchard and computed their primary 3D dimensions on the three study dates with high accuracy in the most cases. Adapted pruning was generally the most aggressive treatment in terms of the area and volume (the trees decreased by 38.95 and 42.05\% on average, respectively), followed by trees under traditional pruning (33.02 and 35.72\% on average, respectively). Regarding the tree heights, mechanical pruning produced a greater decrease (12.15\%), and these values were minimal for the other two treatments. The tree growth over one year was affected by the pruning severity and by the type of pruning treatment, i.e., the adapted-pruning trees experienced higher growth than the trees from the other two treatments when pruning intensity was low (< 10\%), similar to the traditionally pruned trees at moderate intensity (10-30\%), and lower than the other trees when the pruning intensity was higher than 30\% of the crown volume. Conclusions: Combining UAV-based images and an OBIA procedure allowed measuring tree dimensions and quantifying the impacts of three different pruning treatments on hundreds of trees with minimal field work. Tree foliage losses and annual canopy growth showed different trends as affected by the type and severity of the pruning treatments. Additionally, this technology offers valuable geo-spatial information for designing site-specific crop management strategies in the context of precision agriculture, with the consequent economic and environmental benefits.",2017,"{""Jimenez-Brenes, F.

Variability in climate has been linked to variability in fisheries, specifically salmon stocks of the Pacific Northwest. The ability to forecast El Niño events already exists and is likely to improve in coming years. An accurate prediction may have value because it allows for better management decisions. In this article, we develop a bioeconomic model of the coho salmon fishery and derive the value of information from improved El Niño forecasting ability. We find that a perfect El Niño forecast results in an annual welfare gain of approximately $1 million, while imperfect forecasts lead to smaller gains.

7037437,"Space-Based Earth Observations For Disaster Risk Management","As space-based Earth observations are delivering a growing amount and variety of data, the potential of this information to better support disaster risk management is coming into increased scrutiny. Disaster risk management actions are commonly divided into the different steps of the disaster management cycle, which include: prevention, to minimize future losses; preparedness and crisis management, often focused on saving lives; and post-crisis management aiming at re-establishing services supporting human activities. Based on a literature review and examples of studies in the area of coastal, hydro-meteorological and geohazards, this review examines how space-based Earth observations have addressed the needs for information in the area of disaster risk management so far. We show that efforts have essentially focused on hazard assessments or supporting crisis management, whereas a number of needs still remain partly fulfilled for vulnerability and exposure mapping, as well as adaptation planning. A promising way forward to maximize the impact of Earth observations includes multi-risk approaches, which mutualize the collection of time-evolving vulnerability and exposure data across different hazards. Opportunities exist as programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinels are now delivering Earth observations of an unprecedented quality, quantity and repetitiveness, as well as initiatives from the disaster risk science communities such as the development of observatories. We argue that, as a complement to this, more systematic efforts to (1) build capacity and (2) evaluate where space-based Earth observations can support disaster risk management would be useful to maximize its societal benefits.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s10712-020-09586-5","{""notes"": ""('lecozannet_spacebasedearthobservations_2020',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:26:31,"included",NA,NA
6862756,"Evaluation Of Earth Observation Systems For Estimating Environmental Determinants Of Microbial Contamination In Recreational Waters","Public health risks related to the microbial contamination of recreational waters are increased by global environmental change. Intensification of agriculture, urban sprawl, and climate change are some of the changes which can lead to favorable conditions for the emergence of waterborne diseases. Earth observation (EO) images have several advantages for the characterization and monitoring of environmental determinants that could be associated with the risk of microbial contamination of recreational waters in vast territories like Canada. There are a large number of EO systems characterized by different spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolutions. Also, they have different levels of accessibility. In this study, we compared several EO systems for the estimation of environmental determinants to assess their usefulness and their added value in monitoring programs of recreational waters. Satellite images from EO systems WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, SPOT-5/HRG, Landsat-5/TM, Envisat/MERIS, Terra/MODIS, NOAA/AVHRR, and Radarsat-2 were acquired in 2010 and 2011 in southern Quebec, Canada. A supervised classification of these images with a maximum likelihood algorithm was used to estimate five key environmental determinants (agricultural land, impervious surfaces, water, forest, and wetlands) within the area of influence of 78 beaches. Logistic regression models were developed to establish the relationship between fecal contamination of beaches and environmental determinants derived from satellite images. The power prediction of these models and criteria such as accuracy of classified images, the ability of the sensor to detect environmental determinants in the area of influence of beaches, the correlation between the estimated environmental determinants in the area of influence by the sensor with those estimated by very high spatial resolution reference sensors (WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1), and general criteria of accessibility (cost of the images, imaging swath, satellite revisit interval, hours of work, and expertise and material required to process the images) were used to evaluate the EO systems. The logistic regression model establishing the relationship between environmental determinants from Landsat-5/TM images and the level of fecal contamination of beaches is the one which performs best. These images are also those that best meet all of the evaluation criteria. This study showed that environmental determinants like agricultural lands and impervious surfaces present in the area of influence of beaches are those which contribute the most to the microbial contamination of beaches. Our study demonstrated the utility and the added value that EO images could bring to programs monitoring the microbial contamination of recreational waters. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",2015,"{""Brazeau, S."",""Essono, F.

Traditional techniques have been based on field inventories, through sampling with plots and human intervention in the acquisition of variables at tree and stand level. Current technology allows estimates to be made using sensors in autonomous vehicles and satellites. In Costa Rica, studies with Landsat and RapidEye satellite images have made it possible to generate updated maps on land cover and land use, including forest types.

7038332,"Ehabitat, A Multi-Purpose Web Processing Service For Ecological Modeling","The number of interoperable research infrastructures has increased significantly with the growing awareness of the efforts made by the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). One of the societal benefit areas that is benefiting most from GEOSS is biodiversity, given the costs of monitoring the environment and managing complex information, from space observations to species records including their genetic characteristics. But GEOSS goes beyond simple data sharing to encourage the publishing and combination of models, an approach which can ease the handling of complex multi-disciplinary questions. It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate these concepts by presenting eHabitat, a basic Web Processing Service (WPS) for computing the likelihood of finding ecosystems with equal properties to those specified by a user. Despite the availability of the agreed WPS standard for Web-based geospatial modeling, few practical implementations exist, making eHabitat a significant addition to the field. On the other hand, the wide uptake of Web access standards for geospatial data has led to a wealth of data sources within GEOSS which can be effectively combined using eHabitat. When chained with other services providing data on climate change, eHabitat can be used for ecological forecasting and becomes a useful tool for decision-makers assessing different strategies when selecting new areas to protect. eHabitat can use virtually any kind of thematic data that can be considered as useful when defining ecosystems and their future persistence under different climatic or development scenarios. The paper will present the architecture and illustrate the concepts through case studies which forecast the impact of climate change on protected areas or on the ecological niche of an African bird.

7036832,"Flood Hazard And Flood Risk Assessment Using A Time Series Of Satellite Images: A Case Study In Namibia","In this article, the use of time series of satellite imagery to flood hazard mapping and flood risk assessment is presented. Flooded areas are extracted from satellite images for the flood-prone territory, and a maximum flood extent image for each flood event is produced. These maps are further fused to determine relative frequency of inundation (RFI). The study shows that RFI values and relative water depth exhibit the same probabilistic distribution, which is confirmed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The produced RFI map can be used as a flood hazard map, especially in cases when flood modeling is complicated by lack of available data and high uncertainties. The derived RFI map is further used for flood risk assessment. Efficiency of the presented approach is demonstrated for the Katima Mulilo region (Namibia). A time series of Landsat-5/7 satellite images acquired from 1989 to 2012 is processed to derive RFI map using the presented approach. The following direct damage categories are considered in the study for flood risk assessment: dwelling units, roads, health facilities, and schools. The produced flood risk map shows that the risk is distributed uniformly all over the region. The cities and villages with the highest risk are identified. The proposed approach has minimum data requirements, and RFI maps can be generated rapidly to assist rescuers and decisionmakers in case of emergencies.

Built upon the continent's past experiences, challenges, and successes, AU-Agenda 2063 comprehensively describes the strategic path for Africa's future development in the next 50 years. Thus, the monitoring of its implementation in various African states is critical for ensuring sustainable development and track progress. However, the higher cost of collecting data for accurately and reliably monitoring the implementation of Agenda 2063 may hinder the progress towards achieving these goals. Satellite Earth observation provides ample data, and thus has provided opportunities for the development of novel products and services with the potential to support implementation, monitoring and reporting for AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. However, it has been limitedly exploited in Africa, as evidenced by lower research outputs and investments. This calls for increased capacity building in the use of available EO data and products for various users including decision makers to advance national, regional and continental priorities. The use of such data products is often hampered by the capability to understand the products and thus their value for addressing socio-economic challenges. This paper discusses the potential of Earth observation capacity building for supporting the implementation, monitoring of, and reporting towards achieving AU-Agenda 2063 development imperatives. Specifically, this paper identifies existing capacity building resources, including the role of open and free Earth observation data, open-source software, and product dissemination platforms that can be leveraged for supporting national development, service delivery and the achievement of AU-Agenda 2063 targets. Furthermore, the paper recognizes the importance of bilateral and multilateral partnerships in leveraging existing know-how, technology and other resources for advancing strategic goals of African emerging space agencies and promoting sustainable development, with examples from South African National Space Agency (SANSA). Then, the challenges and opportunities for capacity building and the wide adoption of EO in Africa are discussed in the context of AU-Agenda 2063. The paper thus concludes that EO capacity building is essential to address the skills and data gaps and increase the use of EO-based solutions for decision making in various sectors, critical for achieving AU-A2063.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/ijgi8070292","{""notes"": ""('kganyago_roleafricanemergingspace_2019',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:55:28,"included",NA,NA

A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves.

There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet.

Despite this potential, these datasets continue to be underused around the world. In this article, we combine a recently established global water resources reanalysis that was developed within the EartH2Observe research project, and in-situ data in the Magdalena Cauca Macrobasin in Colombia. Through rigorous hydrological modelling we evaluate the contribution of this new information to the derivation of water availability indices used to support water policy and management. Results confirm the complementarity of the reanalysis, with water management indices derived from the reanalysis data showing good comparison to values obtained using in-situ data only. Indeed, the estimation of simple indices such as an Aridity Index and a Water Regulation Index show to be a suitable method for assessing and comparing the different reanalysis datasets. We also explore the value of the reanalysis and earth observations datasets in the study of climate and land use change scenarios in the basin. While considering the associated uncertainties, results show that on average rainfall is projected to increase in the basin and thus available water resources. Deforestation will increase the water balance due to lower evapotranspiration. However, reduced fog deposition in deforested cloud forest areas will lead to a decrease in the water balance.

Advantages of these data include relative ease of interpretation and acquisition, affordability, high resolution (1-2 meters), and provision of a common reference for communication among those involved in rangeland management. Additionally, air photos are especially well suited for analysis of historical rangeland remediation treatments because acquisition of widespread aerial photographic coverage began during the 1930s. Several types of treatments can be easily identified and monitored over time, including contour terraces, brush water spreaders, rootplow seeding, water ponding dikes, shrub removal by grubbing, and grazing restrictions. The use of archived aerial photographs allows the opportunity to recreate the management history of rangeland, as well as to serve as a point of departure for involvement in more sophisticated satellite-based remote sensing systems. © 2003 National Association of Environmental Professionals.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1017/s1466046603031065","{""notes"": ""('rango_utilityhistoricalaerialphotographs_2003',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 17:37:17,"included",NA,NA
6863675,"Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland By Coupling Optical And Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote Sensing","Plastic Mulching (PM) is criticized for causing environmental problems in spite of the benefits to increase crop yield. Accurate map of Plastic-Mulched Farmland (PMF) is demanded to monitor the usage of plastic mulches and to mitigate its environmental damages. However, mapping PMF with remote sensing data over large scale is still technically challenging due to its variable spectral characteristic. This paper proposed a Random Forest (RF) workflow to map PMF by coupling multi-resource satellite observations, including high- and medium- resolution optical imageries and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries. Under the context of two typical PMF regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, China, we test the performance of the proposed method. Results indicated that coupling optical and SAR remote sensing data improved the mapping accuracy significantly. There were different strategies for optimal data coupling. Coupling of three data, which are the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) data, Landsat-8 data and Radarsat-2 data, generated the highest mapping accuracy. Besides, coupling the GF-1 data with SAR data produced better accuracy than coupling the Landsat-8 data with SAR data. Compared with the accuracies derived from the coupling of two data (such as coupling GF-1 data with Radarsat-2 data and coupling Landsat-8 data with Radarsat-2 data), coupling the three data improved the overall accuracies by 0.39 to 4.93%. Compared with the mapping accuracy produced from Radarsat-2 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling increased by 20.96 and 26.06%, respectively, in Jizhou and Guyuan. When compared with the mapping accuracy of GF-1 data alone, the overall accuracies generated from the optimum coupling improved by 4.77% both in Jizhou and Guyuan. In general, contribution of optical remote sensing data was greater than that of SAR data for mapping PMF. Whereas, the SAR data also made great contribution to improve the mapping accuracy of PMF. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,"{""Fei, L."",""Yuncai, H."",""Zhongxin, C.""}","jour",NA,"10.1080/01431161.2020.1763510","{""notes"": ""('zhongxin_mappingplasticmulchedfarmland_2020',)""}","{}",2024-07-12 19:40:52,"included",NA,NA

Such climatic information is provided by global climate models (GCMs). One of the key factors determining how biological systems respond to human-caused climate change is variation in temperature and precipitation volume and intensity. The implementation of remote sensing technologies is expanding and increasing in popularity, especially in the context of GCM. However, data are influenced by inaccuracies, even though they are frequently utilized, so correction is necessary. Recent studies show that satellite-based rainfall estimations are inaccurate and have lower values that need to be corrected [1]. In Sohar, Oman, ground station rainfall data were compared with satellite data from several sources, including Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4) and GSMaP_NRT, to assess the correctness of the data. During the evaluation of precipitation, temperatures, and observed and anticipated climatic trends, all sources overestimated the data, particularly rainfall in the summer months. The CCSM4 and GSMaP_NRT data differed from ground station data. Nevertheless, it is possible to improve the data to make sufficiently accurate estimates. When compared to monitoring with a single ground station, using this satellite data will yield significant advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, geographic distribution and coverage, timely issuance, and accuracy with additional or improved inputs. © 2023 by authors, all rights reserved.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.13189/eer.2023.110411","{""notes"": ""('afandy_trendsprojectionsanalysisprecipitation_2023',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:04:03,"included",NA,NA

Uncertainty of wetland responses to sea-level rise is a pervasive concern in coastal science and management. Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and multi-sensor and object-oriented image analysis techniques are poised to aid the inventorying, monitoring and management of wetlands to an even greater extent. This chapter reviews developments and coastal wetland applications of these state of the art remote sensing data and techniques and evaluates the utility of these products for management of coastal reserves in case studies.

However, few studies have examined how PFTs are adopted and used at the farm level. In this study a preliminary investigation was made of on-farm PFT uses in the Oise region (northern France). Three main PFTs were identified in the area: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) guidance, section control, and variable rate (VR) application. For each farm, the use of every PFT was defined by the technical characteristics of the equipment, the field operation(s) concerned, the targeted crop(s), the aim of the use, the PFT adoption drivers, and the perceived impacts by the farmers. These different variables were combined into a typology of PFT uses. The results show that most of the farms combined GNSS guidance for all technical operations and section control, whereas VR application was less common. Section control was largely used by farmers for liquid fertilizers and phytochemical spraying. The typology shows three to five types of use for each PFT, which differ in terms of technique adoption drivers, e.g. reducing on-farm work or adaptation to field morphology. According to literature, economic impacts were found to be the most frequent, however farmers seemed unable to quantify them. Social impacts such as reduced work time and fatigue were also frequent and are becoming the main motivation for using PFT on farms studied. Further research is needed to assess the use trajectories of PFT along with the motivations of each PFT use.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s11119-019-09660-y","{""notes"": ""('ayerdigotor_precisionfarmingtypologyarable_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-25 16:51:41,"included",NA,NA
6903569,"A Data-Driven Approach To Hurricane Debris Modeling","The large amount of debris generated in the aftermath of hurricane and storm events can cause severe financial and logistical burdens to coastal communities. Existing debris estimation models mainly focus on wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50\%, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that can account for other types of debris while improving accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic framework to estimate the presence and amount of waterborne debris following a severe storm using machine learning (ML) techniques as a function of relevant storm and landcover parameters. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models, employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris removal database for Hurricane Ike, respectively. The results show that the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a misclassification error of 5.56\% for the debris presence predictive model, and a normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 11.98 for the debris volume model, the lowest RMSE of the tested algorithms. Dual-layer ML models are also investigated, incorporating the debris presence as a predictor in the debris volume model. The results show a percent error of 11.29\% for the dual-layer model and an approximately 5.4\% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not incorporate debris presence. The generated debris volume and presence models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource allocation following a storm event.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1061/jwped5.wweng-1945","{""notes"": ""('gonzalezduenas_datadrivenapproachhurricane_2023',)""}","{""probably not""}",2024-10-01 17:55:48,"included",NA,NA

The project will concentrate on five selected catchments in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The focus of the project will be to define the geological characteristics, to measure three-dimensional variability in conductivity in the regolith system, and to determine the spatial variability in soil characteristics. The analysis will allow the derivation of products such as maps showing salinity hazard, water resource target, soils, regolith conductivity and thickness, and geological interpretation. These derived products will be integrated with other datasets to specifically assist with the development of land management plans at appropriate scales and to contribute to the understanding of hydrogeological processes.

7036792,"Mapping Spatial Pattern In Biodiversity For Regional Conservation Planning: Where To From Here?","Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations, distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping, derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/10635150252899806","{""notes"": ""('ferrier_mappingspatialpatternbiodiversity_2002',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 22:59:27,"included",NA,NA

6903510,"A New Method For Long-Term River Discharge Estimation Of Small- And Medium-Scale Rivers By Using Multisource Remote Sensing And Rshs: Application And Validation","River discharge is an important hydrological parameter of river water resources. Especially in small- and medium-scale rivers, data deficiency is the biggest problem for studies of river discharge. In recent years, remote sensing has become a rapid and convenient method to estimate river discharge. However, remote sensing images still have some difficulty generating continuous long-term river discharge. To address this problem, we developed a new method coupling the remote sensing hydrology station method (RSHS) with statistical regression downscaling, using data from optical satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), radar satellites (Sentinel-1), and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We applied this method to monitor monthly river discharge for small- and medium-scale rivers from 2016 to 2020 on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and evaluated the accuracy of the results. The results show that (1) by applying the newly constructed method, the water body continuity index obtained by Landsat-8 increased by 7\% and the average river length percentage in the channel reached 90.7\%, a 40\% increase; (2) there were only 10 river flow data points, on average, in the 5-year period obtained before this method was applied; after this method was applied, more than 50 river flow data points could be obtained, on average, extending the quantity of data fivefold; in addition, improper extreme values could also be avoided; (3) with better continuity of water body distribution, the images provided steadier river widths. The relative error of daily flow estimation from Landsat-8 images was reduced by 60\% and the mean percentage error was reduced by one-fourth. The relative error of the multisource remote sensing composited flow was reduced by 37\% with a reduction in the mean percentage error of over a half; (4) in addition, we found that when the threshold difference between water bodies and land in remote sensing images is more than 0.2, the impact of water body recognition error on flow accuracy can be ignored. This method helps to overcome the absence of remote sensing methods for the long-term estimation of flow series in small- and medium-scale rivers, improves the accuracy of remote sensing methods for calculating flow, and provides ideas for regional water resource management and utilization.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs14081798","{""notes"": ""('lou_methodtermriverdischarge_2022',)""}","{""probably not"",maybe}",2024-09-26 00:41:42,"included",NA,NA

In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWX’s core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described. Then, a comprehensive overview of the Viewer, which is a web-based interface used to access EOs, is provided. This includes a description of (i) the maps and associated features to access gridded EO data and anomalies for different temporal averaging periods, (ii) time series graphs and associated features to access EOs aggregated over polygons such as administrative boundaries, and (iii) commonly used EOs served by the EWX that provide assessments of climate and vegetation conditions. Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted. Regional implementation of the EWX facilitates access to regionally focused EOs and their availability at polygon boundaries most relevant to the local decision-makers.

However, despite available suite of indicators, sustainable practices are constrained by unreliable yet conflicting information attributed to model abstraction, scale mismatch and non replicability. Besides, stale scientific evidence precludes its relevance to management or policy. It remains a non-trivial task to determine a universal soil quality metric applicable in diverse ecosystems because of the difficulty in modeling soil multifunctionality and complexity across scale and time. The advent of digital technology which incorporate high performance computing systems with cellular communication devices, coupled with agile earth observation systems, creates new prospects for monitoring, demistifying and unravelling the specific drivers of soil quality dynamics. It is increasingly feasible to integrate multiple (i.e., qualitative and quantitative) datasets to inform site specific application of inputs thereby reducing costs, and simultaneously communicating scientific knowledge in real-time to stakeholders.

6863602,"Satellite-Based Crop Production Monitoring In Ukraine And Regional Food Security","Every year weather vagaries have caused shortfalls of agricultural production regionally and every 3-4 years these shortfalls occurred globally. Therefore, early assessment of crop losses in response to weather fluctuations is an important task for the estimation of global, regional and countries food supply/demand, donor's decision to assists the nations in need and to those receiving the assistance. The new satellite-based technology has been recently developed to provide timely and accurate crops' monitoring and assessments. This technology includes the theory, algorithm, data base and operational implementation of vegetation health (VH) assessments from observations provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on NOAA operational polar-orbiting satellites. Several AVHRR-based VH indices were developed and used to provide weekly cumulative estimation of moisture, thermal and health conditions of vegetation canopy throughout the growing season. The indices were calculated for the entire 1981-2010 period of the AVHRR sensor in space and were compared with regional crop yields in the two dozens of countries. Strong correlation between wheat (both winter and spring), corn, soybeans and sorghum yield and VH indices was found during the critical period of the tested crops. The test results showed that VH indices can be used as proxy for early (2-5 months in advance of harvest) assessment of crop yield with the errors of estimation less than 10%. This paper discusses utility of space observations for early forecasting regional crop yield in Ukraine, with specific emphasis on 2-5 months warning of weather-related losses in agricultural production and their impact on agricultural supply/demand and food security. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",2011,"{""Adamenko, T."",""Kogan, F."",""Kulbida, M.""}","jour",NA,"10.1007/978-90-481-9618-0_11","{""notes"": ""('kogan_satellitebasedcropproduction_2011',)""}","{}",2024-09-27 23:04:48,"included",NA,NA
7037087,"The Role Of Satellite Telemetry Data In 21St Century Conservation Of Polar Bears (Ursus Maritimus)","Satellite telemetry (ST) has played a critical role in the management and conservation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) over the last 50 years. ST data provide biological information relevant to subpopulation delineation, movements, habitat use, maternal denning, health, human-bear interactions, and accurate estimates of vital rates and abundance. Given that polar bears are distributed at low densities over vast and remote habitats, much of the information provided by ST data cannot be collected by other means. Obtaining ST data for polar bears requires chemical immobilization and application of a tracking device. Although immobilization has not been found to have negative effects beyond a several-day reduction in activity, over the last few decades opposition to immobilization and deployment of satellite-linked radio collars has resulted in a lack of current ST data in many of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations. Here, we review the uses of ST data for polar bears and evaluate its role in addressing 21(st) century conservation and management challenges, which include estimation of sustainable harvest rates, understanding the impacts of climate warming, delineating critical habitat, and assessing potential anthropogenic impacts from tourism, resource development and extraction. We found that in subpopulations where ST data have been consistently collected, information was available to estimate vital rates and subpopulation density, document the effects of sea-ice loss, and inform management related to subsistence harvest and regulatory requirements. In contrast, a lack of ST data in some subpopulations resulted in increased bias and uncertainty in ecological and demographic parameters, which has a range of negative consequences. As sea-ice loss due to climate warming continues, there is a greater need to monitor polar bear distribution, habitat use, abundance, and subpopulation connectivity. We conclude that continued collection of ST data will be critically important for polar bear management and conservation in the 21(st) century and that the benefits of immobilizing small numbers of individual polar bears in order to deploy ST devices significantly outweigh the risks.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2022.816666","{""notes"": ""('laidre_rolesatellitetelemetrydata_2022',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 18:15:48,"included",NA,NA
7038206,"Embedding Smart Technologies In Accounting To Meet Global Irrigation Challenges","Purpose - Agriculture is under pressure to produce more food under increasingly variable climate conditions. Consequently, producers need management innovations that lead to improved physical and financial productivity. Currently, farm accounting technologies lack the sophistication to allow producers to analyse productivity of water. Furthermore water-related agricultural technology (""agtech"") systems do not readily link to accounting innovations. This study aims to establish a conceptual and practical framework for linking temporal, biophysical and management decision-making to accounting by develop a soil moisture and climate monitoring tool. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts an exploratory mixed-methods approach to understand supply of and demand for water accounting and water-related agtech; and bundling these innovations with farm accounting to generate a stable tool with the ability to improve agricultural practices over time. Three phases of data collection are the focus here: first, a desk-based review of water accounting and water technology - including benchmarking of key design characteristics of these methods and key actor interviews to verify and identify trends, allowing for conceptual model development; second, a producer survey to test demand for the ""bundled"" conceptual model; third and finally, a participant-based case study in potato-farming that links the data from direct monitoring and remote sensing to farm accounts. Findings - Design characteristics of water accounting and agtech innovations are bundled into an overall irrigation decision-making conceptual model based on in-depth review of available innovations and verification by key actors. Producer surveys suggest enough demand to pursue practical bundling of these innovations undertaken by developing an integrated accounting, soil moisture and climate monitoring tool on-farm. Productivity trends over two seasons of case study data demonstrate the pivotal role of accounting in leading to better technical irrigation decisions and improving water productivity. Originality/value - The model can assist practitioners to gauge strengths and weaknesses of contemporary water accounting fads and fashions and potential for innovation bundling for improved water productivity. The practical tool demonstrates how on-farm irrigation decision-making can be supported by linking farm accounting systems and smart technology",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1108/medar-03-2020-0835","{""notes"": ""('tingeyholyoak_embeddingsmarttechnologiesaccounting_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-11 19:20:18,"included",NA,NA
7038285,"Initial Assessment Of Burn Severity Using Transfer Learning Model","[Objective] Forest fires have broken out frequently in recent years, which severely damages the structure and function of forest ecosystem around the world. Initial assessment of burn severity after forest fires could provide a quantitative basis for rapid implementations of restoration measures in burned areas. In last decades, remote sensing-based models have become an appropriate choice to assess burn severity, which generally requires a certain amount of field survey data. However, this requirement could not be satisfied sufficiently in most cases, since the field survey work would cost a lot of time, labor, and money. Therefore, this would largely limit the efficient application of remote sensing technology to the initial assessment of burn severity. To improve the time-efficiency of traditional remote sensing-based models, a transfer learning algorithm (i.e., SSTCA, semi-supervised Transfer Component Analysis) was employed in this study to build an initial assessment model of burn severity. [Method] At first, the SSTCA algorithm was applied to project a series of new features from original spectral features of remotely sensed data. Based on these projected features, a SVR (Support Vector Regression) model was then trained using historical field survey data of source areas (i.e., Bear fire on June 27, 2002 and Mule fire on July 11, 2002). After that, this combined SSTCA-SVR model was transferred to the initial assessment of burn severity of a target area (i.e., Lushan fire on March 30, 2020). Finally, its performance was quantitatively compared with that of some traditional models (i.e., dNDVI-, dLST-, dNBR-, and SVR-based models). [Results] Results showed that original spectral features of remote sensing images over source and target areas were quite different. After the projection of SSTCA, projected features of source and target samples have similar distribution patterns in the new features-based space. Meanwhile, in the initial assessment of burn severity, dNDVI- and dNBR-based models have overestimated burn severity levels with the lowest accuracy (i.e., overall accuracy was from 20.80% to 24.80% and Kappa value was between 0.01 and 0.06). Compared to these spectral indices-based models, dLST-based model has a better performance with an overall accuracy of 34.80% and a Kappa value of 0.19. Although SVR-based model has shown a promising performance with an overall accuracy of 58.00% and a Kappa value of 0.48, this machine learning model still has overestimated burn severity in some regions of burned areas. Compared to that of mentioned-above models, assessment results of burn severity levels using the SSTCA-SVR model was more accurate with an overall accuracy of 71.20% and a Kappa value of 0.64. [Conclusion] It could be concluded that the application of a transferring learning algorithm would be very helpful for building an assessment model of burn severity with a good transferring ability. In this way, more accurate results could be obtained in the initial assessment of burn severity and the response of post-fire management could thus be speeded up after forest fires. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

6863640,"A Hybrid Kernel-Based Change Detection Method For Remotely Sensed Data In A Similarity Space","Detection of damages caused by natural disasters is a delicate and difficult task due to the time constraints imposed by emergency situations. Therefore, an automatic Change Detection (CD) algorithm, with less user interaction, is always very interesting and helpful. So far, there is no existing CD approach that is optimal and applicable in the case of (a) labeled samples not existing in the study area; (b) multi-temporal images being corrupted by either noise or non-normalized radiometric differences; (c) difference images having overlapped change and no-change classes that are non-linearly separable from each other. Also, a low degree of automation is not optimal for real-time CD applications and also one-dimensional representations of classical CD methods hide the useful information in multi-temporal images. In order to resolve these problems, two automatic kernel-based CD algorithms (KCD) were proposed based on kernel clustering and support vector data description (SVDD) algorithms in high dimensional Hilbert space. In this paper (a) a new similarity space was proposed in order to increase the separation between change and no-change classes, and also to decrease the processing time, (b) three kernel-based approaches were proposed for transferring the multi-temporal images from spectral space into high dimensional Hilbert space, (c) automatic approach was proposed to extract the precise labeled samples; (d) kernel parameter w a s selected automatically by optimizing an improved cost function and (e) initial value of the kernel parameter was estimated by a statistical method based on the L2-norm distance. Two different datasets including Quickbird and Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were used for the accuracy of analysis of proposed methods. The comparative analysis showed the accuracy improvements of kernel clustering based CD and SVDD based CD methods with respect to the conventional CD techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction, Independent Component Analysis, Spectral Angle Mapper, Simple Image differencing and Image Rationing, and also the computational cost analysis showed that implementation of the proposed CD method in similarity space decreases the processing runtime. © 2015 by the authors.",2015,"{""Homayouni, S."",""Safari, A."",""Shah-Hosseini, R.""}","jour",NA,"10.3390/rs71012829","{""notes"": ""('shahhosseini_hybridkernelbasedchange_2015',)""}","{maybe}",2024-09-30 21:32:09,"included",NA,NA
7037348,"Contribution Of Remote Sensing For Crop And Water Monitoring","Agriculture brings with it a number of issues: agricultural production and food security, water and soil resource conservation, limiting the impact of farming on the quality of our environment (water, air, soil). In the context of global changes and the challenges they pose for agriculture sustainability, our ability to characterize how croplands function in terms of water, carbon and particle fluxes is crucial. Developments of agro-ecosystems modeling, including their interactions with the atmosphere and the anthropogenic factors are valuable tools for progress in this direction. Remote sensing, with the high variety of spectral ranges and the fine spatial and temporal resolution currently available, is a tool of great value for various applications in agriculture. The availability of robust inverse methods that allow surface biophysical variables to be assessed, combined with modeling approaches, makes it a high performance tool. The major contributions of remote sensing include:. -its ability to cover large stretches of land and to provide information on the various land uses and practices generated by agriculture. These uses and practices are important to know, both for census purposes (agricultural statistics, agri-environmental monitoring, etc.) and for modeling the behavior of agro-hydrosystems;-providing frequent variables characterizing soil and vegetation properties that allows us to monitor the status of crops, their production potential, their irrigation requirements. This monitoring is a highly strategic issue, both for forecasting purposes, food security and good resource management;-the possibility, from the same information, of assessing the contribution of agricultural lands to net emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs); this assessment is essential for proposing alternative agricultural scenarios for mitigating the contribution of croplands to climate change-thanks to the fine spatial and temporal resolution of information, the possibility of providing a decision support for farming activities according to the intra-field variability (precision farming).

6863116,"Avhrr Data For Real-Time Operational Flood Forecasting In Malaysia","Flash floods strike quickly and in most cases without warning. They are usually observed before any warning can be issued and usually persons and property have been affected before the warning reaches them. Such are the conditions prevalent in Malaysia's extreme monsoon weather that occasionally causes floods and results in the extensive damage to property and sometimes loss of lives. Over the years variously hydrological and structural engineering measures have been implemented for flood monitoring and forecasting. These measures have only yielded limited success as may be seen in the recurring flood situation. Yearly financial and property loss estimates have increased and an estimated cost of over 2.5 billion RM is projected for the year 2004 according to sources from the drainage and irrigation department of Malaysia. It has thus become apparent that Malaysia institutes an effective operational flood forecasting to arrest the persisting flood problem. In this paper we will expound on current flood management and forecasting system being implemented in the country, particularly the Klang Valley that includes Kuala Lumpur where there has been tremendous urban growth and development in the last one and half decades. The paper further discusses where current flood management systems have been lacking in the absence of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts. Where as hydrodynamic simulations and structural control measures have been emphasized in many flood management systems in Malaysia, the integration of real-time hydro-meteorological forecasts have been conspicuously absent, rendering most in-situ flood forecasts and early warnings ineffective in address the flood problem in the country. Malaysia is a tropical country that lies along the path of the northeast and southwest monsoon. Although satellite image based NWP have proved useful for the tropical and equatorial regions of the world in flood forecasting, they have yet to be applied in Malaysia. Observations have generally shown heavy cumulonimbus clouds formation and thunderstorms precede the usual heavy monsoon rains that cause floods in the region. This makes quantitative precipitation forecast a must be input to any flood early warning design. Numerous empirical studies have determined that cloud top temperatures less that 235k in the tropics are generally expected to produce convective rainfall at the rate of 3mm/hr. In this study we thus investigate monsoon cloud formation that has the propensity to precipitate using NOAA-AVHRR data for real-time operational flood early warning in Malaysia. The AVHRR data has been preferred for its relatively high temporal resolution of at most 6/hours, its easy acquisition and cost effectiveness and its ability for automated geometric rectification when compared to GEOS and GMS data. Cloud cover and types are processed using cloud indexing and pattern recognition techniques on the AVHRR data. The cloud indexing technique was initially developed for NOAA but was later also adapted for Geostationary satellite images. The technique assigns rainfall levels to each cloud type identifies in an image based on the relationship between cold and bright clouds top temperature and the high probability of precipitation. We discuss how visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) techniques are applied to bi-spectral cloud classification and rain areas are determined by classifying pixel clusters in the VIS/IR histogram. Precipitation probability is evaluated based on the relationship between cold and brightness temperature of clouds. The near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) channels 3, 4, and 5 of the data are processed for temperature and brightness. Cold clouds with temperature below 235k threshold value are taken as indication of rain. Rainfall is estimated based on the assumption that every cloud pixel has a constant unit rain-rate of 3mmh-1, which is appropriate for tropical precipitation over 2.5° × 2.5° areas around the equator. The paper finally discusses current developments in nowcasting that utilizes latest satellite observatio s together with numerical weather prediction models and how this system can be adapted to the needs of very short term forecast for flood early warnings in Malaysia. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2005,"{""Billa, L."",""Ghazali, A.

7038174,"Remote Sensing For Irrigation Water Management In The Semi-Arid Northeast Of Brazil","Northeast of Brazil is a semi-arid region, where water is a key strategic resource in the development of all sectors of the economy. Irrigation agriculture is the main water consumer in this region. Therefore, policy directives are calling for tools to aid operational monitoring in planning, control and charging of irrigation water. Using Landsat imagery, this study evaluates the utility of a process that measures the level of water use in an irrigated area of the state of Ceara. The experiment, which models evapotranspiration (ET), was carried out within the Jaguaribe-Apodi irrigation scheme (DIJA) during two months of the agricultural season. The ET was estimated with the model Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution and with Internalized Calibration (METRIC). The model uses the residual of the energy balance equation to estimate ET for each pixel in the image. The results of the estimates were validated using measurements of ET from a micrometeorological tower installed within a banana plantation located near the irrigation scheme. After evaluating the ET estimates, the average fraction of depleted water for a set of agricultural parcels combined with the monthly ET mapping estimates by METRIC provided a method for predicting the total water use in DIJA for the study period. The results were then compared against the monthly accumulated flow rates for all the pumping stations provided by the district manager. Finally, this work discusses the potential use of the model as an alternative method to calculate water consumption in irrigated agriculture and the implications for water resource management in irrigated perimeters.

7037598,"Incorporation Of Satellite Remote Sensing Pan-Sharpened Imagery Into Digital Soil Prediction And Mapping Models To Characterize Soil Property Variability In Small Agricultural Fields","Soil prediction models based on spectral indices from some multispectral images are too coarse to characterize spatial pattern of soil properties in small and heterogeneous agricultural lands. Image pan-sharpening has seldom been utilized in Digital Soil Mapping research before. This research aimed to analyze the effects of pan-sharpened (PAN) remote sensing spectral indices on soil prediction models in smallholder farm settings. This research fused the panchromatic band and multispectral (MS) bands of WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Landsat 8 images in a village in Southern India by Brovey, Gram-Schmidt and Intensity-Hue-Saturation methods. Random Forest was utilized to develop soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil exchangeable potassium (Kex) prediction models by incorporating multiple spectral indices from the PAN and MS images. Overall, our results showed that PAN remote sensing spectral indices have similar spectral characteristics with soil TN and Kex as MS remote sensing spectral indices. There is no soil prediction model incorporating the specific type of pan-sharpened spectral indices always had the strongest prediction capability of soil TN and Kex. The incorporation of pan-sharpened remote sensing spectral data not only increased the spatial resolution of the soil prediction maps, but also enhanced the prediction accuracy of soil prediction models. Small farms with limited footprint, fragmented ownership and diverse crop cycle should benefit greatly from the pan-sharpened high spatial resolution imagery for soil property mapping. Our results show that multiple high and medium resolution images can be used to map soil properties suggesting the possibility of an improvement in the maps’ update frequency. Additionally, the results should benefit the large agricultural community through the reduction of routine soil sampling cost and improved prediction accuracy. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

One of the techniques that permeate sugarcane crops in large areas and can contribute to higher productivity and production quality is irrigation. Therefore, it is essential to know the different irrigation management that can be applied in extensive areas aimed at the efficient use of water and considering the water status and plant development. In this sense, remote sensing brought benefits for sugarcane cultivation with studies of biomass estimation, plant growth and vigor, but few studies have shown results on monitoring the water status of the plant aiming at irrigation management possibilities considering the water deficit of plants. In this context, this study evaluated alternatives for monitoring the water status of sugarcane with the use of thermographic and multispectral cameras embedded in an unmanned aerial vehicle. The evaluations allowed recording differences between irrigated treatments compared to treatments without irrigation in the two cameras used. Thermographic images can evaluate the water status of sugarcane plants quickly, nondestructively and efficiently. © 2020, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

We characterize the global high-seas fishing fleet and report the economic benefits of fishing the high seas globally, nationally, and at the scale of individual fleets. Our results suggest that fishing at the current scale is enabled by large government subsidies, without which as much as 54\% of the present high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable at current fishing rates. The patterns of fishing profitability vary widely between countries, types of fishing, and distance to port.

This was made possible by current advancement of consumer drone and availability of open-source UAVS technology for custom-made UAVS. The role of UAVS technology is seen as bridging the gap between field data collection and airborne and spaceborne remote sensing. UAVS offers great details of geospatial data at very high resolution with flexibility of deployment and cloud-free aerial photos.

The benefits of UAVS applications in forestry and plantation operations greatly improve efficiency through fast and timely geospatial data acquisition for various operational applications. In order to utilise UAVS technology, the forest and plantation owners' choices are either hiring third-party specialist or purchasing UAVS hardware and software with necessary training for own staff.

6863135,"A Maritime Emission Control Area For The Mediterranean Sea? Technological Solutions And Policy Options For A 'Med Eca'","Proposals to create a maritime Emission Control Area for the Mediterranean ('Med ECA') are on the agendas of national governments, local governments, port authorities, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations. Previous studies have contributed much data and analysis about maritime emissions and their impacts in the Mediterranean region. The present paper reviews the results of these studies and evidence from existing ECAs in other regions in order to inform analyses of issues regarding the design and implementation of a Med ECA. There are diverse issues and options concerning technologies and policies that need to be addressed. The potential for applying remote sensing technology and digital ledger technology to compliance verification and enforcement processes is assessed. The following international institutions are especially appropriate for addressing these issues and facilitating the development of a Med ECA: the International Maritime Organization and its affiliated body the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition at the UN Environment Programme, the World Bank, and the UN Conference on Trade and Development, which prepares an annual review of maritime transport that includes information about recent policy and technology developments. The paper concludes that the public health, food production, climate change and economic benefits of a Med ECA would be significant for the more than 200 million people living in Mediterranean coastal areas.",2020,"{""Brewer, Thomas""}","article",NA,"10.1007/s41207-020-00155-1","{""notes"": ""('brewer_maritimeemissioncontrolmediterranean_2020',)""}","{duplicate?}",2024-12-19 23:27:22,"included",NA,NA
7038682,"Wireless Sensor Networks To Study, Monitor And Manage Cattle In Grazing Systems","Monitoring and management of grazing livestock production systems can be enhanced with remote monitoring technologies collecting information with high temporal and spatial detail. However, the potential benefits of such technologies have yet to be realised and challenges still exist with hardware, and data analysis and interpretation. The objective of this paper was to propose analytical methods and demonstrate the value of remotely collected liveweight (LW) and behaviour of beef cattle grazing tropical pastures. Three remote weighing systems were set up at the water troughs to capture LW of three groups of 20 animals for 341 days. LW data reflected short-term effects following the first rain event (>50 mm) at the end of the dry season, which resulted in LW losses of 22 +/- 8.8 kg of LW at a rate of -1.54 +/- 0.46 kg/day (n = 60). This period was followed by a peak daily LW change (LWC) of +2 kg/day. The remote weighing system also captured longer environmental effects related to seasonal changes in forage quality and quantity with highest LWC during the wet season and weight loss during the dry season. Effects of management on LW and LWC were observed as a result of moving animals to paddocks with more edible forage during the dry season when the negative trend in LWC was reversed after rotating animals. Behavioural monitoring indicated that resting and ruminating took place at camping sites, and foraging resulted in grazing hotspots. Remotely collected LW data captured both short-and long-term temporal changes associated with environmental and management factors, whereas remote monitoring collars captured the spatial distribution of behaviours in the landscape. Wireless sensor networks have the ability to provide data with sufficient detail in real-time making it possible for increased understanding of animal biology and early management interventions that should result in increased production, animal welfare and environmental stewardship.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1071/an14368","{""notes"": ""('gonzalez_wirelesssensornetworksstudy_2014',)""}","{""wireless weighing""}",2024-11-21 02:24:08,"included",NA,NA
7038696,"A Daily 25km Short-Latency Rainfall Product For Data-Scarce Regions Based On The Integration Of The Global Precipitation Measurement Mission Rainfall And Multiple-Satellite Soil Moisture Products","Rain gauges are unevenly spaced around the world with extremely low gauge density over developing countries. For instance, in some regions in Africa the gauge density is often less than one station per 10 000 km(2). The availability of rainfall data provided by gauges is also not always guaranteed in near real time or with a timeliness suited for agricultural and water resource management applications, as gauges are also subject to malfunctions and regulations imposed by national authorities. A potential alternative is satellite-based rainfall estimates, yet comparisons with in situ data suggest they are often not optimal. In this study, we developed a short-latency (i.e. 2-3 d) rainfall product derived from the combination of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) Early Run (IMERG-ER) with multiplesatellite soil-moisture-based rainfall products derived from ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer), SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) L3 (Level 3) satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals. We tested the performance of this product over four regions characterized by high-quality ground-based rainfall datasets (India, the conterminous United States, Australia and Europe) and over data-scarce regions in Africa and South America by using triple-collocation (TC) analysis. We found that the integration of satellite SM observations with in situ rainfall observations is very beneficial with improvements of IMERG-ER up to 20\% and 40\% in terms of correlation and error, respectively, and a generalized enhancement in terms of categorical scores with the integrated product often outperforming reanalysis and ground-based long-latency datasets. We also found a relevant overestimation of the rainfall variability of GPM-based products (up to twice the reference value), which was significantly reduced after the integration with satellite soil-moisture-based rainfall estimates. Given the importance of a reliable and readily available rainfall product for water resource management and agricultural applications over data-scarce regions, the developed product can provide a valuable and unique source of rainfall information for these regions.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.5194/hess-24-2687-2020","{""notes"": ""('massari_daily25kmshortlatency_2020',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:59:48,"included",NA,NA

Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of theSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction.

A vital aspect of an EIA process is consideration of the accumulation of impacts from multiple activities and stressors through a cumulative effects assessment (CEA). An opportunity exists to improve the rigor and utility of CEA and EIA by incorporating core scientific principles of landscape ecology into EIA. With examples from a Canadian context, we explore realistic hypothetical situations demonstrating how integration of core scientific principles could impact EIA outcomes. First, we demonstrate how changing the spatial extent of EIA boundaries can misrepresent cumulative impacts via the exclusion or inclusion of surrounding natural resource development projects. Second, we use network analysis to show how even a seemingly small, localized development project can disrupt regional habitat connectivity. Lastly, we explore the benefits of using long-term historical remote sensing products.

In Nordic commercial forest inventories, SI is commonly estimated by a combination of aerial image interpretation, field assessment and information obtained from previous inventories. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data can alternatively be used for SI estimation, however the economic utilities of the inventory methods have not been compared. We compared seven methods of SI estimation in a cost-plus-loss analysis, by which we added the expected economic losses due to sub-optimal treatment decisions to the inventory costs. The methods comprised direct and indirect estimation from combinations of ALS, DAP and stand register data, and manual interpretation from aerial imagery supported by field assessment and information from previous inventories (conventional practices). The choice of method had great impact on both the accuracy and the economic value of the produced estimates. Direct methods using bitemporal ALS and DAP data gave the best accuracy and the smallest total cost. DAP was a suitable and low-cost data source for SI estimation. Estimation from single-date ALS and DAP data and age obtained from the stand register provided practical alternatives when applied to even-aged stands.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/02827581.2020.1854340","{""notes"": ""('noordermeer_economicutility3dremote_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-19 21:16:32,"included",NA,NA
7038606,"Evaluating Tropical Forest Classification And Field Sampling Stratification From Lidar To Reduce Effort And Enable Landscape Monitoring","In high biodiversity areas, such as the Amazon, forest inventory is a challenge due to large variations in vegetation structure and inaccessibility. Capturing the full gradient of variability requires the acquisition of a large number of sample plots. Pre-stratified inventory is an efficient strategy that reduces sampling effort and cost. Low-cost remote sensing techniques may significantly expand pre-stratification capacity; however, the simplest option, satellite optical imagery, cannot detect small variations in primary forests. Alternatively, three-dimensional information obtained from airborne laser scanning (ALS, a.k.a. airborne lidar) has been successfully used to estimate structural parameters in tropical forests. Our objective was to assess to what extent forest plot sampling effort could be reduced, while accurately estimating mean vegetation characteristics in the landscape, by stratifying with ALS structural properties, relative to a random, uniformed conventional approach. The study was developed in an 800-ha area of wet Amazonian forest (Acre, Brazil), including portions of palms, bamboo and dense forest. We estimated relevant structural attributes from ALS: canopy height, openness, rugosity and fractions of leaf area index (LAI) along the vertical profile. We clustered vegetation to define heterogeneity into structural types, employing the Ward method and Euclidean distance. Also, principal component analysis was employed to characterize the groups using field and ALS-derived structural attributes. We simulated sampling intensities to estimate the gain in reducing the field efforts based on pre-stratified and non-stratified forest inventory scenarios. The resulting stratification clearly distinguished the forest's structural variation gradient and the vegetation density profile. For a fixed uncertainty of 10\% in basal area estimation, the ALS-aided stratified inventory reduced the necessary number of field plots by 41\%, relative to simple random sampling. The resulting reduction in sampling effort can offset the cost of ALS data collection, significantly enhancing its financial feasibility. In addition, ALS provides broad-coverage quantifications of basal area (or aboveground carbon stock), canopy structure, and accurate terrain characterization, which have an added value for forest management.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117634","{""notes"": ""('papa_evaluatingtropicalforestclassification_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-19 17:51:48,"included",NA,NA
6863434,"An Open Data And Citizen Science Approach To Building Resilience To Natural Hazards In A Data-Scarce Remote Mountainous Part Of Nepal","The citizen science approach has gained momentum in recent years. It can enable both experts and citizen scientists to co-create new knowledge. Better understanding of local environmental, social, and geographical contexts can help in designing appropriate plans for sustainable development. However, a lack of geospatial data, especially in the context of developing countries, often precludes context-specific development planning. This study therefore tests an innovative approach of volunteer citizen science and an open mapping platform to build resilience to natural hazards in the remote mountainous parts of western Nepal. In this study, citizen scientists and mapping experts jointly mapped two districts of Nepal (Bajhang and Bajura) using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. Remote mapping based on satellite imagery, capacity building, and mobilization of citizen scientists was performed to collect the data. These data were then uploaded to OSM and later retrieved in ArcGIS to produce a usable map that could be exploited as a reference resource for evidence-based decision-making. The collected data are freely accessible to community members as well as government and humanitarian actors, and can be used for development planning and risk reduction. By piloting in two communities of western Nepal, we found that using open data platforms for collecting and analyzing location-based data has a mutual benefit for researchers and communities. Such data could be vital in understanding the local landscape, environmental risk, and distribution of resources.

Two different top -down NOx emissions estimates were developed using the KNMI DOMINO v2.0 and NASA SP2 retrievals of OMI NO2 columns. Differences in the top-down NOx emissions estimates made with these two operational products derived from the same OMI radiance data were sufficiently large that they could not be used to constrain the TCEQ NOx emissions in the southeast. The fact that the two available operational NO2 column retrievals give such different top-down NOx emissions results is important because these retrievals are increasingly being used to diagnose air quality problems and to inform efforts to solve them. These results reflect the fact that NO2 column retrievals are a blend of measurements and modeled data and should be used with caution in analyses that will inform policy development. This study illustrates both benefits and challenges of using satellite NO2 data for air quality management applications. Comparison with OMI NO2 columns pointed the way toward improvements in the CAMx simulation of the upper troposphere, but further refinement of both regional air quality models and the NO2 column retrievals is needed before the mass balance and other emission inversion methods can be used to successfully constrain NOx emission inventories used in U.S. regulatory modeling.

The valuation of government-owned satellite systems providing a public good with a complex array of instruments is a nascent field of study. Many different sensor configurations are possible, but there are restrictions due to physical and budget constraints. Accounting for economic considerations during the design and planning phase for satellite constellations helps to ensure that the most cost effective instruments are selected. To assess whether the HSS instrument should be included on GeoXO, we applied a value of information approach and found the benefits associated with this instrument are likely to substantially outweigh the costs. Value of information studies often focus on data and information that has a direct use case. Estimating benefits for the HSS is especially challenging because data are not used directly by decision makers. Instead these data along with information from other Earth observing (EO) satellites play a key role in producing the inputs necessary for modern numerical hydrometeorological modeling. We describe strategies to assess the marginal (i.e., incremental) contribution of an instrument that is part of a complex information production process. We make several recommendations that, if implemented, would improve the quality of future studies of this kind.

We found that community scientists and stakeholders provided comparable general site assessments to the field data, but that as the assessments became more detailed, differences emerged. Further, remotely sensed data were assessed and provided a more positive site assessment than any other method. Experiences and knowledge of nature did not influence assessments by community scientists or stakeholders. Our findings show that for overall site assessments, community scientists and stakeholders may be able to provide a reasonably accurate assessment. If monitoring and evaluation needs (either research-based or practical) extend beyond a broad assessment, use of a field expert or multiple methods of data collection may be warranted.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113266","{""notes"": ""('baird_evaluatingecologicaloutcomesenvironmental_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 21:40:18,"included",NA,NA

In this article, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to mine satellite data and identify pixel-level optimal weather indices that can be used to inform the design of risk transfers and the quantification of the benefits of resilient production technology adoption. We implement the model to study maize production in Mozambique, and show how the approach can be used to produce countrywide risk profiles resulting from the aggregation of local, heterogeneous exposures to rainfall precipitation and excess temperature. We then develop a framework to quantify the economic gains from technology adoption by using insurance costs as the relevant metric, where insurance is broadly understood as the transfer of weather-driven crop losses to a dedicated facility. We consider the case of irrigation in detail, estimating a reduction in insurance costs of at least 30\%, which is robust to different configurations of the model. The approach offers a robust framework to understand the costs versus benefits of investment in irrigation infrastructure, but could clearly be used to explore in detail the benefits of more advanced input packages, allowing, for example, for different crop varieties, sowing dates, or fertilizers.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/risa.12847","{""notes"": ""('biffis_satellitedatamachinelearning_2017',)""}","{}",2024-12-17 04:42:25,"included",NA,NA

Since no specific path was officially recognized before our study, the remains of the road did not benefit from heritage protection. In 2017, we made a project to determine the course of the road through rural alava. In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying.

The adaptive fusion method is introduced to fuse the collected farmland environmental data to make the multi-sensor data fusion result optimal. The soil temperature, humidity, oxygen, carbon dioxide and plant height environmental data acquisition sensors are activated to obtain field environmental sensing data, and determine the function keys based on the early warning value and time value. Adjustments were made to the farmland environment based on the judgment results with focus on the environmental control of farmland operation monitoring technology impact. The experimental results show that after the introduction of farmland operation monitoring technology, the accuracy of farmland environment monitoring is higher and the error of farmland environment regulation is lower, which meets the basic needs of users.

7036593,"The Potential Of Remote Sensing Data For Decision Makers At The State, Local And Tribal Level: Experiences From Nasa's Synergy Program","NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) satellite data are contributing to the development of policy relevant, remote sensing applications. To promote the use of EOS data for application development, NASA funded the Synergy program in 2000 in partnership with academia, end users, and industry. Three examples of remote sensing applications from the Synergy program are presented here and include agriculture, range management, and water resource management. These examples show that remote sensing products have the potential to be useful to a variety of decision makers and policy makers because of the opportunity to reduce chemicals in the environment, improve crop yields and better manage range lands and water resources. Transitioning from research and development to successful applications must overcome challenges such as the lack of awareness by end users of these technologies, inadequate feedback mechanism between application developers and end users, and unproven cost benefits of remote sensing data. Experience from the Synergy program indicates that these issues could be mitigated by educating and training end users, demonstrating the utility of remote sensing data in improving decision making, and establishing and maintaining a continuous dialogue between developers and end users. Sustainability of remote sensing applications ultimately depends on users continuing reliance on products and benefits from remote sensing data. The Synergy program also demonstrates that remote sensing data sets that are collected primarily for global change research contribute to the development of applications in a variety of disciplines at the regional and local level.

The use of satellite and airborne remote sensing to quickly and accurately detect activities associated with deforestation has great potential for catalyzing local response teams responsible for assessing and interdicting threats to tropical forest ecosystems. To better understand the utility of NRT monitoring technologies in improving environmental protection and management, from 2008 to 2016 Conservation International conducted a series of surveys and interviews with users of these systems in four countries where wildfires threaten tropical forest ecosystems: Madagascar, Indonesia, Bolivia and Peru. Users reported that NRT forest monitoring systems made significant contributions to improving the ability of conservation and forest management organizations to respond to and reduce the impacts of fire, deforestation and other illegal or undesirable forest activity.

7038071,"Public Health Benefits From Improved Identification Of Severe Air Pollution Events With Geostationary Satellite Data","Despite improvements in ambient air quality in the US in recent decades, many people still experience unhealthy levels of pollution. At present, national-level alert-day identification relies predominately on surface monitor networks and forecasters. Satellite-based estimates of surface air quality have rapidly advanced and have the capability to inform exposure-reducing actions to protect public health. At present, we lack a robust framework to quantify public health benefits of these advances in applications of satellite-based atmospheric composition data. Here, we assess possible health benefits of using geostationary satellite data, over polar orbiting satellite data, for identifying particulate air quality alert days (24hr PM2.5 > 35 μg m−3) in 2020. We find the more extensive spatiotemporal coverage of geostationary satellite data leads to a 60% increase in identification of person-alerts (alert days × population) in 2020 over polar-orbiting satellite data. We apply pre-existing estimates of PM2.5 exposure reduction by individual behavior modification and find these additional person-alerts may lead to 1,200 (800–1,500) or 54% more averted PM2.5-attributable premature deaths per year, if geostationary, instead of polar orbiting, satellite data alone are used to identify alert days. These health benefits have an associated economic value of 13 (8.8–17) billion dollars ($2019) per year.

7036582,"Assumption-Versus Data-Based Approaches To Summarizing Species' Ranges","For conservation decision making, species' geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches. Some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning. We examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses. Extent-of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations. Refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in estimates of species' true areas of distribution. However, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed. Whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing. In contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species' distributional patterns for conservation applications.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/cobi.12801","{""notes"": ""('peterson_assumptionversusdatabased_2018',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 20:52:04,"included",NA,NA

The Potential Of Small Uav's (Drones) For Site Detection And Heritage Management In Archaeological Survey Projects: A Case Study From Le Pianelle In The Tappino Valley, Molise (Italy)","Recent and ongoing technological developments make the application of unmanned aerial platforms increasingly accessible for archaeological research and heritage management. While the effectiveness of drones for documentation purposes of standing monuments and excavations has been amply demonstrated in recent years, there are also promising developments in their application for landscape archaeological projects. In this paper, the potential use of drones for the detection of subsurface archaeological remains in mountainous, Mediterranean landscapes is explored by presenting a case study in Molise, South Italy. In this rugged, Apennine area, traditional aerial archaeology approaches have in the past failed to yield good results as regards the detection and documentation of subsurface structures through crop marks. Recent experiments with low altitude, both vertical and oblique aerial photography using small, consumer friendly UAV's drones have, however, produced important and clearly readable information about the existence and extent of subsurface features in a series of sites in the Tappino Valley in Molise. This paper presents the first results of a case study of a complex rural site of the Classical-Roman period. Consequently, the paper discusses the potential value and feasibility of UAV's for archaeological research and cultural heritage management. In particular, the potential of the integration of UAV imagery in existing standard landscape archaeological research methods, such as field survey and geophysical prospection, is discussed. It is concluded that the targeted use of small remote controlled aerial platforms can significantly add to existing practices of both site-recognition and heritage management in the heavily threatened Mediterranean landscapes, and that it can be feasibly and efficiently integrated within standard methodologies applied in field survey projects.

7038484,"Scaling Marine Fish Movement Behavior From Individuals To Populations","Understanding how, where, and when animals move is a central problem in marine ecology and conservation. Key to improving our knowledge about what drives animal movement is the rising deployment of telemetry devices on a range of free-roaming species. An increasingly popular way of gaining meaningful inference from an animal's recorded movements is the application of hidden Markov models (HMMs), which allow for the identification of latent behavioral states in the movement paths of individuals. However, the use of HMMs to explore the population-level consequences of movement is often limited by model complexity and insufficient sample sizes. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to current practices and provide evidence of how the inclusion of prior information in model structure can simplify the application of HMMs to multiple animal movement paths with two clear benefits: (a) consistent state allocation and (b) increases in effective sample size. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply HMMs and adapted HMMs to over 100 multivariate movement paths consisting of conditionally dependent daily horizontal and vertical movements in two species of demersal fish: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; n=46) and European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa; n=61). We identify latent states corresponding to two main underlying behaviors: resident and migrating. As our analysis considers a relatively large sample size and states are allocated consistently, we use collective model output to investigate state-dependent spatiotemporal trends at the individual and population levels. In particular, we show how both species shift their movement behaviors on a seasonal basis and demonstrate population space use patterns that are consistent with previous individual-level studies. Tagging studies are increasingly being used to inform stock assessment models, spatial management strategies, and monitoring of marine fish populations. Our approach provides a promising way of adding value to tagging studies because inferences about movement behavior can be gained from a larger proportion of datasets, making tagging studies more relevant to management and more cost-effective.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/ece3.4223","{""notes"": ""('griffiths_scalingmarinefishmovement_2018',)""}","{""prob not""}",2024-12-19 18:14:43,"included",NA,NA

7038216,"Seawatch, Performance And Future","Operational oceanography has become an option and a reality to an extent which was not possible a decade ago. Modern techniques now allow for the collection of new types of especially ""green"" data. Data are transferred from remote locations using satellite links to support operational applications both in oceanography and in meteorology. Operational oceanography is comparable to weather forecasting in meteorology. As a consequence issues such as synoptic data collection, uniform data-quality, real-time transmission of data, data management, data assimilation in numerical models, assessment and forecasting and finally the dissemination of products tot users, are also relevant in operational oceanography. In this paper the performance and future of the Seawatch system is described. Seawatch is a result of the Eureka/Euromar partnership. Seawatch Europe was in operations from 1990-1994. It was partly operational and partly experimentla. Valuable experience was gained in operating large scale regional monitoring systems. Daily reports were distributed to different users, weekly reports were issued and distributed widely, quarterly and annual reports were issued for in-depth presentations of the marine environment as deducted from the data obtained by the Seawatch buoy network. A strong point of Seawatch is that it is commercially off-the-shelf and state-of-the-art technology. In a report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1996) the benefits of the Seawatch system are clearly demonstrated. The global potential for the Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a running costs of $100 million per year. Within the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the initiator of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), Seawatch is seen as an important building block for GOOS, with special relevance to the marine meteorology and oceanographic forecasting, the health of the ocean, and the coastal zone management modules. © 1997 Elsevier B.V.

This evaluation integrates remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, aerodynamic principles, and Landsat7 ETM+ images. Three main procedures were carried out in this study; the first derived the surface temperature from Landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantified evaporation loss to the secondary channels' level over one month (March) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface temperature of the raster data; the third procedure applied GIS suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected. The results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2.73 mm/day at the middle of the lake to 9.58 mm/day at the edge. The evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0.86 billion m(3) /month (March). The analysis suggests that it is possible to save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19.7 million m(3) / month (March), and thus 2.4 billion m(3) /year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate construction heights of 8 m and 15 m. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS are useful for applications in remote locations where field-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management.

Experience in the use of remote sensing, however, indicate the potential for the use of processed satellite or air orthophotomaps not only for cropping delineation but also to verify certain elements of agricultural practices. During the CwRS routine, one could indicate a possible non-compliance issues directly on the image and thereby optimize the process of control. The studies indicated which of the requirements to maintain land in good agricultural conditions might be monitored with CwRS. The results of the series of experiments showed that both kind of aerial and satellite orthophoto can be consider as equivalent materials. Features or phenomenon spread over a large area or occurred point-wise are detectable in image easier than during field inspection. Also wherever access or visibility on the ground is limited due to the morphology complexity, road network, etc., orthophotomap provide better angle of view. Nevertheless, the ratio benefit/cost for managing the entire control on national level should be checked against the efficiency of field control.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.2478/ecoq-2013-0018","{""notes"": ""('plutokossakowska_remotesensingcontrolagricultural_2013',)""}","{}",2024-10-28 19:38:48,"included",NA,NA
7037441,"Potential Of Virtual Earth Observation Constellations In Archaeological Research","Earth observation sensors continually provide datasets with different spectral and spatial characteristics, while a series of pre- and postprocessing techniques are needed for calibration purposes. Nowadays, a variety of satellite images have become accessible to researchers, while big data cloud platforms allow them to deal with an extensive number of datasets. However, there is still difficulty related to these sensors meeting specific needs and challenges such as those of cultural heritage and supporting archaeological research world-wide. The harmonization and synergistic use of different sensors can be used in order to maximize the impact of earth observation sensors and enhance their benefit to the scientific community. In this direction, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has proposed the concept of virtual constellations, which is defined as ""a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the Earth system"".

6903469,"Enabling Efficient Service Function Chains At Terrestrial-Satellite Hybrid Cloud Networks","The great improvements in both satellite and terrestrial networks have motivated the academic and industrial communities to rethink their integration. As a result, there is an increasing interest in new-generation hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks, where sufficient flexibility should be enabled to deploy customized SFCs to satisfy the growing diversity of user needs. However, it is still challenging to achieve such a nice vision, since many key issues remain unaddressed comprehensively such as framework design, communication procedures and resource optimization. Therefore, in this article, we focus on how to efficiently deploy customized SFCs at terrestrial-satellite hybrid cloud networks. In particular, we first propose an elastic framework used for SFC deployment at clouds, and second propose an efficient SFC mapping approach for improvement of system resource utilization. Finally, we verify the proposed framework at a proof-of-concept prototype via a number of use cases, and evaluate the proposed mapping approach through extensive simulations based on a real-world topology.

6691635,"Bayesian framework for assessing the value of scientific space systems: value of information approach with application to earth science spacecraft","Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholders’ beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to justify the acquisition of the system.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently funded activities to enhance remote sensing inputs to FEWS NET. A professional review was conducted to elicit Earth observation requirements for FEWS NET. It focused upon operational requirements of FEWS NET end-users to determine qualities of useful remote sensing data and data products. In this manner, properties of certain biophysical predictions that would be beneficial as FEWS NET supplementary inputs could be ascertained. Reviewers were asked to evaluate the importance of environmental variables and spatiotemporal requirements for Earth science data inputs, particularly for rainfall and vegetation products. The review was implemented in 2007 as an online questionnaire and was completed by more than 40 experts from around the world. This professional review questionnaire was shown to be a viable tool for the rapid derivation, compilation, and analysis of requirements necessary to enhance FEWS NET.

As valuable field experience increases and learning by doing advances, successful applications of management practices are being identified even though few are adequately documented with economic benefits. Access to accurate information pertaining to applications of site-specific management would be expected to motivate more producers to incorporate technology uses with crop production. This next group of producers has been watching technology developments as they preferred to avoid risk and wait for identifiable benefits. Waiting for detailed case studies involving high value fruits and vegetables may be the wrong approach to take. Fierce competition and strict confidentiality are expected in the fresh market industry. Thus, personal experience with technology becomes more relevant to innovative producers than published literature. This is especially true in California where 350 different crops are produced. High resolution imagery from digital aerial and satellite sensors has been used in crop production in California to identify plant stress, direct plant tissue and soil sampling efforts, and provide information for analysis and interpretation of crop growth.

In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield.

In view of this, one of the main purposes of the development and application of the Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) is to assess the potential impact of new observations on the quality of the current monitoring or forecasting systems, thereby making this framework valuable. This study introduces the overall OSSE framework established to support air quality forecasting and the details of its individual components. Furthermore, it shows case study results from Northeast Asia and the potential benefits of the new observation data scenarios on the PM2.5 forecasting skills, including the PM data from 200 virtual monitoring sites in the Gobi Desert and North Korean non-forest areas (NEWPM) and the aerosol optical depths (AOD) data from South Korea's Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS AOD). Performance statistics suggest that the concurrent assimilation of the NEWPM and the PM data from current monitoring sites in China and South Korea can improve the PM2.5 concentration forecasts in South Korea by 66.4\% on average for October 2017 and 95.1\% on average for February 2018. Assimilating the GEMS AOD improved the performance of the PM2.5 forecasts in South Korea for October 2017 by approximately 68.4\% (\~{}78.9\% for February 2018).

7036835,"On Timeliness And Accuracy Of Wildfire Detection By The Goes Wf-Abba Algorithm Over California During The 2006 Fire Season","The Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF-ABBA) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for geostationary wildfire detection whose results have been increasingly used in a range of environmental applications. At present, the WF-ABBA validation activities and, in general, fire product validation methodologies are at a markedly less advanced stage than the algorithm itself. Particularly, little is known about detection timeliness, despite the value of such information for assessing the potential of geostationary observations to improve tactical decision making of first responders. This paper contributes to reducing this gap in two ways. Firstly, we describe a new methodology that is suitable for evaluating geostationary satellite wildfire detection in terms of incidents with regard to both timeliness and reliability. This methodology utilizes available official multi-agency wildfire reporting information and multitemporal Landsat imagery. Secondly, we apply the proposed validation method to temporally filtered GOES-West WF-ABBA (ver. 6.1) detections for the 2006 fire season over the State of California and present incident-wise and pixel-wise performance information. The results indicate highly reliable pixel-wise performance of WF-ABBA, with about 75\% of fire pixels (or more) corresponding to actual recorded active wildfires. A substantial portion of wildfires were detected during their first hour of activity, and a few incident-even before the initial reports from conventional sources. Although the WF-ABBA performs best at what it was designed for: consistently re-detecting (monitoring) active fires, we believe there is an additional potential for automated detection from current geostationary data to reduce wildfire ignition latencies in the Western U.S. Our results can serve as a guideline for algorithm developers and users of the WF-ABBA fire product.

7037063,"The Added Value Of A Proposed Satellite Imager For Ground Level Particulate Matter Analyses And Forecasts","Monitoring aerosols over wide areas is important for the assessment of the population's exposure to health relevant particulate matter (PM). Satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) can contribute to the improvement of highly needed analyzed and forecasted distributions of PM when combined with a model and ground-based observations. In this paper, we evaluate the contribution of column AOD observations from a future imager on a geostationary satellite by performing an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). In the OSSE simulated imager, AOD observations and ground-based PM observations are assimilated in the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to assess the added value of the satellite observations relative to the value of ground-based observations. Results show that in highly polluted situations, the imager AOD observations improve analyzed and forecasted PM2.5 concentrations even in the vicinity of simultaneously incorporated ground-based PM observations. The added value of the proposed imager is small when considering monthly averaged PM distributions. This is attributed to relatively large errors in the imager AODs in case of background aerosol loads coupled to the fact that the imager AODs are column values and an indirect estimate of PM. In the future, model improvements and optimization of the assimilation system should be achieved for better handling of situations with aerosol plumes above the boundary layer and satellite observations containing aerosol profile information. With the suggested improvements, the developed OSSE will form a powerful tool for determining the added value of future missions and defining requirements for planned satellite observations.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1109/jstars.2009.2034613","{""notes"": ""('timmermans_addedproposedsatelliteimager_2009',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 18:54:01,"included",NA,NA

The RO measurement technique was dubbed as ""the most accurate and stable thermometer in space"" because of its high accuracy, high vertical resolution, and high stability, which does not require calibration. Since its launch in 2006, FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC has accumulated over 6.9 million atmospheric and 4.6 million ionospheric RO sounding profiles. Encouraged by the success of FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC, Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) started the planning for the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 mission in 2008 as a follow-on program to FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC.

6863303,"Mapping Daily Evapotranspiration At Field Scale Using The Harmonized Landsat And Sentinel-2 Dataset, With Sharpened Viirs As A Sentinel-2 Thermal Proxy","Accurate and frequent monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) at sub-field scales can provide valuable information for agricultural water management, quantifying crop water use and stress toward the goal of increasing crop water use efficiency and production. Using land-surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, along with surface reflectance data describing albedo and vegetation cover fraction, surface energy balance models can generate ET maps down to a 30 m spatial resolution. However, the temporal sampling by such maps can be limited by the relatively infrequent revisit period of Landsat data (8 days for combined Landsats 7 and 8), especially in cloudy areas experiencing rapid changes in moisture status. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, as a good complement to the Landsat system, provide surface reflectance data at 10-20 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit period but do not have a thermal sensor. On the other hand, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) provides TIR data on a near-daily basis with 375 m resolution, which can be refined through thermal sharpening using S2 reflectances. This study assesses the utility of augmenting the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset with S2-sharpened VIIRS as a thermal proxy source on S2 overpass days, enabling 30 m ET mapping at a potential combined frequency of 2-3 days (including Landsat). The value added by including VIIRS-S2 is assessed both retrospectively and operationally in comparison with flux tower observations collected from several U.S. agricultural sites covering a range of crop types. In particular, we evaluate the performance of VIIRS-S2 ET estimates as a function of VIIRS view angle and cloud masking approach. VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals (MAE of 0.49 mm d(-1) against observations) generally show comparable accuracy to Landsat ET (0.45 mm d(-1)) on days of commensurate overpass, but with decreasing performance at large VIIRS view angles. Low-quality VIIRS-S2 ET retrievals linked to imperfect VIIRS/S2 cloud masking are also discussed, and caution is required when applying such data for generating ET timeseries. Fused daily ET time series benefited during the peak growing season from the improved multi-source temporal sampling afforded by VIIRS-S2, particularly in cloudy regions and over surfaces with rapidly changing vegetation conditions, and value added for real-time monitoring applications is discussed. This work demonstrates the utility and feasibility of augmenting the HLS dataset with sharpened VIIRS TIR imagery on S2 overpass dates for generating high spatiotemporal resolution ET products.",2021,"{""Anderson, Martha C."",""Gao, Feng"",""Hain, Christopher"",""Knipper, Kyle R."",""Kustas, William P."",""Xue, Jie"",""Yang, Yang"",""Yang, Yun""}","article",NA,"10.3390/rs13173420","{""notes"": ""('xue_mappingdailyevapotranspirationfield_2021',)""}","{}",2024-07-12 23:27:16,"included",NA,NA

To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730. nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a. +. b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a piñon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling. We found that the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) allowed stress to be detected 13. days after girdling - between and 16. days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI traditionally used for satellite based forest health monitoring. We conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress monitoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2011,"{""Ager, A.

7038031,"Site- And Time-Specific Early Weed Control Is Able To Reduce Herbicide Use In Maize - A Case Study","Remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for weed detection is a valuable asset in agriculture and is vastly used for site-specific weed control. Alongside site-specific methods, time-specific weed control is another critical aspect of precision weed control where, by using different models, it is possible to determine the time of weed species emergence. This study combined site-specific and time-specific weed control methods to explore their collective benefits for precision weed control. Using the AlertInf model, a weed emergence prediction model, the cumulative emergence of Sorghum halepense was calculated, following the selection of the best date for the UAV survey when the emergence was predicted to be at 96\%. The survey was executed using a UAV with visible range sensors, resulting in an orthophoto with a resolution of 3 cm, allowing for good weed detection. The orthophoto was post-processed using two separate methods: an artificial neural network (ANN) and the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) to discriminate between the weeds, the crop, and the soil. Finally, a model was applied for the creation of prescription maps with different cell sizes (0.25 m(2), 2 m(2), and 3 m(2)) and with three different decision-making thresholds based on pixels identified as weeds (>1\%, >5\%, and >10\%). Additionally, the potential savings in herbicide use were assessed using two herbicides (Equip and Titus Mais Extra) as examples. The results show that both classification methods have a high overall accuracy of 98.6\% for ANN and 98.1\% for VARI, with the ANN having much better results concerning user/producer accuracy and Cohen's Kappa value (k 83.7 ANN and k 72 VARI). The reduction percentage of the area to be sprayed ranged from 65.29\% to 93.35\% using VARI and from 42.43\% to 87.82\% using ANN. The potential reduction in herbicide use was found to be dependent on the area. For the Equip herbicide, this reduction ranged from 1.32 L/ha to 0.28 L/ha for the ANN; with VARI the reduction in the amounts used ranged from 0.80 L/ha to 0.15 L/ha. Meanwhile, for Titus Mais Extra herbicide, the reduction ranged from 46.06 g/ha to 8.19 g/ha in amounts used with the ANN; with VARI the amount reduction ranged from 27.77 g/ha to 5.32 g/ha. These preliminary results indicate that combining site-specific and time-specific weed control might significantly reduce herbicide use with direct benefits for the environment and on-farm variable costs.

Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DVI, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2, ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R2 = 0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran.

7038401,"Impacts Of Geospatial Information For Decision Making","Geospatial information contributes to decisions by both societal decision-makers and individuals. Investments in geospatial data have become a part of the political and policy debates that are focused on reducing government spending, as well as increasing societal wellbeing. Although many examples in our everyday life come to mind, good benchmarks of the value of geospatial information are missing. Quantifying this value involves comparisons of the decisions that would have been made with and without the information, and what the consequences of those decisions would have been. The Value of Information (VOI) is linked to the outcome of choice in uncertain situations. Individuals may be willing to pay for improved information depending on how uncertain they are, what is at stake, and the degree to which the benefit exceeds the cost of the information (Macauley 2006). Problems with data access, content interpretation (due to obscure file formats, for example) or use of the data all reduce the information value. Systematic analysis of the benefits of geospatial information in decisions focuses on the quantitative demonstration of why and how scientific data such as earth observations have economic value. Case studies apply the science and technology of geospatial data to inform decisions concerning the costs and benefits of economic and resource development. Two cases studies are provided which show net economic value but different approaches to assessing the VOI.

6691644,"An Economic Value of Remote-Sensing  Information—Application to Agricultural  Production and Maintaining  Groundwater Quality","Does remote-sensing information provide economic benefits to society, and can a value be assigned to those benefits?

The approach uses moderate-resolution land-imagery (MRLI) data from the Landsat and Advanced Wide Field Sensor satellites that has been classified by the National Agricultural Statistics Service into the Cropland Data Layer (CDL).

Employing various multiscaled, multitemporal geospatial datasets with MRLI to maximize the value of agricultural production, the approach develops and uses multiple environmental science models to address dynamic nitrogen loading and transport at specified distances from specific sites (wells) and at landscape scales (for example, across 35 counties and two aquifers). In addition to the ecosystem service of potable groundwater, this effort focuses on the use of MRLI for the management of the major land uses in the study region—the production of corn and soybeans, which can impact groundwater quality. Derived methods and results include (1) economic and dynamic nitrate-pollution models, (2) probabilities of the survival of groundwater, and (3) a VOI for remote sensing. For the northeastern Iowa study region, the marginal benefit of the MRLI VOI (in 2010 dollars) is $858 million ± $197 million annualized, which corresponds to a net present value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits in perpetuity. Given that these economic estimates are derived from one case study in a part of only one State, the estimates provide a lower estimate related to the potential value of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission.",2012,"{""Forney, W.M.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1796/","{}","{}",2024-04-23 22:08:11,"included",NA,NA
6691692,"Getting the Most out of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based on User–Forecast Interactions","A flexible theoretical model of perceived forecast value is proposed that explicitly includes the effects of user and ensemble characteristics and their interactions. The model can be applied to arbitrary decision problems and is sensitive to a much wider range of factors than traditional forecast valuation models. A simple illustration of its application to the cost–loss decision problem familiar from the forecast valuation literature is discussed. It is shown that perceived value is highly sensitive to perceived model accuracy and that in most cases a high level of perceived accuracy is required for the forecasts to be thought to have any value at all. Decisions with a cost–benefit ratio that is close to the climatological probability of the adverse event are shown to be less sensitive to perceived accuracy. The model shows that it is possible for perceived value to remain unchanged when perceived accuracy increases, thus suggesting an explanation for why forecast uptake often does not increase after improvements in model performance are made. Last, it is argued that attempts to increase forecast uptake should be targeted at those users whose cost–benefit ratios fall in a restricted range that depends on the climatological probability of the event and an objective measure of the ensemble accuracy.",2008,"{""Millner, Antony""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1175/2008JAMC1899.1","{}","{}",2024-04-23 22:38:02,"included",NA,NA
7038083,"Automated Predictive Ecological Mapping In A Forest Region Of Bc,: Canada, 2001-2005","Procedures for automated predictive thematic mapping were developed and applied to project areas totaling more than 3 million ha of forested land in British Columbia, Canada. The effective scale of mapping was 1:20,000 using data at a grid resolution of 25 in. The methods can be described as a form of automated feature extraction or object recognition where the objects of interest consist of ecological site types. The methods implement a hybrid of automated, semi-automated and manual procedures that develop and apply heuristic, rule-based conceptual models of ecological-landform relationships. The methods rely heavily upon terrain derivatives extracted from available digital elevation models (DEMs) in addition to satellite imagery and manually digitized maps of ancillary environmental conditions. The primary input has been the BC provincial Terrain Resource Information Management (TRIM) digital elevation model (DEM) surfaced to a regular grid of 25 in. Other input layers include manually interpreted maps of parent material texture, depth and ecological exception classes, manually prepared maps of the spatial distribution of ecological zones of the BC Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system and, to a limited extent, LandSat7 digital satellite imagery. The procedures do not use any field sampling to develop or train classification rules. A knowledge-based approach is used to establish classification rules which are defined and implemented using a Semantic Import (SI) Model implementation of fuzzy logic. All rules are constructed by examining and deconstructing published field guides that define the required ecological output classes and that document the current expert understanding of the conditions and criteria that control the spatial distribution of these desired output classes. An iterative, trial and error, process is used to develop, apply, evaluate and revise object recognition rules that relate ranges of values of key input data layers to an expert-assigned likelihood of occurrence for each ecological class of interest. Local expert knowledge is used at each stage to evaluate each new set of output results and to guide refinement of the fuzzy SI model classification rules. Field sample observations obtained along randomly selected closed traverses were collected following a line intercept approach and used to assess the accuracy of the final predictions of ecological classification. Application of the procedures has progressed from an initial pilot project through projects to evaluate operational scale-up to full-scale commercial application to millions of hectares. Costs have been reduced from a high of \$3.50/ha to less than \$0.20/ha. Rates of progress increased from 150,000 ha per person year to more than 2.0 million ha per person year. Independent assessments of map accuracy produced results superior to the highest accuracies reported for all alternatives, including traditional manual mapping methods. We conclude that we have formalized and automated many of the concepts and techniques previously used to create thematic maps of ecosystems using manual interpretation of stereo air photos and ancillary data combined with field observations. We have shown that automated feature extraction is able to capture and apply the concepts of landform control referenced by typical landform-based ecological models and classification systems. We have demonstrated that it is possible to produce accurate and cost-effective ecological-landform maps by applying fuzzy and Boolean logic and automated landform analysis procedures to idely available spatial data.

7037933,"Economic Valuation Of Mangroves In The Niger Delta: An Interdisciplinary Approach","Today, the concept of an interdisciplinary approach to research has gained tremendous attention, both because it is an antithesis to the conventional divisions of knowledge-based research, and because complex problems in applied research almost always span various disciplines. This study explores one interdisciplinary approach to research, which addresses the problem of equitable mangrove valuation for the sustainable management of the resource in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. By integrating results from satellite remote sensing analysis and socioeconomic surveys, the economic value of mangroves in the Niger Delta, discounted over a 30- year period at 20% discount rate, ranges from $640-2,825ha. The variation in economic value is attributed to the variation in the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities that participated in the study. © 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Estimation results based on a survey data of 1000 households show that most explanatory variables including bid amounts and household income significantly influenced dichotomous choice contingent valuation responses with expected signs. When applied to the whole sample, mean willingness to pay reflecting both use and non-use values was stable at around $3.70 per year for the improvement of air quality information. Present values of total benefits over the lifetime period of the space satellite exceed the cost born by tax payers with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.77.

This study investigated the intangible economic benefits of remote sensing activities in Indonesia. This research explored qualitatively the advantage of the use of remote sensing information by users obtained from the results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The conceptual framework of intangible benefit is based on the information system success model by the De-Lone and McLean Information Value model. The results showed that the quality of remote sensing was good. This can be seen from most responses of user respondents on the Perceived System Quality and Information Quality indicators giving a good rating. The response of the user respondents caused a sense of satisfaction and also caused the use of the system to be more intense. These had a good impact on the performance of respondents, both individually and organizationally.

6691572,"Economic value of environmental and weather information for agricultural decisions – A case study for Oklahoma Mesonet","For the past 24 years, weather information and monitoring provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s largest weather and environmental monitoring network) has been used by many farmers across the state to optimize their farm operations and improve profitability of agricultural production. Several research studies delineated advantages of Mesonet weather information for efficient agricultural decision-making. However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center. The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006–2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006–2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.This research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic understanding of the economic value and benefits of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state.",2018,"{""Ziolkowska, Jadwiga R.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.008","{}","{}",2024-04-25 02:41:20,"included",NA,NA
7036814,"Alternative Spatially Enhanced Integrative Techniques For Mapping Seagrass In Florida's Marine Ecosystem","Seagrass is an important component of coastal marine ecosystems. Seagrass mapping provides a means for assessing seagrass health by monitoring the spatial distribution and density of seagrass habitat in coastal waters. Recent image processing and satellite technologies present the opportunity to leverage quantitative techniques that have the potential to improve upon traditional photo-interpretation techniques in terms of cost, mapping fidelity, and objectivity. Integrated spatial and spectral processing techniques were identified as an alternative method for mapping seagrass extent and density from an IKONOS satellite image of Springs Coast, Florida. These spatially enhanced integrative mapping techniques objectively standardize seagrass-monitoring efforts and enhance mapping capabilities by characterizing spatial seagrass density gradients. A combination of water column correction, pixel classification, and image segmentation techniques provided a seagrass density index map that represented seagrass density and distribution with high spatial detail and overall accuracy (77%) comparable to photo-interpretation techniques. Satellite imagery-based spatially enhanced image processing techniques were found to provide a consistent, quantitative, and cost-effective alternative for seagrass mapping in Springs Coast with the potential to be transferred to other parts of the world. A cost savings analysis concluded that there was a 13% cost saving using satellite photo-interpretation and a 47% cost saving using enhanced satellite classification when compared to aerial photo-interpretation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/01431161.2012.721941","{""notes"": ""('baumstark_alternativespatiallyenhancedintegrative_2013',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 21:38:34,"included",NA,NA

This workshop has been conducted as part of GEO Task US-09-02a: “Socio-Economic Benefits of GEO and GEOSS”, led by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the International Institute for Advanced Spatial Applications (IIASA), and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). It was organized by these three organizations, and by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Twenty-five experts from America, Europe and Australia have gathered in Ispra to present their experience in the field of the evaluation of the benefits from Earth Observations obtained by in-situ, remote and the new citizen’s sensors. The discussion was based on the outcomes of two previous workshops held in 2010 on the same issue, in US and in Europe. The background section presents the rationale behind the need of understanding the benefits Earth Observations, supported by several initiatives at the continental (e.g. INSPIRE Directive in Europe) and at the global (e.g. GEOSS) level. The aim of the workshop, described in the second section of this document, was to support the development of international capabilities to determine, quantify and document the socioeconomic benefits from EO and their use, and to jointly develop a programme of activities to be followed in the next few years by the research group. The foreseen activities of the programme were the consolidation of the body of literature in the field, the collection and analysis of suitable methodologies to assess Earth Observations’ benefits, and of evidence of benefits from existing case studies, the development of appropriate outreach initiatives, the strengthening of the existing community of researchers and the link with other communities of scientists, to set up multidisciplinary studies. To this aim, each participant brought his/her own experience in the analysing and assessing the impacts of Earth Observation in their own field of research, generating an interesting list of multifaceted examples and case studies in which the same problem is analysed from different perspectives. Section 3 contains a summary of each presentation, which gave the elements for the subsequent discussion among experts, leading to the preliminary programme of activities. Among the several subject of discussions there were the value to be ascribed to Earth Observation data, the need of complementing ex-ante impact assessments with monitoring and ex-post evaluations, the need of clearly communicating the benefits to policy makers in order to fund research and as well to provide a service to the society. These discussion topics are summarised in section 4, describing also the view of the experts as regard possible activities for the creation of a body of knowledge about the field, for the definition of a methodology for the estimation of Earth Observations’ benefits, the criteria for selecting suitable case studies to show such benefits and proposal for outreach and dissemination activities. As final recommendations from the workshop, priority should be given to: \n• the development of an accepted scientific paradigm and of a General Economic Framework to measure EO costs and benefits; \n• the establishment of a community of practice bringing together demand and supply; \n• the support to increase the number of researchers active in this field research group; \n• the showcase of concrete projects clearly communicating the benefits achieved. \nMoreover, concrete suggestions were given aimed at developing research activities to establish a consolidated state of the art, mainly consisting in meta-analysis of existing studies and production of high-impact articles or special issues in well-recognised scientific journals.",2011,"{""Borzacchiello, Maria-Teresa""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.2788/78532","{}","{maybe}",2024-04-25 02:46:45,"included",NA,NA

7038563,"Acquisition Of Earth Science Remote Sensing Observations From Commercial Sources: Lessons Learned From The Space Imaging Ikonos Example","Over the last decade, NASA and other federal agencies have been increasingly encouraged to explore commercial sources of land remote sensing data rather than pursuing government-funded sources of these measurements (prior to U.S. Commercial Executive, 2003. U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis. Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys. To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations. The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

7038246,"Exploring The Potential Value Of Satellite Remote Sensing To Monitor Chlorophyll-A For Us Lakes And Reservoirs","Assessment of chlorophyll-a, an algal pigment, typically measured by field and laboratory in situ analyses, is used to estimate algal abundance and trophic status in lakes and reservoirs. In situ-based monitoring programs can be expensive, may not be spatially, and temporally comprehensive and results may not be available in the timeframe needed to make some management decisions, but can be more accurate, precise, and specific than remotely sensed measures. Satellite remotely sensed chlorophyll-a offers the potential for more geographically and temporally dense data collection to support estimates when used to augment or substitute for in situ measures. In this study, we compare available chlorophyll-a data from in situ and satellite imagery measures at the national scale and perform a cost analysis of these different monitoring approaches. The annual potential avoided costs associated with increasing the availability of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a values were estimated to range between \$5.7 and \$316 million depending upon the satellite program used and the timeframe considered. We also compared sociodemographic characteristics of the regions (both public and private lands) covered by both remote sensing and in situ data to check for any systematic differences across areas that have monitoring data.

7038505,"Monitoring Daily Evapotranspiration Over Two California Vineyards Using Landsat 8 In A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion Approach","California's Central Valley grows a significant fraction of grapes used for wine production in the United States. With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, it is critical to be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014. The system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with a multi-scale ET retrieval algorithm based on the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation to compute daily ET at 30 m resolution. In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, similar to 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19-23\% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d(-1)), reducing to 14-20\% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (similar to 5 mm wk(-1)). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at field-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops.

7036774,"Uav To Inform Restoration: A Case Study From A California Tidal Marsh","Monitoring of environmental restoration is essential to communicate progress and improve outcomes of current and future projects, but is typically done in a very limited capacity due to budget and personnel constraints. Unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in a variety of natural and human-influenced environments and have been found to be time- and cost-efficient, but have not yet been widely applied to restoration contexts. In this study, we evaluated the utility of UAVs as an innovative tool for monitoring tidal marsh restoration. We first optimized methods for creating high-resolution orthomosaics and Structure from Motion digital elevation models from UAV imagery by conducting experiments to determine an optimal density of ground control points (GCPs) and flight altitude for UAV monitoring of topography and new vegetation. We used elevation models and raw and classified orthomosaics before, during, and after construction of the restoration site to communicate with various audiences and inform adaptive management. We found that we could achieve 1.1 cm vertical accuracy in our elevation models using 2.1 GCPs per hectare at a flight altitude of 50 m. A lower flight altitude of 30 m was more ideal for capturing patchy early plant cover while still being efficient enough to cover the entire 25-hectare site. UAV products were valuable for several monitoring applications, including calculating the volume of soil moved during construction, tracking whether elevation targets were achieved, quantifying and examining the patterns of vegetation development, and monitoring topographic change including subsidence, erosion, and creek development.

7037337,"Role Of Satellite Remote Sensing In The Geographic Information Economics In France","In national and international economics, geographic information plays a role which is generally acknowledged to be important but which is however, difficult to assess quantitatively, its applications being rather miscellaneous and indirect. Computer graphics and telecommunications increae that importance still more and justify many investments and research into new cartographic forms. As part of its responsibility for participating in the promotion of those developments, by taking into account needs expressed by public or private users, the National Council for Geographic Information (C.N.I.G.) has undertaken a general evaluation of the economic and social utility of geographic information in France. The study involves an estimation of the cost of production and research activities, which are probably about 0.1% of the Cross National Product-similar to many other countries. It also devised a method of estimating ""cost/advantage"" ratios applicable to these ""intangible"" benefits. Within that framework, remote sensing emphasizes particular aspects related both to the increase of economic performances in cartographic production and to the advent of new products and new ways of utilization. A review of some significant sectors shows effective earnings of about 10-20%, or even 50% or 100% of the costs, and these are doubtless much greater for the efficacy in the exploitation of products. Finally, many applications, entirely new result from extensions in various fields which would have been impossible without remote sensing: here the ""cost advantage"" ratio cannot even be compared with previous processes. Studies were undertaken in parallel for defining different types of products derived from satellite imagery, as well as those domains where development effort is required in order to make new advances. © 1991.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/0924-2716(91)90065-4","{""notes"": ""('denegre_rolesatelliteremotesensing_1991',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:16:13,"included",NA,NA

This paper attempts to assess the economic benefits of informational investments, specifically of investments in Earth Observation (EO) for managing the Great Barrier Reef. We develop an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the expected contribution of informational investments to decision-making. We hypothesize that EO can improve decision-making by allowing for better-targeted emission reduction measures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. For assessing the benefits (cost savings) of improved targeting we develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments may affect reef quality, or emissions from certain catchments may affect reef quality more. The states reflect the current uncertainties relating to water quality management in the region. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of EO information for managing the GBR can be substantial, and depend on the perceived accuracy of EO information and on decision-makers prior beliefs.",2009,"{""Bouma, Jetske A.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2608005/235180.pdf","{}","{""in benchmarks?""}",2024-04-22 02:59:30,"included",NA,NA

Securing sustainability in agriculture requires accountability and responsibility of the actors engaged in the deployment of the civilian UAV due to associated deployment risks and unintended consequences. UAV technology has the potential to replace remote sensing technologies like satellite imageries and piloted aircraft used in the crop insurance business. The governance of deployment of UAV technology in India is a complex challenge when a well-developed regulatory system is not in place and diverse actors involved in the deployment and operation of civilian UAV for agricultural applications. Therefore, two main questions, how UAV innovations can lead to sustainability in Indian agriculture and how are the issues of governance of civil UAV innovations in crop insurance applications addressed, are dealt with. The responsible innovation approach is adopted as a theoretical framework. The exploratory and qualitative study used in-depth interviews, and the interviewees were selected through snowball sampling technique. The results suggest that in the governance of emerging technologies like UAV certain values such as trust, transparency, safety, autonomy, and environmental friendliness assumed high significance. Findings also suggest that UAV has the risk-taking ability in adverse weather condition.

6863694,"Food, Water, And Fault Lines: Remote Sensing Opportunities For Earthquake-Response Management Of Agricultural Water","Earthquakes often cause destructive and unpredictable changes that can affect local hydrology (e.g. groundwater elevation or reduction) and thus disrupt land uses and human activities. Prolific agricultural regions overlie seismically active areas, emphasizing the importance to improve our understanding and monitoring of hydrologic and agricultural systems following a seismic event. A thorough data collection is necessary for adequate post-earthquake crop management response; however, the large spatial extent of earthquake's impact makes challenging the collection of robust data sets for identifying locations and magnitude of these impacts. Observing hydrologic responses to earthquakes is not a novel concept, yet there is a lack of methods and tools for assessing earthquake's impacts upon the regional hydrology and agricultural systems. The objective of this paper is to describe how remote sensing imagery, methods and tools allow detecting crop responses and damage incurred after earthquakes because a change in the regional hydrology. Many remote sensing datasets are long archived with extensive coverage and with well-documented methods to assess plant-water relations. We thus connect remote sensing of plantwater relations to its utility in agriculture using a post-earthquake agrohydrologic remote sensing (PEARS) framework; specifically in agro-hydrologic relationships associated with recent earthquake events that will lead to improved water management.

The employment of artificial intelligence in smart agriculture has many benefits for the environment: it helps small farmers (at a local scale) and policymakers and cooperatives (at regional scale) to take valid and coordinated countermeasures to combat climate change. This article discusses how artificial intelligence in agriculture can help to reduce costs, especially in developing countries such as Cote d'Ivoire, employing only low-cost or open-source tools, from hardware to software and open data. We developed machine learning models for two tasks: the first is improving agricultural farming cultivation, and the second is water management. For the first task, we used deep neural networks (YOLOv5m) to detect healthy plants and pods of cocoa and damaged ones only using mobile phone images. The results confirm it is possible to distinguish well the healthy from damaged ones. For actions at a larger scale, the second task proposes the analysis of remote sensors, coming from the GRACE NASA Mission and ERA5, produced by the Copernicus climate change service.

This article seeks to evaluate the public value arising from improving the accuracy of early detection of cumulo-nimbus using Geo-Kompsat-2A. To this end, an economic technique called contingent valuation (CV) is adopted taking a three step approach. In step 1, a CV questionnaire was prepared for deriving the willingness to pay (WTP) for the improvement. In step 2, a nationwide survey of 1000 households was conducted using the CV questionnaire and employing person-to-person interviews with household visits. In step 3, the average WTP was estimated. The yearly household average WTP was KRW 2143 (USD 1.91), securing statistical significance. Adjusting this value to suit the entire population of South Korea produces a yearly public value of KRW 44.1 billion (USD 39.3 million).

Urban green spaces are traditionally valued by merging spatial household data with administrative data on land use to obtain their amount around households; this is then related to residential wellbeing or real estate prices to arrive at a monetary valuation. This traditional approach, however, neglects not only the large heterogeneity in the quality of urban green spaces but also issues of measuring outcomes and issues of reverse causality. We discuss new data and methods to overcome some of these issues. We focus on the use of high-frequency experience-sampling methods on wellbeing or web-scraped real estate prices to better understand impacts; big data from crowdsourced imagery of urban green spaces or satellite imagery of chlorophyll activity to better understand quality; and machine learning to make better use of data. Finally, we discuss the potential of field experiments and quasi-experiments to deal with reverse causality.

7037988,"Experiences From Near-Real-Time Satellite-Based Volcano Monitoring In Central America: Case Studies At Fuego, Guatemala","Over the past decade, remote sensing has been used increasingly in the study of active volcanoes and their associated hazards. Ground-based remote sensing techniques, such as those aimed at the analysis of volcanic gases or fumarole temperatures, are now part of routine monitoring operations with additional satellite-based remote sensing methods. It is likely that the use of satellite-based systems will be most beneficial for volcano monitoring in developing country regions and remote areas. In such situations, an operational real-time satellite remote sensing system could provide rapid assessment of volcanic activity levels and potentially be used to derive crucial information for disaster prevention. This would allow key at-risk areas to be rapidly and appropriately targeted. An operational test of such a system has been carried out in the past 3 years in Central America, based on local reception and analysis of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Here we analyse the performance and data quality for recent activity of Fuego volcano (Guatemala). We assess the ability of the system to detect, quantify and monitor periods of heightened activity and consider the benefits of such information being available in near-real time to local geoscientists and for hazard mitigation. We show that the system is able to detect significant changes in volcanic activity (November and December 2004, February and December 2005). There are good comparisons for these events with large-scale monitoring systems using additional remote sensing data.

The outcome provides a unified starting point for the climate-change carbon community to assess uncertainty and sensitivity data and methodologies, and ultimately supports decision-making about which missions and instruments to develop for a desired cost/benefit ratio. Initial results include fusion of remote-sensing techniques (e. g., radar and lidar), uncertainties associated with measurement and modeling, and the impact of potential uncertainty correlations across aggregated unit areas. Biomass uncertainty estimates are presented at the single-hectare level for the forestlands of California. Using a forest biomass map of California, we calculate changes in variance (e. g., 2 orders of magnitude) as a function of uncertainty correlation assumptions, with correlations extending to spatial scales up to 100 km. Using a variogram formalism to derive the correlation shape and magnitude, we show that the estimated variance for California above-ground biomass is between 1\% and 2\% (1 standard deviation) for our current best estimate of the correlation range at 5-10 km-i.e., we bound the standard deviation by a factor of 2. This contrasts with 0.025\% (1 standard deviation) if one does not include the correlation term.

6863091,"Multi-Decadal Assessment Of Soil Loss In A Mediterranean Region Characterized By Contrasting Local Climates","Soil erosion is one of the most widespread soil degradation phenomena worldwide. Mediterranean landscapes, due to some peculiar characteristics, such as fragility of soils, steep slopes, and rainfall distribution during the year, are particularly subject to this phenomenon, with severe and complex issues for agricultural production and biodiversity protection. In this paper, we present a diachronic approach to the analysis of soil loss, which aims to account for climate variability and land cover dynamics by using remote data about rainfall and land cover to guarantee sufficient observational continuity. The study area (Basilicata, Southern Italy) is characterized by different local climates and ecosystems (temperate, Csa and Csb; arid steppic, Bsk; and cold, Dsb and Dsc), and is particularly suited to represent the biogeographical complexity of the Mediterranean Italy. The well-known Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was applied by integrating information from remote sensing to carry out decadal assessments (1994, 2004, 2014, and 2021) of the annual soil loss. Changes in the rainfall regime and vegetation cover activity were derived from CHIRPS and Landsat data, respectively, to obtain updated information useful for dynamical studies. For the analyzed region, soil loss shows a slight reduction (albeit always remarkable) over the whole period, and distinct spatial patterns between lowland Bsk and Mediterranean mountain Dsb and Dsc climate areas. The most alarming fact is that most of the study area showed soil erosion rates in 2021 greater than 11 t/ha{*}y, which is considered by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) the threshold for identifying severe erosion phenomena. A final comparison with local studies shows, on average, differences of about 5 t ha(-1) y(-1) (minimum 2.5 and maximum 7) with respect to the local estimates obtained with the RUSLE model. The assessment at a regional scale provided an average 9.5\% of soil loss difference for the arable lands and about 10\% for all cultivated areas. The spatial-temporal patterns enhance the relevance of using the cover management factor C derived from satellite data rather than land cover maps, as remote observations are able to highlight the heterogeneity in vegetation density within the same vegetation cover class, which is particularly relevant for agricultural areas. For mountain areas, the adoption of a satellite-gridded rainfall dataset allowed the detection of erosion rate fluctuations due to rainfall variability, also in the case of sparse or absent ground pluviometric stations. The use of remote data represents a precious added value to obtain a dynamic picture of the spatial-temporal variability of soil loss and new insights into the sustainability of soil use in a region whose economy is mostly based on agriculture and the exploitation of natural resources.",2022,"{""Coluzzi, Rosa"",""Imbrenda, Vito"",""Lanfredi, Maria"",""Pace, Letizia"",""Samela, Caterina"",""Simoniello, Tiziana""}","article",NA,"10.3390/land11071010","{""notes"": ""('samela_multidecadalassessmentsoil_2022',)""}","{""probably not""}",2024-09-27 23:13:34,"included",NA,NA

In order to optimize the use of these technologies for precision viticulture, their technical, scientific and economic performances need to be assessed. The aim of this work is to compare NDVI surveys performed with UAV, aircraft and satellite, to assess the capability of each platform to represent the intra-vineyard vegetation spatial variability. NDVI images of two Italian vineyards were acquired simultaneously from different multi-spectral sensors onboard the three platforms, and a spatial statistical framework was used to assess their degree of similarity. Moreover, the pros and cons of each technique were also assessed performing a cost analysis as a function of the scale of application. Results indicate that the different platforms provide comparable results in vineyards characterized by coarse vegetation gradients and large vegetation clusters. On the contrary, in more heterogeneous vineyards, low-resolution images fail in representing part of the intra-vineyard variability.

7652533,"No Pixel Left Behind: Toward Integrating Earth Observations For Agriculture Into The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Framework","Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework.

The paper has two objectives: to demonstrate how several societal benefit frameworks work, and to highlight some of these benefits in the case of MISR. Such consideration of practical benefits is timely, as their realization is becoming a prominent objective of future space remote sensing activities. At least four groups of experts recommend that societal benefit serve as a heavily weighted criterion for prioritizing Earth science research opportunities. The National Academy of Sciences' forthcoming decadal survey for U.S. Earth science applications from space, the U.S. Climate Change Research Program, the framework for the international Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS), and the new world water program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) all argue that societal benefit should be a determining factor in selecting the next Earth-observing spacecraft missions and instruments.

In this study, the MOD13A2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation (P), MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST), MOD16A2 evapotranspiration (ET) and hydrological station data were used as data sources with which to estimate the monthly runoff through the application of a fully connected long short-term memory (LSTM) model in the upstream reach of the Heihe River basin in China from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that inputting multiple remote sensing parameters improved the quality of runoff estimation compared to the use of rain gauge observations; an increase in R-2 from 0.91 to 0.94 was observed from the implementation of this process, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) showed an improvement from 0.89 to 0.93. The incorporation of rain gauge data as well as satellite data provided a slight improvement in estimating runoff with a respective R-2 value of 0.95 and NSE value of 0.94.

7037465,"Integrative Geospatial Approaches For The Comprehensive Monitoring And Assessment Of Land Management Sustainability: Rationale, Potentials, And Characteristics","Sustainable dryland management seeks to improve the conditions of people and ecosystems affected by degradation, but it is often unclear which land management strategies work, which ones do not and why. Monitoring and assessment (M\&A) can support decision-making by providing this information. As implied by the 10-year Strategy of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), however, M\&A efforts have thus far been insufficient or inadequate. We argue that integrative geospatial approaches should be implemented to enhance dryland management decision-making. By assimilating and linking human and environmental data, qualitative and quantitative data, as well as field and remotely sensed data in a spatially explicit framework, such approaches facilitate assessments of both the complexities and place-specificities inherent to sustainability. In addition, they help represent different stakeholder perspectives, promote communication among scientists from diverse backgrounds as well as between scientific and local experts, facilitate inter-institutional knowledge sharing, and create synergy between the UNCCD and other Conventions. Due to these benefits as well as the rapid evolution and increasing availability and affordability of geospatial data and technologies in all countries, it is appropriate to begin capitalizing more fully on them now for the M\&A of land management sustainability. In order for integrative geospatial approaches to become more central to M\&A efforts, however, capacities and infrastructure must be improved and standards and protocols developed for the collection, analysis, and modeling of data, for the evaluation of outputs, and for the reporting of results.

The magnitude of events, who they impacted, and the degree to which the events were managed are all, very often, told through the lens of data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such data-driven history, where statistics on infections, death, vaccination, and average mobility are used to tell the story of how the pandemic unfolded in a given locale. While such statistical history is useful, it can also efface the histories of locations that lack access to the proper surveillance infrastructure, or are otherwise unable to deploy it. This produces an erasure of pandemic memory in healthcare-challenged areas, as deaths and infections go unrecorded and undocumented. This paper proposes the use of satellites to correct this, using Earth observation technologies to track viral vectors and find and document mass burial sites to produce a fuller picture of pandemic history, with an emphasis on filling the statistical gaps between the developed and developing world.",2022,"{""Gleason, Louis""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://ejournals.bc.edu/index.php/orac/article/view/15255","{}","{}",2024-04-28 00:56:38,"included",NA,NA

7037375,"Terrestrial And Orbital Spectral Models For The Determination Of Soil Attributes: Potential And Costs","The use of remote sensing techniques in soils studies is relatively new. Further research in this area should be made. The objective of this work was to estimate chemical and granulometric attributes of soil from Ibaté and São Carlos counties, State of São Paulo, through multiple and linear regression equations generated with reflected electromagnetic information collect by sensors installed in laboratory and satellite. An analysis of the economic viability of the sensor uses for quantifying soil attributes were carried out in comparison with the conventional method of soil analysis. It was collected and georeferenced 319 soil samples. The soil samples were evaluated by laboratory sensor (FielSpec) and orbital image (ASTER). Spectral prediction models were elaborated for both acquisition levels. The models were used to determine the attributes on unknown samples. It was possible to quantify some soil attributes, such as clay (R2 = 0.69) and sand (R2 = 0.53) content using the reflected electromagnetic energy measures by terrestrial sensor. The orbital sensor showed good results to predict coarse sand (R2 = 0.45) e total sand (R2 = 0.41). It was verified that the attribute analysis by sensors can be cheaper and faster to assist the traditional method of soil analysis.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1590/s0006-87052011000300017","{""notes"": ""('sousajunior_terrestrialorbitalspectralmodels_2011',)""}","{}",2024-12-21 20:45:20,"included",NA,NA

Here we train deep learning models to predict survey-based estimates of asset wealth across similar to 20,000 African villages from publicly-available multispectral satellite imagery. Models can explain 70\% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries where the model was not trained, outperforming previous benchmarks from high-resolution imagery, and comparison with independent wealth measurements from censuses suggests that errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Satellite-based estimates can also explain up to 50\% of the variation in district-aggregated changes in wealth over time, with daytime imagery particularly useful in this task.

7036878,"Remote Sensing For The Study, Protection And Conservation Of Cultural Heritage: The Experience Of Itaca Mission In Southern America (2007-2013)","The importance of applying remote sensing to archaeological research has been paid great attention worldwide, due to the following aspects: (i) the improvement in spectral and spatial resolution reveals increasing detailed information for the detection of archaeological features; (ii) the development of remote sensing data processing approaches in the context of GIS help us to manage the complexity of archaeological investigations at a variety of different scales; (iii) the availability of different sensors available for remote sensing activities (LiDAR, SAR, optical, georadar, geomagnetometry, etc.) allows to obtain several information for different purposes, from site detection to documentation up to risk analysis. Moreover, archaeologists are ever more aware of the benefits of remote sensing applications for their investigations, such as: i) maps and profiles of existing and potential sites without extensive excavation; ii) reduction of costs, time and risk associated with archaeological excavation; iii) creation of site strategies, conservation, preservation; iv) assessment of the integrity of historical structures useful for their conservation. The result is the development of a scientific culture based on the interdisciplinarity and integration of knowledge, essential for applications in the field of cultural heritage. An example of such culture is the Italian heritage Conservation and Archaeo-geophysics (ITACA) Mission. It applies different scientific methodologies which rely on the most advanced Earth Observation technologies, to contribute to the study of the pre-Columbian civilizations and the cultural heritage conservation and management in Southern America.

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide regular and accurate observations of the entire planet that can greatly support improvements in such understanding. The European Space Agency (ESA) is committed to supporting international efforts to decipher the processes and phenomena that regulate life on Earth, by building world class EO space missions and making data available to scientists and citizens across the world. How successful is ESA in this endeavour? Given the variable and dynamic nature of EO data use, it is difficult to answer the question through established figures. Yet, it is crucial that ESA be able to discriminate and assess the benefits brought by the use of its EO missions, in order to demonstrate its achievements, to keep improving its systems, to better design and plan future missions, and to promote further uptake. In this article, after recalling its commitments in support of Earth system sciences, ESA’s attempts to conduct valuations of the impact of its own space missions are described. In particular, the challenges encountered in measuring such impacts and the solutions pursued by the Agency to improve its assessment capabilities are detailed, together with the open issues and the current lines of work.",2022,"{""Tassa, Alessandra""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.788843","{}","{}",2024-04-26 22:55:59,"included",NA,NA
7037497,"Comparison Of Rs/Gis Analysis With Classic Mapping Approaches For Siting Low-Yield Boreholes For Hand Pumps In Crystalline Terrains. An Application To Rural Communities Of The Caimbambo Province, Angola","In poverty-stricken regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, groundwater for supply is often obtained by means of hand pumps, which means that low-yield boreholes are acceptable. However, boreholes are often sited without sufficient hydrogeological information due to budget constraints, which leads to high failure rates. Cost-effective techniques for borehole siting need to be developed in order to maximize the success rate. In regions underlain by granite, weathered formations are usually targeted for drilling, as these are generally presented as a better cost-benefit ratio than the fractured basement. Within this context, this research focuses on a granite region of Angola. A comparison of two mapping techniques for borehole siting-groundwater prospect is presented. A classic hydrogeomorphological map was developed first based on aerial photographs, field mapping and a geophysical survey. This map represents a considerable time investment and was developed by qualified technicians. The second map (RS/GIS) is considerably simpler and more cost-effective. It was developed by the integration in a GIS platform of six maps of equal importance-slope, drainage density, vegetation vigor, presence of clay in the soil, lineaments and rock outcrops-prepared from Landsat 8 imagery and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Similar results were obtained in both cases. By means of a supervised classification of Landsat images, RS/GIS analysis allows for the identification of granitic outcrops, house clusters and sandy alluvial valleys. This in turn allows for the delineation of low-interest or contamination-prone areas, thus contributing additional qualitative information. The position of a well that is going to be powered by a handpump is chosen also upon social and local matters as the distance to the stakeholders, information that are not difficult to integrate in the GIS. Although the second map needs some field inputs (i.e. surveys to determine the thickness of the weathered pack), results show that RS/GIS analyses such as this one provide a valuable and cost-effective alternative for siting low-yield boreholes in remote regions.

7038393,"Sebu: A Novel Fully Automated Google Earth Engine Surface Energy Balance Model For Urban Areas","Understanding the diverse energy exchange within the city's boundaries would enable better design of future urban planning and environmental policies and update current ones. More importantly, it would facilitate the establishment of smart cities, where human health and wellbeing is a top priority. In this regard, several energy balance models have been proposed for urban areas. Only recently, remote sensing images have been extensively used in these areas, but are still difficult to implement due to the large inputs' sources and types required as well as their complexity. Their accuracy can also be improved. Thus, in this paper, the Surface Energy Balance Model for Urban areas (SEBU) is proposed based on the 100-m Landsat images. It uses other sources as well such as Sentinel-1, MODIS and ERA5. SEBU is based on the innovative hot/cold pixels approach widely known in the agricultural-based models, but also includes several dynamic internal calibrations. It generates monthly turbulent sensible (Qh) and latent (Qe) heat values over a 100-m spatial resolution. When applied over seven different regions (i.e., Denver, New Hampshire, Basel, Heraklion, Singapore, Phoenix and Vancouver) in four contrasting climates (i.e., cold, arid, warm and equatorial) and when compared to local flux tower measurements, absolute mean error varied between 6.13 W m(-2) month-1 for Qe and 14.46 W m(-2) month(-1) for Qh. More importantly, the novelty of SEBU does not lie only in providing reliable accuracy and full reliance on the remote sensing database, but also on its open-source nature and easy-accessibility over the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Thus, SEBU has the potential to be scalable using the massive power and huge database found in GEE, where users need to specify the required date only. This would certainly assist researchers to access urban cilmate information in a timely manner. Policy makers and even local dwellers would then benefit from their findings. Furthermore, SEBU can be improved to accommodate current and future needs of its users, while ultimately, enhancing the urban surface energy models and related science.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.uclim.2022.101187","{""notes"": ""('abunnasr_sebuautomatedgoogleearth_2022',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 01:58:06,"included",NA,NA
6862764,"Integrating Drone Imagery With Existing Rangeland Monitoring Programs","The recent availability of small and low-cost sensor carrying unmanned aerial systems (UAS, commonly known as drones) coupled with advances in image processing software (i.e., structure from motion photogrammetry) has made drone-collected imagery a potentially valuable tool for rangeland inventory and monitoring. Drone-imagery methods can observe larger extents to estimate indicators at landscape scales with higher confidence than traditional field sampling. They also have the potential to replace field methods in some instances and enable the development of indicators not measurable from the ground. Much research has already demonstrated that several quantitative rangeland indicators can be estimated from high-resolution imagery. Developing a suite of monitoring methods that are useful for supporting management decisions (e.g., repeatable, cost-effective, and validated against field methods) will require additional exploration to develop best practices for image acquisition and analytical workflows that can efficiently estimate multiple indicators. We embedded with a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field monitoring crew in Northern California, USA to compare field-measured and imagery-derived indicator values and to evaluate the logistics of using small UAS within the framework of an existing monitoring program. The unified workflow we developed to measure fractional cover, canopy gaps, and vegetation height was specific for the sagebrush steppe, an ecosystem that is common in other BLM managed lands. The correspondence between imagery and field methods yielded encouraging agreement while revealing systematic differences between the methods. Workflow best practices for producing repeatable rangeland indicators is likely to vary by vegetation composition and phenology. An online space dedicated to sharing imagery-based workflows could spur collaboration among researchers and quicken the pace of integrating drone-imagery data within adaptive management of rangelands. Though drone-imagery methods are not likely to replace most field methods in large monitoring programs, they could be a valuable enhancement for pressing local management needs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,"{""Gillan, J.

7037756,"Data Assimilation Of Volcanic Aerosol Observations Using Fall3d+Pdaf","Modelling atmospheric dispersal of volcanic ash and aerosols is becoming increasingly valuable for assessing the potential impacts of explosive volcanic eruptions on buildings, air quality, and aviation. Management of volcanic risk and reduction of aviation impacts can strongly benefit from quantitative forecasting of volcanic ash. However, an accurate prediction of volcanic aerosol concentrations using numerical modelling relies on proper estimations of multiple model parameters which are prone to errors. Uncertainties in key parameters such as eruption column height and physical properties of particles or meteorological fields represent a major source of error affecting the forecast quality. The availability of near-real-time geostationary satellite observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions provides the opportunity to improve forecasts in an operational context by incorporating observations into numerical models. Specifically, ensemble-based filters aim at converting a prior ensemble of system states into an analysis ensemble by assimilating a set of noisy observations. Previous studies dealing with volcanic ash transport have demonstrated that a significant improvement of forecast skill can be achieved by this approach. In this work, we present a new implementation of an ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) method coupling the FALL3D dispersal model and the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF). The FALL3D+PDAF system runs in parallel, supports online-coupled DA, and can be efficiently integrated into operational workflows by exploiting high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Two numerical experiments are considered: (i) a twin experiment using an incomplete dataset of synthetic observations of volcanic ash and (ii) an experiment based on the 2019 Raikoke eruption using real observations of SO2 mass loading. An ensemble-based Kalman filtering technique based on the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is used to assimilate satellite-retrieved data of column mass loading. We show that this procedure may lead to nonphysical solutions and, consequently, conclude that LETKF is not the best approach for the assimilation of volcanic aerosols. However, we find that a truncated state constructed from the LETKF solution approaches the real solution after a few assimilation cycles, yielding a dramatic improvement of forecast quality when compared to simulations without assimilation.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.5194/acp-22-1773-2022","{""notes"": ""('mingari_dataassimilationvolcanicaerosol_2022',)""}","{maybe}",2024-12-19 18:47:53,"included",NA,NA
7036873,"Artisanal Exploitation Of Mineral Resources: Remote Sensing Observations Of Environmental Consequences, Social And Ethical Aspects","Since the rise of the gold price in 2000, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a growing economic activity in developing countries. It represents a source of income for several millions of people in West Africa. Exploitation techniques have evolved from traditional gold panning to mechanization and use of chemical products that are harmful for the environment. Government strategies to control and regulate this activity are impeded by the difficulties to collect spatial information, due to the remote location and the mobile and informal natural of ASGM. Here we present and discuss the value of remote sensing techniques to complement the knowledge on artisanal mining impacts, including for detection of illegal sites, the evaluation of the degradation of soils and waters, the deforestation and the monitoring of expansion of ASGM with time. However, these techniques are blind regarding gender issues, labor relations, mobility, migration, and insecurity and need to be considered with knowledges from other disciplines. Remote sensing is also instilled with various powers accruing to those enabled to produce and interpret these data.

7036684,"Possibilities Of The Practical Application Of Remote Sensing Data In Real Property Appraisal","In the process of real estate evaluation, there are many important elements that should be taken into consideration: for example the type of property which is under evaluation, real estate market analysis, and the selection of appropriate evaluation approaches, methods and techniques. In each of the approaches, different parameters are important. Most importantly, however, is the appropriate selection and identification of real estate characteristics, both physical and economic, as well as the determination of the importance of these qualities so that, when necessary, it will be possible to make the appraisal and select those characteristics which have the greatest impact on value of property. To acquire information about real estate, one can analyze data from multiple sources of information, such as: the land and mortgage register, land and buildings register, local town and country planning, industry data and other. Integrating data from all these sources allows comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge on the assessed property to be developed. One of best sources of data describing the characteristics of real estate is remote sensing. This method offers a high spectrum of information and, therefore, allows a wide range of analyses. As a result, one can obtain highly accurate facts about the property. Remote sensing data, however, are not a panacea for all problems and have some limitations that determine their applicability. This paper describes the possibilities of specifying some characteristics of the property under appraisal based on remote sensing data. For this purpose, the qualitative - quantitative analysis of the four most ""common"" types of remote sensing data were made, along with determining selected characteristics of 30 properties located in the Warsaw - Bemowo suburb area. The results of this research made it possible to answer the question of whether it is practicable and, if so, to what extent, to use remotely sensed data as the basis for determining the characteristics of a property as well as connecting the types of data to individual properties.

6863076,"Satellite Sensors And Retrieval Algorithms Of Atmospheric Methane","Significance Global climate governance and greenhouse gas emission reduction are of great urgency. The volume fraction of atmospheric methane (CH4) has been rising continuously since the industrial revolution and is now averaging about 1895.7x10(-9) globally. In addition, since the global warming potential of CH4 is about 27-30 times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), the monitoring of atmospheric CH4 becomes the focus and hotspot of carbon emission reduction. Satellite remote sensing features fast detection speed, wide coverage, and rich information. It can conduct continuous and stable observations of atmospheric CH4 with high temporal and spatial resolution and high precision on a global scale and can provide verification and support for the ""bottom-up"" emission inventory. Relying on the rapid development of satellite detection technology and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a large number of satellites with CH4 detection capabilities have emerged in the past two decades. The detection technology has become more mature with increasingly higher detection accuracy. Additionally, corresponding algorithms of various satellite sensors have also made a huge leap forward. Rapid advances in both sensors and algorithms enable us to better monitor the temporal and spatial variability of atmospheric CH4 and its impact on climate change. With the purpose to promote the further development of CH4 satellite remote sensing and retrieval research and realize the dual carbon target, it is necessary to summarize and discuss the existing research progress and future development trends, which can provide scientific and technological support for China's low-carbon sustainable development. Progress Firstly, the development of atmospheric CH4 satellites and sensors is reviewed and introduced. Early sensors mainly rely on the thermal infrared band of about 8 mu m for CH4 detection, and typical representatives include IMG, AIRS, and IASI (Table 1). Subsequently, a series of passive short-wave infrared sensors represented by SCIAMACHY, TANSO-FTS, and TROPOMI are developed. They rely on CH4 characteristic bands near 1.6 mu m and 2.3 mu m for detection and are more sensitive to changes in near-surface CH4 concentration. Among them, the high-resolution imaging spectral sensors and platforms represented by GHGSat, AHSI, and MethaneSAT also take advantage of their high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution to monitor the CH4 point source emissions. There is no doubt that new energy is injected into the development of CH4 satellite remote sensing (Table 2). In recent years, active detection represented by the methane remote sensing lidar mission (MERLIN) has also developed rapidly, effectively making up for the shortcomings of passive remote sensing detection with improved detection efficiency. Subsequently, the principles, application conditions, and retrieval accuracy of different sensor algorithms are summarized. From the early DOAS algorithm, proxy algorithm, and PPDF algorithm, to the most commonly employed full-physical algorithm with the highest precision at this stage, the physical algorithms have been continuously improved with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. The full-physical algorithms represented by NIES-FP, UoL-FP, RemoTeC, RemoTAP, IAPCAS, and FOCAL have an accuracy of 6x10(-9). At the same time, with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence, various new algorithms, such as neural network algorithms, are also emerging, which can almost complete the real-time retrieval of CH4. These methods have also brought breakthroughs to CH4 retrieval. Conclusions and Prospects In the future, CH4 detection satellite sensors will continue to develop toward the goal of high temporal and spatial resolution, high precision, high accuracy, and continuous observation. Many high- performance satellites such as MethaneSAT, Sentinel-5, and CO2M are under planning (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the construction of the satellite network should be stepped up to meet the demands of CH4 global high-precision detection. Correspondingly, new requirements are put forward for the accuracy, coverage, and calculation speed of CH4 observation data and retrieval products. For the most accurate full- physical algorithm at present, the adoption of more accurate forward radiative transfer models and prior information, collaborative retrieval and correction of clouds and aerosols, and multi-satellite joint retrieval and verification are all important means for algorithm improvement. With the accelerated global climate governance and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, more and more countries have formulated and implemented a series of CH4 emission reduction measures, and China has also proposed the dual carbon target, which is steadily advancing. However, the issues of climate governance and carbon emissions are very complex, and to some extent have even become the focus of competition among countries. In this context, the development of China's atmospheric CH4 satellite remote sensing cannot be slackened and should be highly valued and vigorously developed to seize opportunities. China has deployed the launch of the next-generation carbon satellite task, which will implement the main passive observation, and significantly broaden the range of detection time and space. Finally, the spatial and temporal resolution is improved to promote an effective amount of data and realize the full range of high-precision detection, thus providing a solid foundation and strong support for realizing a dual carbon target.",2023,"{""Fan Cheng"",""Gu Haoran"",""Han Yinghui"",""He Zhuo"",""Li Zhengqiang"",""Ma Jinji"",""Qin Kai"",""Shi Zheng"",""Xu Wenbin"",""Zhang Hao"",""Zhang Ying"",""Zhang Yuanxun"",""Zheng Yang"",""Zhu Jun"",""Zuo Jinhui""}","article",NA,"10.3788/aos230429","{""notes"": ""('hezhuoandlizhengqiangandfanchengandzhangyingandshizhengandzhengyangandguhaoranandmajinjiandzuojinhuiandhanyinghuiandzhangyuanxunandqinkaiandzhanghaoandxuwenbinandzhujun_satellitesensorsretrievalalgorithms_2023',)""}","{}",2024-07-13 00:11:04,"included",NA,NA

One is information overload. As the spatial resolution of imagery increases to allow the identification of the individual components of urban form (street-blocks, buildings, gardens etc.), image interpretation (classifications into land-use categories or estimation of dwelling units) becomes less accurate. One answer is to adopt interpretation methods that use the increased information in a more detailed scene.

7037324,"The Economics Of Atmosphere Monitoring Systems: Theory And Applications","In recent years there has been increasing concern with the possibility that man's terrestrial economic activities of production, distribution, and consumption contribute pollutants to the environment in sufficient quantities to upset naturally existing chemical equilibria in the atmosphere. Such inadvertent anthropogenic phenomena have become associated with possible changes in climate (temperature, precipitation, and ultraviolet radiation) whose long term consequences may be serious, if not disastrous. Among other societal reactions to this problem, proposals for various environment monitoring systems have been proffered. Such systems, often envisioned as satellite-based, are costly and their benefits often appear largely intangible. In this research we develop a general methodology for identifying and estimating the economic benefits of environment monitoring systems, and we apply the methodology to the cases of stratospheric ozone depletion and aerosol accumulation. The research synthesizes numerous recent efforts in atmospheric chemistry, climatology, engineering, policy analysis, and primarily economic cost benefit analysis.

Scientists who are designing the satellite observing system, those who are developing mission data products, and the community who will use them need to work together to determine how satellite data can better inform decision making. NASA is working to initiate engagement with data users much earlier in the satellite program life so that the user needs can be prioritized, continue to engage with users throughout the development cycle, and then include analysis on societal impact after nominal mission life. The Early Adopter Program allows for broad and early engagement with decision makers by encouraging individuals and institutions with clear uses of data to engage with the mission. Early adopters facilitate feedback on mission products during pre-launch and accelerate the utilization of these products post-launch.

7037697,"Potential Of Npp-Viirs Nighttime Light Imagery For Modeling The Regional Economy Of China","Historically, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) was the unique satellite sensor used to collect the nighttime light, which is an efficient means to map the global economic activities. Since it was launched in October 2011, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite has become a new satellite used to monitor nighttime light. This study performed the first evaluation on the NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery in modeling economy, analyzing 31 provincial regions and 393 county regions in China. For each region, the total nighttime light (TNL) and gross regional product (GRP) around the year of 2010 were derived, and a linear regression model was applied on the data. Through the regression, the TNL from NPP-VIIRS were found to exhibit R2 values of 0.8699 and 0.8544 with the provincial GRP and county GRP, respectively, which are significantly stronger than the relationship between the TNL from DMSP-OLS (F16 and F18 satellites) and GRP. Using the regression models, the GRP was predicted from the TNL for each region, and we found that the NPP-VIIRS data is more predictable for the GRP than those of the DMSP-OLS data. This study demonstrates that the recently released NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery has a stronger capacity in modeling regional economy than those of the DMSP-OLS data. These findings provide a foundation to model the global and regional economy with the recently availability of the NPP-VIIRS data, especially in the regions where economic census data is difficult to access. © 2013 by the authors.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs5063057","{""notes"": ""('li_potentialnppviirsnighttime_2013',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:09:01,"included",NA,NA

7038205,"The Value Of Rapid Damage Assessment For Efficient Earthquake Response","Every year earthquakes cause substantial economic losses and loss of life in many parts of the world. Earth observations may provide valuable information on spatial damage distribution and through that increase the efficiency of rapid response actions, finally resulting in reduction of earthquake induced losses. However, a methodology for quantitative assessment of the potential value of information in such a context has not yet been developed. That knowledge would be of high importance for planning and development of Earth observation systems on both regional and international levels when aiming at sustainable development goals. In this paper we suggest a stochastic modeling approach to assess the value of information for earthquake rapid response. Our analysis is focused on a rather short time interval after an earthquake occurrence (order of several hours) when there is a maximum need for urgent help to the earthquake victims. We use rescue efficiency as a performance measure of earthquake response actions; this efficiency is described in terms of timely arrival of rescue teams at places, where their help is mostly needed. We quantify the benefit of using spatial damage distribution information in terms of cost reduction/rescue efficiency gains. We intentionally conduct our analysis at a methodological level and do not go deeper into case studies to keep general conclusions traceable. The modeling exercise we present in the paper is a first step towards a more detailed and integrated approach that could contribute to better systematic understanding of earthquake response actions and ultimately improve their efficiency.

7038184,"Advances In Precision Agriculture In South-Eastern Australia. I. A Regression Methodology To Simulate Spatial Variation In Cereal Yields Using Farmers' Historical Paddock Yields And Normalised Difference Vegetation Index","Despite considerable interest by Australian farmers in precision agriculture (PA), its uptake has been low. Analysis of the possible financial benefits of alternative management options that are based on the underlying patterns of observed spatial and temporal yield variability in a paddock could increase farmer confidence in adopting PA. The cost and difficulty in collecting harvester yield maps have meant that spatial yield data are generally not available in Australia. This study proposes a simple, economical and easy to use approach to generate simulated yield maps by using paddock-specific relationships between satellite normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the farmer's average paddock yield records. The concept behind the approach is illustrated using a limited dataset. For each of 12 paddocks in a property where a farmer's paddock-level yield data were available for 3-5 years, the paddock-level yields showed a close to linear relationship with paddock-level NDVI across seasons. This estimated linear relationship for each paddock was used to simulate mean yields for the paddock at the subpaddock level at which NDVI data were available. For one paddock of 167 ha, for which 4 years of harvester yield data and 6 years of NDVI data were available, the map of simulated mean yield was compared with the map of harvester mean yield. The difference between the two maps, expressed as percentage deviation from the observed mean yield, was <20\% for 63\% of the paddock and <40\% for 78\% of the paddock area. For 3 seasons when there were both harvester yield data and NDVI data, the individual season simulated yields were within 30\% of the observed yields for over 70\% of the paddock area in 2 of the seasons, which is comparable with spatial crop modelling results reported elsewhere. For the third season, simulated yields were within 30\% of the observed yield in only 22\% of the paddock, but poor seasonal conditions meant that 40\% of the paddock yielded <100 kg/ha. To illustrate the type of financial analysis of alternative management options that could be undertaken using the simulated yield data, a simple economic analysis comparing uniform v. variable rate nitrogen fertiliser is reported. This indicated that the benefits of using variable rate technology varied considerably between paddocks, depending on the degree of spatial yield variability. The proposed simulated yield mapping requires greater validation with larger datasets and a wider range of sites, but potentially offers growers and land managers a rapid and cost-effective tool for the initial estimation of subpaddock yield variability. Such maps could provide growers with the information necessary to carry out on-farm testing of the potential benefits of using variable applications of agronomic inputs, and to evaluate the financial benefits of greater investment in PA technology.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1071/cp08347","{""notes"": ""('fisher_advancesprecisionagriculturesouth_2009',)""}","{}",2024-12-14 22:27:34,"included",NA,NA
6862826,"Where's Woolly? An Integrative Use Of Remote Sensing To Improve Predictions Of The Spatial Distribution Of An Invasive Forest Pest The Hemlock Woolly Adelgid","Non-native pests and pathogens present serious challenges to the management of forested ecosystems around the world. Early detection of pest and pathogen invasions may allow timely control and prevention methods to be implemented. Species distribution models (SDMs) and remote sensing (RS) methods have both been used effectively to determine locations of pest and pathogen damage. However, previous work integrating these two methods has rarely used RS metrics that have biological meaning. We use RS difference indices that show changes in forest cover from defoliation in order to map Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, locations using MaxEnt in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DWGNRA). Brightness, greenness, wetness, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images for December 1982 and 2010. A difference for each index was created by subtracting the 1982 value from the 2010 value. We compared two models, one using difference indices and the other using 2010 indices along with other ancillary data layers, to determine if the more complicated but more biologically relevant difference indices were necessary for improved model performance. Variables with low importance were removed from both models, leaving NDVI, Wetness, soil, and elevation in the two final models. The difference model had an improvement in accuracy of three percent, across a number of threshold values. Despite this small difference in accuracy, however, the infected area predicted by the difference model (5.1\% of total area) was approximately 1/2 of that predicted by the single year model (9.6\% of total area). These results suggest that using remote sensing difference indices improves model accuracy slightly in terms of errors of omission, but also decreases predicted area of forest infestation by about 50\%, suggesting that errors of commission would be substantially reduced using the difference approach. This method can provide forest managers more accurate information on the best locations to sample and treat. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

7037928,"Eo Products For Drought Risk Reduction","Drought risk reduction strategies, with enhanced focus on preparedness, mitigation and warning, are truly knowledge intensive. Their implementation demands scientific inputs on all the aspects related to drought vulnerability, which are quite dynamic, difficult to capture and also complex. While Earth Observation (EO) information products and services do have enabling roles in addressing some of these demands, the issue is their integration as a part of the national strategy towards drought risk reduction. In efforts to promote principles of risk management by encouraging development of early warning systems; preparedness plans at all government levels; mitigation policies and programmes that reduce drought impacts; a coordinated emergency response programme that ensures timely and targeted relief during drought emergencies, use of EO enabled products and services has been found making impacts, whenever they have been used strategically. Although, drought risk reduction strategies are more specific and vary between countries, reflecting their unique physical, environmental, socioeconomic, and political characteristics, the generic EO information products and services have been contextualized accordingly through appropriate value addition and with the participation of the end users. Further, disseminating EO products and services through web have brought in newer challenges. The products and services of coarseresolution EO payloads have reached to the end users in many parts of the world, including India. However, technically these services cannot be extended beyond the early warning and broad level qualitative drought assessment and monitoring, while the real strength of EO lies in its applications towards mitigation and preparedness. The operationally demonstrated products and services, closer to community action and their enhanced coping mechanisms, need to be promoted. Access to high-resolution multi-spectral (to the extent of 20 m spatial resolution) EO products is an important information empowerment towards drought mitigation. Institutional infrastructure, especially basic national systems and services, is to be positioned strategically to absorb and recast, as per the local requirements, the products and services increasingly becoming available from the global/regional EO missions. Funding of drought risk is yet another emerging area wherein financial institutions especially insurance and banking sectors have interests, while high resolution multi-spectral imaging has a role to bring out in-season crop and weather statistics. A public private partnership could be built on such issues of common interest. Community based drought management, synergizing the indigenous coping mechanisms, local wisdom and technological means, is the ultimate to achieve. The paper spells out all these perspectives, while advocating the overall interest of developing countries in using EO products as a strategy towards drought risk reduction. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/978-1-4020-9573-3_15","{""notes"": ""('srivastava_eoproductsdroughtrisk_2009',)""}","{}",2024-12-14 23:50:10,"included",NA,NA

The development of deep learning techniques has brought new opportunities and methods for long-term hydrological simulation research at the watershed scale. Different from traditional hydrological models, the application of deep learning techniques in the hydrological field has greatly promoted the development trend of runoff prediction and provides a new paradigm for hydrological simulation. In this study, a CNN-LSTM model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a CNN-GRU model based on CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRN) are constructed to study the watershed hydrological processes. To compare the performance of deep learning techniques and the hydrological model, we also constructed the distributed hydrological model: Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model based on remote sensing data. These models were applied to the Xixian Basin, and the promising results had been achieved, which verified the rationality of the method, with the majority of percent bias error (PBE) values ranging between 3.17 and 13.48, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.63 and 0.91, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.70 and 0.90 on a monthly scale. The results demonstrated their strong ability to learn complex hydrological processes. The results also indicated that the proposed deep learning models could provide the certain decision support for the water environment management at the watershed scale, which was of great significance to improve the hydrological disaster prediction ability and was conducive to the sustainable development of water resources.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/feart.2022.875145","{""notes"": ""('xu_comprehensiveanalysistermhydrological_2022',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:19:59,"included",NA,NA

It is now possible, via satellite observations, to obtain a synoptic view of ecosystems at spatial and temporal resolutions that are more detailed, locally relevant, and consistent from village to global scales. However, to make geospatial data and technologies work for conservation, we still need to understand how data turn into actionable information and conservation decisions.

It focuses on how Earth Observation data and associated technologies enabled and benefitted from the creation of research-implementation spaces in which stakeholders were able to collaborate and interact with geospatial data and results in a diversity of ways.

6863101,"On The Future Of Argo: A Global, Full-Depth, Multi-Disciplinary Array","The Argo Program has been implemented and sustained for almost two decades, as a global array of about 4000 profiling floats. Argo provides continuous observations of ocean temperature and salinity versus pressure, from the sea surface to 2000 dbar. The successful installation of the Argo array and its innovative data management system arose opportunistically from the combination of great scientific need and technological innovation. Through the data system, Argo provides fundamental physical observations with broad societally-valuable applications, built on the cost-efficient and robust technologies of autonomous profiling floats. Following recent advances in platform and sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years ago to (i) improve Argo's global coverage and value beyond the original design, (ii) extend Argo to span the full ocean depth, (iii) add biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding of oceanic cycles of carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and each of these enhancements, the past, present, and future progression along a path from experimental deployments to regional pilot arrays to global implementation is described. The objective is to create a fully global, top-to-bottom, dynamically complete, and multidisciplinary Argo Program that will integrate seamlessly with satellite and with other in situ elements of the Global Ocean Observing System (Legler et al., 2015). The integrated system will deliver operational reanalysis and forecasting capability, and assessment of the state and variability of the climate system with respect to physical, biogeochemical, and ecosystems parameters.

However, the influence of increased accuracy and cost-efficiency on simulations of forest management planning has not been evaluated. The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of data acquisition accuracy on standwise forest inventory by comparing the accuracy and cost of traditional compartmentwise inventory methods with 2D and 3D measurements of digital aerial photographs and airborne laser scanning. Comparison was based on the expected net present value (NPV), i.e. economic losses that consisted of the inventory costs and incorrect timings of treatments. The reference data, totalling 700 ha, were measured from Central Park in the city of Helsinki, Finland. The data were simulated to final cut with a MOTTI simulator, which is a stand-level analysis tool that call be used to assess the effects of alternative forest management practices on growth and timber yield. The results showed that when inventory costs were not considered there were no significant differences between the expected NPV losses in 3D measurements of digital aerial photographs, laser scanning and the compartmentwise method. When inventory costs were taken into account, the compartmentwise method was still the most efficient inventory method in the study area. Forest inventories, however, are usually directed to larger areas when the costs per hectare of remote-sensing methods decrease. As a result of better accuracies, 3D and compartmentwise methods always produce better results than the 2D method when NPV losses are accounted. Simulations of this type are based on the accuracies and costs of the 3D data available today, assuming that the data can be used in tree-level measurements.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.14214/sf.335","{""notes"": ""('holopainen_effectdataacquisitionaccuracy_2006',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 22:48:21,"included",NA,NA

This paper quantifies the spatial coverage represented by a finite set of monitoring stations by using global data-data that are possibly of lower resolution and quality. For illustration purposes, merged satellite temperature data from Microwave Sounding Units are used to estimate the representativeness of the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN). While many metrics exist for evaluating the representativeness of a site, the ability to have highly accurate monthly averaged data is essential for both trend detection and climatology evaluation. The calculated correlations of the monthly averaged upper-troposphere satellite-derived temperatures over the GRUAN stations with all other pixels around the globe show that the current 9 certified GRUAN stations have moderate correlations (r >= 0.7) for approximately 10\% of the earth, but an expanded network incorporating another 15 stations would result in moderate correlations for just over 60\% of the earth. This analysis indicates that the value of additional stations can be quantified by using historical, satellite, or model data and can be used to reveal critical gaps in current monitoring capabilities. Evaluating the value of potential additional stations and prioritizing their initiation can optimize networks. The expansion of networks can be evaluated in a manner that allows for optimal benefit on the basis of optimization theory and economic analyses.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/jamc-d-17-0040.1","{""notes"": ""('weatherhead_spatialcoveragemonitoringnetworks_2017',)""}","{""probably not""}",2024-09-27 22:39:09,"included",NA,NA

We also find large areas in the Southern United States and sporadic watersheds in the Northeast and Northwest seaboards and the Midwest would likely benefit most from using remote sensing for watershed monitoring.

7037894,"Production, Property, And The Construction Of Remotely Sensed Data","Remote sensing, particularly satellite imaging, is widely used in scientific, government, and public applications. One of the reasons it is so highly valued is the perception of its fundamental objectivity and neutrality. Yet like all data, satellite imagery is a product of human action. Elements such as specific technologies, strategic priorities, and privileged interpretations influence the availability and applications of remotely sensed data. We therefore argue that careful examination of the epistemological, social, and political dimensions of these data is a crucial, yet relatively underdeveloped task, especially in the scientific literature. We conduct such an examination through the property regimes (or property rights regimes) framework developed by Schlager and Ostrom. Property regimes are the arrangements by which rights over particular goods are allocated, as well as the roles to which these rights are assigned and the rules that regulate this process. This framework is especially useful in revealing the large contextual variation in the production, use, and appropriation of particular goods, in this case remotely sensed data. Understanding remotely sensed data through the property regimes that govern them emphasizes the political and economic dimensions of this valuable resource and reveals its embeddedness in the world it intends to capture from afar. Thus, we show that to have a better grasp on the role of remotely sensed data in science, policy, and society, users must acknowledge the property regimes and other political interventions that are here shown to be indeed fundamental to their construction. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/24694452.2017.1293498","{""notes"": ""('alvarezleon_productionpropertyconstructionremotely_2017',)""}","{""schlager ostrom!""}",2024-12-16 22:53:51,"included",NA,NA
6691514,"Geographic microtargeting of social assistance with high-resolution poverty maps","Hundreds of millions of poor families receive some form of targeted social assistance. Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning–based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning–based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",2022,"{""Smythe, Isabella""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120025119","{}","{}",2024-04-26 19:08:16,"included",NA,NA
7038561,"Comparison Of Multi-Source Satellite Data For Quantifying Water Quality Parameters In A Mining Environment","Population growth and associated anthropogenic activities such as mining are posing a major threat to water resources. Remote sensing provides valuable information for assessing and monitoring water quality and quantity, and thus supports sustainable water management. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of various remote sensing techniques for quantifying water quality parameters, however, more needs to be done to exploit the growing number of satellite sensors available to the public. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performances of individual and combined bands of Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, ASTER and SPOT 6 data as predictors of water quality parameters of open water bodies in a mining area. We applied the all-subsets regression approach to explore all possible candidate models from which selection was made based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), coefficient of determination (adjR2) and Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE). Two secondary objectives that make use of the products of the all-subsets regression approach were added in the study. This included comparison of a parsimonious model containing few predictors with the model that was ranked the best but containing more predictors; and comparison of models consisting of similar bands across sensors per water quality parameter. In general, all sensors yielded promising estimation accuracies, particularly for SAR, permanent hardness and cations (RMSE < 50\% of observed means). Sentinel-2 bands produced the best estimations followed by Landsat 8 bands for most water quality parameters, chiefly due to the greater number of bands these sensors possess compared to ASTER and SPOT 6 sensors. All sensors provided alternative models that used fewer predicting bands than the best-ranked models (lowest AIC) and still showed comparable accuracies with the lowest AIC models for most variables (Pearson's correlation, r up to 0.9). Sentinel-2, in particular, had the most accurate, parsimonious models compared to the other sensors. Pairwise cross-sensor comparison of estimation models using similar bands revealed the best matches when a model consisted of blue band only (r > 0.95) for most parameters while the similarity decreased as the number of predicting bands increased. Furthermore, the best similarities were obtained between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors compared to the other pairs, indicating the potential of replacing one in the absence of the other. The findings of this study showed the advantage of commonly used remotely-sensed data for estimating, and by extension monitoring, water quality parameters in open water bodies. In addition, the results revealed that few, specific bands carry information relevant to characterise most of the water quality parameters considered in the study. We recommend similar studies for different seasons, considering the need to monitor water quality throughout the year.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125322","{""notes"": ""('modiegi_comparisonmultisourcesatellite_2020',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 19:24:35,"included",NA,NA
7038396,"Uptake And Barriers To The Use Of Geospatial Technologies In Forest Management","Background: A survey was conducted to assess the uptake, and barriers to use, of geospatial tools and technologies amongst New Zealand's plantation forestry sector. Methods: Responses were received from 17 companies representing 63\% of New Zealand's plantation forest by area. A wide range of company sizes were surveyed (net stocked areas ranged from 4,000 - 200,000 hectares), and 7 of the 17 have international operations. Results: Survey results suggest that freely available topography, climate, and soil datasets have limited utility, as forest management at the operational level requires higher resolution, remotely sensed data. The most common supplemental data are aerial photography or satellite imagery. High spatial resolution was more highly valued by respondents than spectral diversity (i.e. number of channels); only six companies regularly use imagery containing an infrared band. LiDAR data has been used regularly by only three New Zealand forestry companies, while another six have tried it, suggesting it is an emerging technology in New Zealand. The use of generic GIS software was common amongst all respondents (14 use the ESRI product ArcGIS, three use MapInfo produced by Pitney Bowes). The utility of ArcGIS, in particular, was enhanced by locally developed extensions designed to address specific operational tasks performed regularly by New Zealand's forestry companies. Conclusions: While it is clear that geospatial data and tools are generally adopted by New Zealand's forest industry, cost-related barriers prevent their widespread adoption. Interestingly, a lack of staff knowledge was also conceded an impediment to uptake, alluding to the importance of tertiary education in the geospatial sciences and continuing education for practitioners.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1186/1179-5395-43-16","{""notes"": ""('morgenroth_uptakebarriersgeospatialtechnologies_2013',)""}","{}",2024-12-17 04:30:02,"included",NA,NA
6903588,"Mapping For Coral Reef Conservation: Comparing The Value Of Participatory And Remote Sensing Approaches","Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66\%; RS: 76\%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/ecs2.1325","{""notes"": ""('selgrath_mappingcoralreefconservation_2016',)""}","{}",2024-09-26 00:31:49,"included",NA,NA
7036822,"Scenarios For Valuing Sample Information In Natural Resources","Uncertainty is ubiquitous in natural resource systems, science and management. Sample data are obtained in order to reduce uncertainty, thereby increasing knowledge and improving resource management, but sampling always comes at a cost of some sort. Is that cost worthwhile? Analysis of the value of sample information (VSI) addresses this question. In this paper we develop the valuation of sample information in terms of five elements: (a) asystemwhose attributes are the focus of analysis; (b) a range of managementactionsthat affect the system's status; (c)uncertaintyabout system status or structure, as characterized by initial (prior) probabilities of possible system states or structures; (d) anexperimentor other information source that produces new data points and updated (posterior) probabilities; and (e) avalue measurethat is a function of the management action taken, conditional on either the system state or structure. We describe five scenarios for analysing theVSIunder uncertainty about system structure and state. Scenarios 1-3 comprise analyses of conditional, expected and optimal expected values of sample information. They focus primarily on choice of management adaptations with new information. Scenarios 4 and 5 involve pre-selected management actions, and are useful for comparing designs of data collection rather than for choosing a management action. These last scenarios expand the framework forVSIto include actions that have been selected independently of the updating of uncertainty. We discuss other extensions ofVSIanalysis, which include spatial applications, hybrid scenarios, applications involving dynamic systems, and a focus on costs rather than net benefits. Value of sample information analysis holds promise in emerging areas of ecology such as ecological forecasting and the use of remote sensing in conservation, where potential new data from models and satellites can be evaluated in advance, thereby allowing more efficient prioritization of scientific efforts. More generally,VSIcan contribute to better ecological understanding and more effective management in a wide range of ecological situations.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/2041-210x.13487","{""notes"": ""('williams_scenariosvaluingsampleinformation_2020',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 00:20:18,"included",NA,NA
7036807,"Justification For Site-Specific Weed Management Based On Ecology And Economics","One of the primary benefits of site-specific agricultural technologies is the potential to reduce the use of polluting inputs, thereby minimizing ecological damage. Weeds are often found in patches, so site-specific (field scale) management offers a straightforward opportunity to minimize ecological effects related to wasteful broadcast use of herbicides. Beyond possible efficiencies related to accurate targeting, site-specific technologies, through a process of parameterizing management decision models for each field, may improve ecological understanding of weed populations and thus encourage ecologically based management. This hypothesis was assessed with a simple model that combined economic injury level prediction with a single parameter (growing season precipitation) to represent environmental variability. Model simulations of crop yield in response to weed density at a virtual farm and six surrounding regional experiment stations suggested that localized (on-farm field) parameter estimation may help to circumvent the variability associated with damage function extrapolation from small-plot experiments at experiment stations and thereby improve predictive accuracy for site-specific weed management (SSWM) strategies. Thus, remote sensing and SSWM technologies may allow producers to reduce the risk associated with the reduced use of purchased inputs and greater reliance on natural weed population-regulating mechanisms. Effective ecologically based weed management may be dependent on local parameterization of models.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1614/ws-04-071r2","{""notes"": ""('maxwell_justificationsitespecificweed_2005',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 18:52:48,"included",NA,NA

This investigation looked at the potential incorporation of a newly emerging remote sensing technology, remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared investigated using a cost-benefit analysis approach. Methods: An online survey-based approach targeting subject matter experts in wildland fire management and unmanned aircraft was used to evaluate the percentage change in the effectiveness of five different management scenarios using remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared. The most commonly accepted economic model in wildland fire management was adapted to determine the net value change between the five scenarios. Results: The benefits of incorporated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared were measured as the reduction in cost-opportunity of helicopter use, and were estimated as an average of \$548 per fire (where the average cost of fires was \$1767) or a 31 \% cost saving on total suppression costs. The return on investment of such technology was estimated at 24 fires, whereas the return of investment of the existing thermal camera/helicopter use occurred after 160 fires. Conclusions: The incorporation of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared if implemented and managed appropriately, could well improve the cost effectiveness of the current forest, rural and wildland fire fighting efforts. The inherent uncertainty on such unevaluated technology (the combination of remotely piloted aircraft and forward-looking infrared) was addressed by adding stochastic variability and a triangular probability distribution approximation. Key management issues and recommendations are identified such as; greater use of current thermal camera equipment where possible, taking a project management based approach for further testing of remotely piloted aircraft and other emerging technologies, and the improved financial recording and reporting of fire management efforts.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1186/s40490-015-0044-9","{""notes"": ""('christensen_uavremotelypilotedaircraft_2015',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 00:11:49,"included",NA,NA
6447795,"Value of information for climate observing systems","The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system. As illustration, the VOI for the proposed space-borne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne systems is computed.

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of 'values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27\% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake.

Although at a generally low temporal resolution, satellite altimetry has been successfully used for water surface elevation (WSE) estimation and hydrodynamic modeling. This study aims to investigate the contribution of WSE from both short-repeat and geodetic altimetry to hydrodynamic model calibration, and also explore the contribution of the new Sentinel-3 mission. Two types of data sources (i.e., in-situ and satellite altimetry) are investigated together with two roughness cases (i.e., spatially variable and uniform roughness) for calibration of a hydrodynamic model (DHI MIKE 11) with available bathymetry. A 150 km long reach of Han River in China with rich altimetry and in-situ gauging data is selected as a case study. Results show that the performances of the model calibrated by satellite altimetry-derived datasets are acceptable in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of simulated WSE. Sentinel-3A can support hydrodynamic model calibration even though it has a relatively low temporal resolution (27-day repeat cycle). The CryoSat-2 data with a higher spatial resolution (7.5 km at the Equator) are proved to be more valuable than the Sentinel-3A altimetry data with a low spatial resolution (104 km at the Equator) for hydrodynamic model calibration in terms of RMSE values of 0.16 and 0.18 m, respectively. Moreover, the spatially variable roughness can also improve the model performance compared to the uniform roughness case, with decreasing RMSE values by 2-14\%.

By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70\% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of ""zero hunger"", potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability.

In this study, a sample design and mapping method was developed by integrating stratification, model updating, and cokriging with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. This method is based on the spatial autocorrelation of variables and the spatial cross-correlation among them. It can lead to sample designs with variable grid spacing, where sampling distances between plots vary depending on spatial variability of the variables from location to location. This has potential cost-efficiencies in terms of sample design and mapping. This method is also applicable for mapping in the case in which no ground data can be collected in some parts of a study area because of the high cost. The method was validated in a case study in which a ground and vegetation cover factor was sampled and mapped for monitoring soil erosion. The results showed that when the sample obtained with three strata using the developed method was used for sampling and mapping the cover factor, the sampling cost was greatly decreased, although the error of the map was slightly increased compared to that without stratification; that is, the sample cost-efficiency quantified by the product of cost and error was greatly increased. The increase of cost-efficiency was more obvious when the cover factor values of the plots within the no-significant-change stratum were updated by a model developed using the previous observations instead of remeasuring them in the field. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s00267-005-0222-2","{""notes"": ""('wang_samplingmappingsoilerosion_2007',)""}","{}",2024-12-24 19:57:32,"included",NA,NA

Nevertheless, for a lot of users, costs should be considered with the benefits these technologies are able to generate. The benefit-cost analysis is a useful tool for a financial evaluation of the transferability of the technology. This method has been selected to evaluate the eventual implementation of remote sensing technologies for snow cover measurements in the La Grande river basin (Quebec, Canada). Indeed, a better assessment of the snow water equivalent leads to a better forecasting of the water inputs due to the snowmelt. Thus, the improvement of the snow cover monitoring has direct impact on hydroelectric reservoir management. The benefit-cost analysis was used to compare three acquisition modes of the satellite Radarsat 1 (ScanSAR, Wide and Standard). The costs considered for this project are: R D costs and operations costs (the purchase of images and costs of gound truth measurements). We evaluated the raw benefits on the basis of reducing the standard deviation of predicted inflows. The results shows that the ScanSAR mode is the primary remote sensing tool for the monitoring ofthe snow cover, on an operational basis. With this acquisition mode, the benefit-cost ratios range between 2.3:1 and 3.9:1, using a conservative 4% reduction of the standard deviation. Even if the reduction is only 3%, ScanSAR remains profitable. Due to the large number of images needed to cover all the territory, the Standard and Wide modes are penalized by the purchase and the processing costs of the data and with delays associated to the processing. Nevertheless, with these two modes, it could be possible to work with a partial coverage of the watershed, 75% being covered in 4 days in Wide mode. The estimated B/C ratios (1.5:1 et 2:1) confirm the advantages of this alternative, particularly if any technical problems (geometric correction and radiometric precision) are encountered with ScanSAR products. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/014311699212335","{""notes"": ""('martin_evaluationfinancieredel‘integration_1999',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:40:53,"included",NA,NA

Traditional techniques, including satellite remote sensing and ground-based techniques used to assess habitat condition, have limitations in terms of costs and low resolution of satellite platforms. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI (GNDVI) have potential for assessing habitat condition, e.g., forage quantity and quality, vegetation cover and degradation, soil erosion and salinization, fire, and pollution of vegetation cover. We, therefore, examined how the recently emerged Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform and the traditional Sentinel-2 differs in indications of habitat condition using NDVI and GNDVI. We assigned 13 survey plots to random locations in the major land cover types: three survey plots in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands, and two in riverine and mosaics cover types. We used a UAV-mounted, multi-spectral sensor and obtained Sentinel-2 imagery between February and March 2020. We categorized NDVI and GNDVI values into habitat condition classes (very good, good, poor, and very poor). We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and linear regression model in R-software. The results revealed higher sensitivity and ability of UAV to provide the necessary preliminary diagnostic indications of habitat condition. The UAV-based NDVI and GNDVI maps showed more details of all classes of habitat conditions than the Sentinel-2 maps. The linear regressions results showed strong positive correlations between the two platforms (p < 0.001). The differences were attributed primarily to spatial resolution and minor atmospheric effects.

7037550,"Comparative Analysis Of Machine Learning Algorithms In Automatic Identification And Extraction Of Water Boundaries","Monitoring open water bodies accurately is important for assessing the role of ecosystem services in the context of human survival and climate change. There are many methods available for water body extraction based on remote sensing images, such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified NDWI (MNDWI), and machine learning algorithms. Based on Landsat-8 remote sensing images, this study focuses on the effects of six machine learning algorithms and three threshold methods used to extract water bodies, evaluates the transfer performance of models applied to remote sensing images in different periods, and compares the differences among these models. The results are as follows. (1) Various algorithms require different numbers of samples to reach their optimal consequence. The logistic regression algorithm requires a minimum of 110 samples. As the number of samples increases, the order of the optimal model is support vector machine, neural network, random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost. (2) The accuracy evaluation performance of each machine learning on the test set cannot represent the local area performance. (3) When these models are directly applied to remote sensing images in different periods, the AUC indicators of each machine learning algorithm for three regions all show a significant decline, with a decrease range of 0.33–66.52%, and the differences among the different algorithm performances in the three areas are obvious. Generally, the decision tree algorithm has good transfer performance among the machine learning algorithms with area under curve (AUC) indexes of 0.790, 0.518, and 0.697 in the three areas, respectively, and the average value is 0.668. The Otsu threshold algorithm is the optimal among threshold methods, with AUC indexes of 0.970, 0.617, and 0.908 in the three regions respectively and an average AUC of 0.832. © 2021 by the authors.

Animal-borne telemetry has revolutionized our ability to study animal movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing environments and the threats that animals are experiencing. While there will always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to make informed management decisions. 2. Here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal telemetry devices can influence conservation. We then discuss two critical questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied conservation decision-making: (i) Would my choice of action change if I had more data? (ii) Is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect more data? 3. Policy implications.

7036821,"Geo-Cropsim: A Geo-Spatial Crop Simulation Modeling Framework For Regional Scale Crop Yield And Water Use Assessment","Remote sensing derived datasets (e.g. Leaf Area Index (LAI)) are increasingly being used in process based cropping system models to improve the prediction skill of the simulations when implementing operationally at regional scale. However, challenges such as inadequate quality of the available remote sensing data products and high reliance of models on climate variables and their uncertainties still exist. To address these challenges, we developed Geo-CropSim, a spatial modeling framework to use high quality remote sensing products in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model to regulate simulated processes and improve predictions of crop yield and evapotranspiration. Geo-CropSim comprises three main features 1) pixel level model initialization using crop emergence dates; 2) ability of the EPIC model to read in the PROSAIL (i.e. combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model) inversion-based crop type LAI; and 3) a stress adjustment function to regulate simulated stress using LAI anomalies. To understand its performance, we implemented it over the State of Nebraska to estimate corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [Merr.]) yields and evapotranspiration (ET) for 2012 (drought year) and 2015 (normal year) at 500-m resolution. Results showed that emergence dates and seasonal LAI captured spatial and temporal differences in crop progression (e.g. delayed planting in 2015) and growth (e.g. declined LAI in 2012) driven by regional differences in crop management and weather conditions very well. These differences were reflected in Geo-CropSim yield estimates, and showed improved spatial and temporal details compared over those from EPIC simulations obtained without using remote sensing derived emergence and LAI. Results revealed that Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Geo-CropSim yield estimates, computed based on USDA-NASS reported yields, were 18.85% and 1.22 Mg ha−1 for corn, and 17.90% and 0.46 Mg ha−1 for soybeans, respectively, which are substantially lower than those of original EPIC estimates (MAPE = 33.74% and RMSE = 2.18 Mg ha−1 for corn; and MAPE = 40.71% and RMSE = 0.98 Mg ha−1 for soybeans). Further, Geo-CropSim was able to capture ET and transpiration dynamics reasonably well (e.g. 10–12 % lower values for soybeans compared to corn values), and showed good agreement with flux measurements (i.e. R2 values of 0.63 and 0.72, RMSE values of 29.88 and 33.41 mm, and MAPE values of 5.0% and 6.8% for corn and soybean, respectively). Overall, this study demonstrated that Geo-CropSim has considerable potential to serve as a reliable operational tool to assess crop yields and water use under various cropping systems and to help in regional yield monitoring and water resource management. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The most recent lahar disaster occurred in 1998 at Casita volcano, Nicaragua, claiming over 2,500 lives. Lahars can cover large areas and be highly destructive, and constitute a challenge for disaster management. With infrastructure affected and access frequently impeded, disaster management can benefit from the synoptic coverage provided by satellite imagery. This potential has been recognised for other types of natural disasters, but limitations are also known. Dedicated satellite constellations for disaster response and management have been proposed as one solution. Here we investigate the utility of currently available and forthcoming optical and radar sensors as tools in lahar disaster management. Applied to the Casita case, we find that imagery available at the time could not have significantly improved disaster response.

Vermont's omission of GHG emissions from land conversions could result in significant costs of inaction (COI), which could hinder the state's mitigation and adaptation plans and result in climate crisis-related risks (e.g., credit downgrade). Science-based spatio-temporal data of GHG emissions from soils because of land conversions can be integrated into the conceptual framework of ""action"" versus ""inaction"" to prevent GHG emissions. The application of soil information data and remote sensing analysis can identify the GHG emissions from land conversions, which can be expressed as ""realized"" social costs of ""inaction"". This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for VT by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases.

This work aims to design an objective spatial climate regionalization method for assessing health risks in response to extreme weather. Specific climate regions for the conterminous United States of America (USA) were defined using satellite remote sensing (RS) data and compared with the conventional Köppen-Geiger (KG) divisions. Using the nationwide database of hospitalisations among the elderly (≥65 year olds), we examined the utility of a RS-based climate regionalization to assess public health risk due to extreme weather, by comparing the rate of hospitalisations in response to thermal extremes across climatic regions. Satellite image composites from 2002-2012 were aggregated, masked and compiled into a multi-dimensional dataset. The conterminous USA was classified into 8 distinct regions using a stepwise regionalization approach to limit noise and collinearity (LKN), which exhibited a high degree of consistency with the KG regions and a well-defined regional delineation by annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation values. The most populous was a temperate wet region (10.9 million), while the highest rate of hospitalisations due to exposure to heat and cold (9.6 and 17.7 cases per 100,000 persons at risk, respectively) was observed in the relatively warm and humid south-eastern region. RS-based regionalization demonstrates strong potential for assessing the adverse effects of severe weather on human health and for decision support.

Here, we combine geospatial models of cloud cover as a proxy for the likelihood of acquiring remote scenes and the shortest time of travel to population centers as a proxy for accessibility to ground-truth remote sensing data for water quality monitoring and produce maps of the potential of remote sensing in watershed management in the United States. We generate several maps with different cost-payoff relationships to help stakeholders plan and incentivize remote sensing-based monitoring campaigns. Additionally, we combine these remote sensing potential maps with spatial indices of population, water demand, ecosystem services, pollution risk, and monitoring coverage deficits to identify where remote sensing likely has the greatest role to play. We find that the Southwestern United States and the Central plains regions are generally suitable for remote sensing for watershed management even under the most stringent costing projections, but that the potential for using remote sensing can extend further North and East as constraints are relaxed. We also find large areas in the Southern United States and sporadic watersheds in the Northeast and Northwest seaboards and the Midwest would likely benefit most from using remote sensing for watershed monitoring.

Despite the existing extraction methods, there remains the challenging task of fully exploiting the characteristics of multisource remote sensing data, each of which has its own advantages. In this paper, a new fusion approach for accurately extracting urban built-up areas based on the use of multisource remotely sensed data, i.e., the DMSP-OLS nighttime light data, the MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1) and Landsat 7 ETM+ images, was proposed. The proposed method mainly consists of two components: (1) the multi-level data fusion, including the initial sample selection, unified pixel resolution and feature weighted calculation at the feature level, as well as pixel attribution determination at decision level; and (2) the optimized sample selection with multi-factor constraints, which indicates that an iterative optimization with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and the bare soil index (BSI), along with the sample training of the support vector machine (SVM) and the extraction of urban built-up areas, produces results with high credibility. Nine Chinese provincial capitals along the Silk Road Economic Belt, such as Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, Xining, and Nanning, were selected to test the proposed method with data from 2001 to 2010. Compared with the results obtained by the traditional threshold dichotomy and the improved neighborhood focal statistics (NFS) method, the following could be concluded. (1) The proposed approach achieved high accuracy and eliminated natural elements to a great extent while obtaining extraction results very consistent to those of the more precise improved NFS approach at a fine scale. The average overall accuracy (OA) and average Kappa values of the extracted urban built-up areas were 95\% and 0.83, respectively.

However, the country has also experienced severe ecological damage, surpassing that of many other nations. The rapid economic growth has come at the expense of the environment, revealing a significant lack of coordination between urbanization and eco-environmental protection in China. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and continuous historical dataset of China’s eco-environmental quality (EEQ) based on remote sensing, allowing for the analysis of spatial and temporal changes. Such data would provide objective, scientific, and reliable support for China’s eco-environmental protection and pollution prevention policies, while addressing potential ecological risks resulting from urbanization. To achieve this, the entropy value method is employed to integrate multi-source remote sensing data and construct an evaluation system for China’s EEQ. Historical data from 2000 to 2017 is plotted to illustrate China’s EEQ over time. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) The entropy method effectively facilitates the construction of China’s eco-environmental quality assessment system. (2) From 2000 to 2017, approximately 39.7% of China’s regions witnessed a decrease in EEQ, while 60.3% exhibited improvement, indicating an overall enhancement in EEQ over the past eighteen years. (3) The Yangtze and Yellow River basins experienced improved EEQ due to China’s ecological restoration projects. (4) The future EEQ in China demonstrates a subtle positive trend across diverse contexts.

The paper further shows road safety as another public health concern. Traffic fatalities are the number one cause of death in the world. Traffic accidents result in huge financial loss to the people involved and the related public health cost is a significant part of the total societal cost. Motor vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents as well as natural sources emit nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are precursors to the formation of ground-level Ozone. High concentration values of ground-level Ozone in hot summer days produce smog and lead to respiratory problems and loss in worker's productivity. These factors and associated economic costs to society are important in establishing public policy and decision-making for sustainable transportation and development of communities in both industrialized and developing countries. This paper presents new science models for predicting ground-level Ozone and related air quality degradation. The models include predictor variables of daily climatological data, traffic volume and mix, speed, aviation data, and emission inventory of point sources. These models have been implemented in the user friendly AQMAN computer program and used for a case study in Northern Mississippi.

6863115,"The Role Of Remote Sensing Data And Methods In A Modern Approach To Fertilization In Precision Agriculture","The precision fertilization system is the basis for upgrading conventional intensive agricultural production, while achieving both high and quality yields and minimizing the negative impacts on the environment. This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost-and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions. State-of-the-art remote sensing techniques allowed hybrid interpolation to predict the sampled data supported by remote sensing data such as high-resolution multispectral, thermal and radar satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imagery in the analyzed studies. The representative overview of conventional and modern approaches to precision fertilization was performed based on 121 samples with phosphorous pentoxide (P2 O5 ) and potassium oxide (K2 O) in a common agricultural parcel in Croatia. It visually and quantitatively confirmed the superior prediction accuracy and retained local heterogeneity of the modern approach.

The Space Assets for Demining Assistance (SADA) undertaking is a set of activities that aim at developing new services to improve the socio-economic impact of mine action activities, primarily focused on the release of land thought to be contaminated, a process described as land release. SADA was originally initiated by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). It has been implemented under the Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) program of the European Space Agency (ESA). Land release in mine action is the process whereby the demining community identifies, surveys and prioritizes suspected hazardous areas for more detailed investigation, which eventually results in the clearance of landmines and other explosives, thereby releasing land to the local population. SADA has a broad scope, covering activities, such as planning (risk and impact analysis, prioritization, and resource management), field operations and reporting. SADA services are developed in two phases: feasibility studies followed by demonstration projects. Three parallel feasibility studies have been performed. They aimed at defining an integrated set of space enabled services to support the land release process in mine action, and at analyzing their added value, viability and sustainability. The needs of the mine action sector have been assessed and the potential contribution of space assets has been identified. Support services have been formulated. To test their fieldability, proofs of concept involving mine action end users in various operational field settings have been performed by each of the study teams. The economic viability has also been assessed. Whenever relevant and cost-effective, SADA aims at integrating Earth observation data, GNSS navigation and SatCom technologies with existing mine action tools and procedures, as well as with novel aerial survey technologies. Such conformity with existing user processes, as well as available budgets and appropriateness of technology based solutions given the field level operational setting are important conditions for success. The studies have demonstrated that Earth observation data, satellite navigation solutions and in some cases, satellite communication, indeed can provide added value to mine action activities if properly tailored based on close user interaction and provided through a suitable channel. Such added value for example includes easy and sustained access to Earth observation data for general purpose mapping, land use assessment for post-release progress reporting, and multi-source data fusion algorithms to help quantify risks and socio-economic impact for prioritization and planning purposes. The environment and boundaries of a hazardous area can also be better specified to support the land release process including detailed survey and clearance operations. Satellite communication can help to provide relevant data to remote locations, but is not regarded as strongly user driven. Finally, satellite navigation can support more precise non-technical surveys, as well as aerial observation with small planes or hand-launched UAV's. To ensure the activity is genuinely user driven, the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) plays an important role as ESA's external advisor. ESA is furthermore supported by a representative field operator, the Swiss Foundation of Mine Action (FSD), providing ESA with a direct connection to the field level end users. Specifically FSD has provided a shared user needs baseline to the three study teams. To ensure solutions meet with end user requirements, the study teams themselves include mine action representatives and have interacted closely with their pre-existing and newly established contacts within the mine action community.

6691554,"Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations- Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions -Group on Earth Observations side event proceedings","The U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Association for Remote Sensing Companies, and the European Space Agency in coordination with the GEOValue Community hosted a side event to the Group on Earth Observations Plenary on October 23-24, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The workshop, entitled ""Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations: Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions,"" brought together more than 60 international experts including economists, scientists, and engineers to consider the state of the science and applications of valuing Earth observations (EO).\n\nThis 2-day workshop built upon previous activities developed under the GEOValue initiative. This workshop brought together expert analysts from multiple disciplines and backgrounds who are developing methods to identify and measure the value of information generated from the use of satellite and in-situ data. The mix of government agencies, international financial institutions, and independent consultants who participated in the workshop blended to develop a rich mix of views, approaches, and outcomes.\n\nDuring the first part of the workshop, the focus was on the latest science in valuing EO. A number of methodologies were described. Approaches generally assess the societal benefits of specific actions (for example, investments in EO). Some methods focus on broad measures of economic activity (for example, gross domestic product) or methods to assess total economic value such as contingent valuation surveys. Alternatively, use-case approaches (a use case is defined as an evaluation in which one or more decisions, applications, or other uses of data, information, and information products are specifically considered) start with the specific actions and how information is used to support decision making and affect outcomes. \n\nThe second part of the meeting was focused on the use and development of value chains and decision trees. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. In terms of EO, the value chain approach can be applied to consider societal benefits of the data and assess the value of data and data features. The EO value chain considers the geospatial data sources and the processing of the data into value added information to be incorporated into decision-support systems, leading to decision maker's actions. To understand the value of EO, one would also need to recognize the demand side of the equation or how EO benefits users. Extending the value chain concept and incorporating tenets of Bayesian decision making, a decision tree would include one or more use cases. The value provided by the marginal increase in information could flow from one or several parts of the supply side of the value chain. The decision tree is based on the premise that information has no value if it is not used in at least one decision. By connecting the value chain and the decision tree, a framework is created that allows for conceptualizing the value of EO in its many uses. One can then apply economic techniques to monetize the marginal benefit of an outcome with information versus one without. \n\nA third part of the meeting applied the value chain and decision-tree frameworks to five specific thematic areas, each with the focus of using information for a decision point: \n- Effect of increasing temperatures on human health; \n- Flooding- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts to safety and property damage; \n- Energy and mineral supply- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts of shortfalls on the economy; and\n- Effects of natural hazards on transportation systems- Effects on mobility, safety, and the economy.\n\nDuring the working session, five separate groups worked to define and delineate the value chains and decision trees associated with each topic, discussing the related challenges and data needs. The outcomes were reported back to the full group. Because of the complexity of the topics, most groups first identified a network of value chains and then narrowed the scope to develop a single value chain to address their group's topic. Although they worked separately and on different topics, the groups came to similar conclusions, concurring that the value chain and decision-tree frameworks are very effective for informing quantitative impact assessments and developing a relatable narrative to assist the public in understanding the link between EO and citizens.",2019,"{""Pearlman, Francoise""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20191033","{}","{}",2024-04-22 02:48:01,"included",NA,NA

7652644,"Spatial Water Footprint Optimization Of Crop Planting: A Fuzzy Multiobjective Optimal Approach Based On Mod16 Evapotranspiration Products","Agriculture is required to produce more food while reduce water consumption at the same time. To improve the irrigation water use efficiency in agricultural production, this study proposed a fuzzy multiobjective optimal modeling approach based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global evapotranspiration products for optimizing spatial water footprint of crop planting. This study attempts to accurately estimate the spatial crop water footprint based on remote sensing information, and effectively plan crop planting structure considering conflicting targets, spatial water footprint, and limited irrigation water resources under fuzzy uncertainty. To test its feasibility, the proposed approach is employed to a typical semi-arid region in Northwest China. Three performance evaluation indicators, including synthetic degree (SD), sustainability index (SI), and approximation degree of ideal objective value (AD), are applied for measuring model performance and try to give a more comprehensive picture of agricultural land use strategies. Results show that (1) the remote sensing data can effectively improve the accuracy of water footprint estimation, and identify crop planting advantage distribution in spatial; (2) the planting area of crops with high evapotranspiration should be increased in irrigation districts near the upstream with high precipitation, which can improve economic benefit, increase utilization rate of green water, and fairness of allocation; (3) through optimization, the average total, blue, and gray water footprint among IDs are drop while green water utilization rates is raised comparing with status quo (2014); (4) Water scarcity will not only damage the coordinated development degree of economy, society and environment, but also hurt the regional sustainable development ability and the realization of development objectives. The proposed optimal modeling framework can help optimize the spatial water footprint of crop planting and improve irrigation water use efficiency, which can be applied to similar regions that suffer from water scarcity.",2021,"{""Cai, Yanpeng"",""Tan, Qian"",""Wang, Xuan"",""Zhang, Fan""}","article",NA,"10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107096","{""notes"": ""('zhang_spatialwaterfootprintoptimization_2021',)""}","{}",2025-02-27 23:16:29,"included",NA,NA
7036566,"Forests In Climate Policy: Technical, Institutional And Economic Issues In Measurement And Monitoring","Despite the economic and environmental significance of the world's forests, we have limited data about them. Estimates of deforestation in tropical countries and rates of reforestation or afforestation in boreal and temperate countries are inconsistent. Accordingly, estimates of emissions released in deforestation vary widely and range from 7\% to 17\% of all sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The lack of good data severely hampers efforts to shape climate policy because it is difficult to model the role of forests both in the physical global carbon (C) cycle and in cost-effective regimes to abate GHG. Data limits strain the capacity of even the best models to estimate marginal cost functions for forest carbon (C) sequestration. It is technically possible to obtain better information, but for institutional and economic reasons these technologies have not yet been fully deployed. The emergence of carbon (C) trading or tax policy in which forest carbon (C) storage becomes valued would strengthen incentives to supply better data, as would nonmarket regulation if it elicited a shadow value of forest carbon (C) in substituting for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. ""Geo-wiki"" may provide a short-term solution to at least part of the data problem. The ultimate solution is the development of a comprehensive forest monitoring system involving remote sensing and on-the-ground truthing. This paper briefly discusses the role of forests in climate policy and then describes data gaps, the capability of technology to fill them, the limits of institutions and budgets in realizing this capability, and possible near-term solutions.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s11027-010-9276-4","{""notes"": ""('macauley_forestsclimatepolicytechnical_2011',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 21:38:23,"included",NA,NA

This approach integrates an event-driven mechanism, Web services, and a Sensor Web and coordinates them using workflow technologies to facilitate the Web-based sharing and processing of hydrological hazard information. The design and implementation of hydrological Web services for conducting various hydrological analysis tasks on the Web using dynamically updating sensor observation data are presented.

In this context, the European Commission is intending to evaluate the overall potential utility of a complementary Copernicus hyperspectral mission to be added to the Copernicus Sentinels fleet. Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful remote sensing technology that, allowing the characterization and quantification of Earth surface materials, has the potential to deliver significant enhancements in quantitative value-added products. This study aims to illustrate the interaction methodology that was set up to collect and assess user-driven requirements in different thematic areas to demonstrate the potential benefit of a future Copernicus hyperspectral mission. Therefore, an ad hoc interaction matrix was circulated among several user communities to gather preferences about hyperspectral-based products and services. The results show how the involvement of several user communities strengthens the identification of these user requirements. Moreover, the requirement evaluation is used to identify potential opportunities of hyperspectral imaging in addressing operational needs associated with policy obligations at European, national, and local levels. The frequency distribution of spectral range classes and spatial and temporal resolutions are also derived from the preference expressed by the user communities in each thematic area investigated. © 2020 by the authors.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs12081286","{""notes"": ""('taramelli_interactionmethodologycollectassess_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-15 01:57:35,"included",NA,NA

Employing advanced remote sensing techniques, the research integrates ICESat-2 ATL08 segment data, Landsat satellite imagery, and Esri Sentinel-2 Land Cover datasets to generate forest canopy cover (FCC) maps for the years 2019 and 2022. The study area was chosen due to its high population, significant tourism industry, and frequent forest fires, making it a critical region for biodiversity and forest resources in Turkey. The Canopy Cover Estimation Method (CCEM) was employed, achieving accuracy percentages ranging from 77% to 86%, demonstrating its efficacy in estimating FCC without the need for fieldwork. The integration of annual updates from the Esri Sentinel-2 Land Cover dataset as auxiliary data greatly enhanced the reliability and accuracy of the analyses. Despite challenges posed by the study area and differences in spatial resolution among the datasets, the study successfully demonstrated the utility of integrating ICESat-2 segment data and Landsat imagery for understanding the dynamics of FCC in a complex environment. The results contribute to more informed decision-making in forest management and conservation efforts.

It analyses the usefulness of a set of spatial data layers, including medium resolution satellite imagery, for population density estimations in rural Zimbabwe. The exercise conducted on a 185 × 185km area at a grid cell size of 150m allowed us to develop a methodology that can be extended to the whole of Zimbabwe. The surface modelling of population density was implemented by integrating 4 main variables: land use, settlements, road network, and slopes. During the modelling procedure, pixel weighting values were allocated according to pre-defined decision rules. In a final step the district population counts of the recent Zimbabwean census were distributed among all pixels of the relevant district according to the pixel weighting values. The resulting land use information and population data can be linked to vulnerability and food insecurity. In order to be transferred to other countries, the modelling procedure needs to be adapted to case specific characteristics, the determination of which requires a certain level of local / expert knowledge.

6447798,"The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response","Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions “on the ground” more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies.

6863481,"Normalizing Land Surface Temperature For Environmental Parameters In Mountainous And Urban Areas Of A Cold Semi-Arid Climate","Normalization of land surface temperature (LST) relative to environmental factors is of great importance in many scientific studies and applications. The purpose of this study was to develop physical models based on energy balance equations for normalization of satellite derived LST relative to environmental parameters. For this purpose, a set of remote sensing imagery, meteorological and climatic data recorded in synoptic stations, and soil temperatures measured by data loggers were used. For modeling and normalization of LST, a dual-source energy balance model (dual-EB), taking into account two fractions of vegetation and soil, and a triple-source energy balance model (triple-EB), taking into account three fractions of vegetation, soil and built-up land, were proposed with either regional or local optimization strategies. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different modeling results, correlation coefficients and root mean square difference (RMSE) were computed between modeled LST and LST obtained from satellite imagery, as well as between modeled LST and soil temperature measured by data loggers. Further, the variance of normalized LST values was calculated and analyzed. The results suggested that the use of local optimization strategy increased the accuracy of the normalization of LST, compared to the regional optimization strategy. In addition, no matter the regional or local optimization strategy was employed, the triple-EB model out-performed consistently the dual-EB model for LST normalization. The results show the efficiency of the local triple-EB model to normalize LST relative to environmental parameters. The correlation coefficients were close to zero between all of the environmental parameters and the normalized LST. In other words, normalized LST was completely independent of the environmental parameters considered by this research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

6863535,"Wetland Landscape Spatio-Temporal Degradation Dynamics Using The New Google Earth Engine Cloud-Based Platform: Opportunities For Non-Specialists In Remote Sensing","The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica. We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region. This GEE application illustrates new opportunities for biosystems engineers and other scientists to integrate historical vegetation and land cover data into comprehensive datasets to understand human impacts on ecosystems, and provides the guidance to do so.",2016,"{""Alonso, A."",""Kennedy, R.

These tools - hereafter referred to as 'Geographic Information Technology' (GIT) tools - have the potential to simplify workflow in geoconservation assessment and inventory, be employed as decision-support and decision-making tools for complex decisions, or be used to enhance communication and user experience in geotourism. In this paper, we review the progress on the use of GIT tools in geoheritage and geotourism to date, highlighting current gaps in practice. By way of an interview of prominent global geoconservation and geotourism professionals conducted in 2018, we show that approximately 25\% of the surveyed workforce use some type of GIT tool to aid in decision-support, decision-making, or for communication(s) of inventory elements and features of interest. Upon review of the literature, it appears that the vast majority of tools are used for communications of inventory, features and site maps. Opportunities for further improvement in the field will most likely be realised when more sophisticated decision-making tools become available for geoconservationists and geotourism professionals, especially in the use of GIS Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to rank and curate inventory, geosites or geotouristic experiences.

6691713,"Simulating the value of El Nino forecasts for the Panama Canal","The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canal’s primary storage facility, for operations—principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (July–December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914–1997. Operational capabilities to predict\ntropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment ‘‘virtual’’ canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981–1998. The results show the following main points:\n(i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate.\n(ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies.\n(iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments.\n(iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately $US 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.",2006,"{""Graham, Nicholas""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2005.12.005","{}","{}",2024-04-26 18:59:12,"included",NA,NA

One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data. Decision makers comprise three communities: consumers and producers of information, public officials whose job is to invest in data acquisition and information development (including sensors and other hardware, algorithm design and software tools, and a trained labor force), and the public at large.",2006,"{""Macauley, Molly K.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2006.08.003","{}","{""in benchmarks?""}",2024-04-22 03:06:27,"included",NA,NA
7036580,"Application Of Near Real-Time And Multiscale Three Dimensional Earth Observation Platforms In Disaster Prevention","Taiwan frequently experiences natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, landslides, debris flows, and earthquakes. Therefore, the instant acquisition of high-definition images and topographic or spatial data of affected areas as disasters occur is crucial for disaster response teams and making emergency aid decisions. The National Applied Research Laboratories has implemented the project ""development of near real-time, high-resolution, global earth observation 3D platform for applications to environmental monitoring and disaster mitigation."" This developmental project integrates earth observation technologies, data warehousing, high-performance visualization displays, grids, and disaster prevention technology to establish a near real-time high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) disaster prevention earth observation application platform for Taiwan. The main functions of this platform include (1) integration of observation information, such as Formosat-2 satellite remote sensing, aerial photography, and 3D photography of disaster sites, to provide multidimensional information of the conditions at the affected sites; (2) disaster prevention application technologies, such as large-sized high-resolution 3D projection system, medium-sized active stereo projection systems, and small-sized personal computers with multiscale 3D display systems; (3) a 3D geographical information network platform that integrates data warehousing and cloud services, complies with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) international standard for image data exchange and release processes, and includes image overlaying and added-value analysis of disasters; and (4) near real-time and automated simulation of image processing procedures, which accelerates orthophoto processing once raw data are received from satellites and provides appropriate images for disaster prevention decision-making within 3 to 6 h. This study uses the 88 Flood event of Typhoon Morakot in 2009, Typhoon Fanapi in 2011, and the 311 Earthquake of Japan in 2011 as examples to dissert the applications, functions and features of this platform for supporting disaster response and disaster recovery decision-making. © 2011 International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.5875/ausmt.v1i2.124","{""notes"": ""('tsai_applicationrealtimemultiscale_2011',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:30:37,"included",NA,NA

7037246,"The Rise Of Low-Cost Sensing For Managing Air Pollution In Cities","Ever growing populations in cities are associated with a major increase in road vehicles and air pollution. The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate.

6447792,"Utilizing Satellite Earth Observation Analyses and the Environment-Vulnerability-Decision-Technology  Modelling Framework to Support the Yurok Tribe in Mitigating Climate Change Impacts through Natural  Resource Management","The Yurok Tribe is engaging in innovative conservation-based natural resource management to confront the impacts of climate change both on and off the Yurok Ancestral Territory. These indigenous-led efforts focus on protecting community safety and the natural forest, land, and river resources that are connected to their lifeways, economies and culture. However, decisions around the implementation of these efforts are challenging. Challenges include intersecting environmental and socioeconomic factors, understanding complex environmental trends, and a diverse network of stakeholders. This project aids the Nation-Building efforts of the Tribe by supplementing tribal decisionmaking as they develop solutions to mitigate climate impacts, reduce the rate of climate change, and balance resilience, revenue, and cultural values in natural resource management. To supplement Yurok decisionmakers and staff actions, a Decision Support System (DSS) is being developed as a collaborative project by the Tribe and the authors. The DSS incorporates satellite earth observation (EO) analyses and employs the Environment-VulnerabilityDecision-Technology (EVDT) modelling framework. The DSS considers the interactions between the environment, human vulnerability, decision-making and technology design. This work discusses the development of the EO analyses for this DSS. Regarding the environmental component of EVDT, tree cover is analysed towards understanding fire risk and forest trends with respect to different land management strategies. This analysis also relates to the human vulnerability component of EVDT, as it is integrated in the DSS with local socioeconomic data on the wildland-urban interface (to protect public safety) and Tribal Carbon Sequestration projects (to protect the carbon sequestered in these forests). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) mean anomaly is utilized to examine sustained tree cover change. Also, regarding human vulnerability, existing EO products on forest fire alerts and smoke are integrated with local socioeconomic information in the DSS towards minimizing these climaterelated impacts on Yurok communities. Additionally, analyses of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) space-based LiDAR data are utilized to provide information on forest structure change. This information is related to the decision-making component of EVDT, as it is employed by Yurok staff and decisionmakers in carbon sequestration initiatives and the Tribe’s natural resources portfolio project planning. These carbon sequestration projects provide the Tribe with meaningful revenues and seek to reduce the rate of climate change impacts. These analyses will be supplemented by aerial LiDAR data collection and further technological advances coupled with scientific and traditional ecological knowledge which is being explored by the Tribe.

6862735,"The Value Of Remotely Sensed Vs. Field-Surveyed Habitat Structure For Predicting Bird Abundance: A Case Study In Traditional Orchards","Understanding environmental effects on the distribution and abundance of species is central to ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology. This led to the development of species distribution models (SDMs) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables. So far, SDMs rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determinant of bird distributions. While remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys. In this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance. Specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in South-Western Germany. 'Remote sensing SDMs' related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees. Alternative 'field survey SDMs' related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees. Additionally, both remote sensing and field survey SDMs included climate and land use variables. Accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use. The impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species. The remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abundance of seven species. In contrast, multiple field-surveyed variables had similar effect strength, with the overall strongest effect found for pear tree density, to which seven bird species showed a unimodal response. These analyses have conservation implications since they predict expected responses of bird species to ongoing changes in orchard structure. Moreover, they identify structural variables that will be most promising to measure via remote sensing data in the future.",2022,"{""Chaparro, Laura"",""Schmieder, Klaus"",""Schurr, Frank M.""}","article",NA,"10.1007/s10336-022-01970-9","{""notes"": ""('chaparro_remotelysensedfieldsurveyed_2022',)""}","{}",2024-07-16 23:56:48,"included",NA,NA
6863236,"Spectral Matching Based On Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization: A New Method For Terrestrial Water Body Extraction Using Multi-Temporal Landsat 8 Images","Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management.",2018,"{""Jia, Kai"",""Jiang, Weiguo"",""Li, Jing"",""Tang, Zhenghong""}","article",NA,"10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.012","{""notes"": ""('jia_spectralmatchingbaseddiscrete_2018',)""}","{}",2024-07-18 22:03:31,"included",NA,NA
7652958,"Mangrove Plantation Suitability Mapping By Integrating Multi Criteria Decision Making Geospatial Approach And Remote Sensing Data","Mangroves are woody plant communities that appear in tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in intertidal zones along the coastlines. Despite their considerable benefits to humans and the surrounding environment, their existence is threatened by anthropogenic activities and natural drivers. Accordingly, it is vital to conduct efficient efforts to increase mangrove plantations by identifying suitable locations. These efforts are required to support conservation and plantation practices and lower the mortality rate of seedlings. Therefore, identifying ecologically potential areas for plantation practices is mandatory to ensure a higher success rate. This study aimed to identify suitable locations for mangrove plantations along the southern coastal frontiers of Hormozgan, Iran. To this end, we applied a hybrid Fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP (FDANP) model as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to determine the relative importance of different criteria, combined with geospatial and remote sensing data. In this regard, ten relevant sources of environmental criteria, including meteorological, topographical, and geomorphological, were used in the modeling. The statistical evaluation demonstrated the high potential of the developed approach for suitable location identification. Based on the final results, 6.10\% and 20.80\% of the study area were classified as very-high suitable and very-low suitable areas.

7036736,"Benefits Of Increasing Information Accuracy In Variable Rate Technologies","Improvements in the sustainability of agricultural production depend essentially on advances in the efficient use of nitrogen. Precision farming promises solutions in this respect. Variable rate technologies allow the right quantities of fertilizer to be applied at the right place. This helps to both maintain yields and avoid nitrogen losses. However, these technologies are still not widely adopted, especially in small-scale farming systems. Recent developments in sensing technologies, like drones or satellites, open up new opportunities for variable rate technologies. In this paper, we develop a bio-economic modelling framework to assess the usefulness of different sensing approaches in variable rate fertilization to measure environmental heterogeneity at field level, ranging from satellite imagery to drones and handheld N-sensors. We assess the utility of these sensing technologies and quantify the effects on yields, nitrogen input and associated net returns using wheat production in Switzerland as our case study. Our results show that net profits increase when a high-resolution technology is applied to fields which exhibit higher spatial heterogeneity of soil conditions and lower spatial autocorrelation of different soil types. However, even with a high degree of spatial heterogeneity within a field, both the overall utility of variable rate fertilization and the absolute differences in the net returns between the technologies remain low. Our results suggest that the additional cost of using a drone that provides the highest resolution should not exceed 4.5 CHF/ha compared to the use of a standard N-sensor or satellite imagery. Thus, the adoption of variable rate technologies depends essentially on the additional economic and environmental effects they generate. Therefore, it might be necessary to implement specific policy measures, such as taxes on nitrogen in combination with subsidies. Moreover, specific technology providers, such as contractors, may play a vital role in technology uptake since the economic benefits might only play out at larger spatial levels.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.107047","{""notes"": ""('spaeti_benefitsincreasinginformationaccuracy_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 21:22:26,"included",NA,NA

6863329,"Assessing The Role Of Climate And Resource Management On Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem Changes In Arid Environments With The Landsat Archive","Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function, their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate, groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8 under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary relationship studies.

Scientific estimation of crop cultivation areas and production levels is crucial for formulating agricultural policies linked to regulating food supply, which increasingly impacts the national economy. Conducting comprehensive on-site inspections for compliance monitoring of direct payment programs has shown very low efficiency in relation to budget and time. The expansion of areas subject to compliance monitoring and various challenges in on-site inspections necessitate streamlining current monitoring methods and devising effective strategies. As a solution, the application of Remote Sensing technology and spatial information utilization, allowing swift acquisition of necessary information for policies without overall on-site visits, is being discussed as an efficient compliance monitoring method. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential use of remote sensing for improving operational efficiency in monitoring compliance with public-interest direct payment programs.

Presently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology advancements are becoming increasingly popular in bushfire management systems because of their fundamental characteristics, such as manoeuvrability, autonomy, ease of deployment, and low cost. UAVs with remote-sensing capabilities are used with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep-learning algorithms to detect fire regions, make predictions, make decisions, and optimize fire-monitoring tasks.

7036987,"Both Real-Time And Long-Term Environmental Data Perform Well In Predicting Shorebird Distributions In Managed Habitat","Highly mobile species, such as migratory birds, respond to seasonal and interannual variability in resource availability by moving to better habitats. Despite the recognized importance of resource thresholds, species-distribution models typically rely on long-term average habitat conditions, mostly because large-extent, temporally resolved, environmental data are difficult to obtain. Recent advances in remote sensing make it possible to incorporate more frequent measurements of changing landscapes; however, there is often a cost in terms of model building and processing and the added value of such efforts is unknown. Our study tests whether incorporating real-time environmental data increases the predictive ability of distribution models, relative to using long-term average data. We developed and compared distribution models for shorebirds in California's Central Valley based on high temporal resolution (every 16 days), and 17-year long-term average surface water data. Using abundance-weighted boosted regression trees, we modeled monthly shorebird occurrence as a function of surface water availability, crop type, wetland type, road density, temperature, and bird data source. Although modeling with both real-time and long-term average data provided good fit to withheld validation data (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or AUC, averaged between 0.79 and 0.89 for all taxa), there were small differences in model performance. The best models incorporated long-term average conditions and spatial pattern information for real-time flooding (e.g., perimeter-area ratio of real-time water bodies). There was not a substantial difference in the performance of real-time and long-term average data models within time periods when real-time surface water differed substantially from the long-term average (specifically during drought years 2013-2016) and in intermittently flooded months or locations. Spatial predictions resulting from the models differed most in the southern region of the study area where there is lower water availability, fewer birds, and lower sampling density. Prediction uncertainty in the southern region of the study area highlights the need for increased sampling in this area. Because both sets of data performed similarly, the choice of which data to use may depend on the management context. Real-time data may ultimately be best for guiding dynamic, adaptive conservation actions, whereas models based on long-term averages may be more helpful for guiding permanent wetland protection and restoration.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/eap.2510","{""notes"": ""('conlisk_realtimetermenvironmental_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-10 01:02:50,"included",NA,NA

The current operating paradigm in practice is for satellites to passively collect data when they happen to fly over a disaster location. Conversely, this article considers the alternative approach of actively maneuvering satellites to fly directly overhead of the disaster site on a routine basis. Toward this end, we seek to compute a satellite constellation design that minimizes the expected maneuver costs for monitoring an unknown forest fire. In this article, we present a 2-stage stochastic programing model for this problem as well as a accelerated L-shaped decomposition approach. A comparison between our approach and the current operating paradigm indicates that our solution provides longer duration data collections and a greater number of data collections.

6903648,"Linking Geomatics And Participatory Social Analysis For Environmental Monitoring: Case Studies From Malawi","In this paper we demonstrate the need for linking geomatics and social analysis methodologies for enumerating and describing land-use change. Until recently, these two methods were used as distinct approaches at varying levels of inquiry. Using two case studies from Malawi, inductive and deductive approaches to land-use/landcover monitoring illustrate the utility of linking geomatics and social analysis as complementary tools. While both studies integrate geomatics with community-based social analysis, the starting point for each is different. The first case study begins by identifying where environmental change is occurring without preconceived hypotheses of causes. The use of geomatics in this case guides the researchers in determining where to conduct more in-depth analysis of explanations of change. The second case study begins with an environmental policy question - ""What has been the effect of market liberalization on the environment?"" - and then uses remote sensing to evaluate a set of hypotheses. This is the deductive approach. Regardless of the starting point, integrating geomatics and social analysis can promote a cycle of inductive and deductive research. In this way geomatics and social analysis not only address different questions but also can be used to verify and further develop contributions to nature-society dynamics.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3138/u52p-1r20-9l57-9373","{""notes"": ""('haan_linkinggeomaticsparticipatorysocial_2000',)""}","{maybe}",2024-09-26 00:44:32,"included",NA,NA

As a collective response, sections of the hydrologic community have recently forged partnerships for the development of space-borne missions for cost-effective, yet global, hydrologic measurements by building upon the technological advancements since the last two decades. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art on flood monitoring in medium and large ungauged basins where satellite remote sensing can facilitate development of a cost-effective mechanism. We present our review in the context of the current hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in flood-prone developing nations situated in international river basins (IRBs). Given the large number of such basins and the difficulty in acquisition of multi-faceted geophysical data, we argue that the conventional data-intensive implementation of physically based hydrologic models that are complex and distributed is time-consuming for global assessment of the utility of proposed global satellite hydrologic missions. A more parsimonious approach is justified at the tolerable expense of accuracy before such missions begin operation. Such a parsimonious approach can subsequently motivate the identified international basins to invest greater effort in conventional and detailed hydrologic studies to design a prototype flood forecasting system in an effort to overcome the hydro-political hurdles to flood monitoring. Through a modeling exercise involving an open-book watershed concept, we demonstrate the value of a parsimonious approach in understanding the utility of NASA-derived satellite rainfall products.

7037443,"Comparing The Hedging Effectiveness Of Weather Derivatives Based On Remotely Sensed Vegetation Health Indices And Meteorological Indices","Weather derivatives are considered a promising agricultural risk management tool. Station-based meteorological indices typically provide the data underlying these instruments. However, the main shortcoming of these weather derivatives is an imperfect correlation between the weather index and the yield of the insured crop, called basis risk. This paper considers three available remotely sensed vegetation health (VH) indices, namely, the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the vegetation health index (VHI), as indices for weather derivatives in a German case study. We investigated the correlation and period of highest correlation with winter wheat yield. Moreover, we analyzed whether the use of remotely sensed VH indices for weather derivatives can reduce basis risk and thus improve the performance of weather derivatives. The two commonly used meteorological indices, precipitation and temperature sums, were employed as benchmarks. Quantile regression and index value simulation were used for the design and pricing of the weather derivatives. The analysis for the selected farms and corresponding counties in northeastern Germany revealed that, on average, the VHI resulted in the highest correlation with winter wheat yield, and VHI-based weather derivatives were also superior in terms of the hedging effectiveness. The total periods of the highest correlations ranged from the beginning of April to the end of July. VHI- and VCI-based weather derivatives led to statistically significant reductions of basis risk, compared to the benchmarks. Our results indicate that the VHI-based weather derivatives can be useful alternatives to meteorological indices, especially in regions with sparser weather station networks.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/wcas-d-17-0127.1","{""notes"": ""('moellmann_comparinghedgingeffectivenessweather_2018',)""}","{}",2024-12-20 01:51:47,"included",NA,NA

In this study, we test the value of the recently launched, freely available Sentinel-2 (S2), as opposed to conventional Landsat 8 imagery in mapping the American bramble. Using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm, we seek to identify the optimal season for mapping the American bramble as well as the most influential bands in the classification process. Results show that Sentinel-2 out-performed Landsat 8 in all seasons, with summer providing the highest classification accuracy (77\% accuracy). The study also shows that strategically placed Sentinel-2 bands of Near Infrared, Red edge and Short Wave Infrared significantly contribute to an increase in overall bramble mapping accuracy.

7036570,"Understanding Measurement Reporting And Verification Systems For Redd+ As An Investment For Generating Carbon Benefits","Reducing emissions from forests-generating carbon credits-in return for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) payments represents a primary objective of forestry and development projects worldwide. Setting reference levels (RLs), establishing a target for emission reductions from avoided deforestation and degradation, and implementing an efficient monitoring system underlie effective REDD+ projects, as they are key factors that affect the generation of carbon credits. We analyzed the interdependencies among these factors and their respective weights in generating carbon credits. Our findings show that the amounts of avoided emissions under a REDD+ scheme mainly vary according to the monitoring technique adopted; nevertheless, RLs have a nearly equal influence. The target for reduction of emissions showed a relatively minor impact on the generation of carbon credits, particularly when coupled with low RLs. Uncertainties in forest monitoring can severely undermine the derived allocation of benefits, such as the REDD+ results-based payments to developing countries. Combining statistically-sound sampling designs with Lidar data provides a means to reduce uncertainties and likewise increases the amount of accountable carbon credits that can be claimed. This combined approach requires large financial resources; we found that results-based payments can potentially pay-off the necessary investment in technologies that would enable accurate and precise estimates of activity data and emission factors.

Resilience is the ability of the system to maintain trustworthy service delivery in spite of changes. Resilience of the EO infrastructure becomes an extremely important issue, especially in the disaster management domain. We propose to enable resilience through: 1) the use of grid resources and services to meet high performance computing requirements; and 2) assessment of resource reputation to select reliable resources. Grid services enable redundancy through integration of heterogeneous resources administrated by geographically distributed organizations. The same services could be provided by different organizations within the infrastructure, and could be of different levels of quality. Therefore, we propose to incorporate a utility-based reputation model to assess reliability of the resources.

Therefore, this study analyses the agro-ecological, economic and social benefits of - and the institutional challenges to - establishing index-based insurance markets to catalyse rural development in Syria. The paper examines the potential of three index insurance schemes for minimizing risk: (1) a statistical index, (2) an index based on agro-meteorological approach and (3) a remote sensing-based index. It also discusses how index-based insurance markets contribute to rural development in scenarios of increasing climate risks. The study identifies that all three insurance schemes have a very high potential to cope with increasing climate risk. Insurance schemes designed according to these indexes performed very well in terms of covering revenue losses in most of the extreme drought years observed in the country. Farmers purchasing an insurance contract may have better access to credit and find it easier to invest in agricultural production and improve productivity.

Community studies, such as those deployed by NASA's Surface Biology and Geology and ESA's Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment, have offered new and tangible insights into user needs that are then incorporated into overall mission planning and design. These technologies and tools will be key to develop and consolidate downstream services for users and resource management, given the current pressures on the environment posed by climate change and population growth. This process has highlighted the degree to which planned mission capabilities are responsive to community needs. In this study, we analyze user requirements belonging to the Italian Copernicus User Forum and to the user pool of NASA's Surface Biology and Geology community for the synergic use of hyperspectral imaging technology, providing a reference for the development of earth observation services and the consolidation of existing ones. In addition, potential cross-mission coordination is analyzed to highlight key benefits-(a) addressing shared community needs around products requiring more frequent temporal revisit and (b) shared resources and community expertise around algorithm development. This paper discusses the critical role of early engagement with users to establish a community of practice ready to work with high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy data sets. The main outcome is a guide for the synergetic use of hyperspectral mission and data together with the identification of the main gaps between user needs and satellite capabilities influencing the development of key national and trans-national downstream services. In this research we have analyzed needs of users to understand how to develop and improve earth observation downstream services. Hyperspectral imaging provides information across the electromagnetic spectrum in more detail than multispectral imaging, allowing more specific analysis and accurate identification of materials and substances. The users in this study belong to the Italian Copernicus User Forum and to the NASA Surface Biology and Geology community which provided requirements respectively for ESA's Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment and NASA's Surface Biology and Geology. This work identifies common users and examines the advantages of potential synergy between these hyperspectral satellites for responding to their needs. This analysis shows that the synergy would bring significant advantages in terms of improved revisit time and represents an opportunity to address shared community needs around product and algorithm development.

7037338,"To Pay Or Not To Pay? Monitoring Performance And Enforcing Conditionality When Paying For Forest Conservation In Mexico","Paying landowners to conserve forests is a promising new strategy to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. However to succeed with this approach, programme managers need reliable monitoring data to make informed payment decisions. This includes withholding payment from landowners who do not meet conservation objectives. The monitoring method used for the Monarch Butterfly Conservation Fund compared aerial photographs and conducted field sampling to identify forest changes. The comparison of aerial photographs showed that 161 hectares of forest were degraded in the central core zone of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico between 2001 and 2003. As a result, payment was withheld from one of 13 landowners. Analysis of high resolution (0.6 m) digital aerial photographs did not detect finer scale changes, despite obtaining an average pixel resolution 1000 times greater than Landsat satellite imagery. This suggests that current payment for ecosystem services programmes are underestimating environmental change and overpaying non-compliant participants. In addition, selecting a decision rule to enforce payment conditionality raised new questions about how much ecosystem degradation should be permitted before withholding payment. Sound decisions about withholding payment cannot be developed until the marginal value of ecosystem services is better understood.

An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-km(2) resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5' resolution. Costs of habitat protection and area requirements for reserves may be severely underestimated when conservation planning relies only on coarse-scale data, which may result in notable shortcomings in conservation target achievement. Improvements in conservation benefits far outweigh the additional costs of acquiring fine-scale data.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1017/s0376892912000331","{""notes"": ""('jantke_benefitsearthobservationdata_2013',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:43:26,"included",NA,NA

These satellites were maneuvered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to approximately 60 degrees W, enabling other countries in Central and South America to benefit from their ongoing measurements. The extended usefulness of GOES-10 and -12 was only possible as a result of a new image geolocalization system developed by NOAA for correcting image distortions and evaluated in collaboration with the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. The extension allowed GOES-10 and -12 to monitor SA for an additional 7 years proving the efficiency of this navigation capability implemented for the first time in the GOES series well beyond the expected satellites' lifetime. Such successful capability is incorporated in the new-generation GOES-R series. This practical and technological experience shows the importance of communication between scientists from the United States and SA for advancing Earth's monitoring system through the development of novel software and derived products. For SA in particular, GOES-10 and -12 were employed operationally to monitor dry spells, relevant for agriculture and forest fire management and to nowcast severe weather for flash flood warnings. Additionally, GOES-12 detected the first registered tropical hurricane over the Brazilian coast.

In addition, CBFM enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore, CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations, governments and forest data end-users, particularly those engaged in forestry, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation projects such as REDD+.",2014,"{""Koh, Lian Pin"",""McCall, Michael K."",""Napoletano, Brian M."",""Paneque-Galvez, Jaime"",""Wich, Serge A.""}","article",NA,"10.3390/f5061481","{""notes"": ""('panequegalvez_dronescommunitybasedforest_2014',)""}","{}",2024-09-27 23:36:45,"included",NA,NA

6903653,"Costs And Benefits Of Satellite-Based Tools For Irrigation Management","This paper presents the results of a collaborative work with farmers and a cost-benefit analysis of geospatial technologies applied to irrigation water management in a semi-arid agricultural area in Lower Austria. We use Earth observation (Eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (Et) and webGlS technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers. The study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments. The calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers. In most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops. At the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types. Our data clearly indicates that economic benefits could be achieved by reducing irrigation volumes, especially for water-intensive crops. Regarding the qualitative evaluation, most of the farmers expressed a very positive interest in the provided information. In particular, information related to crop ET was appreciated as this helps to make better informed decisions on irrigation. The majority of farmers (54\%) also expressed a general willingness to pay, either directly or via cost sharing, for such a service. Based on different cost scenarios, we calculated the cost of the service. Considering 20,000 ha regularly irrigated land, the advisory service would cost between 2.5 and 4.3 (sic)/ha per year depending on the type of satellite data used. For comparison, irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 /ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters per ha.

First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information.

The second support is the short-term update of the location of initial registration facilities and first reception facilities, their capacities, and their occupancy. The third support level is the systematic inquiry for unoccupied housing facilities and for empty places within build-up areas. For this purpose Geo-coded datasets of house numbers have to be cross-referenced with city maps and communal inhabitants address data. However, the paper will not disclose scientific progress in Earth Observation and GIS, but will actually demonstrate that a new combination of existing methods is required to support actual data needs for improved refugee management and integration. The examples show that EO/GIS cannot only theoretically provide societal benefits.

7037759,"Climate Data For The European Forestry Sector: From End-User Needs To Opportunities For Climate Resilience","The aim of this study is to assess the potential of Earth Observation and climate data for the forestry sector focusing on the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Although forestry researchers recognize the importance of Earth Observation and climate data, forestry practitioners currently work mainly with land cover information, largely neglecting climate data. Understanding its potential for the forestry sector becomes thus important, as to align the vast offer of climate services in Europe to different forestry users and stakeholders' necessities. Interviews, surveys, and dedicated workshops were used to collect a series of forestry end-users' needs and requirements regarding climate data. End-user's requirements were categorized through a SWOT analysis, which allowed to identify perceived internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats to the increased use of the C3S. Results indicate that improved climate services for the forestry sector based on C3S data would benefit from enhanced training on the use of climate data, improved provision of services integrating climate with non-climate data, the provision of new variables and indicators, and the integration of machine learning techniques for developing data and information in support of the deployment of climate services. These findings are relevant to close the gap between demand and supply of climate services for the forestry sector and provide a basis for further exploring the value of climate data in serving a wide array of forestry stakeholders. Going forward, increased knowledge on user requirements from both forest practitioners and policy-makers can be beneficial to develop accessible tailored services.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100247","{""notes"": ""('fraccaroli_climatedataeuropeanforestry_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:41:29,"included",NA,NA
6691601,"Cost and value of multidisciplinary fixed-point ocean observatories","Sustained ocean observations are crucial to understand both natural processes occurring in the ocean and human influence on the marine ecosystems. The information they provide increases our understanding and is therefore beneficial to the society as a whole because it contributes to a more efficient use and protection of the marine environment, upon which human livelihood depends. In addition the oceans, which occupy 73% of the planet surface and host 93% of the biosphere, play a massive role in controlling the climate. Eulerian or fixed-point observatories are an essential component of the global ocean observing system as they provide several unique features that cannot be found in other systems and are therefore complementary to them. In addition they provide a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, combining physical, chemical and biological observations on several time scales. The fixed-point open ocean observatory network (FixO3) integrates the 23 European open ocean fixed-point observatories in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. The programme also seeks to improve access to key installations and the knowledge they provide for the wider community, from scientists, to businesses, to civil society. This paper summarises the rationale behind open ocean observatories monitoring the essential ocean variables. It also provides an estimate of the costs to operate a typical fixed-point observatory such as those included in the FixO3 network. Finally an assessment of the type of data and services provided by ocean observations and their value to society is also given.",2016,"{""Cristini, Luisa""}","ARTICLE",NA,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2016.05.029","{}","{maybe}",2024-04-26 19:44:29,"included",NA,NA

The empirical estimation results provide several useful implications for water resource management. First, the precipitation of this region is significantly affected by El Niño Southern Oscillation events, which increases the uncertainty of regional water supply. Secondly, the damage caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation events to this regional water market could reach up to NT$ 146 million (i.e., US$ 4.56 million). Finally, the possible water management strategies, which include water transfer activities among different demand groups, with a perfect El Niño Southern Oscillation forecast could substantially mitigate the damage and result in a benefit of NT$ 370 million (i.e., US$ 11.56 million).",2010,"{""Liao, Shu-Yi""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.09.008","{}","{}",2024-04-26 22:54:37,"included",NA,NA

A variety of parameters can be inferred via altimeter measurements, including sea surface height, sea surface wind speeds, significant wave heights, and topography of land, sea ice, and ice sheets. Taking advantage of these parameters with the long record of altimeter data spanning multiple decades has allowed a diverse range of societal applications. As the constellation of altimeter satellites grows, the proven value of the missions to a diverse user community can now be demonstrated by highlighting a selection of verifiable success stories. In this paper, we review selected altimeter success stories that incorporate altimetry data, alone or in conjunction with numerical models or other Earth observations, to solve a key societal problem. First, we define the problem or the key challenge of each use case, and then we articulate the uptake of the successful altimeter-based solution. Our review revealed steady progress by scientific and stakeholder communities in bridging the gap between data availability and their actual uptake to address a variety of applications. Highlighting these altimeter-based success stories can serve to further promote the widespread adoption of future satellite missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission scheduled for launch in 2022.

The valuation of government-owned satellite systems providing a public good with a complex array of instruments is a nascent field of study. Many different sensor configurations are possible, but there are restrictions due to physical and budget constraints. Accounting for economic considerations during the design and planning phase for satellite constellations helps to ensure that the most cost effective instruments are selected. To assess whether the HSS instrument should be included on GeoXO, we applied a value of information approach and found the benefits associated with this instrument are likely to substantially outweigh the costs. Value of information studies often focus on data and information that has a direct use case. Estimating benefits for the HSS is especially challenging because data are not used directly by decision makers. Instead these data along with information from other Earth observing (EO) satellites play a key role in producing the inputs necessary for modern numerical hydrometeorological modeling. We describe strategies to assess the marginal (i.e., incremental) contribution of an instrument that is part of a complex information production process. We make several recommendations that, if implemented, would improve the quality of future studies of this kind. This includes (1) a systems approach to observing system planning, (2) improving the design of observing system experiments (OSSE and OSE), and (3) better tracking of the decisions and needs of end-users, especially those external to the agency.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/fenvs.2021.749044","{""notes"": ""('lauer_estimatingsocietalbenefitssatellite_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 22:31:34,"included",NA,NA
7037346,"Supporting Operational Site-Specific Fertilization In Rice Cropping Systems With Infield Smartphone Measurements And Sentinel-2 Observations","Due to the low efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers in flooded rice paddies, there is a rising demand for tools able to detect crop nitrogen status in space and time to allow farmers to use the technical novelties of precision agriculture to improve fertilizer management in extensive fields. This work sets up an operational approach to increase nitrogen use efficiency of top-dressing fertilization by supporting variable rate fertilization in rice cropping systems. The procedure exploits (i) crop modelling to identify best periods for fertilization (When), (ii) Sentinel-2 imagery to draw management zones (MZ) and lead field scouting (Where), and (iii) smartphone app to measure nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) (How much). Automatically generated MZ from Sentinel-2 data were able to identify within field patches with different nutritional status and NNI data well described the crop temporal dynamic in relation to crop development and nutritional needs. The workflow was implemented to provide farmers with timely information on plant nutritional status during the 2018 growing season to define site-specific fertilization strategies implemented with variable rate technology (VRT). Tests conducted on 6 fields over 30 ha in 3 farms showed the feasibility of the proposed workflow in real farming conditions allowing a reduction of applied fertilizer up to 25\% in the areas with sufficient nutritional status. Demonstration revealed that VRT based on geospatial information from integrated in-field and satellite data can provide agronomic and environmental benefits compared with standard fertilization resulting in promising outcomes both in terms of yield (increase in the range 0.2-0.5 t ha(-1)) and nitrogen use efficiency (increase up to 7.8\%).",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s11119-021-09784-0","{""notes"": ""('nutini_supportingoperationalsitespecific_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-10 01:10:03,"included",NA,NA
6691628,"Value of information for climate observing systems","The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system. As illustration, the VOI for the proposed spaceborne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne systems is computed. Depending on details of the decision context, the VOI ranges from 2 to 30 trillion US dollars.",2014,"{""Cooke, Roger""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-013-9451-8","{}","{}",2024-04-25 02:40:40,"included",NA,NA

6691530,"Valuing User Preferences for Geospatial Fire Monitoring in Guatemala","Like many landscapes across Central America, forests in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) are increasingly susceptible to forest fire, with most forest fires resulting from untended agricultural fires. Fire damage poses significant risk to the MBR’s natural resources and cultural heritage, but budget challenges limit the capacity of national, regional, and local institutions to effectively detect, monitor, and control forest fires. The Geospatial Information System for Fire Management (SIGMA-I) is a United States government-subsidized suite of geospatial fire management tools that are widely disseminated, free of charge, to land managers and other users in Guatemala for on-the-ground fire prevention and response. Provision of SIGMA-I geospatial data and tools such as daily thermal “hotspot” maps provide positive benefits for sustainable fire management. However, little research exists supporting the nonmarket monetary value of geospatial fire monitoring tools and their component features. We used a choice experiment to estimate land managers’ willingness to pay for individual attributes of SIGMA-I hotspot mapping in Guatemala. We found quantitative evidence of positive willingness to pay for geospatial data, demonstrating positive nonmarket value of geospatial data for sustainable fire management in developing countries and regions where agricultural fires are common. Our results indicate strong preferences from Guatemala’s forest fire management community for improving the frequency of hotspot reporting and reducing detection of erroneous hotspots. As the availability of geospatial data increases, use of tools like SIGMA-I has the potential to significantly improve fire management, especially in regions where funding and resources for fire management are scarce. Our results support continued multinational funding for tools like SIGMA-I for forest fire management in Guatemala and other developing countries.",2021,"{""Berenter, Jared""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.3390/su132112077","{}","{}",2024-04-22 23:38:29,"included",NA,NA

However, historically its application has been limited by high costs associated with data acquisition, analysis, and classification. In recent years, freely available satellite imagery and geospatial data sets and rapid advancement in data analysis capabilities provide immense opportunities to understand and solve the real-world environmental problems. Open-source platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide a planetary-scale environmental science data and analyses capability at much greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional workflows.

We identified eight major LULC classes with an overall accuracy of 86\% and Kappa value of 79\%. We completed all remote sensing data analyses procedures including data retrieval, classification, and report preparation in the Jupyter notebook, an open-source web application. Computation time for the procedure was less than 15 min. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for conducting land use and land cover analysis using much less time, money, and human resources.

Using open-source platforms like Google Earth Engine, the approach streamlines training sample generation and assesses diverse machine learning algorithms on pre- and post-disaster Landsat images. The innovation lies in its semi-automatic training sample generation methodology, reducing time and manual effort for accurate land cover mapping and addressing the challenge of crafting training samples in disaster settings. The methodology was tested on the 2010 Chilean earthquake and tsunami, revealing a 45% increase in sediment cover and a 15% reduction in water cover, underlining vast landscape alterations. SVM stood out for its consistent accuracy. To validate the methodological robustness and broaden its applicability, we replicated the procedures using diverse land cover collection, including ESA WorldCover 10 m and Dynamic World. This comprehensive validation encompassed varied catastrophic events, extending the methodology’s relevance beyond its original scope. The consistent findings across different scenarios underscored the method’s robustness and underscored its potential for broader utilization. This streamlined, cost-effective approach suits multiple land cover products, setting the stage for constant Earth feature monitoring.

With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder-oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.",2009,"{""Bouma, J.

7036738,"Earth Observations Into Action: The Systemic Integration Of Earth Observation Applications Into National Risk Reduction Decision Structures","Purpose: As stated in the United Nations Global Assessment Report 2022 Concept Note, decision-makers everywhere need data and statistics that are accurate, timely, sufficiently disaggregated, relevant, accessible and easy to use. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate scalable and replicable methods to advance and integrate the use of earth observation (EO), specifically ongoing efforts within the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Work Programme and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Work Plan, to support risk-informed decision-making, based on documented national and subnational needs and requirements. Design/methodology/approach: Promotion of open data sharing and geospatial technology solutions at national and subnational scales encourages the accelerated implementation of successful EO applications. These solutions may also be linked to specific Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) 2015–2030 Global Targets that provide trusted answers to risk-oriented decision frameworks, as well as critical synergies between the Sendai Framework and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This paper provides examples of these efforts in the form of platforms and knowledge hubs that leverage latest developments in analysis ready data and support evidence-based DRR measures. Findings: The climate crisis is forcing countries to face unprecedented frequency and severity of disasters. At the same time, there are growing demands to respond to policy at the national and international level. EOs offer insights and intelligence for evidence-based policy development and decision-making to support key aspects of the Sendai Framework. The GEO DRR Working Group and CEOS Working Group Disasters are ideally placed to help national government agencies, particularly national Sendai focal points to learn more about EOs and understand their role in supporting DRR.

These factors could trigger an increase of chronic diseases and various other health concerns that would bear a heavy weight on finances worldwide. Scientific advances can play an important role in solving a number of these problems, space technology; in general, can propose a panoply of possible solutions and applications that can make life on Earth easier and better for everyone. Satellites, Earth Observation, the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Space Agency (ESA) may not be the first tools that come to mind when thinking of improving health, yet there are many ways in which ESA and its programmes contribute to the health care arena. The research focuses on quantifying two ESA spin-offs to provide an initial view on how space can contribute to worldwide health. This quantification is part of the present strategy not only to show macroeconomic return factors for space in general, but also to identify and describe samples of 'best practice' type of examples close to the general public's interest. For each of the 'best practices' the methodology takes into account the cost of the space hardware/software, a number of tangible and intangible benefits, as well as some logical assumptions in order to determine the potential overall returns.

7038214,"Remote Sensing In Support For Monitoring Rice In The Senegal Catchment","Senegal River catchment represents a vital source for its four riparian countries Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, which cooperate within the interstate agency OMVS (Senegal River Basin Development Authority). The key issue of integrated water resources management addressed major challenges, especially with climate change. Satellite imagery represents thus a relevant and inexpensive source of data for observing land use changes at large scale and thus provides management support. In this context, MOSIS project (Monitoring of Observations from Satellites for Innovative Services) arose based on a ""Living Lab"" approach between SOGED, CACG and E2L. Based on the needs of end-users, an operational tool was co-designed in a single year to localise and quantify rice producing areas using Sentinel 2 satellite imagery and Web resources. The purpose of the created WebGIS was to improve the recovery rate of the irrigation fee. Many added values have emerged when used in the field: improved identification of water users and land management, an access to water use history, performance of field agents and improved communication with users and other partners. As a first step, the Senegal River Delta alone was investigated where 80\% of irrigated surfaces are. Next steps are (1) the functional improvement of the WebGIS and the satellite image processing, (2) capacity building of SOGED, (3) regulatory certification of the tool and (4) extension of the study zone to the catchment area. The created Geo-Web service also aroused a great deal of interest among different partners and state structures. It enabled to bring out several ideas of other potential services that would rely on WEB resources and remote sensing in order to estimate spatialised, reliable and permanent management indicators on the Senegal catchment.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1051/lhb/2020049","{""notes"": ""('lefrancq_remotesensingsupportmonitoring_2020',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 00:12:32,"included",NA,NA

However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data-as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases-is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting-as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases-novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs11151797","{""notes"": ""('wyngaard_emergentchallengessciencesuas_2019',)""}","{}",2024-09-26 00:51:24,"included",NA,NA
7037208,"Fire Spread Predictions: Sweeping Uncertainty Under The Rug","Predicting fire spread and behavior correctly is crucial to minimize the dramatic consequences of wildfires. However, our capability of accurately predicting fire spread is still very limited, undermining the utility of such simulations to support decision-making. Improving fire spread predictions for fire management purposes, by using higher quality input data or enhanced models, can be expensive, unfeasible or even impossible. Fire managers would benefit from fast and inexpensive ways of improving their decision-making. In the present work, we focus on i) understanding if fire spread predictions can be improved through model parameter calibration based on information collected from a set of large historical wildfires in Portugal; and ii) understanding to what extent decreasing parametric uncertainty can counterbalance the impact of input data uncertainty. Our results obtained with the Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) modeling system show that fire spread predictions can be continuously improved by 'learning' from past wildfires. The uncertainty contained in the major input variables (wind speed and direction, ignition location and fuel models) can be 'swept under the rug' through the use of more appropriate parameter sets. The proposed framework has a large potential to improve future fire spread predictions, increasing their reliability and usefulness to support fire management and decision making processes, thus potentially reducing the negative impacts of wildfires.

7037803,"Advanced Processing Of Multiplatform Remote Sensing Imagery For The Monitoring Of Coastal And Mountain Ecosystems","Coastal areas are key to sustaining biodiversity, but their complexity and variability makes their analysis challenging. On the other hand, mountain ecosystems include a large percentage of the global biodiversity and their monitoring is essential, as they are especially vulnerable to climate change. In this context, remote sensing offers a cost-effective technology for the conservation of both kinds of natural areas. In this work, multispectral and hyperspectral data recorded by sensors, onboard satellites, aircrafts and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), have been used for the sustainable management of natural resources. Specifically, a multiplatform methodology has been developed to process multisensor high spatial resolution imagery and the main benefits and drawbacks of each technology have been identified. Advanced processing techniques in each stage of the methodology have been selected to provide accurate and validated benthic and vegetation maps. Two challenging ecosystems, located in Cabrera and Teide National Parks, have been selected for this study. They correspond with a coastal and a mountain island ecosystem, respectively. To address the associated challenges, the use of imagery with the maximum spatial and spectral resolution, provided by Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, CASI and Pika-L, has been considered. Results have been validated with in-situ data and by the National Parks' managers and they have shown the ability of remote sensing to accurately map both Parks when the appropriate imagery and techniques are selected. The best performance was achieved with the Support Vector Machine classifier and, in general, WorldView can be considered the most appropriate platform when factoring in cost, coverage and accuracy.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1109/access.2020.3046657","{""notes"": ""('marcello_advancedprocessingmultiplatformremote_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:17:26,"included",NA,NA

The aim of the present study was to develop a methodology for characterising fuel models using low-density and free LiDAR data that facilitate the work of managers of protected territories. Field inventories were carried out in order to understand the characteristics of the stand and the variables that fuel models must include. This information, together with the use of the intensity and structure provided by LiDAR, was used to perform statistical analyses. The linear regressions obtained to characterise the stand of the mixed Quercus spp.-Pinus ssp.-dominated stand had an R-2 value ranging from 0.4393 to 0.66. While working with low-density LiDAR data (which has more difficulties crossing the canopy), in addition to the obtained results, we performed the statistical analysis of the dominant stand to obtain models with R-2 values ranging from 0.8201 to 0.8677. The results of this research show that low-density LiDAR data are significant; however, in mixed stands, it is necessary to only use the dominant stratum because other components generate noise, which reduces the predictive capacity of the models. Additionally, by using the decision tree developed in combination, it is possible to update the mapping of fuel models in inaccessible areas, thereby significantly reducing costs.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/f12081011","{""notes"": ""('ferrerpalomino_fuelmodellingcharacterisationlow_2021',)""}","{}",2024-09-30 21:20:44,"included",NA,NA
6447804,"The value of remotely-sensed data in terrestrial habitat corridor design for large migratory species","Cost-effective conservation program design to support seasonal migratory species is urgently needed, but to-date has received little attention by economists. Conserving migratory corridors is a complicated design problem because of the large spatial scales over which migratory species can travel and the weakest-link characteristic of the problem. If one section or area of a potential migratory corridor is unable to support species movement, the migration through that route will not be successful. We develop and apply an integer-programming modeling approach that leverages innovative new data products to propose a costeffective, landscape-scale conservation planning approach. We apply our approach to the Cody elk herd range within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), leveraging satellite data on crop type and density over time and GPS collar data on elk migrations. We provide empirical evidence that using new satellite data products can avoid unconnected corridors and increase the cost effectiveness of corridor construction. In the Cody context, we estimate that achieving the conservation outcome associated with using satellite data on both costs and beneﬁts would cost close to twice as much when using satellite beneﬁt data but only limited cost data and about three times as much when using satellite cost data but only limited beneﬁt data. Empirical work across additional herds is needed to provide additional insights into characteristics of contexts under which we expect gains from satellite and/or GPS collar data.",2022,"{""Gigliotti, Laura"",""Kroetz, Kailin"",""Leonard, Bryan"",""Middleton, Arthur""}","report",NA,NA,"{""url"": ""https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/the-value-of-remotely-sensed-data-in-terrestrial-habitat-corridor-design-for-largely-migratory-species/"", ""date"": ""2022-01-19"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://media.rff.org/documents/WP_22-21_rGlUga4.pdf"", ""place_published"": ""Washington, D.C."", ""database_provider"": ""Zotero""}","{benchmark}",NA,NA,NA,NA

6903598,"Cloud Cover And Its Impact On Brazil's Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Program: Evidence From The Cerrado Biome Of The Brazilian Legal Amazon","The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7\% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US\$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102651","{""notes"": ""(\""sales_cloudcoverimpactbrazil's_2022\"",)""}","{}",2024-09-26 01:03:50,"included",NA,NA
7038069,"A Review Of Approaches For Automated Habitat Mapping And Their Potential Added Value For Biodiversity Monitoring Projects","Habitats are important indicators of biodiversity in their own right, as well as being linked to species, hence their widespread use in reporting on nature conservation planning and policy. For reporting consistent mapping and monitoring habitat extent and change is important. Remote Sensing techniques are becoming an important tool for this. In this paper we describe four examples of methods of semi-automated mapping using Remote Sensing. Because the most effective way of improving the accuracy of the estimation of habitat area is by increasing the sample number, it is important to develop methods for reducing in situ surveys which are expensive. Remote Sensing has the major advantage of comprehensive coverage and the four examples illustrate the potential of extrapolation from semi-automated habitat classifications. The potential for using these methods at national scales is likely to be limited by the need for validation of the automated images and the subsequent calculation of error terms. Existing major national monitoring programs are described, which still use mainly traditional in situ methods. The selection of relatively small numbers of representative samples from environmental classifications to obtain regional estimates reduces the need for large numbers of in situ survey sites and is therefore discussed. The recent development of the use of drones to acquire detailed imagery to support in situ habitat surveys is also covered. Finally, practical problems linked to the methods described in the paper are considered, as in some cases these will override the theoretical benefits of a particular approach. It is concluded that automated methods can enhance existing monitoring systems and should be considered in any biodiversity monitoring system as they represent an opportunity for reducing costs, if integrated with an in situ program. © 2019 Sciendo.

7038595,"Organisational Drivers For, Constraints On And Impacts Of Decision And Information Support Tool Use In Desertification Policy And Management","Arguments for the potential benefits that environmental decision and information support tools (DISTs) bring to managing complex environmental issues like desertification are well rehearsed. However our empirical understanding of the reasons why particular DISTs are or are not used by different policy and management organisations, and the impacts they have on the work of those organisations is substantially weaker. Such understanding is needed to determine whether concerns raised in the literature about poor adoption and use of DISTs are correct, to understand why, and to remedy them. This paper presents a thematic analysis of 31 exploratory interviews with representatives of 14 desertification policy and management organisations operating at different scales about their use of DISTs: specifically GIS. remote sensing, simulation models, statistical models and DSS. DISTs of all types were found to be used along with other sources of decision and information support including hard-copy maps, aerial photography, databases, academic literature and local participation. GIS was most widely used, by 9 of the organisations interviewed. From the interview data a generic conceptual model identifying the organisational drivers for, constraints on and impacts of DIST use in desertification policy and management organisations is developed and discussed. Drivers were grouped into those concerned with system attributes (e.g. ease of use, flexibility) and those concerned with how information is used organisationally (e.g. to facilitate communication, assessment of desertification). Barriers including DIST information attributes such as reliability and uncertainty, and additional financial investment arising from training, employment and infrastructure procurement were identified. Impacts were grouped into structural changes, individual work changes and financial investment needs. No systematic variation was evident in the drivers, constraints or impacts of use according to DIST type, although GIS was the most widely used DIST and consequently was associated with a larger number of each., Results are discussed in relation to existing theory and evidence on information system and DSS adoption and use, and found to be in agreement. The paper finishes with a set of recommended improvements to DIST design processes to enhance the uptake of and positive benefits associated with use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional tools based on the value of information are sometimes difficult to apply. When risks are traded in a market, it may be possible to use market instruments to monetize the reductions in uncertainty. This paper illustrates such market-based methods with a satellite system designed to reduce uncertainty in predicting soil moisture in the USA. Soil moisture is a key variable in managing agricultural production and predicting crop yields. Using data on corn and soybean futures, we find that a 30% reduction in the weather-related component of uncertainty in corn and soybean futures pricing yields a yearly US consumer surplus of $1.44 billion. The total present value of information from the satellite system for the USA—calculated with a 3% discount rate—is about $22 billion, assuming the system is in operation for 20 years.

6903481,"Satellite Imagery As A Single Source Of Predictor Variables For Habitat Suitability Modelling: How Landsat Can Inform The Conservation Of A Critically Endangered Lemur","1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain. © 2010 The Authors.

This study aims to manage potential flood risks, and Tikrit city was used as a case study. The daily discharge of the Tigris River in the study area was provided by the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources from 2019 to 2022. The HEC-RAS software was utilized to build a 2-D flood model to simulate potential flood scenarios. First, the model was calibrated by adjusting the value of Manning's coefficient (n), and it was found that n = 0.031 reflects the nature of the region because the Nash-Sutcliff Error (NSE) was 0.93. Then, the efficiency of the 2-D flood model was verified by comparing the model’s results with the study area’s satellite images, and the results showed a great match. Following that, the 2-D model was used under different flooding scenarios. The results showed that the size of areas exposed to flooding increased with the discharges passing through the Tigris River. For instance, increasing the discharge to 800m3/s increased the flooded areas by 13.7%, while increasing the discharge to 1500 m3/s increased the flooded areas by 90.7 % compared to the river’s normal flow. Also, the results showed that the eastern regions of the riverbanks are more vulnerable to flooding than the western side because the ground levels are low on the eastern side compared to the western part of the riverbanks. © 2023 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, TIKRIT UNIVERSITY.",2023,"{""Khairallah, R.

Affordable drones may contribute to cost-effective detection of illegal fishing activity and associated gear, although their application has yet to be evaluated in many types of fisheries. Here, the utility of drones for the detection of crab traps and floats set in a shallow estuary was quantitatively tested, and the effects of survey altitudes, cameras and monitor screens on detection rates were determined. It was found that drone flight altitude and float colour influenced the detection rates of common crab trap floats, with infrared cameras improving the detection of floats camouflaged by black paint. However, the type of monitor screen used by the drone operator had no influence on the detection of crab traps.

Advances induced by digital innovation have positively impacted this sector and could have a considerable impact by reducing the risk of food insecurity. In this chapter, applied research experiences conducted in Morocco have been reported to highlight some of the opportunities that digital transformation can offer in agriculture. First, agricultural land management was approached through remote monitoring of agricultural land and mapping of cropland using satellite imageries and machine learning. Then, the question of what digital can offer for the management of agricultural water resources was discussed through two examples: the first deals with the use of remote sensing and modeling to support irrigation water management; and the second is related to another aspect of multi-year bioeconomic modeling for predicting changes in water management indicators. Finally, experiences on the importance of digital transformation in risk management were discussed in order to analyze the risks in a more informed way and to relate aspects that could not be connected before in the past, in an efficient and relevant manner. Indeed, an experiment on the evaluation of spatial variability of wheat yield has been reported and an example of the spatial analysis of risk related to losses in production value using satellite data was discussed. With steps added or substituted compared to the research presented in this chapter, digital innovation allows precise monitoring of agricultural land and offers socio-economic conditions that are more advantageous for farmers. Overall, all of the experiences cited on the use of digital innovation in the agriculture sector can be extended to other contexts, particularly in Africa where sustainable agricultural development remains the ultimate goal. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

6691680,"Value of perfect ENSO phase predictions for agriculture: evaluating the impact of land tenure and decision objectives","In many places, predictions of regional climate variability associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon offer the potential to improve farmers’ decision outcomes, by mitigating the negative impacts of adverse conditions or by taking advantage of favorable conditions. While the notion that climate forecasts are potentially valuable has been established, questions of when they may be more or less valuable have proven harder to resolve. Using simulations, we estimate the expected value of seasonal climate information under alternative assumptions about (a) land tenure (ownership vs. short-term leases) and (b) the decision maker’s objective function (expected utility vs. prospect theory value function maximization), employing a full range of plausible parameter values for each objective function. This allows us to show the extent to which the value of information depends on risk preferences, loss aversion, wealth levels and expectations, as well as situational constraints. Our results demonstrate in a non-laboratory decision context that, in some cases, psychologically plausible deviations from expected utility maximization can lead to substantial differences in estimates of the expected value of climate forecasts. Efforts to foster effective use of climate information and forecasts in agriculture must be grounded in a firm understanding of the goals, objectives and constraints of decision makers.",2009,"{""Letson, David""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9600-8","{}","{}",2024-04-23 22:37:12,"included",NA,NA
7037875,"Mapping Regional Land Cover With Modis Data For Biological Conservation: Examples From The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Usa And Para State, Brazil","The paper investigated the application of MODIS data for mapping regional land cover at moderate resolutions (250 and 500 in), for regional conservation purposes. Land cover maps were generated for two major conservation areas (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem-GYE, USA and the Par State, Brazil) using MODIS data and decision tree classifications. The MODIS land cover products were evaluated using existing Landsat TM land cover maps as reference data. The Landsat TM land cover maps were processed to their fractional composition at the MODIS resolution (250 and 500 m). In GYE, the MODIS land cover was very successful at mapping extensive cover types (e.g. coniferous forest and grasslands) and far less successful at mapping smaller habitats (e.g. wetlands, deciduous tree cover) that typically occur in patches that are smaller than the MODIS pixels, but are reported to be very important to biodiversity conservation. The MODIS classification for Para State was successful at producing a regional forest/non-forest product which is useful for monitoring the extreme human impacts such as deforestation. The ability of MODIS data to map secondary forest remains to be tested, since regrowth typically harbors reduced levels of biodiversity. The two case studies showed the value of using multi-date 250 m data with only two spectral bands, as well as single day 500 in data with seven spectral bands, thus illustrating the versatile use of MODIS data in two contrasting environments. MODIS data provide new options for regional land cover mapping that are less labor-intensive than Landsat and have higher resolution than previous 1 km AVHRR or the current 1 km global land cover product. The usefulness of the MODTS data in addressing biodiversity conservation questions will ultimately depend upon the patch sizes of important habitats and the land cover transformations that threaten them.

7037777,"Keeping Up With Remote Sensing And Gi Advances- Policy And Legal Perspectives","Technological advances in remote sensing capabilities, wider participation of commercial firms and the possibilities of 'processing' spatial data to create value-added information have given rise to a range of policy and legal issues in the geographic information (GI) field. How far satellite images can still be considered a 'public good', conflicts between commercial and national interests is becoming a major issue, especially where security is concerned, sovereignty and the rights of sensed states, shutter control vs transparency is debated, data access, IPR and infringement of privacy becoming more relevant are all discussed. At the same time, the societal and public good of GI is well accepted with innumerable national and international examples. It is clear that societies would greatly benefit from the proper use of GI.

Developing a user-friendly, portable, real-time solar UV alert system especially or wearable electronic mobile devices can help reduce the exposure to UV as a key measure for personal and occupational management of the UV risks. This research aims to design artificial intelligence-inspired early warning tool tailored for short-term forecasting of UV index (UVI) integrating satellite-derived and ground-based predictors for Australian hotspots receiving high UV exposures. The study further improves the trustworthiness of the newly designed tool using an explainable artificial intelligence approach. Methods: An enhanced joint hybrid explainable deep neural network model (called EJH-X-DNN) is constructed involving two phases of feature selection and hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. A compre-hensive assessment of EJH-X-DNN is conducted with six other competing benchmarked models. The proposed model is explained locally and globally using robust model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence frame-works such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and permutation feature importance (PFI). Results: The newly proposed model outperformed all benchmarked models for forecasting hourly horizons UVI, with correlation coefficients of 0.900, 0.960, 0.897, and 0.913, respectively, for Darwin, Alice Springs, Townsville, and Emerald hotspots. According to the combined local and global explainable model outcomes, the site-based results indicate that antecedent lagged memory of UVI and solar zenith angle are influential features. Predictions made by EJH-X-DNN model are strongly influenced by factors such as ozone effect, cloud conditions, and precipitation.Conclusion: With its superiority and skillful interpretation, the UVI prediction system reaffirms its benefits for providing real-time UV alerts to mitigate risks of skin and eye health complications, reducing healthcare costs and contributing to outdoor exposure policy.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107737","{""notes"": ""('prasad_enhancedjointhybriddeep_2023',)""}","{}",2024-12-19 19:17:46,"included",NA,NA
7037000,"Detection And Mapping The Spatial Distribution Of Bracken Fern Weeds Using The Landsat 8 Oli New Generation Sensor","Bracken fern is an invasive plant that presents serious environmental, ecological and economic problems around the world. An understanding of the spatial distribution of bracken fern weeds is therefore essential for providing appropriate management strategies at both local and regional scales. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the freely available medium resolution Landsat 8 OLI sensor in the detection and mapping of bracken fern at the Cathedral Peak, South Africa. To achieve this objective, the results obtained from Landsat 8 OLI were compared with those derived using the costly, high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery. Since previous studies have already Successfully mapped bracken fern using high spatial resolution WorldView-2 image, the comparison was done to investigate the magnitude of difference in accuracy between the two sensors in relation to their acquisition costs. To evaluate the performance of Landsat 8 OLI in discriminating bracken fern compared to that of Worldview-2, we tested the utility of (i) spectral bands; (ii) derived vegetation indices as well as (iii) the combinatidn of spectral bands and vegetation indices based on discriminant analysis classification algorithm. After resampling the training and testing data and reclassifying several times (n =100) based on the combined data sets, the overall accuracies for both Landsat 8 and WorldView-2 were tested for significant differences based on Mann-Whitney U test. The results showed that the integration of the spectral bands and derived vegetation indices yielded the best overall classification accuracy (80.08\% and 87.80\% for Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 respectively). Additionally, the use of derived vegetation indices as a standalone data set produced the weakest overall accuracy results of 62.14\% and 82.11\% for both the Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 images. There were significant differences \{U (100) = 569.5, z = -10.8242, p < 0.01\} between the classification accuracies derived based on Landsat OLI 8 and those derived using WorldView-2 sensor. Although there were significant differences between Landsat and WorldView-2 accuracies, the magnitude of variation (9\%) between the two sensors was within an acceptable range. Therefore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the recently launched Landsat 8 OLI mtiltispectral sensor provides valuable information that could aid in the long term continuous monitoring and formulation of effective bracken fern management with acceptable accuracies that are comparable to those obtained from the high resolution WorldView-2 commercial sensor.

By doing so, we analyzed the interrelationships between the VCI and anomalies in the Land Surface Temperature (LST), along with connections between the VCI and data considering water deficits in vulnerable areas. When it came to image processing, we focused on the use of analytics and GIS algorithms, while the Scott-Knott method elucidated the statistical analyses. Consequently, we identified drought areas followed by periods susceptible to their occurrence, indicating 2016 as the driest year. The North macroregion presented the lowest average values regarding VCI values in the most vulnerable periods, followed by the Central one. We also call attention to the highest LST averages observed in 2015 and 2016, as strong El Nino events marked the same timeframe periods. The methodological approach was efficient for the identification, analysis, and characterization of agricultural drought occurrences, enabling mitigation actions, as well as the management of the exploitation and protection of water resources.

7037417,"Optimal Decision-Making Model Of Spatial Sampling For Survey Of China's Land With Remotely Sensed Data","In the remote sensing survey of the country land, cost and accuracy are a pair of conflicts, for which spatial sampling is a preferable solution with the aim of an optimal balance between economic input and accuracy of results, or in other words, acquirement of higher accuracy at less cost. Counter to drawbacks of previous application models, e.g. lack of comprehensive and quantitative-comparison, the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is proposed. This model first acquires the possible accuracy-cost diagrams of multiple schemes through initial spatial exploration, then regresses them and standardizes them into a unified reference frame, and finally produces the relatively optimal sampling scheme by using the discrete decision-making function (built by this paper) and comparing them in combination with the diagrams. According to the test result in the survey of the arable land using remotely sensed data, the Sandwich model, while applied in the survey of the thin-feature and cultivated land areas with aerial photos, can better realize the goal of the best balance between investment and accuracy. With this case and other cases, it is shown that the optimal decision-making model of spatial sampling is a good choice in the survey of the farm areas using remote sensing, with its distinguished benefit of higher precision at less cost or vice versa. In order to extensively apply the model in the surveys of natural resources, including arable farm areas, this paper proposes the prototype of development using the component technology, that could considerably improve the analysis efficiency by insetting program components within the software environment of GIS and RS.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1360/03yd0376","{""notes"": ""('li_optimaldecisionmodelspatial_2005',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 20:35:15,"included",NA,NA
6691681,"Assessing the value of information for water quality management in the North Sea","Global Earth Observation (GEO) is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management and disaster prevention. With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results.

Without proper maintenance and mitigating, the hazardous trees with structural defects can be harmful to the local community. In practice, the hazardous trees can be assessed using visual tree assessment (VTA), expertise interview and questionnaire. The advancement in remote sensing technology provides users with alternative ways to identify the hazardous trees and is very efficient especially in large areas. The intent of this study is to identify the potential of the tree hazard in UiTM Shah Alam from the integration of LiDAR and Pleiades dataset. Tree health condition and tree height were derived from LiDAR and Pleiades dataset. Height of trees were extracted from a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and the condition of tree health were assessed based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Both parameters were used to classify the individual into low, moderate and high-risk ratings. The findings demonstrated that the integration of both datasets successfully identified the potential of tree hazard at the study area. Altogether 108 of individual trees were detected. 7 and 67 trees were identified as high and moderate risk respectively.

The study was carried out using IRS 1C, LISS III data of December 11, 1997 (pre-treatment) and November 15, 2002 (post-treatment) covering the watershed to assess the changes in land use / land cover and biomass that have changed over a period of five years (1997-2002). The images were classified into different land use/land cover categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach. The results indicated that the area under agriculture crops and forest land were increased by 671 ha (5.7%) and 1,414 ha (11.94%) respectively. This is due to the fact that parts of wastelands and fallow lands were brought into cultivation. This increase in the area may be attributed to better utilization of surface and ground waters, adoption of soil and water conservation practices and changes in cropping pattern. The area under waste lands and fallow lands decreased by 1,667 ha (14.07%) and 467 ha (3.94%), respectively. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (502 ha and 19 ha respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing and GIS was 2.2 times cheaper than the conventional methods.

7037859,"Openet: Filling A Critical Data Gap In Water Management For The Western United States","The lack of consistent, accurate information on evapotranspiration (ET) and consumptive use of water by irrigated agriculture is one of the most important data gaps for water managers in the western United States (U.S.) and other arid agricultural regions globally. The ability to easily access information on ET is central to improving water budgets across the West, advancing the use of data-driven irrigation management strategies, and expanding incentive-driven conservation programs. Recent advances in remote sensing of ET have led to the development of multiple approaches for field-scale ET mapping that have been used for local and regional water resource management applications by U.S. state and federal agencies. The OpenET project is a community-driven effort that is building upon these advances to develop an operational system for generating and distributing ET data at a field scale using an ensemble of six well-established satellite-based approaches for mapping ET. Key objectives of OpenET include: Increasing access to remotely sensed ET data through a web-based data explorer and data services; supporting the use of ET data for a range of water resource management applications; and development of use cases and training resources for agricultural producers and water resource managers. Here we describe the OpenET framework, including the models used in the ensemble, the satellite, meteorological, and ancillary data inputs to the system, and the OpenET data visualization and access tools. We also summarize an extensive intercomparison and accuracy assessment conducted using ground measurements of ET from 139 flux tower sites instrumented with open path eddy covariance systems. Results calculated for 24 cropland sites from Phase I of the intercomparison and accuracy assessment demonstrate strong agreement between the satellite-driven ET models and the flux tower ET data. For the six models that have been evaluated to date (ALEXI/DisALEXI, eeMETRIC, geeSEBAL, PT-JPL, SIMS, and SSEBop) and the ensemble mean, the weighted average mean absolute error (MAE) values across all sites range from 13.6 to 21.6 mm/month at a monthly timestep, and 0.74 to 1.07 mm/day at a daily timestep. At seasonal time scales, for all but one of the models the weighted mean total ET is within +/- 8\% of both the ensemble mean and the weighted mean total ET calculated from the flux tower data. Overall, the ensemble mean performs as well as any individual model across nearly all accuracy statistics for croplands, though some individual models may perform better for specific sites and regions. We conclude with three brief use cases to illustrate current applications and benefits of increased access to ET data, and discuss key lessons learned from the development of OpenET.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/1752-1688.12956","{""notes"": ""('melton_openetfillingcriticaldata_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-10 00:56:08,"included",NA,NA

For this purpose in-situ eddy covariance measurements were used, acquired from 7 selected experimental sites belonging to the CarboEurope ground observational network over 2 full years of observations (2010-2011). Appraisal of ET accuracy was also investigated with respect to land cover, season and each site(s) degree of heterogeneity, the latter being expressed by the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) operational product of SEVIRI. Results indicated a close agreement between the operational product's ET estimates and the tower based in-situ ET measurements for all days of comparison, showing a satisfactory correlation (r of 0.709) with accuracies often comparable to previous analogous studies. For all land cover types, the grassland and cropland sites exhibited the closest agreement (r from 0.705 to 0.759). In terms of seasons the strongest correlations were observed during the summer and autumn (r of 0.714 \& 0.685 respectively), and with FVC the highest correlation of 0.735 was observed for the class FVC 0.75-1 when compared against the observed values for the complete monitoring period. Our findings support the potential value of the SEVIRI ET product for regional to mesoscale studies and corroborate its credibility for usage in many practical applications. The latter is of particular importance for water limiting environments, such as those found in the Mediterranean basin, as accurate information on ET rates can provide tremendous support in sustainable water resource management as well as policy and decision making in those areas.

We conducted interviews and one group discussion with practitioners, and feedback surveys among PM participants. According to the experiences of the practitioners and participants, PM methods based on high-resolution remote sensing images have increased practitioners' work quality and professional competence, and enhanced participants' active participation and spatial understanding for informed decision-making. Technical challenges and lack of skilled experts and institutional support were commonly identified limitations. Based on the users' perceptions we identified previously recognized enabling factors such as supportive policy environment but also context specific factors; removal of disincentives and wider awareness raising.

However, there have been only very few attempts to demonstrate the ability of drone images, and none so far to observe vegetation (specieslevel) mapping. The present study compares the utility of drone images (DJI-Phantom-2 with SJ4000 RGB and IR cameras, spatial resolution: 5cm) and satellite images (Pleiades-1B, spatial resolution: 50cm) for mangrove mapping-specifically in terms of image quality, efficiency and classification accuracy, at the Setiu Wetland in Malaysia. Both object- and pixel-based classification approaches were tested (QGIS v.2.12.3 with Orfeo Toolbox). The object-based classification (using a manual rule-set algorithm) of drone imagery with dominant land-cover features (i.e. water, land, Avicennia alba, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata and Casuarina equisetifolia) provided the highest accuracy (overall accuracy (OA): 94.0 +/- 0.5\% and specific producer accuracy (SPA): 97.0 +/- 9.3\%) as compared to the Pleiades imagery (OA: 72.2 +/- 2.7\% and SPA: 51.9 +/- 22.7\%). In addition, the pixel-based classification (using a maximum likelihood algorithm) of drone imagery provided better accuracy (OA: 90.0 +/- 1.9\% and SPA: 87.2 +/- 5.1\%) compared to the Pleiades (OA: 82.8 +/- 3.5\% and SPA: 80.4 +/- 14.3\%). Nevertheless, the drone provided higher temporal resolution images, even on cloudy days, an exceptional benefit when working in a humid tropical climate. In terms of the user-costs, drone costs are much higher, but this becomes advantageous over satellite data for long-term monitoring of a small area. Due to the large data size of the drone imagery, its processing time was about ten times greater than that of the satellite image, and varied according to the various image processing techniques employed (in pixel-based classification, drone >50 hours, Pleiades <5 hours), constituting the main disadvantage of UAV remote sensing. However, the mangrove mapping based on the drone aerial photos provided unprecedented results for Setiu, and was proven to be a viable alternative to satellite-based monitoring/management of these ecosystems. The improvements of drone technology will help to make drone use even more competitive in the future.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0200288","{""notes"": ""('ruwaimana_advantagesdronesspaceborne_2018',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 19:36:00,"included",NA,NA
7038262,"May Smart Technologies Reduce The Environmental Impact Of Nitrogen Fertilization? A Case Study For Paddy Rice","Precision agriculture is increasingly considered as a powerful solution to mitigate the environmental impact of farming systems. This is because of its ability to use multi-source information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management. Among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in research and operational contexts, variable rate (VR) nitrogen fertilization plays a key role. A promising approach to make quantitative, spatially distributed diagnoses to support VR N fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this study, a new smart app for field NNI estimates (PocketNNI) was developed, which can be integrated with remote sensing data. The environmental impact of using PocketNNI and Sentinel 2 products to drive fertilization was evaluated using the Life Cycle Assessment approach and a case study on rice in northern Italy. In particular, the environmental performances of rice fertilized according to VR information derived from the integration of PocketNNI and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform N application. Primary data regarding the cultivation practices and the achieved yields were collected during field tests. Results showed that VR fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0\% to 13.6\% as compared to uniform N application. For Climate Change, the impact is reduced from 9373 to 832.7 kg CO2 eq/t of paddy rice. The highest environmental benefits - mainly due to an improved ratio between grain yield and N fertilizers were achieved in terms of energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of N compounds. Although further validation is needed, these preliminary results are promising and provide a first quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital technologies are used to support N fertilization.

7037084,"Influence Of Spatial Resolution On Satellite-Based Pm2.5 Estimation: Implications For Health Assessment","Satellite-based PM2.5 estimation has been widely used to assess health impact associated with PM2.5 exposure and might be affected by spatial resolutions of satellite input data, e.g., aerosol optical depth (AOD). Here, based on Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD in 2020 over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and three PM2.5 retrieval models, i.e., the mixed effects model (ME), the land-use regression model (LUR) and the Random Forest model (RF), we compare these model performances at different spatial resolutions (1, 3, 5 and 10 km). The PM2.5 estimations are further used to investigate the impact of spatial resolution on health assessment. Our cross-validated results show that the model performance is not sensitive to spatial resolution change for the ME and LUR models. By contrast, the RF model can create a more accurate PM2.5 prediction with a finer AOD spatial resolution. Additionally, we find that annual population-weighted mean (PWM) PM2.5 concentration and attributable mortality strongly depend on spatial resolution, with larger values estimated from coarser resolution. Specifically, compared to PWM PM2.5 at 1 km resolution, the estimation at 10 km resolution increases by 7.8%, 22.9%, and 9.7% for ME, LUR, and RF models, respectively. The corresponding increases in mortality are 7.3%, 18.3%, and 8.4%. Our results also show that PWM PM2.5 at 10 km resolution from the three models fails to meet the national air quality standard, whereas the estimations at 1, 3 and 5 km resolutions generally meet the standard. These findings suggest that satellite-based health assessment should consider the spatial resolution effect. © 2022 by the authors.

7038585,"Grid-Scale Agricultural Land And Water Management: A Remote-Sensing-Based Multiobjective Approach","This paper developed a remote-sensing-based multiobjective (RSM) approach to formulate sustainable agricultural land and water resources management strategies at a grid scale. To meet the spatial resolution and accuracy need of agricultural management, downscaled precipitation data sets were obtained with the help of global precipitation measurement (GPM) data and other spatial information. Spatial crop water requirement information were obtained via the combination use of the Penman-Monteith method, remote sensing information (MOD16/PET) and virtual water theory. Through integrating these spatial data and considering the impact of different spatial environments on crop growth, a grid-based integer multiobjective programming (GIMP) model was developed to determine best suitable crop planting types at all grids. GIMP can simultaneously consider several conflicting objectives: crop growth suitability, crop spatial water requirements, and ecosystem service value. Further, GIMP results were inputted into a grid-based nonlinear fractional multiobjective programming (GNFMP) model with three objectives: maximize economic benefits, maximize water productivity, and minimize blue water utilization, to optimize irrigation-water allocation. To verify the validity of the proposed approach, a realworld application in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China was conducted. Results show that the proposed method can improve the ecosystem service value by 0.36 x 10(8) CNY, the economic benefit by 21.85\%, the irrigation-water productivity by 25.92\%, and reduce blue water utilization rate by 24.32\% comparing with status quo.

7652459,"The Application Of Geographic Information Systems And Remotely Sensed Data To The Conservation Of Heathland Fragments","The integration of data from field observations and remote sensing within geographic information systems (GIS) offers the potential for rapid, cost-effective surveying and assessment of biotopes of high conservation value. A case study of the Dorset heathlands in southern England illustrates the application of this approach. Information on the historical extent of the heathlands was combined with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to assess the current extent of the heathlands together with the potential for adjacent other lands (formerly heathland) to be converted to heathland again. The results of this work showed that the current extent of the Dorset heathlands is about 44·3 km2. Heathland that had been converted to grassland since 1960 was considered to be the category of land use most suitable for the restoration of heathland. It was found that 27·5% of this type of land falls within 100 m of existing heathland and, under changed management, could significantly improve the natural resource of the region. This work draws upon an existing understanding of heathland ecology and demonstrates the application of geographical information systems to the solution of ecological and conservation problems. © 1995.",1995,"{""Veitch, N."",""Webb, N.

In this paper, the price and profitability of three levels of remote sensing platforms were evaluated to define a decision-making process. Prices of satellite, plane and UAV-acquired vegetation indices were collected in Italy during 2020 and compared to the economic benefits resulting from variable rate nitrogen application, according to a bibliographic meta-analysis performed on grains. The quality comparison of these three technologies was performed considering the error propagation in the NDVI formula. The errors of the single bands were used to assess the optical properties of the sensors. Results showed that medium-resolution satellite data with good optical properties could be profitably used for variable rate nitrogen applications starting from 2.5 hectares, in case of medium resolution with good optical properties. High-resolution satellites with lower optical quality were profitable starting from 13.2 hectares, while very high-resolution satellites with good optical properties could be profitably used starting from 76.8 hectares.

7036564,"Key Technologies Of Monitoring High Temperature Stress To Rice By Portable Uav Multi Spectral Remote Sensing","Rice is an important cereal crop in the world and the most important food resource in China. Under the background of global warming, the degree and frequency of extreme high temperature heat waves are also increasing. From July to August every year, continuous high temperature weather with daily maximum temperature exceeding 35.0℃ often occurs in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River affected by subtropical high. At this time, rice is in a sensitive period of growth and development, and continuous high temperature will seriously influences the physiological development of rice. Consequently, scientific and reasonable monitoring of the occurrence and development process of high temperature stress to rice is of great scientific significance and practical value for impact assessment of rice yield variation and agricultural production decisions in the context of global warming. At present, crop growth monitoring methods mainly rely on field investigation and satellite remote sensing. However, the traditional field investigation methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the accuracy is also influenced by the subjective consciousness of investigators. In addition, satellite remote sensing also has some shortcomings, such as low spatial resolution, long transit period, cloud pollution and so on. So, the application technology research of real-time monitoring of crop growth using multi-spectral sensors carried by portable drones is an important supplement and improvement to the existing monitoring and investigation methods for high temperature stress to rice. In this paper, a remote sensing monitoring system for rice growth and data post-processing analysis and application methods were designed based on consumer-grade drones and portable multi-spectral sensors, and then Wuhu super rice production base in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river was selected as the experimental area, and the continuous high temperature days from July 20 to August 9, 2019 was taken as the experimental period. Experimental results showed that there was a significant exponential relationship between the rice vegetation index and the leaf area index, with the correlation coefficient of 0.918, and then the inversion model of rice leaf area index was established. Finally, the discrimination conditions of leaf area index of rice under high temperature stress were further determined. The inversion model and discrimination conditions of leaf area index were used to extract and to analyze the spectral characteristics of rice under high temperature stress in the experimental area. During this continuous high temperature period, 15.3% of rice in the experimental area was damaged by the continuous high temperature stress, which is coincided with the reality from the field investigation conducted by agricultural department (i.e., the grain filling rate of rice was 82.2% in the experimental area). Compared with the traditional field survey and satellite remote sensing monitoring methods, the portable UAV multispectral remote sensing monitoring technology developed in this paper has advantages of high spatial resolution, real-time and large-scale monitoring and application of low cost, which is conducive to the popularization and promotion. It has a certain application prospect in the remote sensing monitoring of crop natural disasters. © 2020 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

7036619,"Examples Of Strategies To Analyze Spatial And Temporal Yield Variability Using Crop Models","Process-oriented crop growth models simulate plant growth over homogeneous areas. The advent of precision farming has resulted in the need to extend the use of point-based crop models to account for spatial processes. Spatial processes include surface and subsurface water flow and spatial and temporal interaction of plant growth with soil water, nutrient and pest stress and management practices. Our research has focused on developing methods to account for spatial interactions in the CROPGRO-Soybean and CERES-Maize models. These methods introduce new challenges for accurately and economically defining spatial inputs for the models. In spite of these challenges, both models have been used to evaluate causes of spatial yield variability with reasonable success. The purpose of this paper is to present several examples of strategies that we have found useful in using these models to assess spatial and temporal yield variability over different environmental conditions and to analyze economic return of prescriptions. Strategies to overcome spatial resolution in point-based crop models include calibration techniques to run point-based models at small scales within a field, using remote sensing to target measurements of models inputs to areas of similar plant response, and linking point-based models to three-dimensional water flow models to better represent water transport. Each strategy is demonstrated using case studies and comparison of simulated and measured data are presented. A method to estimate break-even costs associated with variable soybean cultivar placement in a field is outlined and presented as a case study as well. Crop models can provide useful estimates of potential economic return of prescriptions, as well as estimate the sensitivity of a prescription to weather. They can also estimate the value of weather information on management prescriptions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To address these needs, the European Commission worked in collaboration with conservation institutions and protected areas in Africa to build two systems for the distribution of satellite-based information to support conservation and decision making. The first system, the Fire Monitoring Tool, is a stand-alone web portal which provides near-real time information of fire activity based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The tool provides specific ecological indicators about fire in the world protected areas. Whereas the second system, the eStation, is a network of servers receiving EO-based products, including wildfire, used for protected area ecological assessment, but also national and regional environmental monitoring. The benefits provided by the systems are described in two case studies in Tanzania and Niger.

7037127,"Environmental Security In Arctic Ice-Covered Seas: From Strategy To Tactics Of Hazard Identification And Emergency Response","Environmental change and increasing industrial activity in the maritime Arctic require strategies to adapt to change and ensure safe operations. This problem has been defined at the broader strategic level. We evaluate key aspects of environmental security in ice-covered waters, focusing on tactical and operational information needs, which have received less attention. Monitoring of environmental hazards and effective emergency response in sea ice environments require high-resolution data of ice hazard distributions (e.g., multiyear ice, landfast ice breakout, and ice push events), ice movement and deformation, as well as ice characteristics and dynamics relevant to emergency response. We have developed a prototype coastal observing system at Barrow, Alaska, that addresses such information needs. Imagery obtained from a marine X-band radar with a digital controller is combined with data from on-ice sensors (ice thickness, ice and water temperature, sea level) and; assessments of potentially hazardous ice conditions by local experts. Digital imagery and data are processed and disseminated in near-real time. Using a combination of image processing approaches (optical flow, Lucas-Kanade tracker), ice velocity fields, floe trajectories, and boundaries of stationary ice are derived automatically. Early onset of hazardous events is detected through Hidden Markov Modeling, providing potential decision support in operational settings.

We retrospectively compared archived remotely sensed measurements (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and turbidity) with previously published data from an environmental study of V. parahaemolyticus in Alabama oysters to assess the utility of the former data for predicting V. parahaemolyticus densities in oysters. Remotely sensed sea surface temperature correlated well with previous in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.86) of bottom water temperature, supporting the notion that remotely sensed sea surface temperature data are a sufficiently accurate substitute for direct measurement. Turbidity and chlorophyll levels were not determined in the previous study, but in comparison with the V. parahaemolyticus data, remotely sensed values for these parameters may explain some of the variation in V. parahaemolyticus levels. More accurate determination of these effects and the temporal and spatial variability of these parameters may further improve the accuracy of prediction models. To illustrate the utility of remotely sensed data as a basis for risk management, predictions based on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration V. parahaemolyticus risk assessment model were integrated with remotely sensed sea surface temperature data to display graphically variations in V. parahaemolyticus density in oysters associated with spatial variations in water temperature.

7037827,"Diversity Features Collaboration Technology For Monitoring Forest Before And After Hurricane By Remote Sensing","Objective: Change monitoring and disaster assessment of hurricane-damaged forests is an important application of remote sensing technology. The extraction of feature information from remote sensing images is very important to the effect of forest remote sensing monitoring. The combination of diversity features can effectively improve the monitoring accuracy of forest change. However, the current spatial information acquisition algorithms, such as texture features, still retain the traditional fixed computing model and do not fully consider the diversity of the spatial distribution of ground objects. When extracting texture features, the accuracy of texture features will be affected if the sliding window is too large or too small. Therefore, the calculation method of this kind of texture feature is always faced with the problem of a hard balance between the number of features and the neighborhood reference range. Therefore, this paper focuses on forest change monitoring technology. Method: To solve the above problems, in this paper, a remote sensing monitoring method for forest destruction before and after hurricanes is proposed based on diversity feature collaborative technology. Firstly, the difference between normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (NDVI) before and after forest remote sensing image change was calculated. Secondly, the compound window technology is proposed to extract the texture features. Then, the texture features extracted from the remote sensing image and the spectrum of the remote sensing image were used to build a diversity characteristic combination model. This can enhance the diversity of features. Finally, an improved rotating forest algorithm based on feature separation is proposed to reduce the direct feature correlation and improve the accuracy of the classifier. Result: The study area used in this study is the remote sensing image of the Nezer forest in France before and after the hurricane, which is derived from the Formosat-2 satellite. In the experimental part, the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the other six methods. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional change detection methods based on spectral features and texture features, the overall accuracy of the proposed method, the detection accuracy of the changed area and the unchanged area are improved by 3.68%, 5.82% and 3.46%, respectively. In addition, this paper tested the sensitivity of features extracted by different methods to the number of training samples. The results show that the proposed method still maintains high classification accuracy in different training sample numbers, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are better than the comparison methods. And after the number of training samples reaches 50, the accuracy of the proposed method tends to flatten out. Conclusion: The proposed method can effectively improve the performance of forest change monitoring. This method can be used to monitor the change and damage of forests in real-time, and obtain the information of forest disaster areas efficiently, which can provide important reference data for the emergency decision-making of forest resource management departments. Therefore this method has high practical value. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed ""cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning"" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

7037865,"Water Balance Estimation Of A Poorly Gauged Catchment In West Africa Using Dynamically Downscaled Meteorological Fields And Remote Sensing Information","Scientifically sound decisions in sustainable water management are usually based on hydrological modeling which can only be accomplished by meteorological driving information. Especially in regions with weak infrastructure this task is hampered by limited hydro-meteorological information in sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. We investigated three approaches to provide required meteorological fields driving the distributed hydrological model: the results of the mesoscale meteorological model MM5 which are available near real time, the TRMM product 3B42 available with approximately one month delay, and station data available with a delay of one year or more. The study site is the White Volta catchment in the semi-arid environment of West Africa. The results for 2004 show that the meteorological model is able to provide meteorological input data for near real time water balance estimations. In this study the TRMM product does not improve the simulation results. Besides missing important meteorological data, also gridded information on land surface properties (albedo, LAI, etc.) is usually difficult to obtain, albeit it is an essential input for distributed hydrological models. This information is commonly taken from ""static"" tables depending on the land use. Satellite remote sensing provides worldwide spatially detailed information on land surface properties which is particularly suitable for large regions in remote settings. Therefore the MODIS products for albedo and LAI were processed to annual time series including the identification and replacement of low quality observations by interpolation. The impact using MODIS data on the spatial distribution of water balance variables occurs mainly on local scale. The hydrological simulations using MODIS LAI and albedo values result in higher annual evapotranspiration and lower total discharge sums for 2004. Altogether it is concluded that hydrological decision support systems in regions with weak infrastructure can benefit significantly from the integration of atmospheric modeling and satellite-derived land surface data. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

6863204,"Model-Assisted Estimation Of Change In Forest Biomass Over An 11year Period In A Sample Survey Supported By Airborne Lidar: A Case Study With Post-Stratification To Provide ""Activity Data""","The United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN REDD) was launched with the aim of contributing to the development of capacity for reducing emissions from loss of forest carbon in developing countries. It is understood that REDD mechanisms must be supported by forest assessment programs that can monitor the carbon stocks by carbon pools and human activities. Reporting at a national level will be required but many countries are likely to benefit from more local monitoring programs within the countries as well, gauging the effects of national policies and local financial mechanisms aimed at reaching goals for emission control for the nation as a whole. Field-based forest sample surveys are typically used as support for national reporting purposes. However, monitoring within the countries will require huge investments in field surveys to provide reliable change estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution. Airborne scanning LiDAR has emerged as a promising tool to provide auxiliary data for sample surveys aiming at estimation of above-ground tree biomass. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how ""wall-to-wall"" LiDAR data can be used for change estimation. Estimators for areal changes of categories representing human activities such as ""deforestation"", ""degradation"" and ""untouched"" were presented. Corresponding estimators for variance were also provided. Furthermore, it was shown how net change in biomass for the defined activity categories and for the entire area of interest can be estimated from a field sample survey with and without support of LiDAR remote sensing data and how the uncertainty can be quantified by corresponding variance estimates. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6. ha) a probability sample of 176 field sample plots distributed according to a stratified systematic design was measured twice over an 11. year period. Corresponding multi-temporal scanning LiDAR data were also available. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to predict change category for every LiDAR grid cell in the area, and areal changes were estimated from the pure field sample and with the support of the LiDAR data applying model-assisted estimators. The standard errors of the areal change estimates were reduced by 43-75% by adding LiDAR data to the estimation. The change categories were used as post-strata in a subsequent estimation of net change in biomass. The standard errors of the biomass change estimates for the respective change categories were reduced by 18-84% compared to the pure field survey when using LiDAR data as auxiliary information in a model-assisted estimation procedure, which translates to a need for 1.5-38.7 times as many field plots when relying only on the field data. For the entire area of interest, the standard error of the overall net change in biomass was reduced by 57% compared to the uncertainty reported from the pure field survey. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",2013,"{""Bollandsås, O.

The 20 cm resolution RGB images and 5 cm red-edge images were used to extract reference data for FGCC, which were then linked to thermal data and red-edge vegetation indices. We found that the airborne thermal data explained 77% of the variation in FGCC at a range of 0%–100%. However, the airborne thermal image could only explain 17% of the variation within the cornfields, which had low FGCC values, ranging from 20% to 40%. In contrast, the simple ratio derived from the ground-level red-edge image explained 81% of the FGCC variation in the cornfields. These results suggest that both thermal and red-edge images are capable of estimating crop FGCC, with the red-edge outperforming the thermal images in estimating low FGCC for single-crop fields. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an efficient and affordable means to map crop FGCC, which could play an essential role in generating insights related to crop canopy development, light interception, and evapotranspiration partitioning, which can be used as indicators for soil health and nutrient status. © Canadian Science Publishing.

Snow-Covered Area (SCA) is an important hydrologic variable for both volumetric and daily stream flow forecasting. Satellite data provide the ideal way to map snow cover in mountain regions; however, the utility of these datasets have been limited due to the large number of scenes that are contaminated with cloud cover. To improve the utility of these datasets for the snowmelt season, in particular the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Daily Snow-Cover Product dataset, a new procedure was developed to predict snow-cover in cloud-obscured areas using a snow-occurrence map technique.

7036730,"New Perspectives Of Earth Surface Remote Detection For Hydro-Geomorphological Monitoring Of Rivers","In the current scenery of climate change and its relatively increasing visible effects seen over the world, the monitoring of geomorphological processes and flood dynamics becomes more and more necessary for disaster risk reduction. During recent decades, the advantages offered by remote sensing for Earth surface observations have been widely exploited, producing images, digital elevation models (DEM), maps, and other tools useful for hydro-geomorphological parameters detection, flood extent monitoring, and forecasting. However, today, advanced technologies and integrated methodologies do not yet enable one to completely provide near-real-time (NRT) and very-high-resolution (VHR) observations of a river, which is needed for risk evaluation and correct operational strategy identification. This work presents an advanced remote detection analysis system (ARDAS) based on the combination of multiple technologies, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques, and cloud computing environment. The system allows to obtain VHR products, such as ortho-photomosaics and DEM, for deep observation of the river conditions, morphological modifications, and evolution trend. The test of ARDAS in the Basento river catchment area (Basilicata, South Italy) showed that the innovative system (i) proves to be advantageous in river monitoring due to its high accuracy, quickness, and data flexibility; (ii) could represent a NRT solution for timely support of flood hazard assessments; and (iii) can be further developed by integrating other technologies for direct application in land planning and safeguard activities by contributing to the value chain of the new space economy and sustainable development.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/su142114093","{""notes"": ""('zingaro_perspectivesearthsurfaceremote_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 21:33:09,"included",NA,NA
7036670,"Taking The Highway To Save Lives On Lake Victoria","Up to 1,000 drowning deaths occur every year on Lake Victoria in East Africa. Nocturnal thunderstorms are one of the main culprits for the high winds and waves that cause fishing boats to capsize. The High Impact Weather Lake System (HIGHWAY) project was established to develop an Early Warning System for Lake Victoria. Prior to HIGHWAY, weather forecasts for the lake were overly general and not trusted. Under the HIGHWAY project, forecasters from weather service offices in East Africa worked with leaders of fishing communities and Beach Management Units to develop marine forecasts and hazardous-weather warnings that were meaningful to fishermen and other stakeholders. Forecasters used high-resolution satellite, radar, and lightning observations collected during a HIGHWAY field campaign, along with guidance from numerical weather prediction models and a 4.4-km resolution Tropical Africa model, to produce specific forecasts and warnings for 10 zones over the lake. Forecasts were communicated to thousands of people by radio broadcasters, local intermediaries, and via smartphones using the WhatsApp application. Fishermen, ferry-boat operators, and lakeside communities used the new marine forecasts to plan their daytime and nighttime activities on the lake. A socioeconomic benefits study conducted by HIGHWAY found that similar to 75\% of the people are now using the forecasts to decide if and when to travel on the lake. Significantly, a 30\% reduction in drowning fatalities on the lake is likely to have occurred, which, when combined with the reduction in other weather-related losses, generates estimated socioeconomic benefits of \$44 million per year due to the HIGHWAY project activities; the new marine forecasts and warnings are helping to save lives and property.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/bams-d-20-0290.1","{""notes"": ""('roberts_takinghighwaysavelives_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-25 00:56:51,"included",NA,NA
6447806,"The Six Dimensions of Value Associated to the use of Copernicus Sentinel Data: Key Findings From the Sentinel Benefits Study","The role of Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites in supporting informed decision-making and more efficient operational processes is becoming increasingly recognized. However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis. The six dimensions are described in the paper and have been tested on a significant number of recent cases.

6691533,"Spatio-temporal design for a water quality monitoring network maximizing the economic value of information to optimize the detection of accidental pollution","The reduction of damage due to water pollution requires good knowledge of the quality of surfacewaters. The Water Quality Monitoring Networks (WQMNs) have evolved over time according to the objectives of each one of them: knowledge of long-term quality evolution, search for the origin of pollution, detection of accidental pollution, etc. Information provided by WQMNs could be improved by a spatial approach, optimizing the location or the number of monitoring stations, or by a temporal approach, optimizing the sampling frequency. However, there is a cost for monitoring water quality.\nIn this article, we show, for the first time, how the estimation of the Economic Value of Information (EVOI) can be used to determine the spatio-temporal design of the network. With the example of a network that aims to detect accidental pollution, we show how to calculate the EVOI according to the spatial and temporal network design (number and location of stations, temporal accuracy of measurement) and how to define this design by maximizing the EVOI. This will allow us to answer questions such as: Are the expenses invested in the networks justified? With an additional budget, is it better to add a station or to increase the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations? What is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget?",2020,"{""Destandau, Francois""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wre.2020.100156","{}","{relevant}",2024-04-28 00:55:41,"included",NA,NA

Notebooks of sketches from Vitruvius, Villard d'Honnecourt, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Le Corbusier are but a few examples of valued design practitioners whose design process included documentation as a necessary and natural element. The value of documentation was clear while the tools for documentation remained manual. Manual manipulation of ruled instruments like rods and tapes when coupled with hand techniques of drawing, engage students directly with the historical environmental context. New technologies, however seem to disengage students from the historic fabric by virtue of their capabilities for automation, remote sensing, remote production, and redefinition of documentation. This paper examines the pedagogical value of historic documentation for design programs in light of new definitions and techniques of documentation necessitated by new technologies.

7037808,"Reducing The Cost Of Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing: Combining Near-Infrared Video Imagery With Colour Aerial Photography","Land managers are often confronted with management problems that could be addressed using decision support or management information systems. The use of such tools, however, depends on the availability of appropriately resolved spatial data. One source of such data is multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery. The cost of such imagery, particularly where environmental goals are most important, is often prohibitive. Even when the cost of such imagery can be met; other factors, such as cloud cover for satellite-based systems or sensor scheduling for sophisticated airborne systems, may mean that imagery is not available. This paper investigates the utility of a system that combines near-infrared imagery from a video camera with conventional medium-format aerial photography deployed in a light aircraft platform. Previously, imagery obtained from video cameras has suffered from limited spectral range and from significant image motion effects. These problems were eliminated by the use of an electronic-shutter charge-coupled device video camera with a strong IR response. The systems components and the approach to their operational deployment are described and the options, for transforming the raw imagery into survey coverage discussed. The image quality and cost is presented for a site characterisation application where the aim is the generation of normalised difference vegetation index values. It is concluded that the system has significant potential-utility for decision support and land-management applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

An error-characterized satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10 ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity, and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\% confidence level. These results indicate that the reanalysis output data set can inform the management of the North West European shelf ecosystem, in relation to eutrophication, fishery, and variability of the carbon cycle.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/2015jc011496","{""notes"": ""('ciavatta_decadalreanalysisbiogeochemicalindicators_2016',)""}","{}",2024-12-15 02:48:45,"included",NA,NA
6691593,"Assessing the usability and potential value of seasonal climate forecasts in land management decisions in the southwest UK: challenges and reflections","The potential usability and benefits of seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) to help inform decision-making processes is widely accepted. However, the practical use of SCF in Europe is still fairly recent and, as such, current knowledge of the added benefits of SCF in supporting and improving decision-making is limited. This study is based on research conducted to co-develop a semi-operational climate service prototype – the Land Management Tool (LMTool) – with farmers in South West regions of the UK. The value of the SCF provided to the farmers was examined to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farmers' decisions during the winter months of 2015/2016. The findings from the study point to the need to explore and develop (new) research methods capable of addressing the complexity of the decision-making processes, such as those in the farming sector. The farmers who used the SCF perceived it as useful and usable as it helped them change and adapt their decision-making and thus, avoid unnecessary costs. However, to fully grasp the potential value of using SCF, farmers emphasised the need for the provision of SCF for longer periods of time to allow them to build trust and confidence in the information provided.

7037606,"Paragon -: An Integrated Approach For Characterizing Aerosol Climate Impacts And Environmental Interactions","Aerosols exert myriad influences on the earth's environment and climate, and on human health. The complexity of aerosol-related processes requires that information gathered to improve our understanding of climate change must originate from multiple sources, and that effective strategies for data integration need to be established. While a vast array of observed and modeled data are becoming available, the aerosol research community currently lacks the necessary tools and infrastructure to reap maximum scientific benefit from these data. Spatial and temporal sampling differences among a diverse set of sensors, nonuniform data qualities, aerosol mesoscale variabilities, and difficulties in separating cloud effects are some of the challenges that need to be addressed. Maximizing the long-term benefit from these data also requires maintaining consistently well-understood accuracies as measurement approaches evolve and improve. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of how aerosol physical, chemical, and radiative processes impact the earth system can be achieved only through a multidisciplinary, inter-agency, and international initiative capable of dealing with these issues. A systematic approach, capitalizing on modern measurement and modeling techniques, geospatial statistics methodologies, and high-performance information technologies, can provide the necessary machinery to support this objective. We outline a framework for integrating and interpreting observations and models, and establishing an accurate, consistent, and cohesive long-term record, following a strategy whereby information and tools of progressively greater sophistication are incorporated as problems of increasing complexity are tackled. This concept is named the Progressive Aerosol Retrieval and Assimilation Global Observing Network (PARAGON). To encompass the breadth of the effort required, we present a set of recommendations dealing with data interoperability; measurement and model integration; multisensor synergy; data summarization and mining; model evaluation; calibration and validation; augmentation of surface and in situ measurements; advances in passive and active remote sensing; and design of satellite missions.

7037181,"Monitoring Water-Related Ecosystems With Earth Observation Data In Support Of Sustainable Development Goal (Sdg) 6 Reporting","Lack of national data on water-related ecosystems is a major challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 targets by 2030. Monitoring surface water extent, wetlands, and water quality from space can be an important asset for many countries in support of SDG 6 reporting. We demonstrate the potential for Earth observation (EO) data to support country reporting for SDG Indicator 6.6.1, 'Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time' and identify important considerations for countries using these data for SDG reporting. The spatial extent of water-related ecosystems, and the partial quality of water within these ecosystems is investigated for seven countries. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5, 7, and 8 with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are used to measure surface water extent at 250 m and 30 m spatial resolution, respectively, in Cambodia, Jamaica, Peru, the Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia. The extent of mangroves is mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1, and SRTM data for Jamaica, Peru, and Senegal. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A imagery, total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a are mapped over time for a select number of large surface water bodies in Peru, Senegal, and Zambia. All of the EO datasets used are of global coverage and publicly available at no cost. The temporal consistency and long time-series of many of the datasets enable replicability over time, making reporting of change from baseline values consistent and systematic. We find that statistical comparisons between different surface water data products can help provide some degree of confidence for countries during their validation process and highlight the need for accuracy assessments when using EO-based land change data for SDG reporting. We also raise concern that EO data in the context of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting may be more challenging for some countries, such as small island nations, than others to use in assessing the extent of water-related ecosystems due to scale limitations and climate variability. Country-driven validation of the EO data products remains a priority to ensure successful data integration in support of SDG Indicator 6.6.1 reporting. Multi-country studies such as this one can be valuable tools for helping to guide the evolution of SDG monitoring methodologies and provide a useful resource for countries reporting on water-related ecosystems. The EO data analyses and statistical methods used in this study can be easily replicated for country-driven validation of EO data products in the future.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs12101634","{""notes"": ""('hakimdavar_monitoringwaterrelatedecosystems_2020',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 18:16:53,"included",NA,NA
7038693,"Applying Bag Of Words Approach To Determine Remote Sensing Technology Acceptance Among Smallholder Plantations","Purpose: Technology acceptance is a measure of that technology’s usefulness. Oil palm is one of the biggest contributors to Indonesia’s revenues, thus fueling its economy. Using remote sensing would allow a plantation to monitor and forecast its production and the amount of fertilizer used. This review aims to provide a policy recommendation in the form of a strategy to improve the added value of Indonesia’s oil palm and support the government in increasing oil palm production. This recommendation needs to be formulated by determining the users’ acceptance of remote sensing technology (state-owned plantations, private plantation companies and smallholder plantations). Design/methodology/approach: This review’s methodology used sentiment analysis through text mining (bag of words model). The study’s primary data were from focus group discussions (FGDs), questionnaires, observations on participants, audio-visual documentation and focused discussions based on group category. The results of interviews and FGDs were transcribed into text and analyzed to 1) find words that can represent the content of the document; 2) classify and determine the frequency (word cloud); and finally 3) analyze the sentiment. Findings: The result showed that private plantation companies and state-owned plantations had extremely high positive sentiments toward using remote sensing in their oil palm plantations, whereas smallholders had a 60% resistance. However, there is still a possibility for this technology’s adoption by smallholders, provided it is free and easily applied. Research limitations/implications: Basically, technology is applied to make work easier. However, not everyone is tech-savvy, especially the older generations. One dimension of technology acceptance is user/customer retention. New technology would not be immediately accepted, but there would be user perceptions about its uses and ease. At first, people might be reluctant to accept a new technology due to the perception that it is useless and difficult. Technology acceptance is the gauge of how useful technology is in making work easier compared to conventional ways. Practical implications: Therefore, technology acceptance needs to be improved among smallholders by intensively socializing the policies, and through dissemination and dedication by academics and the government. Social implications: The social implications of using technology are reducing the workforce, but the company will be more profitable and efficient. Originality/value: Remote sensing is one of the topics that people have not taken up in a large way, especially sentiment analysis. Acceptance of technology that utilizes remote sensing for plantations is very useful and efficient. In the end, company profits can be allocated more toward empowering the community and the environment. © 2023, Shinta Rahma Diana and Farida Farida.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1108/agjsr-02-2023-0056","{""notes"": ""('diana_applyingbagwordsapproach_2023',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 20:46:57,"included",NA,NA
6863292,"Using Bioacoustics To Enhance The Efficiency Of Spotted Owl Surveys And Facilitate Forest Restoration","The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an older-forest associated species that resides at the center of forest management planning in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, USA, which are experiencing increasingly large and severe wildfires and drought-related tree mortality. We leveraged advances in passive acoustic survey technologies to develop an acoustically assisted survey design that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project-level surveys for spotted owls, allowing surveys to be completed in a single year instead of in multiple years. We deployed an array of autonomous recording units (ARUs) across a landscape and identified spotted owl vocalizations in the resulting audio using BirdNET. We then evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in spotted owl vocalizations near occupied territories and the ability of a crew naïve to the location of occupied territories to locate spotted owls based on patterns of acoustic detections. After only 3 weeks of acoustic surveys, ≥1 ARU within 750 m of all 17 occupied territories obtained spotted owl detections across ≥2 nights. When active surveys using broadcast calling were conducted near ARUs with spotted owl detections by surveyors naïve to territory occupancy status and locations, surveyors located owls in 93% to 100% of occupied territories with ≤3 surveys. To further improve the efficiency of spotted owl surveys, we developed a statistical model to identify and prioritize areas across the Sierra Nevada for different survey methods (active only, acoustically assisted, no surveys) based on the expected probability of occupancy predicted from remotely sensed measurements of tree height and historical occupancy. Depending on managers' tolerance for false negatives, this model could help identify large areas that might not benefit from surveys based on low expected occupancy probabilities and areas where acoustically assisted surveys might enhance survey effectiveness and efficiency. Collectively, these findings can help managers streamline the survey process and thus increase the pace of forest restoration while minimizing potential near-term adverse effects on California spotted owls. © 2023 The Authors.

This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13\% and 15\% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/fpls.2023.1230012","{""notes"": ""('martijerez_agronomicperformanceremotesensing_2023',)""}","{}",2024-10-28 18:58:11,"included",NA,NA

These locations are critical for ecosystem function and have significant implications for conservation and management. In this study, we evaluated the utility of remotely sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data for deriving substrate rugosity (a measure of habitat complexity) on a coral reef in Hawaii. We also assessed the potential application of lidar data for examining the relationship between habitat complexity and Hawaiian reef fish assemblage characteristics. Lidar-derived rugosity (4 m grid size) was found to be highly correlated with in-situ rugosity and was concluded to be a viable method for measuring rugosity in analogous coral reef environments. We established that lidar-derived rugosity was a good predictor of fish biomass and demonstrated a strong relationship with several fish assemblage metrics in hard bottom habitat at multiple spatial resolutions. This research demonstrates (i) the efficacy of lidar data to provide substrate rugosity measures at scales commensurate with the resources and their environment (ii) the applicability of lidar-derived rugosity for examining fish-habitat relationships on a coral reef in Hawaii and (iii) the potential of lidar to provide information about the seascape structure that can ultimately be used to prioritize areas for conservation and management.

6447803,"Estimating the Value of Near-real-time Satellite Information for Monitoring Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon","We estimate the amount of avoided deforestation due to the use of near-real-time satellite imagery (DETER) to support the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), the conservation of indigenous and other protected areas, and compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (FC). We develop a Directed Acyclical Graph (DAG) that outlines some of the econometric challenges that arise from the role of policy in the estimation of satellite data on deforestation and consider that policy could be a mediator and/or a moderator along this causal chain. We control for policies that were introduced simultaneously with DETER, and allow for changes in the influences of prices, agricultural settlement, and forest conservation policies on deforestation after near-real-time monitoring was introduced.

In total we estimate the amount of avoided deforestation is approximately 467-471 thousand km2 between 2001-2015, an area that is larger than the state of California, more than twice the amount of deforestation recorded in that region in the same time period, and translates to approximately 12 billion tons of avoided CO2.

6691588,"Free satellite imagery and digital elevation model analyses enabling natural resource management in the developing world: studies from Eastern Indonesia","Decentralization of governance and natural resource management is an ongoing process in many parts of Africa and Asia. Natural resource management requires spatial land resource data for planning. However, currently the financial and human capacity for natural resource mapping, monitoring and modelling remains low in local governments. In this context, this paper explores how new opportunities provided by the increasing availability of free satellite imagery, digital elevation data and open source spatial analysis software, can be applied by local government and NGOs to conduct sophisticated natural resource mapping and modelling in ways that meet their needs and incorporates local knowledge. Reported are cases of a local government using free geospatial data and GIS software to improve evidence-based natural resource management in the developing world with a focus on raster data applications for satellite image analysis and terrain modelling. It is argued that, through removing barriers to uptake, such applications provide a means of decentralizing landscape analysis skills to improve local natural resource management.

When massive IoT terminals pour in the crowded satellite channels, how to enhance the spectrum utility of satellite band and guarantee the system capacity calls for full investigations. In this paper, a secure spectrum optimization scheme is proposed in satellite IoT by introducing blockchain to hamper malicious users to involve in the spectrum sharing. A market-oriented spectrum optimization strategy is designed to improve the satellite systems' benefits wherein the heterogeneous satellite channels are fully be considered and priced. In this circumstance, differentiated pricing is adopted to satisfy the various spectrum users' demands. When applying blockchain to secure the spectrum trading, the edge computing along with the mechanism of user reputation are devised to address the concerns of limited computation power for general IoT devices. Besides, the consensus algorithm of Delegated Proof of Stake is used to improve the computing efficiency so as to better fit in the application circumstance of satellite IoT.

7037474,"Spatial Ecology Of Mangrove Forests: A Remote Sensing Perspective","Over the past few decades, a diverse range of remote sensing data have been acquired over mangrove areas in different modes and with varying spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies, with these used to advance our understanding of mangrove ecosystems and their response to natural and human-induced change. Detailed information on the floristic composition, structure, biomass and growth stage of mangroves and changes in these attributes over time and at different scales of observation has been obtained and the knowledge gained has been to better inform on, for example, carbon dynamics, floral and faunal diversity, connectivity with adjacent environments, and responses to changing hydrological regimes and climate. Significant opportunities also exist for more effective use of these data for actively managing mangroves and the services they provide and ensuring that they are not overexploited and their integrity within the coastal environment is maintained. The benefits of including these data in mangrove characterization, mapping and monitoring programs are demonstrated using case studies from a wide range of locations, including in Australia, Southeast Asia and central America, and instruments such as radar, lidar and optical sensors. Local to global efforts aimed at monitoring mangrove dynamics using remote sensing data are also increasing, with these leading to more informed decisions in relation to conservation, management and sustainable use.

7037224,"Measuring The Economic Benefits Of Advanced Technology Use For River Flood Forecasting","As part of the Hudson Bay drainage system in North America, the Red River of the North Basin (RRB) has been subject to Spring River flooding in the past century. Previously, forecast errors had led to inadequate flood preparations that resulted in tremendous losses and overspending of taxpayer's dollars in flood response. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's satellite microwave remote sensing technology offers improved snow water equivalent measurement information needed for spring flood forecasting in this region. This study evaluates the economic benefits of the technology use to the farm sector in the RRB. We found that farm support for the technology use for river flood forecast is overwhelming, and higher farm support yields higher willingness to pay for the product use. However, respondents who are content with the existing spring flood forecasts tend to have a lower valuation of the new product. Tellingly, landowners who lease to farm operators have noticeably zero perceived economic valuation of the product even though river flooding on their land could depress future land value.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/jfr3.12781","{""notes"": ""('lim_measuringeconomicbenefitsadvanced_2022',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 23:34:06,"included",NA,NA
7037948,"Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Sebal Algorithm Integrated With Remote Sensing And Experimental Methods","Evapotranspiration is one of the most important elements of the hydrological cycle. Estimation of evapotranspiration is imperative for effective forest, irrigation, rangeland and water resources management as well as to increase yields and for better crop management. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in estimating evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of corn in the Mediterranean region of Adana province, Turkey. The Landsat 8 satellite images from March to September 2018 were used to acquire the coefficients of the respective bands. Then, the net radiation flux on the earth's surface and the earth's heat flux is obtained using incoming-outgoing radiation fluxes from albedo, surface emissivity coefficients, land surface temperature, and plant indicators. Next, the sensible heat flux is calculated by determining the hot and cold pixels under consideration via the atmospheric stability conditions. Finally, evapotranspiration maps are plotted. The crop coefficient of corn is also estimated with the respected maps being plotted. To validate the outcomes from the SEBAL algorithm, experimental methods were employed to calculate the evapotranspiration values and evaluated using suitable performance metrics. The results showed that the SEBAL generated evapotranspiration values are in high agreement with the FAO Penman-Monteith method registering the highest correlation (R = 0.91) and the lowest error (RMSE = 1.14). In addition, the SEBAL method registered the highest correlation values of 0.89, 0.87 and 0.68 with Turk, Makkink and Hargreaves experimental methods, respectively. Moreover, the crop coefficients estimated using SEBAL also manifested an acceptable correlation with all methods. The highest correlation value registered was with the FAO Penman-Monteith method (R = 0.98). The outcomes show that since the performance of the SEBAL algorithm in estimating the actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficient using Landsat 8 satellite images is acceptable, the SEBAL algorithm could be a very convenient method. Moreover, it could easily be assimilated into farming management systems and precision agriculture for better decision-making and higher yield.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/17538947.2021.1962996","{""notes"": ""('shamloo_evapotranspirationestimationsebalalgorithm_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 02:33:45,"included",NA,NA

There is an important role in the GCRP for the Developing world. A model is developed in which the Developing world contributes to the in-situ data programmes in exchange for an assured and un-interruptible supply of the sensor data and the products derived from them. These data are needed to perform research in environmental and the human dimensions of the global change. The research provides the basis to evaluate environmental policies in the light of the country's socio-economic and geo-political priorities, and to formulate new policy initiatives. Additionally, the data can be used for the exploration of natural resources, and other applications of public benefit. The model proposes that the Developing world should be partners in the US, European, Japanese, and Canadian programmes related to GCRP. This model is based on the non-transfer-of-funds in either direction, and offers a win-win opportunity for all partners. It consists of a network of centres of excellence in global change research and policy (CEGRP) throughout the Developing world, and the formation of a Developing world coordination group for global change (DWCG-GC). It describes the interfaces among the CEGRPs, the role of DWCG-GC, and their interaction with the rest of the international community.

Today, a number of global and regional remote sensing (RS) products that detect changes in forest cover are publicly available. In this study, we assess the suitability of using these datasets to evaluate the impact of local REDD+ projects targeting smallholders in the Brazilian Amazonb] Firstly, we reconstruct the forest loss of 21,492 farms located in the Transamazonian region for the period 2008 to 2018, using data from two RS products: Global Forest Change (GFC) and the Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project (PRODES). Secondly, we evaluate the consistency between these two data sources and find that the deforestation estimates at the farm level vary considerably between datasets. Despite this difference, using microeconometric techniques that use pre-treatment outcomes to construct counter-factual patterns of REDD+ program participants, we estimate that about two hectares, or about four percent of the forest area, were saved on average on each of the 350 participating farms during the first years of the program, regardless of the data-source used. Moreover, we find that deforestation decreased on plots surrounding participating farms during the very first years of the program, suggesting that the program may have had a positive effect on neighboring farms as well. Finally, we show that participants returned to their business-as-usual pattern of clearing one to three hectares per year at the end of the program. The environmental gain generated by the program, however, was not offset by any catch-up behavior, as the two hectares saved on each farm before 2017 were not cleared in 2018. By calculating the monetary gain of the delayed carbon dioxide emissions, we find that the program's benefits were ultimately greater than its costs.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2023.102653","{""notes"": ""('demarchi_publiclyremotesensingproducts_2023',)""}","{}",2024-12-11 19:27:24,"included",NA,NA

Remote sensing has a fundamental role to play in the characterization of our Earth through mapping, monitoring, and modeling, often requiring the fusion of multiresolution ground-based, airborne, and satellite assets to support comprehensive analyses. Affecting policies, programs, and legislation, remote sensing analyses of societal benefits associated with our key national priorities are vital to assessing status and threats to their sustainability. Often, land cover/land use change is used as a proxy to strategically assess changes in societal benefits and the implications of people, policies, and management programs on realizing full and effective benefits to society. The topics and approaches that are described in the following chapters, part of a broader initiative, the Comprehensive Remote Sensing project edited by Shunlin Liang, suggest a rich and varied perspective and a diversity of themes to fully assess the human dimension and the associated societal benefits.

Twenty-some years later, the Flash Flood Guidance System with global coverage provides real-time assessment and guidance products to more than 60 countries, serving nearly 3 billion people. The implementation domains cover a wide range of hydroclimatological, geomorphological, and land-use regimes worldwide. This flexible and evolving system combines meteorology and hydrology data and concepts as well as supports product utility for flash flood disaster mitigation on very large scales with high spatial and temporal resolution. Through quality control procedures, it integrates remotely sensed data of land surface precipitation and of land surface properties from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite platforms, reflectivity data from a variety of weather radar systems, and asynchronous precipitation data from ground-based automated precipitation gauges in order to produce assessments and short-term forecasts that support forecasters and disaster managers in real time. For each region, it also integrates mesoscale meteorological model forecasts with land surface model response to produce longer-term guidance products. It contains components and interfaces that allow real-time forecaster adjustments to products based on local last-minute field information and relevant forecaster experience. Assessments of utility for flash flood warning operations by national forecasting agencies worldwide are positive.

Global megatrends, e.g., climate change, influence environmental production factors; production and consumption thus must be continuously adjusted to maintain the producer-consumer-equilibrium in the global food system. While, in some parts of the world, smallholder farming still is the dominant form of agricultural production, the use of digital information for the highly efficient cultivation of large areas has become part of agricultural practice in developed countries. Thereby, the use of satellite data to support site-specific management is a major trend. Although the most prominent use of satellite technology in farming still is navigation, Earth Observation is increasingly applied. Some operational services have been established, which provide farmers with decision-supporting spatial information. These services have mostly been boosted by the increased availability of multispectral imagery from NASA and ESA, such as the Landsat or Copernicus programs, respectively. Using multispectral data has arrived in the agricultural commodity chain. Compared to multispectral data, spectrally continuous narrow-band sampling, often referred to as hyperspectral sensing, can potentially provide additional information and/or increased sampling accuracy. However, due to the lack of hyperspectral satellite systems with high spatial resolution, these advantages mostly are not yet used in practical farming.

The coarse-resolution of satellite-derived precipitation data, however, makes it difficult to quantitatively capture certain fine-scale heavy rainfall processes. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite-based precipitation extremes, a downscaling-calibration scheme based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost\_DC) was proposed in this study, where the XGBoost algorithm was applied in both downscaling and calibration procedures. The performance of XGBoost\_DC was evaluated with two other comparative methods, in which XGBoost was only used in either downscaling (XGBoost\_Spline) or calibration (Spline\_XGBoost) process. The results showed that: 1) XGBoost\_DC achieved the best performance, as it obtained the highest accuracy and well reproduced the occurrence and the spatial distribution of precipitation during typhoon events; 2) XGBoost\_DC could capture the spatial variations of the precipitation. Although Spline\_XGBoost obtained results only slightly worse than the XGBoost\_DC, it significantly underestimated the spatial variability; and 3) the model assessment between the XGBoost\_DC and Spline\_XGBoost illustrated the essential contribution of XGBoost algorithm in downscaling process, and improved our understanding of the capability of machine learning (ML) algorithm in reproducing spatial variance of precipitation. These findings imply that our proposed downscaling-calibration scheme can be applied for generating high-resolution and high-quality precipitation extremes during typhoon events, which would benefit water and flood management, as well as other various applications in hydrological and meteorological modeling.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1109/tgrs.2023.3294266","{""notes"": ""('zhu_xgboostbaseddownscalingcalibration_2023',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 18:47:37,"included",NA,NA

Although local measurements can be used to estimate surface energy balance components, these values cannot be extrapolated to large areas due to the heterogeneity and complexity of agriculture environment. This extrapolation can be done using satellite images that provide information in visible and thermal infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum; however, most current satellite sensors do not provide this end, but they do include a set of spectral bands that allow the radiometric behavior of vegetation that is highly correlated with the ET.

Irrigation planning plays an essential role in the growth and development of crops. This study aims to enhance the current status of irrigation scheduling and improve farm water management on sugarcane farms in Khuzestan province, Iran. The AquaCrop model and the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) were used to simulate sugarcane growth and performed well in estimating actual evapotranspiration and final yield based on the calibration and validation results. Four irrigation scenarios were considered: scenario 1, irrigation according to the current situation; scenario 2, irrigation based on maximum allowable depletion (40\%-55\%); scenario 3, irrigation based on field capacity; and scenario 4, deficit irrigation (causes 5\% reduction in yield). Water efficiency based on water consumption (WPIR), transpiration rate (WPTr), and evapotranspiration rate (WPET) were estimated to compare the scenarios in terms of water consumption. Scenario 3 was the selected scenario in which WPIR, WPTr, and WPET were increased about 108.3\%, 2.1\%, and 1.0\%, respectively. Finally, the scenarios were evaluated economically, and the results showed that improving irrigation management slightly increased the benefit.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/ird.2718","{""notes"": ""('jamnani_evaluationsugarcaneirrigationaquacrop_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 18:11:11,"included",NA,NA

Existing free and open-source DEM data gen-erally cover large areas, with relatively high spatial resolutions (similar to 90, 30, and even 12.5 m), but they do not have the advantage of timeliness and cannot accurately reflect current and up-to-date topographical information in the survey area. UAV pre-scanning missions can provide highly accurate and recent terrain data as a reference for UAV route planning and ensure security for subsequent aerial survey missions; however, they are time consuming. In addition, being limited to the electric charge of the UAV, pre-scanning increases the human, financial, and time consumption of field missions, and it is not applicable for field aerial survey missions in reality, unless otherwise specified, especially in harsh environments. In this paper, we used interferometric synthetic aper-ture radar (InSAR) technology to process Sentinel-1a data to obtain the DEMs of the survey area, which were used for route planning, and other free and open-source DEMs were also used for flightline plans. The digital surface models (DSMs) were obtained from the structure of the UAV pre-scan mission images, applying structure for motion (SfM) technology as the elevation reference. Comparing the errors between the InSAR-derived DEMs and the four open-source DEMs based on the reference DSM to analyze the practicability of flight route planning, the results showed that among the four DEMs, the SRTM DEM with a spatial resolution of 30 m performed best, which was considered as the first reference for UAV route plans when the survey area in complex mountainous regions is covered with a poor or inoperative network. The InSAR-derived DEMs from the Sentinel-1 images have great potential value for UAV flight planning, with a large perpendicular baseline and short temporal baseline. This work quantitatively analyzed the errors among the different DEMs and provided a discussion regarding UAV flightline plans based on external DEMs. This can not only effectively reduce the manpower, materials, and time consumption of field operations, improving the efficiency of UAV survey tasks, but it also broadens the use of InSAR technology. Furthermore, with the launch of high-resolution SAR satellites, InSAR-derived DEMs with high spatial and temporal resolutions provide an optimistic and credible strategy for UAV route planning with small errors.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs14205215","{""notes"": ""('du_routeplansuavaerial_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 19:40:34,"included",NA,NA
6903582,"Sentinel-1 Snow Depth Retrieval At Sub-Kilometer Resolution Over The European Alps","Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017-2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%-30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.5194/tc-16-159-2022","{""notes"": ""('lievens_sentinel1snowdepth_2022',)""}","{validation,""probably not""}",2024-09-27 18:39:31,"included",NA,NA
7038245,"Development Of A Web-Based Hydrologic Education Tool Using Google Earth Resources","This study reports on the development of a web-based hydrologic educational system (HydroViz) that supports students' learning in hydrology or related earth science subjects. HydroViz (http://hydroviz.cilat.org/hydro/) is designed as a virtual hydrologic observatory and is based on the integration of field data, remote sensing observations, and computer simulations of hydrologic variables and processes. HydroViz can run on a typical personal computer with Internet access and does not require any specific software package, which makes it easy to utilize. HydroViz employs the free Google Earth browser-based plug-in and its JavaScript application programming interface (API) to enable presentation of geospatial data layers in Google Earth and embed them in web pages that have the same look and feel of Google Earth. The decision to use Google Earth within the HydroViz project was driven by the great deal of geospatial data and visual capabilities it provides for hydrologic educational applications. Besides being freely accessible to a wide user community, Google Earth offers the ability to place and visualize hydrologic technical information on a three-dimensional model of Earth, which facilitates students' interactive and visually supported learning. Within a HydroViz setting, students can use Google Earth navigation capabilities to explore the watershed, either on their own or by using the embedded inquiry-based investigations and the supporting layers of hydrologic information. Cascading style sheets (CSS) and hypertext markup language (HTML) describe the look and formatting of each HydroViz web page. With the aid of Google Earth API, it was also possible to create customized buttons and panels for students to interact with and display the data. HydroViz is populated with several educational modules that range from basic activities (e.g., exploring watershed characteristics) to advanced analysis of field data and simulations. Each module is self-contained where instructions and technical questions are embedded within the same screens that show the watershed and its visual displays. HydroViz has been implemented in several classrooms, and evaluation data showed its potential value as a tool for supporting learning.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1130/2012.2492(33)","{""notes"": ""('habib_developmentwebbasedhydrologic_2012',)""}","{}",2024-12-22 22:18:09,"included",NA,NA
6691657,"Assessing the value of Earth observation for managing coral reefs: an example from the Great Barrier Reef","The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reefprotection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5â€“10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.",2011,"{""Bouma, Jetske A.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.07.023","{}","{""in benchmarks?""}",2024-04-22 02:29:11,"included",NA,NA

If prediction of impending disaster is to be useful, those affected by catastrophe and those who come to their aid must work together. A global strategy based on a vision for disaster management will fail if those affected by hazards are not involved in their own disaster preparation, relief efforts and rehabilitation. Local people are experts in ground knowledge; all that is needed is for those with expertise in remote sensing to pass on their skills, knowledge and data in a way that can be understood and valued. To do this, those threatened by catastrophe must understand how disaster relates to their lives, how satellite data can be used with confidence to prepare for local hazards and how to apply information that can help lessen the effects of catastrophe. This can be achieved by making available remotely sensed images with simple explanations that enhance vegetation, topography and geology.

These bushfires must be managed to save a fortune, wildlife, and vegetation and reduce fatalities and harmful environmental impacts. The current study proposes a holistic model that uses a mixed-method approach of Geographical Information System (GIS), remote sensing, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based bushfire assessment and mitigation. The fire products of Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used for monitoring the burnt areas within the Victorian Region due to the 2020 bushfires. The results show that the aggregate of 1500 m produces the best output for estimating the burnt areas. The identified hotspots are in the eastern belt of the state that progressed north towards New South Wales. The R-2 values between 0.91-0.99 indicate the fitness of methods used in the current study. A healthy z-value index between 0.03 to 2.9 shows the statistical significance of the hotspots. Additional analysis of the 2019-20 Victorian bushfires shows a widespread radius of the fires associated with the climate change and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomenon. The UAV paths are optimized using five algorithms: greedy, intra route, inter route, tabu, and particle swarm optimization (PSO), where PSO search surpassed all the tested methods in terms of faster run time and lesser costs to manage the bushfires disasters. The average improvement demonstrated by the PSO algorithm over the greedy method is approximately 2\% and 1.2\% as compared with the intra route. Further, the cost reduction is 1.5\% compared with the inter-route scheme and 1.2\% compared with the intra route algorithm.

To foster the use of EO remote sensing data, satellite data providers have to take the appropriate measures to remove the policy and technical barriers related to the data access. They have also to increase the awareness of the community of users on the potential benefits that could be gained from the use of EO satellite data.

7036581,"An Operational Procedure For Rapid Flood Risk Assessment In Europe","The development of methods for rapid flood mapping and risk assessment is a key step to increase the usefulness of flood early warning systems and is crucial for effective emergency response and flood impact mitigation. Currently, flood early warning systems rarely include real-time components to assess potential impacts generated by forecasted flood events. To overcome this limitation, this study describes the benchmarking of an operational procedure for rapid flood risk assessment based on predictions issued by the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS). Daily streamflow forecasts produced for major European river networks are translated into event-based flood hazard maps using a large map catalogue derived from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Flood hazard maps are then combined with exposure and vulnerability information, and the impacts of the forecasted flood events are evaluated in terms of flood-prone areas, economic damage and affected population, infrastructures and cities. An extensive testing of the operational procedure has been carried out by analysing the catastrophic floods of May 2014 in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia. The reliability of the flood mapping methodology is tested against satellite-based and report-based flood extent data, while modelled estimates of economic damage and affected population are compared against ground-based estimations. Finally, we evaluate the skill of risk estimates derived from EFAS flood forecasts with different lead times and combinations of probabilistic forecasts. Results highlight the potential of the real-time operational procedure in helping emergency response and management.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.5194/nhess-17-1111-2017","{""notes"": ""('dottori_operationalprocedurerapidflood_2017',)""}","{}",2024-12-25 00:52:20,"included",NA,NA

As missions increasingly require a broader Earth systems focus, it is important that the OSSEs capture the potential benefits of the observations on end-use applications. Toward this end, the results from the OSSEs must also be evaluated with a suite of metrics that capture the value, uncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science and societal impacts. This article presents a soil moisture OSSE that employs simulated L-band measurements and assesses its utility toward improving drought and flood risk estimates using the NASA Land Information System (LIS). A decision-theory-based analysis is conducted to assess the economic utility of the observations toward improving these applications. The results suggest that the improvements in surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and total runoff fields obtained through the assimilation of L-band measurements are effective in providing improvements in the drought and flood risk assessments as well. The decision-theory analysis not only demonstrates the economic utility of observations but also shows that the use of probabilistic information from the model simulations is more beneficial compared to the use of corresponding deterministic estimates. The experiment also demonstrates the value of a comprehensive modeling environment such as LIS for conducting end-to-end OSSEs by linking satellite observations, physical models, data assimilation algorithms, and end-use application models in a single integrated framework.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/jhm-d-13-0204.1","{""notes"": ""('kumar_assessingimpactbandobservations_2014',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:34:53,"included",NA,NA
7037912,"Complementing Satellites And Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Rangeland Assessment In Patagonia","Rangelands assessment in arid and semiarid regions is a key tool both for livestock management planning and environmental diagnoses. Even though there is a consensus on the utility of such tools, rangeland assessment with high detail (grain) while covering large areas or landscapes (extension) is too costly. Then, the compatibility between the resolution and quality of information and the spatial extent required to make decisions in livestock systems is still an operational challenge that has not found an effective solution. Thus, the use of satellite images for rangeland assessments in different environments has been growing steadily in the last two decades. The developments associated with the capture of images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would offer many advantages as a complement to information, since they increase the spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to classify rangeland environments using satellite and UAV images and compare their respective contributions for rangeland assessments in Patagonia. In particular, spatial resolution of an unsupervised classification of rangeland environments using SPOT 7 satellite images and images captured by an optical sensor mounted on an UAV were compared. Rangeland assessment can be potentiated by the use of different sources of information in a more complementary and accessible way for environmental monitoring, and for a pastoral management planning in highly heterogeneous environments from arid and semiarid regions of Patagonia, Argentina. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

In recent decades, it has completely dried up several times with substantial impacts on local ecosystems and climate. Remote sensing-based Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in combination with in-situ data were used to investigate the trend of the Gavkhouni wetland dryness and the associated impact on the variability of local air temperature. The results indicate that the wetland has increasingly experienced drier conditions since the year 2000. The wetland was almost completely dry in 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017. In addition, the results show that Gavkhouni wetland dryness has a significant impact on local climate, increasing the mean seasonal air temperature by ~1.6◦ C and ~1◦ C in spring and summer, respectively. Overall, this study shows that remote sensing imagery is a valuable source for monitoring dryness and air temperature variations in the region. Moreover, the results provide a basis for effective water allocation decisions to maintain the hydrological and ecological functionality of the Gavkhouni wetland. Considering that many factors such as latitude, cloud cover, and the direction of prevailing winds affect land surface and air temperatures, it is suggested to use a numerical climate model to improve a regional understanding of the effects of wetland dryness on the surrounding climate. © 2022 by the authors.

6691710,"Integrating Earth observation data into geospatial databases that support public health decisions","There are several reasons why public health communities do not use information from Earth observations routinely. Most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads. The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the United States. Several Earth observations (EO) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement. Output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Eta version) model (NCEP/Eta). Simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by NCEP/Eta’s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based Continuous Air Monitoring System (CAMS). The simulations were rerun after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from MODIS (MOD-12). For the CAMS test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns. Additional EO data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from SRTM, dustgenerating areas derived from MOD-15’s Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, soil moisture data from AMSR-E, and aerodynamic surface roughness. Ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence.",2006,"{""Morain, S.A.""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXVI/part4/WG-VIII-2-2.pdf","{}","{}",2024-04-25 02:21:49,"included",NA,NA

To construct reliable and consistent valuation measures requires an understanding of the sequence of processes that starts with data acquisition, and leads to decision-makers’ choices that impact society. GEOValue explores each step in this complex value chain from the viewpoint of domain experts spanning disciplines that range from the technical side of data acquisition and management to the social sciences that provide the framework to assess the benefit to society. The book is intended to provide foundational understanding of the techniques and complexities of each step in the process. As such it is intended to be assessable to a reader without prior training in data acquisition systems, information systems, or valuation methods. In addition, a number of case studies are provided that demonstrate the use of geospatial information as a critical input for evaluation of policy pertaining to a wide range of application areas, such as agricultural and environmental policy, natural catastrophes, e-government and transportation systems.",2017,"{""Kuse, Jamie""}","ARTICLE",NA,"9781315154640","{}","{}",2024-04-22 03:03:49,"included",NA,NA
6691653,"Identifying Methods for Quantifying the Societal Impacts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generates tremendous value for the nation. The Agency provides critical environmental data, forecasts, cutting edge knowledge, management and stewardship that the United States needs to plan for and react to in a constantly changing global environment. The Agency, however, needs to do more to understand and measure exactly how its activities, products and services affect the well-being of the nation. Existing and emerging social science methods can be harnessed to help the Agency assess the degree to which we are meeting our mission goals and to improve the value we provide to society. The first NOAA Science Challenge workshop brought together policy makers at NOAA with social science leaders from inside and outside of the Agency to explore methods for better quantifying the ways in which NOAA affects society. As an initial step in better understanding the broader societal impacts of NOAA, we focused on the NOAA line offices and programs that deal most directly with the public: the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (including the National Sea Grant College Program), and the programs that support climate activities at NOAA (the Climate Program Office and the National Climate Data Center). While it is easy to see why society needs NOAA, the workshop revealed just how difficult it can be to rigorously quantify the societal impact of NOAA’s activities, products, and services. As a first step, the line offices identified specific NOAA products, services, and activities (outputs) for which they would like to quantify societal impacts. These examples were meant to highlight a diversity of products and services. We focused initially on relatively straightforward examples that could serve as both a departure for discussion and illustrations of how programs within the Agency might begin thinking about quantifying the societal impact of their work. For each output, the line offices developed a narrative (story) that linked the output with a sector of society and ultimately a state of societal well-being. Workshop participants further developed these stories and explored methods and approaches to better quantify how these NOAA outputs affect societal well-being. The workshop identified many methods that can be applied to better understand the way the Agency affects society. One class of methods is data denial, in which intermediate and final users of NOAA data products are asked to operate in the absence of NOAA data. Other methods involve retrospective analyses of the ways in which the public and private sector have used NOAA outputs. Still other approaches require that users imagine how their decisions would differ in the absence of NOAA activities, products and services.Table 1 provides a sampling of value chains, metrics, and methods developed at the workshop. The participants identified a variety of metrics to measure societal well-being and change including revenues, economic value, lives saved, sense of place, preferences and attitudes, property damages, and crop yields. While one day is insufficient to fully develop these methods and approaches, the workshop was an important opportunity for policy makers at NOAA and social scientists to work together to understand how the Agency can harness social science methods to do a better job of meeting its mission goals. Certain line offices are still more adept at measuring the baseline of societal well-being than in trying to tease out the contribution of any single program or activity. This corresponds, in large part, to the enterprise nature of many activities at the Agency – many programs inside and outside of the Agency combine to achieve our mission goals. As the Agency moves forward in its efforts to understand how NOAA affects society, the methods and metrics used to do so will be refined and improved. Possible next steps in the process include:\n○ More enterprise level approaches to developing value chains and valuations.\n○ Follow-up workshops or symposia on methods for quantifying the societal impacts of specific types of NOAA outputs including: research, information, and weather.",2011,"{""Atmospheric Administration"",""National Oceanic""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353247247_NOAA_Science_Challenge_Workshop_Identifying_Metho","{}","{}",2024-04-22 03:01:11,"included",NA,NA

7036877,"Remotely Sensed Variables Explain Microhabitat Selection And Reveal Buffering Behaviours Against Warming In A Climate-Sensitive Bird Species","Fine-scale habitat selection modelling can allow a mechanistic understanding of habitat selection processes, enabling better assessments of the effects of climate and habitat changes on biodiversity. Remotely sensed data provide an ever-increasing amount of environmental and climatic variables at high spatiotemporal resolutions, and a unique opportunity to produce fine-scale habitat models particularly useful in challenging environments, such as high-elevation areas. Working at a 10-m spatial resolution, we assessed the value of remotely sensed data for investigating foraging habitat selection (in relation to topography, microclimate, land cover) in nestling-rearing white-winged snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), a high-elevation species highly sensitive to climate change. Adult snowfinches foraged at locations with intermediate vegetation cover and higher habitat heterogeneity, also avoiding extremely warm or extremely cold microclimates. Temperature interacted with other environmental drivers in defining habitat selection, highlighting trade-offs between habitat profitability and thermoregulation: snowfinches likely adopted mechanisms of behavioural buffering against physiologically stressful conditions by selecting for cooler, shaded and more snowy foraging grounds at higher temperatures. Our results matched those from previous studies based on accurate field measurements, confirming the species' reliance on climate-sensitive microhabitats (snow patches and low-sward grassland, in heterogeneous patches) and the usefulness of satellite-derived fine-scale modelling. Habitat suitability models built on remotely sensed predictors can provide a cost-effective method for periodic monitoring of species' habitats both at fine grain and over large extents. Fine-scale models also enhance our understanding of the actual drivers of (micro)habitat selection and of possible buffering behaviours against warming, allowing more accurate and robust distribution models, finer predictions of potential future changes and carefully targeted conservation strategies and habitat management.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/rse2.265","{""notes"": ""('alessandrini_remotelysensedvariablesexplain_2022',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 18:33:38,"included",NA,NA
7037655,"Testing And Validation Of Cloud Infrastructures For Earth Observation Services With Satellite Constellations","Earth observation (EO) with satellites has been applied in different fields such as environment monitoring, natural disasters response, emergencies management, civil security, intelligence, maritime surveillance, and many others. Some of the application fields are very demanding in terms of system revisit time and product delivery time. This is the case of responses to natural disasters. However EO still presents critical challenges to overcome in order to cover the actual demand of services: (i) high revisit time, (ii) high response time, and (iii) easy and instant access to EO products. To increase the revisit time and broaden the applications of the remote sensing, new space concepts such as constellations and formations of satellites have been developed. However, the traditional ground infrastructures, which are required to process and store data, are expensive. Moreover, their limited scalability as well as their limited flexibility to manage large and variable amounts of imagery data shall also be considered. Along this work, we propose a cloud infrastructure for data management to be validated with a constellation of 17 satellites acquiring the Earth’s surface on a daily basis in order to offer high added value services for highly demanding applications. The satellites download the raw data images in a network of 12 ground stations distributed around the world to provide global coverage. The cloud system is based on previous works carried out by the research group. Thus the cloud infrastructure is tested and evaluated for its use in the EO sector and applied to different realistic scenarios, including an intensive comparison with a traditional system responding to the Lorca’s earthquake, which occurred in Spain in 2011. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/01431161.2015.1070324","{""notes"": ""('becedas_testingvalidationcloudinfrastructures_2015',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 23:31:20,"included",NA,NA

In situ monitoring of subsidence in this large geographic area has historically been limited. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) sought the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's assistance for satellite- and aircraft-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) monitoring of subsidence during the 2012-2016 drought. InSAR was successful in cost-effectively providing first-ever synoptic measurement of land subsidence over the entire San Joaquin Valley. The purpose of the monitoring was screening or hotspot detection of impact areas affecting critical water infrastructure. Long-term cumulative land subsidence has substantially reduced the conveyance capacity of sections of major valley canals and the monitoring revealed that subsidence rates observed during the drought ranked with maximum historically observed rates, highlighting risks to water infrastructure. InSAR also identified new and rapidly emerging hotspots adjacent to critical water infrastructure. The success of the InSAR monitoring for drought response resulted in CDWR's decision to subsequently provide InSAR data as technical assistance to local agencies required to comply with recent state groundwater management legislation.",2022,"{""Bekaert, David P.

Outcomes are driven by differences across two data products that can be used to inform regulations to limit ship strikes. In the reference case, vessel speed limits depend on species distribution data from shipboard surveys. In the counterfactual case, speed limits depend on species distributions predicted by WhaleWatch, a federal data product incorporating information from several remote sensing technologies. The VOI is identified as the difference in costs to marine shipping operators under the reference and counterfactual cases for regulation of vessel speeds.

Agri-environmental schemes are emerging as an alternative and this paper presents a scheme for hiring the reduction of inputs liable to be accidentally spilled.

Optimal contract menus were derived for three situations differing in the number of contracts in which non-compliance could be detected irrespective of accidents' size. A rate of 99\% of the perfect information efficiency was achieved, as revealed by a numerical simulation based on a range of Brazilian Amazon datasources, including a discrete choice experiment, satellite fire data and mechanization cost. Results were robust to parametric sensitivity analysis, which also pointed to a small contribution by high cost smallholders of up to 10\% of total reduction.

We assessed the utility of IKONOS imagery for applications in the mid-Atlantic region, including mapping of tree cover, impervious surface areas, and riparian buffer zone variables in relation to stream health ratings. We focused on a 1313-km(2) area in central Maryland using precision-georeferenced IKONOS products. We found the IKONOS imagery to be a valuable resource for these applications, and were able to achieve map accuracies comparable to manual aerial photo interpretation. We were also able to use derived data sets for consistent assessments over areas that would be difficult to accomplish with traditional photographic mapping methods. For example, we found that a stream health rating of excellent required no more than 6\% impervious cover in the watershed, and at least 65\% tree cover in the riparian zone. A rating of good required less than 10\% impervious and 60\% tree cover. A number of issues associated with application of the IKONOS data arose, however, including logistics of image acquisition related to phenological and atmospheric conditions, shadowing within canopies and between scene elements, and limited spectral discrimination of cover types. Cost per unit area was also a nontrivial consideration for the image data products we used, but allowed us to provide valuable derived products to agencies in support of their planning and regulatory decision-making processes.

The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations’ (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users’ needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs.

6863583,"Management Recommendation Generation For Areas Under Forest Restoration Process Through Images Obtained By Uav And Lidar","Evaluating and monitoring forest areas during a restoration process is indispensable to estimate the success or failure of management intervention and to correct the restoration trajectory through adaptive management. However, the field measurement of several indicators in large areas can be expensive and laborious, and establishing reference values for indicators is difficult. The use of supervised classification techniques of high resolution images, combined with an expert system to generate management recommendations, can be considered promising tools for monitoring and evaluating restoration areas. The objective of the present study was to elaborate an expert system of management recommendation generation for areas under restoration, which were monitored by two different remote sensors: UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The study was carried out in areas under restoration with about 54 ha and five years of implementation, owned by Fibria Celulose S.A. (recently acquired by Suzano S.A.), in the southern region of Bahia State, Brazil. We used images from Canon S110 NIR (green, red, near infrared) on UAV and LiDAR data compositions (intensity image, digital surface model, digital terrain model, normalized digital surface model). The monitored restoration indicator entailed land cover separated into three classes: Canopy cover, bare soil and grass cover. The images were classified using the Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms and the area occupied by each land cover classes was calculated. An expert system was developed in ArcGIS to define management recommendations according to the land cover classes, and then we compared the recommendations generated by both algorithms and images. There was a slight difference between the recommendations generated by the different combinations of images and classifiers. The most frequent management recommendation was ""weed control + plant seedlings"" (34%) for all evaluated methods.

Its agricultural population accounts for 59.3\% of the total population. Temporal fluctuations of crop price and yield have a significant influence on farmers' revenue. Farmers' selection of crop species, crop planting strategy, and agricultural planting layout according to the market price is important in securing their revenue. In this study, we used a web crawler program to obtain a large amount of data on agricultural product prices from the Internet. Then, the price fluctuation trend of the main economic crops was analyzed by using the K-means clustering method. The net investment yield and the Sharpe ratio were used to compare the economic benefits and investment risks of 10 crops and five cultivation strategies in Mile. Furthermore, a comprehensive comparative advantage index, which integrates the net investment yield, Sharpe ratio, scale advantage index, productivity advantage index, and ecological suitability advantage index, was adopted to comprehensively measure the advantages of crop cultivation. Finally, we propose a spatial-temporal big data analysis model based on the cuckoo search algorithm to optimize the spatial layout of the main crops in Mile in 2017. Based on the comparative analysis of the remote sensing monitoring results and the spatial optimization layout results of the main crops in 2017, several suggestions were given.

In recent years, many humanitarian actors have joined forces to complement traditional, reactive mechanisms with a forward-looking approach that can be activated before a disaster strikes. Anticipatory action (AA) uses forecasts of extreme weather events and combines them with risk information to identify and implement locally-led early actions with the goal of protecting lives and livelihoods more efficiently. AA is still a relatively new approach. Hence, monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL) is crucial to measure its effectiveness and adjust where necessary, as well as for (government) donors that want to see the added value of their investment maximized. However, evidence-based studies that investigate potential limitations and the exact impact pathway of AA at household level are time-consuming, costly, and therefore scarce. Satellite earth observation can become a game changer in AA by strengthening the evidence base via rapid, low-cost assessments. Both commercial and freely available satellite-derived data have reached an unprecedented level of quality, spatial, and temporal resolution. Simultaneously, there are major uncertainties regarding where, when, how, and under what conditions satellite data can support MEAL for AA at all.

6863443,"Mapping A Specific Class For Priority Habitats Monitoring From Satellite Sensor Data","The European Union's Habitats Directive aims to protect biodiversity through the conservation of habitats. If a habitat of interest corresponds to spectrally separable land cover class(es), then this activity can benefit from the production of accurate land cover maps from remotely sensed imagery. Traditionally, the image classification techniques used assume that the set of classes has been defined exhaustively, which requires all of the classes in the region to be included explicitly in the analysis. Often, however, interest focuses on just one or a small sub-set of the classes occurring in the region that represent the habitat(s) of particular interest. Moreover, given that the size of a training set required for an image classification is typically taken to be a function of the number of classes and discriminating variables (e. g. wavebands) used in the classification, the satisfaction of the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes requires that much effort is directed wastefully on classes of little, if any, direct interest. Savings in training could be achieved by focusing on the class(es) of specific interest. A more appropriate approach for mapping a specific class may be to adopt a binary classification analysis that simply seeks to separate the class of interest from all others. In this way the analysis focuses on the class(es) of interest and a small training set may be used. An attractive means to achieve this is through the adoption of decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches to classification. This paper evaluates the accuracy with which a habitat of interest to the EU Habitats Directive, fen, can be mapped from Landsat ETM+ imagery of the Norfolk Broads using such classifiers as well as, for comparative purposes, a standard maximum likelihood decision rule implemented by a discriminant analysis. All analyses yielded accurate classifications, with a conventional approach based on a maximum likelihood allocation providing an overall classification accuracy of 88.4\%. However, both the decision tree- and support vector machine-based approaches provided classifications that were significantly more accurate than conventional maximum likelihood classification (p < 0.05), with overall accuracies of 91.6 and 93.6\%, respectively (table 3). The results highlight the ability to focus the analysis on the class of interest in a manner that is less wasteful of resources and effort and that yields a more accurate classification than the standard approach.",2006,"{""Boyd, Doreen S."",""Foody, Giles M."",""Sanchez-Hernandez, Carolina""}","article",NA,"10.1080/01431160600554348","{""notes"": ""('boyd_mappingspecificclasspriority_2006',)""}","{maybe}",2024-09-27 23:06:54,"included",NA,NA
7036644,"Remote Sensing For Assessing Landslides And Associated Hazards","Multi-platform remote sensing using space-, airborne and ground-based sensors has become essential tools for landslide assessment and disaster-risk prevention. Over the last 30 years, the multiplicity of Earth Observation satellites mission ensures uninterrupted optical and radar imagery archives. With the popularization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, free optical and radar imagery with high revisiting time, ground and aerial possibilities to perform high-resolution 3D point clouds and derived digital elevation models, it can make it difficult to choose the appropriate method for risk assessment. The aim of this paper is to review the mainstream remote-sensing methods commonly employed for landslide assessment, as well as processing. The purpose is to understand how remote-sensing techniques can be useful for landslide hazard detection and monitoring taking into consideration several constraints such as field location or costs of surveys. First we focus on the suitability of terrestrial, aerial and spaceborne systems that have been widely used for landslide assessment to underline their benefits and drawbacks for data acquisition, processing and interpretation. Several examples of application are presented such as Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), lasergrammetry, Terrestrial Optical Photogrammetry. Some of these techniques are unsuitable for slow moving landslides, others limited to large areas and others to local investigations. It can be complicated to select the most appropriate system. Today, the key for understanding landslides is the complementarity of methods and the automation of the data processing. All the mentioned approaches can be coupled (from field monitoring to satellite images analysis) to improve risk management, and the real challenge is to improve automatic solution for landslide recognition and monitoring for the implementation of near real-time emergency systems.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s10712-020-09609-1","{""notes"": ""('lissak_remotesensingassessinglandslides_2020',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:46:53,"included",NA,NA
7037463,"Application-Oriented Real-Time Remote Sensing Service Technology","The aerospace industry in China has developed rapidly over the past 40 years. Remote sensing satellites have grown and gradually developed, and this situation has formed a variety of various satellite series. The communication satellite series, navigation satellite series, Earth observation satellite series, and science and technology test satellite series constitute the current application satellite system in China, which is used in national land and resources survey, meteorological services, environmental monitoring, ocean remote sensing, and other fields. This system provides the foundation for the development of satellite applications. At present, the satellite systems of communication, navigation, and remote sensing are separate and independent. Thus, they cannot meet the real-time, intelligent, and diversified requirements in the era of big data. In addition to the application of land, surveying and mapping, planning, geology and mining, agriculture, transportation, marine, and other industries, the government, enterprises, and the public have shown a large and urgent need for satellite remote sensing navigation data and services, especially high-resolution satellite remote sensing data and services. The demand of users in different industries and fields for remote sensing data products has gradually changed from singularity and standardization to diversification and specialization; from static investigation to dynamic monitoring, forecasting, and forecasting; from qualitative analysis to quantitative research; and from general application to batch business. Therefore, with the application requirements as the traction, focusing on improving the service capabilities of satellite remote sensing, the communication-navigation-remote sensing integrated space-based information service system with integrated communication, navigation, and remote sensing can be built to provide all-day, all-weather, all-region application-oriented services. This system fully utilizes the benefits of satellite applications. Thus, it breaks the barriers of satellites of communication, navigation, and remote sensing. Building a space-based information real-time service system (positioning, navigation, timing, remote sensing, communication, PNTRC) based on ""one-satellite multitasking, multi-satellite networking, multi-network integration, and intelligent services"" that integrates communication, navigation, and remote sensing, has become an important direction for the development of contemporary aerospace information technology. In the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, it is inevitable to study remote sensing service technologies for real-time applications in the era of 5G, Internet of Things, big data, and artificial intelligence is important to meet people's strong demand for ""fast, accurate, and flexible"" remote sensing information services with the way of B2B, B2G, or B2C. This paper first studied the real-time service capabilities of space-air-ground-sea integrated Earth observation network. Then, the real-time application service requirements of remote sensing technology (requirements for high-efficiency remote sensing services for earthquake and disaster relief, remote sensing monitoring requirements for land surface deformation, and demand for public real-world services) were elaborated. Finally, the on-orbit processing technology based on artificial intelligence was analyzed, and the trend of remote sensing technology transformed from remote sensing information to real-time services was discussed. © 2021, Science Press.

6863497,"Open-Source Processing And Analysis Of Aerial Imagery Acquired With A Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial System To Support Invasive Plant Management","Remote sensing by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is a dynamic evolving technology. UAS are particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management because they have the capability to provide data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, data acquisition costs are lower than those of conventional methods such as extensive ground sampling, manned airplanes, or satellites. Small fixed-wing UAS in particular offer further potential benefits as they extend the operational coverage of the area under study at lower operator risks and accelerate data deployment times. Taking these aspects into account, UAS might be an effective tool to support management of invasive plant based on early detection and regular monitoring. A straightforward UAS approach to map invasive plant species is presented in this study with the intention of providing ready-to-use field maps essential for action-oriented management. Our UAS utilizes low-cost sensors, free-of-charge software for mission planning and an affordable, commercial aerial platform to reduce operational costs, reducing expenses with personnel while increasing overall efficiency. We illustrate our approach using a real example of invasion by Acacia mangium in a Brazilian Savanna ecosystem. A. mangium was correctly identified with an overall accuracy of 82.7\% from the analysis of imagery. This approach provides land management authorities and practitioners with new prospects for environmental restoration in areas where invasive plant species are present.",2017,"{""Buttschardt, Tillmann K."",""Heringer, Gustavo"",""Lehmann, Jan R.

7036834,"Using The Social Cost Of Carbon To Value Earth Observing Systems","The goal of this study is to show how to quantify the benefits of accelerated learning about key parameters of the climatic system and use this knowledge to improve decision-making on climate policy. The US social cost of carbon (SCC) methodology is used in innovative ways to value new Earth observing systems (EOSs). The study departs from the strict US SCC methodology, and from previous work, in that net benefits are used instead of only damages to calculate the value of information of the enhanced systems. In other respects the US SCC methodology is followed closely. We compute the surfeit expected net benefits of learning the actionable information earlier, with the enhanced system, versus learning later with existing systems. The enhanced systems are designed to give reliable information about climate sensitivity on accelerated timescales relative to existing systems; therefore, the decision context stipulates that a global reduced emissions path would be deployed upon receiving suitable information on the rate of temperature rise with a suitable level of confidence. By placing the enhanced observing system in a decision context, the SCC enables valuing this system as a real option. Policy relevance Uncertainty in key parameters of the climatic system is often cited as a barrier for near-term reductions of carbon emissions. It is a truism among risk managers that uncertainty costs money, and its reduction has economic value. Advancing policy making under uncertainty requires valuing the reduction in uncertainty. Using CLARREO, a new proposed EOS,as an example, this article applies value of information/real option theory to value the reduction of uncertainty in the decadal rate of temperature rise. The US interagency social cost of carbon directive provides the decision context for the valuations. It is shown that the real option value of the uncertainty reduction, relative to existing observing systems, is a very large multiple of the new system's cost. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/14693062.2015.1110109 and ce and real option value and social cost of carbon and value of in","{""notes"": ""('cooke_socialcostcarbonearth_2017',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 18:33:48,"included",NA,NA

7038084,"Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen For Dryland Farming On Waterlogging Riverine Plains Of Southeast Australia?","Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen, invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces crop yields. Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha). Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one year may be poorest in the next. We answer the question: ""Why would a farmer in this district choose to apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment, georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map data for that paddock in many past seasons?"" We show that soil conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging. If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season, applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable. We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable, fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices. Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1\% increase in yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7\% decrease in applied N. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102962","{""notes"": ""('nordblom_precisionvariableratenitrogen_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-19 22:15:01,"included",NA,NA
7036802,"The Emerging Role Of Remote Sensing Technology In Emergency Management","The use of remote sensing technology is becoming increasingly widespread at all levels of the disaster management cycle. This paper reviews a number of emerging application areas, drawing on examples from both natural disasters such as earthquakes, and man-made events including recent terrorist attacks. In terms of mitigation and preparedness, remote sensing is making an increasing contribution towards inventory development, hazard and risk assessment and logistical planning. After a disaster has occurred, remote sensing offers a rapid low-risk method of assessing damage to critical infrastructure and the urban built environment. In particular, high resolution coverage enabled the detection of bridge damage following the Northridge earthquake and collapsed buildings following various earthquakes in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Once the initial chaos has subsided, the value of remote sensing data lies in post-event monitoring; tracking changes in hazard location and extent. Reference is made to emergency operations following the World Trade Center attack, where remote sensing imagery supported various response efforts. In terms of secondary applications, details are given concerning innovative new research, using information derived from remote sensing coverage for running traffic rerouting programs, and as a supplementary data source for loss estimation models. © 2006 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2. The local government in developing countries with limited data and financial resources can adopt the proposed approach to benefit from utilizing commonly available remote sensing and statistical data with simple machine learning models such as DT (regression method) for sustainable electricity management.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs13224654","{""notes"": ""('hutasavi_estimatingdistrictlevelelectricity_2021',)""}","{}",2024-09-26 00:57:11,"included",NA,NA

However, due to the high complexity of noise problem, most of the existing methods are not robust enough when applied in real-world scenes, which seriously affect their application value in urban planning and management. In addition, how to extract valuable periodic feature from social sensing data still needs to be further study. To this end, we propose a multi-modal fusion network guided by feature co-occurrence for urban region function recognition, which leverages the co-occurrence relationship between multi-modal features to identify abnormal noise feature, so as to guide the fusion network to suppress noise feature and focus on clean feature. Furthermore, we employ a graph convolutional network that incorporates node weighting layer and interactive update layer to effectively extract valuable periodic feature from social sensing data. Lastly, experimental results on public available datasets indicate that our proposed method yeilds promising improvements of both accuracy and robustness over several state-of-the-art methods.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1587/transinf.2021edp7230","{""notes"": ""('zhang_multimodalfusionnetwork_2022',)""}","{""social sensing data?""}",2024-12-10 01:19:29,"included",NA,NA

7036743,"Value Of Airborne Laser Scanning And Digital Aerial Photogrammetry Data In Forest Decision Making","Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been the main method for acquiring data for forest management planning in Finland and Norway in the last decade. Recently, digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has provided an interesting alternative, as the accuracy of stand-based estimates has been quite close to that of ALS while the costs are markedly smaller. Thus, it is important to know if the better accuracy of ALS is worth the higher costs for forest owners. In many recent studies, the value of forest inventory information in the harvest scheduling has been examined, for instance through cost-plus-loss analysis. Cost-plus-loss means that the quality of the data is accounted for in monetary terms through calculating the losses due to errors in the data in the forest management planning context. These costs are added to the inventory costs. In the current study, we compared the losses of ALS and DAP at plot level. According to the results, the data produced using DAP are as good as data produced using ALS from a decision making point of view, even though ALS is slightly more accurate. ALS is better than DAP only if the data will be used for more than 15 years before acquiring new data, and even then the difference is quite small. Thus, the increased errors in DAP do not significantly affect the results from a decision making point of view, and ALS and DAP data can be equally well recommended to the forest owners for management planning. The decision of which data to acquire, can thus be made based on the availability of the data on first hand and the costs of acquiring it on the second hand.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.14214/sf.9923","{""notes"": ""('kangas_airbornelaserscanningdigital_2018',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 16:05:20,"included",NA,NA

Innovative synoptic information products such as Remote Sensing-enabled Essential Biodiversity Variables (RS-enabled EBVs) could complement field observations in biodiversity monitoring. It is not clear however, how these scientific remote sensing products can be utilized for policy reporting. Agreement on the monitored geographic extent (area size and scale), as well as biodiversity attributes (composition, structure, and function), may provide a common'point of departure' for policymakers and the scientific community to develop and further improve monitoring. In this study, biodiversity indicators of 10 nature conservation policies and 50 RS-enabled EBVs were compared using non-parametric tests (chi-square and Mann-Whitney U). Our main finding is that policy indicators and RS enabled EBVs are very similar in the spatial extent they address (mapping scale). However, most policy indicators are related to ecosystem structure while most of the RS-enabled EBVs are related to ecosystem function and ecosystem structure. RS-enabled EBVs have added value in monitoring of biodiversity, especially when looking at ecosystem functioning. Information on ecosystem functioning and structure provides evidence needed as input for policy development and management of biodiversity.

AQAST aims to increase the use of Earth science products in air quality-related research and to help meet air quality managers' information needs. We conducted a Web-based survey and a limited number of follow-up interviews to investigate federal, state, tribal, and local air quality managers' perspectives on usefulness of Earth science data and models, and on the impact AQAST has had. The air quality managers we surveyed identified meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter, emissions from mobile sources, and interstate air pollution transport as top challenges in need of improved information. Most survey respondents viewed inadequate coverage or frequency of satellite observations, data uncertainty, and lack of staff time or resources as barriers to increased use of satellite data by their organizations. Managers who have been involved with AQAST indicated that the program has helped build awareness of NASA Earth science products, and assisted their organizations with retrieval and interpretation of satellite data and with application of global chemistry and climate models. AQAST has also helped build a network between researchers and air quality managers with potential for further collaborations. Implications: NASA's Air Quality Applied Science Team (AQAST) aims to increase the use of satellite data and global chemistry and climate models for air quality management purposes, by supporting research and tool development projects of interest to both groups.

7037336,"Accuracy And Impact Of Spatial Aids Based Upon Satellite Enumeration To Improve Indoor Residual Spraying Spatial Coverage","Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a key tool in the fight to control, eliminate and ultimately eradicate malaria. IRS protection is based on a communal effect such that an individual's protection primarily relies on the community-level coverage of IRS with limited protection being provided by household-level coverage. To ensure a communal effect is achieved through IRS, achieving high and uniform community-level coverage should be the ultimate priority of an IRS campaign. Ensuring high community-level coverage of IRS in malaria-endemic areas is challenging given the lack of information available about both the location and number of households needing IRS in any given area. A process termed 'mSpray' has been developed and implemented and involves use of satellite imagery for enumeration for planning IRS and a mobile application to guide IRS implementation. This study assessed (1) the accuracy of the satellite enumeration and (2) how various degrees of spatial aid provided through the mSpray process affected community-level IRS coverage during the 2015 spray campaign in Zambia. Methods: A 2-stage sampling process was applied to assess accuracy of satellite enumeration to determine number and location of sprayable structures. Results indicated an overall sensitivity of 94\% for satellite enumeration compared to finding structures on the ground. Results: After adjusting for structure size, roof, and wall type, households in Nchelenge District where all types of satellite-based spatial aids (paper-based maps plus use of the mobile mSpray application) were used were more likely to have received IRS than Kasama district where maps used were not based on satellite enumeration. The probability of a household being sprayed in Nchelenge district where tablet-based maps were used, did not differ statistically from that of a household in Samfya District, where detailed paper-based spatial aids based on satellite enumeration were provided. Conclusion: IRS coverage from the 2015 spray season benefited from the use of spatial aids based upon satellite enumeration. These spatial aids can guide costly IRS planning and implementation leading to attainment of higher spatial coverage, and likely improve disease impact.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1186/s12936-018-2236-2","{""notes"": ""('bridges_accuracyimpactspatialaids_2018',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 22:36:18,"included",NA,NA
7037180,"Comparing The Information Content Of Coral Reef Geomorphological And Biological Habitat Maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean","Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

7038283,"Facilitating Native Land Reacquisition In The Rural Usa Through Collaborative Research And Geographic Information Systems","A large proportion of American Indian reservation lands are owned by non-Indian entities. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool for visualising land tenure changes, and public participation GIS (PPGIS) is one approach for using spatial technologies to facilitate the identification and reacquisition of reservation lands by tribes. While some tribes have successfully harnessed GIS for land management and for systematically identifying lands for reacquisition, others struggle to implement land management systems such as GIS for these purposes. This paper situates PPGIS in relation to other forms of participatory action research and outlines our use of a PPGIS framework to engage undergraduate geography students in the mapping of land tenure status on ten rural Minnesota Indian reservations as part of a collaborative partnership with the Indian Land Tenure Foundation (ILTF). A PPGIS framework allowed us to collaboratively define research goals in response to tribal community needs and provided structure for student work with partner reservations to develop and implement tailored mapping and analysis techniques. Two sets of findings are significant. First, the assembly of a standardised set of maps for American Indian reservations in Minnesota provides a tremendous visual and analytical resource for ILTF and individual tribes to pursue land reacquisition within reservation boundaries. Second, from a PPGIS perspective, we found that working with a coordinating or 'bridging' organisation provided key benefits by enabling education of both the student-faculty partners and the individual tribes.

6863566,"Demonstration Of A Modular Prototype End-To-End Simulator For Aquatic Remote Sensing Applications","This study introduces a prototype end-to-end Simulator software tool for simulating two-dimensional satellite multispectral imagery for a variety of satellite instrument models in aquatic environments. Using case studies, the impact of variable sensor configurations on the performance of value-added products for challenging applications, such as coral reefs and cyanobacterial algal blooms, is assessed. This demonstrates how decisions regarding satellite sensor design, driven by cost constraints, directly influence the quality of value-added remote sensing products. Furthermore, the Simulator is used to identify situations where retrieval algorithms require further parameterization before application to unsimulated satellite data, where error sources cannot always be identified or isolated. The application of the Simulator can verify whether a given instrument design meets the performance requirements of end-users before build and launch, critically allowing for the justification of the cost and specifications for planned and future sensors. It is hoped that the Simulator will enable engineers and scientists to understand important design trade-offs in phase 0/A studies easily, quickly, reliably, and accurately in future Earth observation satellites and systems. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,"{""Anstee, J."",""Antoine, D."",""Dekker, A."",""Drayson, N."",""Gensemer, S."",""Matthews, M.

The first case study focuses on adapting land use to sustain drinking water quality and to avoid an increase in the contamination of groundwater by agrochemicals. In the first example the Landsat archive is used to evaluate the societal benefits to adapt agricultural land management to reduce nonpoint source groundwater contamination. The second case study targets mitigating drought disasters by determining farmer eligibility for financial assistance by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). For the second example the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provide data to assess the economic loss due to the misspecification of eligibility for drought disaster assistance and insurance that is evaluated in a specific drought policy.

6691521,"Enhancing Access and Usage of Earth Observations in Environmental Decision-Making in Eastern and Southern Africa Through Capacity Building","Major strides have been made in the development of remote sensing, reanalysis, and model-based earth observations (EOs), which can be used for long-term climate variability mapping, as well as real-time environmental monitoring and forecasting. Such EOs are particularly valuable for environmental decision-making (e.g., for environmental resources management and disaster mitigation) in the Eastern and Southern Africa (E & SA) region, where ground-based EOs are sparse. Nonetheless, operational application of those EOs to inform decision-making in the region remains limited. This paper reports on a recently concluded (as of June 2019) NASA SERVIR-supported Applied Science Team project that contributed to the uptake of EO applications to inform decision-making in this region. This project was conducted in close collaboration with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)—the NASA SERVIR regional hub in E & SA. The capacity-building efforts leveraged RCMRD’s existing environmental service capacity, their long experience in capacity building in the region, and their extensive network of regional partners, with the goal of increasing RCMRD and their regional partners’ ability to uptake EOs to enhance their environmental services and, hence, improve the environmental decision-making process. The project focused on: (1) Transfer of technology—Transition and implementation of web-based tools to RCMRD to allow easy processing and visualization of EOs and (2) Capacity training—training of representatives from regional and national environmental service agencies in EO application based on targeted case studies. Here, we describe these capacity-building efforts, provide specific examples to demonstrate the benefits of those efforts in terms of enhanced uptake of EOs, and provide recommendations for furthering the uptake of EOs in the region and beyond.",2021,"{""Shukla, Shraddhanand""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.504063","{}","{}",2024-04-22 02:29:41,"included",NA,NA

7037397,"Planning Iterative Investment For Landscape Restoration: Choice Of Biodiversity Indicator Makes A Difference","Natural regrowth vegetation offers a cost-effective means of restoring some degraded landscapes. Worldwide, policy responses to climate change are increasing the attractiveness of investment in regrowth protection or facilitation which with strategic planning could also deliver substantial dividends for biodiversity conservation. This study compares the performance of two commonly used indicators of biodiversity conservation priority, irreplaceability and complementarity, as tools to support planning for iterative investment to protect natural regrowth of Brigalow, an endangered ecological community in subtropical eastern Australia. Brigalow covered more than seven million hectares prior to clearing, it now persists 'intact' on less than a tenth of that area but there are significant areas of regrowth. Data on Brigalow regrowth derived from mapping and remote sensing identify 10,555 patches covering 280,000 hectares in total. Two different classifications are used to represent Brigalow biodiversity: a land-type classification of 16 'regional ecosystems' mapped at 1:100,000 scale, and a landscape-scale classification of 40 biogeographic subregions that discriminate relatively uniform landscapes at about 1:500,000 scale. Conservation targets are expressed as the extent of regrowth needed to increase the extent of intact or 'remnant' areas of each biodiversity feature to either 5\% or 10\% of its former extent. In each case, irreplaceability and complementarity are positively correlated, and either metric type could be used to identify relatively large sets of high-priority patches. However, regional-scale restoration is likely to involve iterative investment and therefore to require discrimination of relatively small sets of patches of the highest priority for biodiversity conservation. Irreplaceability is not an ideal measure of biodiversity value when planning such iterative processes, simply because irreplaceability is uninformative for ranking 'high-value' patches; they all have the highest possible score. This study demonstrates the importance of considering quite fundamental points when choosing metrics for conservation planning, such as the frequency distribution of values they produce. Where planning aims to identify quite small sets of very high value features metrics that are most variable among the highest value patches, like the one used for complementarity, in this study, will be more useful than metrics that are strongly bounded at higher values.

7653046,"Influence Of The Resolution Of Forest Cover Maps In Evaluating Fragmentation And Connectivity To Assess Habitat Conservation Status","The analysis of fragmentation and habitat connectivity is important in determining their conservation status and ensuring their long-term survival. However, the reliability of assessments on habitat conservation status may depend on the resolution of forest cover maps used as inputs. The aim of this paper is to quantify differences in the results of habitat fragmentation and connectivity analysis found when using three different forest cover maps of various resolutions, and discusses their effect in the assessment of habitat conservation status. The study was conducted in a Natura 2000 habitat (9120:Atlantic acidophilous beech forests) in Spain. To measure fragmentation, we carried out a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) which provided a very detailed spatial landscape description (core, islet, bridge, loop, branch and perforation elements). We compared the habitat total area (Hta) with the habitat area without edge width (Hwe), which correspond to the obtained previous cores. To measure connectivity, we used the probability of connectivity index (PC). We used three different forest cover maps with different spatial resolutions: (1) a 2 m map derived from remote sensing using very high resolution satellite imagery (GeoEye) processed with object-based image analysis (OBIA_layer); (2) a 10 m map derived from fieldwork and aerial photo-interpretation at 1:10,000 scale (Forest_layer); and (3) a 50 m map obtained by a similar method at 1:50,000 scale (Atlas_layer). Our results confirm results obtained by previous studies showing that the resolution of input forest cover maps substantially influences MSPA results. The habitat area proportion classified as core decreased as the resolution of input forest cover maps increased, whereas the amount of islets, bridges, loops, branches and perforations increased. The spatial resolution of forest cover maps influences the assessment of habitat conservation status. Habitat conservation status was assessed as being ‘unfavourable inadequate’ (the middle rank out of three) with the coarse Atlas_layer, and as ‘unfavourable bad’ (the bottom rank out) when using the higher resolution Forest_layer and OBIA_layer. This can be critical for European environmental funding. Results obtained also show that resolution of input forest cover maps influence the calculated values of PC index. The use of high-resolution forest cover maps is critical to study habitat connectivity, since otherwise the outcome presents no appreciable result. We conclude that using remote sensing techniques together with OBIA is the most appropriate and cost-effective method for analyzing forest fragmentation and connectivity for habitat conservation status assessments. The source and/or the method of generation of the habitat data layer used (also the spatial resolution) as well as the connectivity analysis method applied must at all times be reported in such analyses. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017,"{""García-Abril, A."",""Hernando, A."",""Legrand, M."",""Valbuena, R."",""Velázquez, J.""}","jour",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.031","{""notes"": ""('hernando_influenceresolutionforestcover_2017',)""}","{}",2025-02-26 19:58:16,"included",NA,NA

The authors assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies for each of the four major subbasins of the Mississippi into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) using an ensemble Kalman smoother from January 2003 to May 2006. Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.",2008,"{""Zaitchik, Benjamin""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JHM951.1","{}","{}",2024-04-26 19:06:40,"included",NA,NA
7038636,"Identification Of High Nature Value Grassland With Remote Sensing And Minimal Field Data","In the last 50 years intensification of agricultural land use systems drastically reduced extensively used grassland areas. These areas are of high ecological value due to high species richness and occurring rare species. Therefore, recent European Union (EU) laws stipulate the conservation and monitoring of this farmland, also called ""high nature value"" (HNV) farmland. As a consequence of these new laws, a so called HNV indicator system was implemented that requires all EU member states to establish a nationwide monitoring system for HNV areas. These monitoring systems are challenged among other by the difficult differentiation between grassland types which today at fine scale is only possible with time and cost intensive field work. Due to this high work-load and financial limitations, nationwide field campaigns have to be sample-based and hence will not deliver a spatially consistent result. In this study, we examine whether low and high nature value grasslands can be differentiated with remotely-sensed reflectance data, which could support existing field survey-based monitoring approaches. We used multi-seasonal, multispectral remote sensing data (RapidEye) in combination with sparse field data (collected in southern Germany) and three one-class classifiers to classify A) HNV grassland against other areas and to differentiate between B) three quality classes of HNV grassland according to the current German HNV monitoring approach. The results for A) indicated high performances of the tested approaches to identify HNV grassland areas. Biased support vector machine delivered best overall results (high detection rate and low false positive rates). However, the results also showed a consistent underestimation of HNV grasslands. Results for B) showed that a separation into several HNV quality classes is not possible with any of the tested approaches. We conclude that with the presented approach HNV grasslands can be identified from the landscape matrix based on its spectral signal. Combining the presented approach with an object oriented classifier or with land registry data could further improve the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

6903634,"A Land Use Regression Model Incorporating Data On Industrial Point Source Pollution","Advancing the understanding of the spatial aspects of air pollution in the city regional environment is an area where improved methods can be of great benefit to exposure assessment and policy support. We created land use regression (LUR) models for SO2, NO2 and PM10 for Tianjin, China. Traffic volumes, road networks, land use data, population density, meteorological conditions, physical conditions and satellite-derived greenness, brightness and wetness were used for predicting SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. We incorporated data on industrial point sources to improve LUR model performance. In order to consider the impact of different sources, we calculated the PSIndex, LSIndex and area of different land use types (agricultural land, industrial land, commercial land, residential land, green space and water area) within different buffer radii (1 to 20 km). This method makes up for the lack of consideration of source impact based on the LUR model. Remote sensing-derived variables were significantly correlated with gaseous pollutant concentrations such as SO2 and NO2. R-2 values of the multiple linear regression equations for SO2, NO2 and PM10 were 0.78, 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, and the RMSE values were 0.32, 0.18 and 0.21, respectively. Model predictions at validation monitoring sites went well with predictions generally within 15\% of measured values. Compared to the relationship between dependent variables and simple variables (such as traffic variables or meteorological condition variables), the relationship between dependent variables and integrated variables was more consistent with a linear relationship.

This study examined the capability of machine learning (ML) models in estimating soil texture fractions using different combinations of remotely sensed data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and terrain-derived covariates (TDC) across two contrasting agroecological regions in Southwest Germany, Kraichgau and the Swabian Alb. Importantly, we tested the predictive power of three different ML models: the random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) coupled with the remote sensing data covariates. As expected, ML model performance was not consistent regarding the input covariates, soil texture fractions, and study regions. For example, in the Swabian Alb, the SVM model performed the best for the sand content with S2 + TDC (RMSE = 3.63\%, R-2 = 0.42), and XGB best predicted the clay content with S1 + S2 + TDC (RMSE = 6.84\%, R-2 = 0.64). In Kraichgau, the best models for sand (RMSE = 7.54\%, R-2 = 0.79) and clay contents (RMSE = 6.14\%, R-2 = 0.48) were obtained using XGB and SVM, respectively. Moreover, the results indicated that TDC were critical in estimating soil texture fractions, especially in Kraichgau, which indicated that topography plays an important role in defining the spatial distribution of soil properties. In contrast, the contribution of remote sensing data better predicted the silt and clay content in the Swabian Alb. The transferability of a region-specific model to the other region was low as indicated by poor predictive performance. The resulting soil-texture-fraction maps could be a significant source of information for efficient land resource management and environmental monitoring. Nonetheless, further research to evaluate the added value of the Sentinel imagery and to better analyze the spatial transferability of machine learning models is highly recommended.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs14235909","{""notes"": ""('mirzaeitalarposhti_digitalsoiltexturemapping_2022',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 19:20:59,"included",NA,NA

We describe a modeling framework and an automatic control algorithm that prescribe optimal releases from the Selingue dam in the Upper Niger River Basin, with the objective of understanding how SWOT data might be used to the benefit of operational water management. The modeling framework was used in a twin experiment to simulate the true system state and an ensemble of corrupted model states. Virtual SWOT observations of reservoir and river levels were assimilated into the model with a repeat cycle of 21 days. The updated state was used to initialize a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that computed the optimal reservoir release that meets a minimum flow requirement 300 km downstream of the dam. The data assimilation results indicate that the model updates had a positive effect on estimates of both water level and discharge. The persistence, which describes the duration of the assimilation effect, was clearly improved (greater than 21 days) by integrating a smoother into the assimilation procedure. We compared performances of the MPC with SWOT data assimilation to an open-loop MPC simulation. Results show that the data assimilation resulted in substantial improvements in the performances of the Selingue dam management with a greater ability to meet environmental requirements (the number of days the target is missed falls to zero) and a minimum volume of water released from the dam.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/2014wr016157","{""notes"": ""('munier_swotdataassimilationoperational_2015',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 19:08:42,"included",NA,NA

Information about drought is valuable for river basin authorities and the farmers affected by their decisions. The economic value of this information and the resulting decisions are of interest to these two stakeholder groups and to the information providers. Understanding the dynamics of extreme events, including droughts, in future climate scenarios for the Mediterranean is being improved continuously. This paper analyses the economic value of information on drought events taking into account the risk aversion of water managers. We consider the effects of drought management plans on rice production in the Ebro river basin. This enables us to compute the willingness to compensate the river basin authority for more accurate information allowing for better decision-making. If runoff is reduced, river basin planners can consider the reduction of water allocation for irrigation in order to eliminate the risk of water scarcity. Alternately, river basin planners may decide to maintain water allocation and accept a reduction of water supply reliability, leaving farmers exposed to drought events. These two alternatives offer different risk levels for crop production and farmers’ incomes which determine the value of this information to the river basin authority.

Precision Agriculture (PA) offers a sustainable management solution to meet the increasingly high demand of food and raw materials. PA is also believed to increase safety of the environment, reduce climate change effects, and improve food security. Farmers need to make timely decisions throughout the agricultural life cycle, that is, from paddock to plate. Crop management (from sowing till harvesting) is an important component of this cycle and needs apt decision by the farmers. Such decisions must be timely and precise, for example, how much of weedicide needs to be sprayed and where exactly in the fields it is needed. Geospatial technologies assist in identifying variabilities in soil, weather, water, and crop performance. These are important crop limiting factors and need to be addressed through various management operations. Geospatial technologies in combination with Internet of Things (IoT) guides farmers not only to identify these factors but also provide support in making optimal decisions. This process makes agriculture a digital entity and thus provides considerable information about the land characteristics of individual farms. Remotely sensed imagery is frequently used for mapping agricultural land use, crop yield prediction, and stress monitoring. Remote and in-situ sensors have been developed and used for mapping and monitoring of soil and water characteristics such as electrical conductivity, soil moisture, and microclimate of plants. This information is transformed into knowledge through using machine learning techniques. The potential of these machine learning techniques to monitor various types of crop stresses has been explored to a large extent during past 10 years and more recently deep learning techniques are being developed owing to the rapid advancements in computing capabilities. This chapter, firstly, introduces the need of PA in response to economic and environmental impacts of increased food production to feed about eight billion people. While introducing its need, we argue that PA needs to be adopted as a management philosophy. Secondly, enabling geospatial technologies including Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) has been discussed in relation to their utility in PA. After giving the reader an idea about the magnitude of data obtained using GIS and RS techniques, big data analytics have been presented to show its potential for operationalizing PA. Thirdly, a state-of-the-art conceptual system of PA is described along with the practical use of geospatial technologies for its various components with practical examples from Australian Center for International Agriculture Research's (ACIAR) funded projects. However, the user can be doubtful when it comes to data sharing. Lastly, survey results have been shared with the readers to apprise them of the use of technology in agriculture relevant to PA components. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

7038293,"The Six Dimensions Of Value Associated To The Use Of Copernicus Sentinel Data: Key Findings From The Sentinel Benefits Study","The role of Earth Observation (EO) data from satellites in supporting informed decision-making and more efficient operational processes is becoming increasingly recognized. However, analysing the value that this generates remains a challenge. Often, top-down cost-benefit analyses are used to justify budgets but with very broad-based, macro-economic assumptions. The approach discussed in this paper is bottom-up building on the use of a single product or service arising from the use of data coming from one or more of the Copernicus Sentinel satellites. This allows a much finer, detailed understanding of how the data is being used and hence contributing to informed decision making. A case-based, value-chain methodology has been applied through which the impact on society can be analysed. Whilst early cases focused on economic value i.e., monetized benefits, later ones recognise that often the benefits may be wider than this. For instance, organisations can benefit through an increased reputation, or societal values such as quality of life can be felt. Consequently, a set of non-monetary dimensions have been defined which provide a new framework for the analysis. The six dimensions are described in the paper and have been tested on a significant number of recent cases. The paper describes the updated methodology and the results obtained through its application.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.804862","{""notes"": ""('sawyer_dimensionscopernicussentineldata_2022',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 15:57:28,"included",NA,NA
7038421,"Managing Agricultural Water Considering Water Allocation Priority Based On Remote Sensing Data","To fairly distribute limited irrigation water resources in arid regions, a water allocation priority evaluation method based on remote sensing data was proposed and integrated with an optimization model. First, the water supply response unit was divided according to canal system conditions. Then, a spatialization method was used for generating spatial agricultural output value (income from planting industry) and grain yield (yield of food crops) with the help of NDVI and the potential yield of farmland. Third, the AHP-TOPSIS method was employed to calculate the water allocation priority based on the above information. Finally, the evaluation results were integrated with a nonlinear multiobjective model to optimally allocate agricultural land and water resources, considering the combined objective of minimum envy and proportional fairness. The method was applied to Hetao irrigation area, an arid agriculture-dominant region in Northwest China. After solving the model, optimization alternatives were obtained, which indicate that: (1) the spatial method of agricultural output value can improve the accuracy by around 16\% compared with the traditional method, and the spatial method of grain yield also have good accuracy (MAPE = 14.66\%); (2) the rank of water allocation priority can reflect more spatial information, and provide practical decision support for the distribution of water resources; (3) the envy index can better improve the efficiency of an allocation system compared to the Gini coefficient method.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs13081536","{""notes"": ""('luo_managingagriculturalwaterwater_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 17:05:03,"included",NA,NA
7036577,"Evaluating The Potential Of Als Data To Increase The Efficiency Of Aboveground Biomass Estimates In Tropical Peat-Swamp Forests","Estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests are critically required by many actors including forest managers, forest services and policy makers. Because the AGB of a forest cannot be observed directly, models need to be employed. Allometric models that predict the AGB of a single tree as a function of diameter at breast height (DBH) are commonly used in forest inventories that use a probability selection scheme to estimate total AGB. However, for forest areas with limited accessibility, implementing such a field-based survey can be challenging. In such cases, models that use remotely sensed information may support the biomass assessment if useful predictor variables are available and statistically sound estimators can be derived. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has become a prominent auxiliary data source for forest biomass assessments and is even considered to be one of the most promising technologies for AGB assessments in forests. In this study, we combined ALS and forest inventory data from a logged-over tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia to estimate total AGB. Our objective was to compare the precision of AGB estimates from two approaches: (i) from a field-based inventory only and, (ii) from an ALS-assisted approach where ALS and field inventory data were combined. We were particularly interested in analyzing whether the precision of AGB estimates can be improved by integrating ALS data under the particular conditions. For the inventory, we used a standard approach based on a systematic square sample grid. For building a biomass-link model that relates the field based AGB estimates to ALS derived metrics, we used a parametric nonlinear model. From the field-based approach, the estimated mean AGB was 241.38 Mgha-1 with a standard error of 11.17 Mgha-1 (SE% = 4.63%). Using the ALS-assisted approach, we estimated a similar mean AGB of 245.08 Mgha-1 with a slightly smaller standard error of 10.57 Mgha-1 (SE% = 4.30%). Altogether, this is an improvement of precision of estimation, even though the biomass-link model we found showed a large Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 47.43 Mgha-1. We conclude that ALS data can support the estimation of AGB in logged-over tropical peat swamp forests even if the model quality is relatively low. A modest increase in precision of estimation (from 4.6% to 4.3%), as we found it in our study area, will be welcomed by all forest inventory planners as long as ALS data and analysis expertise are available at low or no cost. Otherwise, it gives rise to a challenging economic question, namely whether the cost of the acquisition of ALS data is reasonable in light of the actual increase in precision. © 2018 by the authors.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs10091344","{""notes"": ""('magdon_evaluatingpotentialalsdata_2018',)""}","{}",2024-12-25 18:49:42,"included",NA,NA

The goal is to develop an efficient solution for collecting accurate forest data in dynamic environments and to highlight potential wildfire regions of interest to support precise forest management and conservation on the ground. Our paper provides a detailed description of the hardware and software components of the system, covering sensor synchronization, data acquisition, and processing. The overall system implements simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, particularly Fast LiDAR Inertial Odometry with Scan Context (FASTLIO-SC), and LiDAR Inertial Odometry Smoothing and Mapping (LIOSAM), for accurate odometry estimation and map generation. We also integrate a fuel mapping representation based on one of the models, used by the United States Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to classify fire behavior, into the system using semantic segmentation, LiDAR camera registration, and odometry as inputs. Real-time representation of fuel properties is achieved through a lightweight map data structure at 4 Hz. The research results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system and show that it can provide accurate forest data collection, accurate pose estimation, and comprehensive fuel mapping with precision values for the main segmented classes above 85\%. Qualitative evaluations suggest the system's capabilities and highlight its potential to improve forest management and conservation efforts.

For this reason, an effective monitoring system should be needed during the exercise phase to support control and management activities by owners and authorities. Actually, control of the Italian infrastructures is demanded to technicians and maintenance teams who detect, through visual control, anomalies and failures which require a site-specific monitoring. Such approach could represent a limited and only partial information to fully characterize and to investigate the infrastructure potential damage and can be highly expensive if a high density of measurements suitable for wide-scale infrastructure monitoring is required. Necessity of a very fast procedure for monitoring of these man-made infrastructures, finds in the application of modern remote sensing techniques a valid response to support infrastructures health assessments. In this work, Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) has been used to investigate stability condition of S.P. 264 linear infrastructure, in Salerno Province (Italy), which is affected by several slow-moving landslides. Furthermore, an analysis of costs and benefits derived by using DInSAR technique has been provided.

7037996,"Irrigation Retrieval From Landsat Optical/Thermal Data Integrated Into A Crop Water Balance Model: A Case Study Over Winter Wheat Fields In A Semi-Arid Region","Monitoring irrigation is essential for an efficient management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions. We propose to estimate the timing and the amount of irrigation throughout the agricultural season using optical and thermal Landsat-7/8 data. The approach is implemented in four steps: i) partitioning the Landsat land surface temperature (LST) to derive the crop water stress coefficient (Ks), ii) estimating the daily root zone soil moisture (RZSM) from the integration of Landsat-derived Ks into a crop water balance model, iii) retrieving irrigation at the Landsat pixel scale and iv) aggregating pixel-scale irrigation estimates at the crop field scale. The new irrigation retrieval method is tested over three agricultural areas during four seasons and is evaluated over five winter wheat fields under different irrigation techniques (drip, flood and no-irrigation). The model is very accurate for the seasonal accumulated amounts (R similar to 0.95 and RMSE similar to 44 mm). However, lower agreements with observed irrigations are obtained at the daily scale. To assess the performance of the irrigation retrieval method over a range of time periods, the daily predicted and observed irrigations are cumulated from 1 to 90 days. Generally, acceptable errors (R = 0.52 and RMSE = 27 mm) are obtained for irrigations cumulated over 15 days and the performance gradually improves by increasing the accumulation period, depicting a strong link to the frequency of Landsat overpasses (16 days or 8 days by combining Landsat-7 and -8). Despite the uncertainties in retrieved irrigations at daily to weekly scales, the daily RZSM and evapotranspiration simulated from the retrieved daily irrigations are estimated accurately and are very close to those estimated from actual irrigations. This research demonstrates the utility of high spatial resolution optical and thermal data for estimating irrigation and consequently for better closing the water budget over agricultural areas. We also show that significant improvements can be expected at daily to weekly time scales by reducing the revisit time of high-spatial resolution thermal data, as included in the TRISHNA future mission requirements.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.rse.2019.111627","{""notes"": ""('oliveraguerra_irrigationretrievallandsatoptical_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 18:03:44,"included",NA,NA

Numerical models are useful for studying fish and other aquatic invertebrate larval transport. SRS data are used to locate fish stocks, locate areas of reef stress and delineate areas of high productivity in the wake of cyclone paths. Coupling SRS with models helps to manage fishery resources on an ecosystem scale, generate potential fishing zones (PFZ), forecast ocean state (OSF), detect meso-scale features such as eddies and track cyclones threatening coastal resources. Modelled, SRS and in situ data sets in combination can be used in the estimation of potential fishery resources in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which in turn can help in fishing fleet management.

The integrated analysis based on the cloud computing and traditional methods represents a great potential as a low-cost, efficient and user-friendly method for global and regional environmental study. The user can save considerable time and cost on data integration. The research shows that there is an excellent promise in performing regional environmental analysis by using a cloud platform.

There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet.

Such variables are available from the WorldClim database for the entire earth surface and at various spatial resolutions. Moreover, convenient access to real-time satellite data and their products has recently created a new way to produce environmental variables. Therefore, in the present study, it was attempted to compare the performance of bioclimatic variables derived from precipitation and temperature instrumental records (scenario I) and variables derived from remote sensing data (scenario II) where both scenarios were from 2001 to 2017. The variables were employed to predict the distribution of Artemisia sieberi in central Iran through five Species Distribution Models (SDMs) such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). The DEM layer was derived from 90-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 1-km MODIS land surface temperature and vegetation indices products, and downscaled PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data were employed as derivations of temperature and precipitation to produce bioclimatic variables for scenario II. The results obtained from independent sample t-test on AUC(ratio) values derived from the correlative models showed that it had more satisfactory results when they were getting from the data of scenario II than the scenario I (p < .01). RF scored the highest partial AUC values (AUC(ratio)) among the single models, and based on both scenarios, ensemble map was able to provide the most accurate predictions. There were also non-significant differences among the performance of RF, CTA and ensemble models under two scenarios (p < .01).

7038476,"Implication Of Geo-Informatics (Gis/Rs) On Agricultural Irrigation Management: The State Of The Art","The agricultural sector is the highest water consumer worldwide. Its production is the essential pillar in world’s food security. Limited water resources are the major constraint in an agricultural production system. Better application of irrigation water will result in increased water and land productivity for the planted crops. Precision irrigation is one of the promising keys to solve this dilemma. It allows applying the exact needed amount of water in its optimal place at the right time. Yet, this requires a huge information database to be accurately able to apply precision irrigation. The traditional trial-and-error technique in agricultural experiments to improve land and water productivity is time-consuming and sometimes is economically unaffordable. Thus, there is a need to develop more cost-effective and accurate tools to correctly survey world’s natural resources and its most sustainable exploitation. Geo-informatics implication in combination with suitable decision support systems plays a relevant role in water management in agricultural sector, especially when applying precision irrigation and farming techniques.

7037247,"Spatio-Temporal Prediction Of Crop Disease Severity For Agricultural Emergency Management Based On Recurrent Neural Networks","As crop diseases bring huge losses every year in both developed and developing countries, determining how to precisely predict crop disease severity to facilitate agricultural emergency management is really a worldwide problem. Previous studies have introduced machine learning (ML) techniques into crop disease prediction and achieved better experimental results. However, the architectures of these ML models are unsuitable to model time series data. Moreover, the dependences among observations over time and across space have not been taken into account in model construction. By applying data-mining techniques to dynamic spatial panels of remote sensing data and considering features of bioclimatic, topographic and soil conditions as a supplement, we propose a novel crop disease prediction framework for agricultural emergency management based on ensemble learning techniques and spatio-temporal recurrent neural network (STRNN) which is an extension of recurrent neural network (RNN) in time and space. Empirical experiments are conducted on a specific dataset which is built based on reported cases of wheat yellow rust outbreaks in the Longnan city. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms all baseline models in crop disease severity prediction.

7037323,"Optimizing Top Dresseing Nitrogen Fertilization Using Venμs And Sentinel‐2 L1 Data","Environmental and economic constraints are forcing farmers to be more precise in the rates and timing of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to wheat. In practice, N is frequently applied without knowledge of the precise amount needed or the likelihood of significant protein enhance-ment. The objective of this study was to help farmers optimize top dress N application by adopting the use of within‐field reference N strips. We developed an assisting app on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to map the spatial variability of four different vegetation indices (VIs) in each field by calculating the mean VI, masking extreme values (three standard deviations, 3σ) of each field, and presenting the anomaly as a deviation of ±σ and ±2σ or deviation of percentage. VIs based on red‐edge bands (REIP, NDRE, ICCI) were very useful for the detection of wheat above ground N uptake and in‐field anomalies. VENμS high temporal and spatial resolutions provide advantages over Sentinel‐2 in monitoring agricultural fields during the growing season, representing the within‐field variations and for decision making, but the spatial coverage and accessibility of Senti-nel‐2 data are much better. Sentinel‐2 data is already available on the GEE platform and was found to be of much help for the farmers in optimizing topdressing N application to wheat, applying it only where it will increase grain yield and/or grain quality. Therefore, the GEE anomaly app can be used for top‐N dressing application decisions. Nevertheless, there are some issues that must be tested, and more research is required. To conclude, satellite images can be used in the GEE platform for anomaly detection, rendering results within a few seconds. The ability to use L1 VENμS or Sen-tinel‐2 data without atmospheric correction through GEE opens the opportunity to use these data for several applications by farmers and others. © 2021 by the authors.

7038495,"An Ontology-Based Reasoning Framework For Querying Satellite Images For Disaster Monitoring","This paper presents a framework in which satellite images are classified and augmented with additional semantic information to enable queries about what can be found on the map at a particular location, but also about paths that can be taken. This is achieved by a reasoning framework based on qualitative spatial reasoning that is able to find answers to high level queries that may vary on the current situation. This framework called SemCityMap, provides the full pipeline from enriching the raw image data with rudimentary labels to the integration of a knowledge representation and reasoning methods to user interfaces for high level querying. To illustrate the utility of SemCityMap in a disaster scenario, we use an urban environmentcentral Stockholmin combination with a flood simulation. We show that the system provides useful answers to high-level queries also with respect to the current flood status. Examples of such queries concern path planning for vehicles or retrieval of safe regions such as find all regions close to schools and far from the flooded area. The particular advantage of our approach lies in the fact that ontological information and reasoning is explicitly integrated so that queries can be formulated in a natural way using concepts on appropriate level of abstraction, including additional constraints.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/s17112545","{""notes"": ""('alirezaie_ontologybasedreasoningframework_2017',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 18:34:57,"included",NA,NA
7652758,"Use Of Earth Observation Satellite Data To Guide The Implementation Of Integrated Pest And Pollinator Management (Ippm) Technologies In An Avocado Production System","Insect pollinators provide an important ecosystem service by improving agricultural productivity. However, their populations have been declining in recent years due to excessive use of synthetic pesticides, climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Climate and LULC changes have resulted in land fragmentation and consequently pollinator habitat loss. To conserve pollinators, there is a need for sustainable agricultural practices such as integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM), which is a holistic landscape management approach that minimizes pesticides use while conserving pollinator abundance and diversity. This study aimed to use earth observation (EO) data to characterize landscape dynamics in terms of vegetation productivity to guide the implementation of IPPM interventions in an avocado production system in Murang'a (Kenya). Specifically, we utilized Sentinel-2 (S-2)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity to assess IPPM implementation sites. The NDVI was calculated using multi-date S-2 data acquired during the dry and wet seasons and categorized into three vegetation productivity classes - low, medium, and high - using a K-means unsupervised clustering method. We also collected socio-economic baseline data from 410 farmers with a focus on their perception to implement one of four avocado pest management and pollination options: (1) IPPM, (2) integrated pest management (IPM), (3) pollinator supplementation (P), and (4) no intervention (control). The three landscape vegetation productivity classes were then linked with the four farmer preferences with regards to the implementation options. Criteria based on the distances among the sites for implementing the different four options were set for farmer selection and the experiment was replicated three times in each vegetation productivity class (i.e. in total 12 farmers in each class). The results showed that the Kmeans method was successful in characterizing the landscape vegetation productivity with an overall accuracy of 86.2\%. One the other hand, we successfully selected the 36 (12 in each of the 3 vegetation productivity classes) out of 410 farmers who met our distance-based criteria and participated in the implementation of one of the four technology options (i.e. IPPM, IPM, P, and control). In conclusion, NDVI proved to be a vital proxy for assessing the landscape dynamics as it provided a robust view of vegetation productivity patterns, which enabled a wellrepresentative distribution of the four pest management and pollination options across the landscape. Overall, the study shows the utility of integrating EO and socio-economic data in selecting sites for implementing agrotechnologies at a landscape scale.",2021,"{""Abdel-Rahman, Elfatih M."",""Adan, Marian"",""Dubois, Thomas"",""Gachoki, Stella"",""Kerubo, Vivian"",""Landmann, Tobias"",""Lattorff, H.

With recent technological advances in wastewater treatment, it is now possible to produce reclaimed water of any quality. Thus, the use of reclaimed water will depend on the reuse opportunities and the cost of the required infrastructure. Historically, centralized wastewater treatment facilities have served the needs of organized societies since the mid 1800s. However. as there are limited options for expansion of most existing centralized facilities, the use of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems offers significant advantages including being close both to the source of wastewater generation and to potential water reuse applications. The comparative advantages of satellite and decentralized wastewater management systems for a number of water reuse applications are presented and discussed in this paper.

7038029,"Using Remote Sensing As A Support To The Implementation Of The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive In Sw Portugal","The exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of coastal countries are coming under increasing pressure from various economic sectors such as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and energy production. In Europe, there is a policy to expand the maritime economic sector without damaging the environment by ensuring that these activities comply with legally binding Directives, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). However, monitoring an extensive maritime area is a logistical and economic challenge. Remote sensing is considered one of the most cost effective, methods for providing the spatial and temporal environmental data that will be necessary for the effective implementation of the MSFD. However, there is still a concern about the uncertainties associated with remote sensed products. This study has tested how a specific satellite product can contribute to the monitoring of a MSFD Descriptor for ""good environmental status"" (GES). The results show that the quality of the remote sensing product Algal Pigment Index 1 (API 1) from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor of the European Space Agency for ocean colour products can be effectively validated with in situ data from three stations off the SW Iberian Peninsula. The validation results show good agreement between the MERIS API 1 and the in situ data for the two more offshore stations, with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.79, and with lower uncertainties for the average relative percentage difference (RPD) of 24.6\% and 27.9\% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.40 and 0.38 for Stations B and C, respectively. Near to the coast, Station A has the lowest R-2 of 0.63 and the highest uncertainties with an RPD of 112.9\% and a RMSE of 1.00. It is also the station most affected by adjacency effects from the land: when the Improved Contrast between Ocean and Land processor (ICOL) is applied the R-2 increases to 0.77 and there is a 30\% reduction in the uncertainties estimated by RPD. The MERIS API 1 product decreases from inshore to offshore, with higher values occurring mainly between early spring and the end of the summer, and with lower values during winter. By using the satellite images for API 1, it is possible to detect and track the development of algal blooms in coastal and marine waters, demonstrating the usefulness of remote sensing for supporting the implementation of the MSFD with respect to Descriptor 5: Eutrophication. It is probable that remote sensing will also prove to be useful for monitoring other Descriptors of the MSFD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

6863704,"The Role Of Remote Sensing In The Development Of Smart Indicators For Ecosystem Services Assessment","Human beings benefit from a wide range of goods and services from the natural environment that are collectively known as ecosystem services. However, rapid natural habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change is causing accelerating losses of populations and species, with largely unknown consequences on ecosystem functioning and the sustainable provision of ecosystem services. It is crucial, therefore, to develop a suite of indicators of the health and status of ecosystems, to monitor and quantify services delivery and to facilitate policy responses to stop and reverse negative trends. An effective framework to facilitate the development of suitable indicators is by using the SMART approach, which defines five criteria that could be applied to set monitoring and management goals, which are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive. Remote sensing provides a useful data source that can monitor ecosystems over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Although the development and application of landscape indicators (vegetation indices, for example) derived from remote sensing data are comparatively advanced, it is acknowledged that a number of organisms and ecosystem processes are not detectable by remote sensing. This paper explores several approaches to overcome this limitation, by examining the strong affinity of species with dominant habitat structures and through the coupling of remote sensing and ecosystem process models using examples drawn from a number of important ecosystems. © 2016 Biodiversity Conservancy International.",2016,"{""Brown, C."",""Cutler, M.

6863189,"Three Most Widely Used Gnss-Based Shoreline Monitoring Methods To Support Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policies","Shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). It provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides information necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones. Shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability. For monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could benefit policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern. However, various GNSS methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difficult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach. Using a case study of the Pernambuco State ICZM in Brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used GNSS-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (RK), real-time kinematic (RTK), and precise point positioning (PPP) methods. It also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations. The results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for supporting ICZM policies.",2017,"{""Awange, J.

7037207,"Precision Agriculture On Grassland: Applications, Perspectives And Constraints","Precision agriculture (PA) is an innovative, integrated and internationally standardized approach aiming to increase the efficiency of resource use and to reduce the uncertainty of decisions required to control variation on farms. Worldwide, investments in research and technology on PA have considerably increased during the past decades. Advances in agricultural research, combined with application of PA on grasslands, could provide major economic and environmental benefits. However, most of the available technology is currently being applied on arable land but not on grassland although the latter contributes substantially to agricultural land use as well as to capital and income. The authors hypothesise that heterogeneity of grassland among and within fields is a major constraint to PA application and that understanding such heterogeneity would enable to implement PA where competitive and cost efficient. In this paper, current developments and future perspectives of digital image processing, remote sensing, yield measurement, and site-specific management on grassland are discussed. At fine scales, on-board sensors can provide information on sward properties that application techniques could respond to. At larger scales, remotely sensed information can provide digital maps of type and status of vegetation that allow a precise management, although the mix of spatial coverage and spatial resolution is not yet ideal. The site-specific management on arable land, however, has not yet proven its applicability in different environments. On grassland, some of these technologies are either already implemented as prototypes into research projects or under development with a short-term perspective to be introduced into practice. Grassland scientists can significantly contribute to the current development and, in return, benefit from latest sensor technology and so enable rapid data acquisition and improvement of experimentation and knowledge. Also existing computer simulation models can contribute to make PA on grassland a success. Animal husbandry is strongly linked to grassland utilization and can also benefit from present PA technology through animal production and health control and animal guidance with appropriate electronic stimuli. Considerable interdisciplinary research is required to link existing knowledge on PA technology with grassland science and with animal science. This could mainly be accomplished by the interpretation of signal-object interaction that is needed to set up suitable configurations on grassland. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Natural and cultural features were digitized from 1:50,000 topographic maps using a geographic information system (GIS) to cover the 29 communities below the tree line in the western Canadian Arctic. Landsat Thematic Mapper data covering the same area were classified into land cover or fuel types. Detailed information on each fire such as location, area burned, date of discovery, fire number, fire zone, fire class and source of ignition was obtained and added to each map sheet as attribute data. A generalized vegetation cover map using NOAA AVHRR data was also obtained. The Intelligent Fire Management Information System (IFMIS) integrates relational data bases, geographic information display, and expert systems. It also has a spatial analysis procedure for forest fire preparedness planning. Linking the weather to the forest fuels through the Fire Weather Index system (FWI) and the Fire Behaviour Prediction System (FBPS), fire danger and fire behaviour are calculated and displayed, cell-by-cell. Values-at-risk and fire suppression resources are used in the dispatching and planning component of the system. The planning component allows the user to evaluate the coverage of fire suppression resources under the prevalent forecast fire behaviour conditions. Through the integration of data from the above systems, a set of maps were created which were used to analyze fire behaviour potential, identify fire hazards, and provide a basis for settlement protection strategies within the context of other land use activities such as wildlife harvesting and recreational activities. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1996,"{""Epp, H."",""Lanoville, R.""}","jour",NA,"10.1080/10106049609354537","{""notes"": ""('epp_satellitedatageographicinformation_1996',)""}","{}",2025-02-27 21:05:45,"included",NA,NA

High-resolution digital elevation models derived from an airborne remote sensing platform informed land managers tasked with endangered species restoration by guiding their efforts to highly suitable areas of the landscape where plant growth, performance, and survival should be greater. In turn, satellite-based monitoring offered a temporal approach to broadly quantify vegetation fire risk in order to restrict fire promoting activities in dry landscapes most modified by fire promoting invasive grasses. Together, the delineation of high suitability areas for plant-based restoration and low suitability areas for wildfire management ultimately releases moderate suitability land for alternative land uses deemed important in multistakeholder landscapes.

7037297,"Policy Implications Of Remote Sensing In Understanding Urban Environments: Developing A Wetlands Inventory For Community Decision-Making In Lucas County, Ohio","The growth in urbanized land has created a variety of impacts to natural areas. Urbanization has many effects on a wetland in terms of climate, air and water quality, hydrological changes, and boundaries and fragmentation of flora and fauna (Ehrenfeld, 2000). Wetlands must be valued as they provide many public amenities with long-term functions, which may be unrecoverable if the wetlands are lost through development, including drainage, water supply and natural habitat provisions (Mitsch et al, 2000). Because public policy supported the filling and destruction of wetlands for so long, land use planners are often reluctant or uninformed on how to integrate them into urban environments (Tilton, 1995). The use of remote sensing technology for the identification, inventory, mapping, and classification of land wetlands has been a common application of satellite imagery (MacDonald, 1999; Lyon, 2001). Numerous studies have discussed the positive benefits and opportunities presented by the technology as well as the barriers and limitations (Hardisky et al, 1986; Johnston and Barson, 1993; Kindscher et al., 1998; Lunetta and Barlogh, 1999; Munyati, 1999; Schmidt and Skidmore, 2003, Shuman and Ambrose, 2003, Townsend and Walsh, 2001). With recent improvements in the methods, computing advances, and the easier access and availability of the satellite imagery and data, it has become more possible to consider further advancements in the use of remote sensing to specifically address issues associated with wetlands research and related policy implications. The results of such research have important applications in addressing wetland management issues-such as wetland loss, degradation, and potential for restoration and remediation-within urban centers where land use pressures have negative impacts on the existence and health of wetland ecosystems. For a comprehensive review of the issues regarding the use of satellite remote sensing for wetlands, the reader is referred to Ozesmi and Bauer (2002). Beyond the methodological and technological advances-and remaining limitations-related to the use of remote sensing for wetlands inventories there are several other practical related issues in regards to how the results from such studies can be applied to address the management and decision-making at the community scale in urban areas. In addition to overcoming common barriers characteristic to the transfer of advanced computer technology-such as needs for software training, access to data sets, the availability of sufficient computer hardware requirements, and related cost issues-the use of remote sensing requires consideration of several other additional remaining issues. The application and transfer of remote sensing methods and technology for urban planning requires understanding of the complexity of wetland definitions and related management issues, acceptance of the level of accuracy obtained by the remote sensing technology, commitment for the support and funding necessary to continue and maintain inventories, databases, and for future updating of the wetland classification. The technical, educational, and decision-making issues regarding the development and utilization of remote sensing for a wetlands inventory for use in urban planning and decision-making will be examined in this paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/3-540-26676-3_3","{""notes"": ""('lawrence_policyimplicationsremotesensing_2005',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 19:21:40,"included",NA,NA
6862799,"Mapping Landscape-Scale Peatland Degradation Using Airborne Lidar And Multispectral Data","Context: An increased interest in the restoration of peatlands for delivering multiple benefits requires a greater understanding of the extent and location of natural and artificial features that contribute to degradation. Objectives: We assessed the utility of multiple, fine-grained remote sensing datasets for mapping peatland features and associated degraded areas at a landscape-scale. Specifically, we developed an integrated approach to identify and quantify multiple types of peatland degradation including: anthropogenic drainage ditches and peat cuttings; erosional gullies and bare peat areas. Methods: Airborne LiDAR, CASI and aerial image datasets of the South West UK, were combined to identify features within Dartmoor National Park peatland area that contribute to degradation. These features were digitised and quantified using ArcGIS before appropriate buffers were applied to estimate the wider ecohydrologically affected area. Results: Using fine-scale, large-extent remotely sensed data, combined with aerial imagery enabled key features within the wider expanse of peatland to be successfully identified and mapped at a resolution appropriate to future targeted restoration. Combining multiple datasets increased our understanding of spatial distribution and connectivity within the landscape. An area of 29 km2 or 9.2% of the Dartmoor peatland area was identified as significantly and directly ecohydrologically degraded. Conclusions: Using a combination of fine-grained remotely sensed datasets has advantages over traditional ground survey methods for identification and mapping of anthropogenic and natural erosion features at a landscape scale. The method is accurate, robust and cost-effective particularly given the remote locations and large extent of these landscapes, facilitating effective and targeted restoration planning, management and monitoring. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,"{""Anderson, K."",""Brazier, R.

6903573,"Evaluating Performance Of Community-Based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-Sensing Technologies To Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management","An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77\% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50\% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s41101-023-00222-y","{""notes"": ""('bashe_evaluatingperformancecommunitybased_2023',)""}","{}",2024-09-27 22:42:45,"included",NA,NA

In addition, there are costs associated with maintenance of the system and distribution of the information available. While public funds may be available to support initial development of the system, there may be less public support for maintaining the system and subsidizing users' access to the information. This study uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of Oklahoma farmers and ranchers, as one set of potential users, to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information. The results indicate that agricultural producers are willing to pay only a modest fee for improved weather information. Gross sales, irrigation, and past weather losses are among the factors shown to significantly impact willingness to pay.",1995,"{""Kenkel, Phil""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40987744","{}","{}",2024-04-22 03:04:10,"included",NA,NA
7036629,"Cooperation In Earth Observation Missions In Africa: A Role For Afrigeoss","This paper is aimed at examining the role of African Global Earth Observation System of Systems (AfriGEOSS) in Earth Observation (EO) mission cooperation on the continent of Africa. It discusses the importance of earth observation programs for developing countries as well as the benefits of international cooperative efforts. The paper further examined some collaborative projects on Earth Observation in Africa and their associated problems. It specifically looked at the EO data coordination initiatives such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), GEOSS, Africa Discovery Broker, etc. It then situates AfriGEOSS in the context of African Space Agenda (ASA) with recommendations especially to the Africa Union Commission for the realization of ASA set goals. The paper reiterated that regardless of whether developed or developing, Earth observation information provides substantial benefit supporting economic development, decision making and policy implementation of all countries of the world. This is as a result of its multifarious benefits to humans in areas like agriculture, forestry, risk management, disaster monitoring, maritime, defence and security and natural resources management. Consequently, the paper argued that the numerous benefits from space assets have driven countries within the continent of Africa to either acquire or develop capabilities in space systems which is devoted to improving quality of life in general. The paper concluded that while space systems are expensive, there is need for continuity and sustainability as a result of its numerous advantages to the human's society.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s10708-017-9840-5","{""notes"": ""('agbaje_cooperationearthobservationmissions_2018',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:52:38,"included",NA,NA
7038424,"Design And Simulation In Sar Satellites' Task Planning System Using Genetic Algorithm With Entropy Operator","Purpose - This paper aims to innovatively propose to improve the efficiency of satellite observation and avoid the waste of satellite resources, a genetic algorithm with entropy operator (GAE) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites' task planning algorithm. Design/methodology/approach - The GAE abbreviated as GAE introduces the entropy value of each orbit task into the fitness calculation of the genetic algorithm, which makes the orbit with higher entropy value more likely to be selected and participate in the remaining process of the genetic algorithm. Findings - The simulation result shows that in a condition of the same calculate ability, 85\% of the orbital revisit time is unchanged or decreased and 30\% is significantly reduced by using the GAE compared with traditional task planning genetic algorithm, which indicates that the GAE can improve the efficiency of satellites' task planning. Originality/value - The GAE is an optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. It combines entropy in thermodynamics with task planning problems. The algorithm considers the whole lifecycle of task planning and gets the desired results. It can greatly improve the efficiency of task planning in observation satellites and shorten the entire task execution time. Then, using the GAE to complete SAR satellites' task planning is of great significance in reducing satellite operating costs and emergency rescue, which brings certain economic and social benefits.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1108/aeat-11-2020-0247","{""notes"": ""('liu_designsimulationsarsatellites_2021',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 16:33:30,"included",NA,NA
7037174,"Conceptual Case For Assimilating Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data Into The Hazus-Mh Earthquake Module","The study of the Earth as a system is being adopted widely by geoscientists. Numerical models and simulations are providing the capability to rapidly test hypotheses and make forecasts of complex geophysical behavior. International efforts are seeking to integrate existing and emerging Earth observation systems into a global network, with enhanced data distribution, models, and decision support tools. Remote sensing is poised to fulfill the increasing need for a synoptic framework. However, the desire to improve the connection between scientific research and societal benefits has not been matched with resources and tools required to bridge the gap between research and applications. Natural hazards research and disaster management are a prime example. Here, we present a conceptual case for how interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data could make a definitive contribution to understanding earthquake processes while simultaneously supporting policy- and decision-making. InSAR measurements derived from time series of radar observations from Earth orbit uniquely can provide geographically comprehensive maps of surface deformation. Observing system simulations are suggested to evaluate the potential contributions of a future system. Simulations would adopt an open seismic hazard analysis (SHA) framework, OpenSHA, recognizing the need for more physics-based modeling and computational infrastructure. SHA is employed by the HAZUS-MH earthquake module to estimate losses. InSAR measurements of strain accumulation would provide event magnitude recurrence bounds for probabilistic SHA, while coseismic InSAR measurements would add constraints on fault rupture models for deterministic approaches. Moreover, interferograms would be incorporated graphically as proxy seismic risk maps for planning and mitigation.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1109/tgrs.2007.895848","{""notes"": ""('tralli_conceptualassimilatinginterferometricsynthetic_2007',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 23:03:55,"included",NA,NA

This research investigates the ability of two geographic information system (GIS)-based tools to promote discussion of sustainability in a suburban context. A local ecological footprint tool and a community environmental atlas (an environmentally themed online mapping system) were created for seven suburban boroughs of Montreal. Variations of both tools have been used to support sustainability efforts, but their use has not been widely evaluated. Working from a public participation GIS (PPGIS) framework that recognizes the powerful influence of data representation, this research uses focus groups to evaluate how well these tools address three criteria that have emerged from the literature on public engagement in sustainability: interdependency across systems, reflexivity about personal and social decision making, and interactions across spatial scales. Whereas the atlas remains advantageous for discussing local spatial specifics, it was found that the ecological footprint helped people see the interconnections among systems, integrate local and global aspects of sustainability, and reflect on the values and assumptions underlying current social and economic structures. © 2010 by Association of American Geographers.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/00330120903404892","{""notes"": ""('klinsky_connectinglocalglobalgeographic_2010',)""}","{""is this ESI?"",interconnections}",2024-12-16 22:00:46,"included",NA,NA

Previous studies have found that early releases of ENSO phase information could permit agricultural producers to make adjustments in their decisions and in turn generate an increase in agricultural sector welfare. This study examines whether the value of the agricultural responses can be enhanced by releasing more detailed ENSO information. Namely we evaluate the implications for projected agricultural welfare under release and adaptation to the Stone and Auliciems five phase definition of ENSO states as opposed to the more standard three phase definition. This value is estimated using a stochastic, U.S./global agricultural model representing 22 climate years. The results indicate that the release and exploitation of the more detailed ENSO phase definition almost doubles the welfare impact. The results also indicate that there is room for up to another doubling of information value through further refinements.",2002,"{""Chen, Chi-Chung""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1016160218221","{}","{}",2024-04-26 23:08:13,"included",NA,NA

Second, subnational actors have improved their institutional capacity through knowledge transfers and strategic planning, facilitated by better information and communication technology and statistical data. Third, inspection networks benefitted from technical advances, such as the access to satellite images, presenting new opportunities for the detection of environmental crimes, and new software programs facilitating risk-based inspections.

The most effective techniques strike a balance between science and art. The science side requires engineering physical algorithms capable of distilling the complex scene into a reduced set of key parameters. The artistic side involves design and construction of visually intuitive displays that maximize information content within the product image. The utility of such imagery to human analysts depends on the extent to which parameters or features of interest are conveyed unambiguously. Here, we detail and demonstrate a dynamic blended imagery technique, based on spatially variant transparency factors whose values are tied to algorithmically isolated parameters. The technique enables seamless display of multivariate information, and is applicable to any imaging system based on red-green-blue composites.

6903470,"Rapid Estimation Of Canopy Nitrogen Of Cereal Crops At Paddock Scale Using A Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index","Rising nitrogen (N) fertiliser costs and concerns over environmental impacts have emphasized the need for rapid, non-destructive, paddock-scale tools to support optimal management of N fertiliser in cereal crops. Remote sensing of canopy reflectance is one approach to address the information needed to guide N applications. One remote sensing vegetation index, the Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was developed to address issues of confounding effects of biomass and chlorophyll concentration, and Fitzgerald et al. (2010) linked the CCCI to the Canopy Nitrogen Index (CNI), a scaled index of the plant N. In the research presented here, we extend the work by Fitzgerald et al. (2010) and Cammarano et al. (2011) to whole paddocks with ground-based, airborne and satellite imagery. The methodology was applied to 11 datasets using multispectral cameras deployed on ground-based and airborne platforms, and to satellite imagery. The previously published relationship between CNI and CCCI was applied to the CCCI and biomass measurements from these new datasets to estimate CNI. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.70. A regression using the means from each dataset produced an r(2) of 0.60, and a standard error of 0.82 (\%N). Exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.87 and reduced the standard error to 0.45 (\%N). A crop model (APSIM v7) was used to simulate above ground dry matter to substitute for measured biomass, and plant N was determined from the measured CCCI and simulated biomass. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.49. The regression using the averages from each dataset was not significant (F-pr >0.10); however, exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.89 and reduced the standard error to 0.42 (\%N). To demonstrate the utility of the methods, simulated biomass values coupled with CNI estimated from RapidEye imagery were used to generate paddock maps of plant N. While the agreement between measured and estimated plant N at the paddock scales is not as close as the previous work done at small plot scales, the method shows promise, particularly if biomass can be estimated through modeling or non-destructive measures.

It is the intention of this paper to advocate the use of RS data in the field of hydrological modelling. It is shown that the main field of application of RS data in hydrological modelling lies in the meso-scale. The potential of RS in the framework of GIS is shown along with three examples. The first example shows the use of RS data for rainfall/runoff modelling in the lower meso-scale. A model was developed which used the high spatial resolution of Landsat polar orbiting satellites (30m X 30m) for model parameter estimation. The second example shows the use of geostationary satellite data for the computation of long time series of monthly runoff values in the upper meso-scale. It was applied in West Africa for the purpose of water resources planning. In the third example, a water balance model in the upper meso-scale is presented which computes daily values for all the variables in the water balance equation along with an example of the model's application in the international Mosel River basin. Here also the detection of land use changes by multi-temporal satellite imagery and their impact on hydrological parameters is discussed. In this example, emphasis is put on the combination of RS data with other information, such as digital elevation models or digitized maps, all within the framework of GIS. In conclusion, not only the potential but also the limitations of the use of RS in hydrological modelling are discussed.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/02626669409492729","{""notes"": ""('schultz_mesoscalemodelingrunoffwater_1994',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 21:37:02,"included",NA,NA
7037769,"Evaluation Of A New Practical Low-Cost Method For Prioritising The Remediation Of Fish Passage Barriers In Resource-Deficient Settings","A key challenge in fishery restoration strategies is prioritising fish passage remediation efforts to achieve optimal ecological and socio-economic outcomes. Various methodologies have been developed for assessing and pri-oritising the mitigation of fish passage barriers, but they have been designed for developed countries where site data and/or other resources are often readily available. We evaluated a new practical, low-cost basin-scale approach - referred to as the Fish Barrier Prioritisation Support System (FBPSS) - for assessing and prioritising the remediation of fish passage barriers of all types (i.e. large dams, small irrigation structures and road crossings) in resource-deficient settings, like those typical of developing countries. The FBPSS applies a five-stage decision-support framework to prioritise barriers for remediation based on geospatial, biological and socio-economic criteria. The stages involve identifying all potential barriers within the target basin using satellite imagery; conducting GIS analysis to rank the barriers for further investigation; field-validating the highest ranked barriers to ground-truth the GIS analysis results; identifying the highest priority field-validated barriers affecting fisheries productivity; and further refining the list according to socio-economic considerations. We applied the FBPSS to the Bago catchment in Myanmar as a case study, and then validated its effectiveness by comparing the fragmentation impacts (as measured by the Dendritic Connectivity Index) of the FBPSS-prioritised large dams with those of all large dams. The FBPSS successfully identified 876 potential barriers in the Bago catchment, and then systematically assessed these barriers using its filters to produce a prioritised list of 23 barriers for cost-effectively achieving optimal fishery and community benefits. The validation analysis revealed that the high priority FBPSS-combined barriers were responsible for 97-100\% of the fragmentation of the combined barriers (with all large dams included). Our findings suggest that the FBPSS could be used as a practical decision support tool, in conjunction with expert knowledge, for prioritising the mitigation of fish passage barriers in resource-deficient settings. Future research could compare the results of the FBPSS with those of an optimisation model to assess how the two approaches perform under different scenarios, and to identify key modelling fea-tures that could potentially be integrated into the FBPSS.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107024","{""notes"": ""('marsden_evaluationpracticallowcost_2023',)""}","{}",2024-12-23 22:03:08,"included",NA,NA

One of its tasks was to develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena, which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model) forecasts.

However, the quality of the products derived using UAV data is very much dependent on the accuracy with which a UAV can be localized. Although cooperative localization has been shown to improve the localization accuracy of all the UAVs in a network even in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) challenging environments, not all UAVs in a network can achieve equal navigational performance. The objective of this paper is to analyze the various parameters that affect the performance of UAVs in a cooperative network. This paper derives the theoretical performance bound of the localization accuracy that can be achieved by any UAV in the network. This performance bound is derived using posterior Cramer Rao bound and is further used to analyze the effects of various parameters such as network geometry and connectivity, quality of available measurements and the availability of GNSS in the network.

7036934,"Assessing The Performance Of A Large-Scale Irrigation System By Estimations Of Actual Evapotranspiration Obtained By Landsat Satellite Images Resampled With Cubic Convolution","Remote sensing techniques allow monitoring the Earth surface and acquiring worthwhile information that can be used efficiently in agro-hydrological systems. Satellite images associated to computational models represent reliable resources to estimate actual evapotranspiration fluxes, ETa, based on surface energy balance. The knowledge of EL and its spatial distribution is crucial for a broad range of applications at different scales, from fields to large irrigation districts. In single plots and/or in irrigation districts, linking water volumes delivered to the plots with the estimations of remote sensed ET. can have a great potential to develop new cost-effective indicators of irrigation performance, as well as to increase water use efficiency. With the aim to assess the irrigation system performance and the opportunities to save irrigation water resources at the ""SAT Llano Verde"" district in Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was applied on cloud-free Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, processed by cubic convolution resampling method, for three irrigation seasons (May to September 2006, 2007 and 2008). The model allowed quantifying instantaneous, daily, monthly and seasonal ETA over the irrigation district. The comparison between monthly irrigation volumes distributed by each hydrant and the corresponding spatially averaged ETa, obtained by assuming an overall efficiency of irrigation network equal to 85\%, allowed the assessment of the irrigation system performance for the area served by each hydrant, as well as for the whole irrigation district. It was observed that in all the investigated years, irrigation volumes applied monthly by farmers resulted generally higher than the corresponding evapotranspiration fluxes retrieved by SEBAL, with the exception of May, in which abundant rainfall occurred. When considering the entire irrigation seasons, it was demonstrated that a considerable amount of water could have been saved in the district, respectively equal to 26.2, 28.0 and 16.4\% of the total water consumption evaluated in the three years.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.jag.2018.10.016","{""notes"": ""('awada_assessingperformancescaleirrigation_2019',)""}","{}",2024-12-19 17:04:40,"included",NA,NA

This paper demonstrates a method for verification of such claims, based on a statistical model that accounts for temporal correlation in positional measurement errors.

With a range of diverse stakeholder interests to consider, early engagement and the development of trust before decision-making are essential for the long-term success of such catchment-wide projects. A local catchment group was consulted to identify key information requirements, and from this a ""virtual globe"" tour was created. The process involved specialist skills and expert leadership, but the end result was accessible to a range of audiences. User evaluation indicated that it was easy to navigate and can be used to stimulate interest and engage stakeholders. Participants trusted the content and valued the interactivity of the tour. It was helpful for communicating and educating participants about the catchment, the issues it faces, and the potential to incorporate NFM, particularly for those with little or no prior knowledge. More abstract information was harder to convey and there were limitations in the availability of suitable data for some variables and the in quality of satellite imagery. This exploratory research found that a Google Earth ""virtual globe"" tour can be a valuable tool in the initial stages of an NFM project, but there are also opportunities to use this technique in the more advanced stages of the planning process.

7037666,"Unmanned Aircraft In Nature Conservation: An Example From Plant Invasions","To successfully fight plant invasions, new methods enabling fast and efficient monitoring are needed, and remote sensing can make their management more efficient and less expensive. However, the data resolution, cost, and availability can be limiting. Optimal solution depends on the species characteristics, where the spectral and spatial resolution can compensate each other to some extent, and phenology plays an important role. Available high spatial resolution satellite data are sufficient for recognition of species that are distinct and either large or form uniform patches at size comparable to the data pixel size. For other species, higher spatial resolution is needed, and unmanned aircraft (UAV) provide data of extremely high spatial resolution (cm) at low cost and high flexibility. We assess its potential to map invasive black locust (BL, Robinia pseudoaccacia), testing imagery of different origin (satellite, UAV), spectral (multispectral, red, green, and blue (RGB) + near-infrared (NIR)) and spatial resolution, and various technical approaches to choose the best strategy for the species monitoring balancing between precision of detection and economic feasibility. Using purposely designed low-cost UAV with tailless fixed wing design for two consumer cameras (RGB and modified NIR) ensures robustness and repeatable field performance while maintaining high aerodynamic efficiency, with resulting mapping capacity over 10 km(2) per day. Several challenges exist in UAV application, such as lower spectral resolution, geometrical and radiometric distortions, and significant amount of data (necessity of automatic processing). In our study, we tested different options of UAV data processing and present comparison of resulting orthomosaic accuracies. For repeated measurements, it is extremely important to ensure spatial co-registration of pixels/objects from different phenological phases. Investment in GPS receiver in the UAV and GPS post-processing eliminated laborious collection of ground control points, while maintaining the co-registration of objects across multiple flights.

This poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis' and requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage, natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally. It is worth mentioning that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil. Natural drainage (the depth and width are 4-10 m and 50-100 m, respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some salinized villages in the range of 3000-5000 m and ancient groundwater drainage systems, such as Karez are supporting the oasis with drainage water for centuries. In addition landscape characteristics, salinization and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from Landsat image, DEM, literature and field photos. Then based on the gathered information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape. Then according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization approaches were recommended for different landscapes. To address environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was validated by stakeholder opinion. The results provide guidelines for sustainable desalinization design and highlight the importance of combining traditional knowledge and modern ecological principles in sustainable landscape design.",2019,"{""Abliz, Abdugheni"",""Lv, Guang-Hui"",""Seydehmet, Jumeniyaz""}","article",NA,"10.3390/su11092578","{""notes"": ""('seydehmet_landscapedesigntoolreduce_2019',)""}","{""stakeholder opinion"",maybe}",2024-09-30 01:44:39,"included",NA,NA
6691559,"The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response","Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions “on the ground” more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies.

For this, PAs can be characterized according to their species, ecosystems and threats, but such information is often difficult to access and usually not comparable across regions. There are currently over 200,000 PAs in the world, and assessing these systematically according to their ecological values remains a huge challenge. However, linking remote sensing with ecological modelling can help to overcome some limitations of conservation studies, such as the sampling bias of biodiversity inventories. The aim of this paper is to introduce eHabitat+, a habitat modelling service supporting the European Commission's Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, and specifically to discuss a component that systematically stratifies PAs into different habitat functional types based on remote sensing data. eHabitat+ uses an optimized procedure of automatic image segmentation based on several environmental variables to identify the main biophysical gradients in each PA. This allows a systematic production of key indicators on PAs that can be compared globally.

Satellite remote sensing techniques have provided convenient access to global soil moisture data at high temporal resolution. The evaluation of remotely sensed soil moisture products from multiple sensors are fundamental for understanding the quality and usefulness of the products and are helpful for the improvements of the retrieval algorithms. In this study, we evaluated four satellite-based soil moisture products against two in situ networks over continental U.S. These products are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E), the Fengyun-3B/Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B/MWRI), and the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture products. The evaluation results show that the temporal characteristics of ECV and SMOS soil moisture products are consistent with those of in situ measurements. Larger errors and bias exist in AMSR-E and FY-3B/MWRI over the study region. In general, the ECV product performs the best comparing with other products. Therefore, the ECV product is recommended in regional hydrological applications and water resource management over the continental U.S. for its good performance in absolute values and soil moisture anomalies.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s11269-018-1989-2","{""notes"": ""('jing_evaluationmultiplesatellitebased_2018',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 18:07:32,"included",NA,NA

6691654,"The Value of Ocean Surface Wind Information for Maritime Commerce","Observations, nowcasts, and forecasts of ocean surface wind conditions are of economic value to activities such as maritime transportation, commercial fishing, offshore energy, recreational boating, and search and rescue. In this paper, we estimate the value to the maritime shipping industry of ocean surface wind information and of wind and wave condition forecasts based on this information. Commercial ships transiting the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans are exposed to severe wind and wave conditions associated with extratropical storms. These storms impose costs on maritime commerce by delaying and sometimes damaging vessels or causing loss of cargo. Ocean surface wind information allows ships to limit their exposure to these conditions. We estimate that average expected annual losses to container shipping (lost containers and associated damage to vessels) in the absence of good information about extratropical storm conditions would be on the order of $250 million/year in the North Pacific and $120 million/year in the North Atlantic, and we estimate average expected annual losses to bulk shipping operations from extratropical storm exposure in these regions to be on the order of $150 million/year. A significant fraction of this risk can be avoided with ocean surface vector wind observations and forecasts. Our model results suggest that the QuikSCAT information (available until November 2009) and associated forecasts enabled a reduction in annual exposure for shipping traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific of about 50%, with total annual net savings around $150 million. The estimate of annual benefits to shipping operations from a hypothetical improved satellite instrument is around $200 million.",2011,"{""Kite-Powell, Hauke""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.45.1.13","{}","{}",2024-04-26 19:18:07,"included",NA,NA

The Role Of Quality Assurance Of Volunteered Observations","Environmental policy involving citizen science (CS) is of growing interest. In support of this open data stream of information, validation or quality assessment of the CS geo-located data to their appropriate usage for evidence- based policy making needs a flexible and easily adaptable data curation process ensuring transparency. Addressing these needs, this paper describes an approach for automatic quality assurance as proposed by the Citizen OBservatory WEB (COBWEB) FP7 project. This approach is based upon a workflow composition that combines different quality controls, each belonging to seven categories or ""pillars"". Each pillar focuses on a specific dimension in the types of reasoning algorithms for CS data qualification. These pillars attribute values to a range of quality elements belonging to three complementary quality models. Additional data from various sources, such as Earth Observation (EO) data, are often included as part of the inputs of quality controls within the pillars. However, qualified CS data can also contribute to the validation of EO data. Therefore, the question of validation can be considered as ""two sides of the same coin"". Based on an invasive species CS study, concerning Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), the paper discusses the flexibility and usefulness of qualifying CS data, either when using an EO data product for the validation within the quality assurance process, or validating an EO data product that describes the risk of occurrence of the plant. Both validation paths are found to be improved by quality assurance of the CS data. Addressing the reliability of CS open data, issues and limitations of the role of quality assurance for validation, due to the quality of secondary data used within the automatic workflow, are described, e.g., error propagation, paving the route to improvements in the approach.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/data2040035","{""notes"": ""('leibovici_earthobservationcitizenscience_2017',)""}","{""prob not""}",2024-11-22 17:11:36,"included",NA,NA

The threat of domoic acid (DA) toxicity to human and wildlife health is the dominant harmful algal bloom (HAB) concern for the region, leading to a strong focus on prediction and mitigation of these blooms and their toxic effects. This paper describes the initial development of the California Harmful Algae Risk Mapping (C-HARM) system that predicts the spatial likelihood of blooms and dangerous levels of DA using a unique blend of numerical models, ecological forecast models of the target group, Pseudo-nitzschia, and satellite ocean color imagery. Data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) are applied to ocean color imagery to fill in missing data and then used in a multivariate mode with other modeled variables to forecast biogeochemical parameters. Daily predictions (nowcast and forecast maps) are run routinely at the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) and posted on its public website. Skill assessment of model output for the nowcast data is restricted to nearshore pixels that overlap with routine pier monitoring of HABs in California from 2014 to 2015. Model lead times are best correlated with DA measured with solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATI') and marine mammal strandings from DA toxicosis, suggesting long-term benefits of the HAB predictions to decision making. Over the next three years, the C-HARM application system will be incorporated into the NOAA operational HAB forecasting system and HAB Bulletin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The two products are updated regularly and aim to deliver the state-of-the-art in the global monitoring of fires from satellite remote-sensing. Both products are derived from data transmitted by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors carried onboard NASA's Aqua and Terra satellites. The active fire product can be accessed for free via the internet and on media by users working anywhere in the world; the burned area product will be accessible in a similar manner in 2006. The MODIS fire products provide systematic, near-global coverage and are freely available; as such, they give resource managers new opportunities to obtain or supplement information they need to manage vegetation fires effectively. However, the availability of these products does not mean that resource managers will use them, and many other factors are involved. To understand factors that affect whether southern African resource managers will use the two products, two focus groups were held with members of the Southern African Fire Network (SAFNet) in Malawi, Africa, August 2004. Analysis of the group discussions reveals a number of factors that influence whether they will use the products. The qualitative, in depth nature of the group discussions revealed 12 main factors that influence product use; not least the low international internet bandwidths for African countries outside of South Africa. Analysis of the group discussions also suggests how the uptake of MODIS fire products by resource managers in southern Africa might be enhanced by affecting specific changes to how MODIS products are packaged and delivered. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

6691538,"Interactive Model for Assessing Mangrove Health, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, and Satellite Design in Rio de Janeiro Using Earth Observation Data","There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally relevant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary, interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence shing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data, cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1985. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes?

7037818,"Pricing Of Satellite Image Data Products: Neutrosophic Fuzzy Pricing Approaches Under Different Game Scenarios","With the gradual commercialization of satellite image data products, their pricing decisions become an important link for providers to achieve profits. This study aims to investigate the pricing problems of data products in a neutrosophic fuzzy environment. A main contribution is that two game scenarios, including the Bertrand and Stackelberg game scenarios, are discussed by considering the specific features of satellite image data products (SIDPs) market. Two main SIDPs providers are regarded as two players in the game. The innovation is that the concept of neutrosophic fuzzy variables is presented to fully express the uncertainty existing in real-world problems. As a result, the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees of decision makers for some problem parameters can determined in an intuitive and convenient fashion. Additionally, the expected value of neutrosophic variables is defined to facilitate the establishment of pricing models. After some equilibrium formulas are derived, a numerical example is provided to obtain the optimal pricing and expected profits. The effects of different power structures of providers are also analyzed and some interesting conclusions are made. Last, the advantages of our methods are demonstrated through comparative analyses. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify the influence of important problem parameters and weight coefficients on final pricing decisions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are feasible and can provide guidelines for the pricing of satellite image data products. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, collaborative environmental factors that predict the spatial distribution of soil nutrients are particularly important for managing soil nutrients. Moreover, less attention is paid to the effect of model parameters on the results obtained from soil nutrient inversion studies. In this study, the Huangshui River Basin in Qinghai Province (China) was selected as the study area, and 28 factors, including elevation, aspect, slope, plane curvature, section curvature, relief degree of land surface, topographic wetness index, soil pH, and spectral reflectance, were selected. In addition, these factors were combined with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to construct artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models for predicting the spatial distribution of four soil nutrients in farmlands: soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK), respectively. Further, the prediction accuracy of these three models was evaluated based on the model coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and relative percent deviation (RPD). The results revealed that: (1) All four soil nutrients exhibited a moderate degree of variability, with TN showing the highest variability of 69.481%. The XGBoost model based on the Bayesian optimized hyperparameter combination was better than other models in predicting the TN content (R2, RMSE, and RPD were 0.893, 0.359, and 2.470, respectively). The R2 values of the XGBoost model validation set for estimating the SOM, AK, and AP contents were 0.801, 0.509, and 0.442, respectively, and the corresponding RPD values were 2.152, 1.210, and 1.274, respectively. Moreover, this model exhibited a better prediction capability. (2) The comparison of the number of optimizations and errors of the three models revealed that the BOA-XGBoost model exhibited minimum number of parameter optimizations, higher efficiency, and better robustness. The ANN and SVM models demonstrated different prediction accuracies for different nutrients; additionally, the SVM model predicted the SOM content with high accuracy (RPD=1.580), while the ANN model predicted TN efficiently (RPD=2.460). Based on Landsat 8 remote sensing images, the XGBoost inversion model developed by combining 28 factors of the Huangshui River Basin was found to be more suitable for application in soil nutrient inversion research; furthermore, it can more accurately describe the spatial distribution pattern of the soil nutrient inversion in the Huangshui River Basin, better ensure precise agriculture fertilization, improve the fertilizer utilization rate and crop yield, and provide a reference for precise agriculture fertilization in the Huangshui River Basin. © 2023 Science and Technology of Food Industry.

Lately, the dissemination of the importance of preserving existing water bodies on the planet has been well known. In this context, bathymetric surveys are the key to calculating silting over the years, estimating volume, erosion at the edges, calculating suspended sediments, among others. These studies are usually performed using echo sounders, which use the sound wave to obtain depth. However, these are time consuming and most of the time have a high cost. Thus, with technological advances, numerous works in this area have already been done with orbital images and the emergence of RPA's (Remotely Pilot Aircraft) systems coupled to aircraft, has brought countless benefits for coastal mapping in the agility, but still not showing efficiency in the cost issue.In view of these issues raised, the present study has as main objective the evaluation of the bathymetry estimate obtained with the Micasense multispectral sensor linked to an unmanned autonomous aircraft. The results found showed that the methodology described, together with the chosen sensor, can be used in several studies of an environmental nature or that aim at the better management of water resources, mainly in clear waters.

The proposed method, based on conventional Bayesian probability methods, involves feature engineering and deep neural networks. Additionally, it extracts significant information for each endmember from combinations of spectra by feature extraction, with spectral unmixing based on mathematical and statistical analysis, and calculates each of the water quality parameters. The experimental results show the great performance of the proposed model with all coefficient of determination R-2 over 0.9 greater than the values (0.6-0.8) from conventional methods, which are greater than ordinary Bayesian probability analysis. The mean percent of absolute error (MPAE) is taken into account as an important statistical criterion to evaluate model performance, and our results show that MPAE ranges from 4\% (nitrogen) to 10\% (COD). The root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of phosphorus, nitrogen, COD, BOD, and chlorophyll-a (Chla) are 0.03 mg/L, 0.28 mg/L, 3.28 mg/L, 0.49 mg/L, and 0.75 mu g/L, respectively. In comparison with other deep learning methods, this study takes a relatively small amount of data as training data to train the proposed model and the proposed model is then tested on the same amount of testing data, achieving a greater performance. Thus, the proposed method is time-saving and more effective. This study proposes a more compatible and effective method to assist with decomposing combinations of hyperspectral signatures in order to calculate the content level of each water quality parameter. Moreover, the proposed method is practically applied to hyperspectral image data on board an unmanned aerial vehicle in order to monitor the water quality on a large scale and trace the location of pollution sources in the Maozhou River, Guangdong Province of China, obtaining well-explained and significant results.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs12101567","{""notes"": ""('zhang_retrievalwaterqualityparameters_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-25 19:08:46,"included",NA,NA
7038038,"Tropical Africa's First Testbed For High-Impact Weather Forecasting And Nowcasting","Testbeds have become integral to advancing the transfer of knowledge and capabilities from research to operational weather forecasting in many parts of the world. The first high-impact weather testbed in tropical Africa was recently carried out through the African Science for Weather Information and Forecasting Techniques (SWIFT) program, with participation from researchers and forecasters from Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, the United Kingdom, and international and pan-African organizations. The testbed aims were to trial new forecasting and nowcasting prod-ucts with operational forecasters, to inform future research, and to act as a template for future testbeds in the tropics. The African SWIFT testbed integrated users and researchers throughout the process to facilitate development of impact-based forecasting methods and new research ideas driven both by operations and user input. The new products are primarily satellite-based nowcasting systems and ensemble forecasts at global and regional convection-permitting scales. Neither of these was used operationally in the participating African countries prior to the testbed. The testbed received constructive, positive feedback via intense user interaction including fishery, agriculture, aviation, and electricity sectors. After the testbed, a final set of recommended standard operating procedures for satellite-based nowcasting in tropical Africa have been produced. The testbed brought the attention of funding agencies and organizational directors to the immediate benefit of improved forecasts. Delivering the testbed strengthened the partnership between each country's participating university and weather forecasting agency and internationally, which is key to ensuring the longevity of the testbed outcomes.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/bams-d-21-0156.1","{""notes"": ""(\""fletcher_tropicalafrica'stestbedimpact_2023\"",)""}","{}",2024-12-22 00:22:49,"included",NA,NA

In particular, Low-Earth Orbits are being realigned and reinvented for various purposes using suitable technological advancement. This paper is focused on the major parameters that can be analyzed to attain orbit control and autonomy of small-satellite constellations for real-time applications. By applying industry experience to graduate research, this work addresses the related concerns in a realistic manner. Currently, global small-satellite constellation solutions are too expensive and inaccessible for many nations to help in their data reception requirements. This issue was addressed, and some of the main aspects relating to low-cost and high-benefit technical synthesis, in addition to utilization for deep-space missions, were also discussed in detail. In conclusion, this paper demonstrated a strategic approach to optimize the coverage and performance, and reduce the cost of small-satellite constellations, compared with present day constellations, allowing the data to be relayed faster and with precision. This will benefit the industry in the development of low-cost constellations, and effectively assist in disaster management and deep-space communication relays.

To better address present climate resilience-building challenges in the current smart world, this contribution presents innovative avenues leading to the development of the << e-GIS Smart, Inclusive, and, Climate-resilient Indigenous Peoples Landscape and Community Clearing-House Mechanism Solution >> which is meant to be used in the mobile-friendly website environment and the e-app environment. This technology policy paper shows that digital GIS, remote sensing products of observation satellites, and smartphone applications products derived from telecommunication satellites can help facilitate Indigenous Peoples' contribution to climate resilience-building within their territories in terms of biodiversity and within their communities in terms of poverty eradication throughout the implementation of the United Nations Indigenous Peoples' Affairs Global Agenda. The methodology used consists, therefore, of a plural technology interface that promises, among many other benefits, to facilitate Indigenous Peoples' participation in decision-making processes. This research reminds us of the importance of state responsibility in these matters. It shows the importance of Indigenous Peoples' participation in the implementation of global instances' agendas through national reporting. It highlights the key role of Indigenous information decolonization and governance as principles of Indigenous Peoples' sovereignty over Indigenous information. The results of this research are illustrated with case studies, when possible, to show the potential of the Solution to achieve its goals in climate resilience-building in Indigenous Peoples Landscapes and Communities with Indigenous Peoples and the financial support of state governments and inter-governmental institutions.

6903514,"Crop Dominance Mapping With Irs-P6 And Modis 250-M Time Series Data","This paper describes an approach to accurately separate out and quantify crop dominance areas in the major command area in the Krishna River Basin. Classification was performed using IRS-P6 (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, series P6) and MODIS eight-day time series remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 23.6 m, 250 m for the year 2005. Temporal variations in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) pattern obtained in crop dominance classes enables a demarcation between long duration crops and short duration crops. The NDVI pattern was found to be more consistent in long duration crops than in short duration crops due to the continuity of the water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release, which affected the time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was, in turn, reflected in the NDVI pattern. The identified crop-wise classes were tested and verified using ground-truth data and state-level census data. The accuracy assessment was performed based on ground-truth data through the error matrix method, with accuracies from 67\% to 100\% for individual crop dominance classes, with an overall accuracy of 79\% for all classes. The derived major crop land areas were highly correlated with the sub-national statistics with R-2 values of 87\% at the mandal (sub-district) level for 2005-2006. These results suggest that the methods, approaches, algorithms and datasets used in this study are ideal for rapid, accurate and large-scale mapping of paddy rice, as well as for generating their statistics over large areas. This study demonstrates that IRS-P6 23.6-m one-time data fusion with MODIS 250-m time series data is very useful for identifying crop type, the source of irrigation water and, in the case of surface water irrigation, the way in which it is applied. The results from this study have assisted in improving surface water and groundwater irrigated areas of the command area and also provide the basis for better water resource assessments at the basin scale.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/agriculture4020113","{""notes"": ""('gumma_cropdominancemappingirs_2014',)""}","{}",2024-09-27 23:22:04,"included",NA,NA
7037868,"Solutions From Space? A Dynamic Capabilities Perspective On The Growing Use Of Satellite Technology For Managing Sustainability In Multi-Tier Supply Chains","Distant upstream tiers in supply chains are hotspots for sustainability issues that expose focal firms to growing reputational, financial, operational and legal risks - yet sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practice and research still focus on dyadic buyer-supplier relationships due to poor upstream transparency. Recently, however, focal firms have started adopting satellite technology as a tool for gaining systematic, continuous and direct oversight of issues like deforestation occurring far upstream to complement standards and certifications. This could transform multi-tier SSCM dynamics but, being a novel phenomenon, it remains unclear which organizational capabilities and collaborations focal firms apply to leverage remote sensing's potential. Combining dynamic capabilities theory and a multi-tier SSCM framework, our paper analyzes the current use of satellite technology in forest-risk commodity supply chains. Triangulating insights from interviews, documents and observations in a qualitative content analysis, the study finds that effective multi-tier SSCM relies on (a) internal resources providing four functions (traceability; monitoring; follow-up; stakeholder accountability), (b) complemented with external resources accessed through strategically selected collaborations that (c) take the form of working along supply chains, across supply chains and across sectors. The results show that technology-driven multi-tier SSCM can hold strategic benefits beyond risk reduction.

7038502,"Measuring And Monitoring Restored Ecosystems: Can Remote Sensing Be Applied To The Ecological Recovery Wheel To Inform Restoration Success?","The commencement of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration has highlighted the urgent need to improve restoration science and fast-track ecological outcomes. The application of remote sensing for monitoring purposes has increased over the past two decades providing a variety of image datasets and derived products suitable to map and measure ecosystem properties (e.g. vegetation species, community composition, and structural dimensions such as height and cover). However, the operational use of remote sensing data and derived products for ecosystem restoration monitoring in research, industry, and government has been relatively limited and underutilized. In this paper, we use the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) ecological recovery wheel (ERW) to assess the current capacity of drone-airborne-satellite remote sensing datasets to measure each of the SER's recommended attributes and sub-attributes for terrestrial restoration projects. Based on our combined expertise in the areas of ecological monitoring and remote sensing, a total of 11 out of 18 sub-attributes received the highest feasibility score and show strong potential for remote sensing assessments; while sub-attributes such as gene flows, all trophic levels and chemical and physical substrates have a reduced capacity for monitoring. We argue that in the coming decade, ecologists can combine remote sensing with the ERW to monitor restoration recovery and reference ecosystems for improved restoration outcomes at the local, regional, and landscape scales. The ERW approach can be adapted as a monitoring framework for projects to utilize the benefits of remote sensing and inform management through scalable, operational, and meaningful outcomes.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/rec.13724","{""notes"": ""('mckenna_measuringmonitoringrestoredecosystems_2023',)""}","{}",2024-10-28 00:32:51,"included",NA,NA
6862949,"Automatic Parameter Optimization For Support Vector Regression For Land And Sea Surface Temperature Estimation From Remote Sensing Data","Land surface temperature (LST) and sea surface temperature (SST) are important quantities For many, environmental models. Remote sensing is a source of information for their estimation on both regional and global scales. Many algorithms have been devised to estimate LST and SST from satellite data, most of which require a priori information about the surface and the atmosphere. A recently proposed approach involves the use of support vector machines (SVMs). Based on satellite data and corresponding in situ measurements, they generate an approximation of the relation between them, which can subsequently he used to estimate unknown surface temperatures from additional satellite data. Such a strategy requires the user to set several internal parameters. In this paper, a method is proposed for automatically setting these parameters to quasi-optimal values in the sense of minimum estimation errors. This is achieved by minimizing a functional correlated to regression errors (i.e., the ""span-bound"" upper bound on the leave-one-out (1,00) error) which can be computed by using only the training set, without need for a further validation set. In order to minimize this functional, Powell's algorithm is adopted, since it is applicable also to nondifferentiable functions. Experimental results yielded by the proposed method are similar in accuracy to those achieved by cross-validation and by a grid search for the parameter configuration which yields the best test-set accuracy. However, the proposed method gives a dramatic reduction in the computational time required, particularly when many training samples are available.",2009,"{""Moser, Gabriele"",""Serpico, Sebastiano B.""}","article",NA,"10.1109/tgrs.2008.2005993","{""notes"": ""('moser_automaticparameteroptimizationsupport_2009',)""}","{maybe,""reduced comp time"",algorithm}",2024-07-17 21:18:45,"included",NA,NA

Methods to assess the long-run socioeconomic benefits of the emerging global Earth observation system of systems (GEOSS) as an integrated multisensor infrastructure have been missing to date. This chapter presents a systems dynamics approach to assess the effect of improvements in Earth observations across the nine societal benefit areas of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). Two types of integration are assessed with the proposed model structure: (1) measuring benefits in an integrated assessment environment (e.g., improved weather forecasting through better measurement of cloud properties could lead to benefits in the agriculture, energy and water sectors); and (2) measuring benefits of an integrated observing system (e.g., in areas with high cloud cover, improvements in the resolution of optical sensors will lead to benefits only if linked to supplementary observing systems such a radar or ground surveys). The benefits from integration relate mostly to economies of scope on both the observation and benefit system sides. Cost reduction from economies of scale are derived from a global or large scale observing system vis-a-vis the currently prevailing patchwork system of national or regional observing systems. Results indicate that the total system benefits of GEOSS are usually orders of magnitude higher than their costs. Benefits are also policy dependent and tend to increase with the degree of implementation of mainly international environmental agreements. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/978-94-007-4839-2_4","{""notes"": ""('obersteiner_valuingpotentialimpactsgeoss_2012',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 17:31:09,"included",NA,NA
6862938,"Heterogeneity Characteristics Of An Inland Wetland Environment Through Spatio-Spectral Analysis","To manage wetlands, resource managers require information on the size, shape, condition, and spatial distribution of vegetation types at both the community and species levels. Remote sensing methods currently used for generating maps of wetland ecosystems are largely based on spectral transformations of image data, preferably using high spatial resolution data. However, airborne hyperspectral imagery contains not only high spectral content but also considerable spatial information. To date, use of the spatial information in such imagery, particularly to determine biodiversity, has not been fully exploited. In this study, spatial heterogeneity in the reflectance values of hyperspectral imagery recorded over an inland wetland complex in South Dumfries Township, Ontario, Canada, is determined on a per-pixel basis by measuring the degree of local spatial association (local Moran’s Ii) within a 3 × 3 neighbourhood of pixels. These new spatio-spectral Moran’s Iibands are then classified into heterogeneity categories using a modified version of the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Results show that the extraction of spatial information from hyperspectral data contributes to wetland management initiatives by providing quantitative information on the spatial arrangement of measured biological elements. The use of Moran’s Ii, a local measure of spatial association, also provides a statistical basis on which to map heterogeneity characteristics of elements within a wetland environment and to determine how these characteristics change over time. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

6862721,"Land Use Change And Environmental Sustainability: The Case Of Lagos Metropolis","Land use is a most important factor in the distribution and functioning of ecosystems and benefits derived by man. The Malthusian geometric population growth and continuous demands for food, shelter, clothing, energy and even pleasure has led to depletion of natural resources. Land is limited in supply and its finite nature makes it a scarce resource that cannot meet its demand. The use of land is a reflection of our decisions, which will determine how sustainable our future will be. Detecting land use changes requires timely and accurate information which can be assured by using remotely sensed data and GIS. Analyzing the correlation between land use changes and their impacts is essential for spatial planning at various spatial levels (global, national, regional and local levels). A cursory look at the sporadic growth of the Lagos metropolis reveals an unquestionable exert of pressure on the existing rural land, agricultural and forests resources. This paper examines Spatio-temporal trends in land use and land cover changes in the Lagos Metropolitan region, especially the loss of forest resources and agricultural land to urban development. Landsat images were used to produce land use classification maps for a period spanning sixteen years (1990 and 2006). The study was limited to these two dates due to cost and difficulty of acquiring satellite imageries. The dynamics of land use change and its impact were discussed as major findings. The paper submits that effective spatial planning could minimize the impacts of land use changes that threaten biodiversity and ecosystems though timely and proper monitoring using remotesensing and GIS; it also recommends integrated spatial planning approach and deployment of environmental management plans. © 2012 WIT Press.",2011,"{""Dekolo, S.

However, road use is challenging to monitor due to limited data and high spatial-temporal variability, especially for unpaved roads, which often coincide with critical habitats. In this study, we developed and evaluated two methods to characterize off-highway road use across a large management area of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) habitat using: (1) a 'network-based' approach to connect human activity hotspots identified from social media posts and remotely detected disturbances and (2) an 'image-based' approach, in which we modeled road surface conditions and travel speed from high spatial resolution satellite imagery trained with crowd-sourced smartphone data. To assess the differences between these approaches and their utility for characterizing roads in the context of habitat integrity, we evaluated how behavioural patterns of global positioning system (GPS)-collared grizzly bears were related to road use characterized by these methods compared to (a) assuming all roads have equal human activity and (b) using a 'reference' road classification from a government database. The network- and image-based methods showed similar patterns of road use and grizzly bear response compared to the reference, and all three revealed nocturnal behaviour near high-use roads and better predicted grizzly bear habitat selection compared to assuming all roads had equal human activity.

6691623,"Position paper: evaluation methods and techniques","This paper reviews methodologies in economics for valuing the benefits of geospatial data and services; including the value of open data. Section 2 explores the meaning of socioeconomic value and reviews the methodologies underpinning value assessment. It explains the theoretical background to economic welfare analysis, total turnover analysis and value added analysis. The use of different methods for economic impact assessment is then outlined. The methods include benefit cost analysis, multiplier analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling1. This section also outlines the background to value chain analysis and real options analysis. Examples of the application of these techniques are discussed. They include the application of earth observation to agricultural and water resource management and the use of mapping to improve decision making in areas such as emergency management, managing endangered species, conducting property tax assessments and verifying insurance claims. These examples illustrate the potential for geospatial data to deliver value over a wide and growing range of applications. Section 3 addresses the issues that arise in applying these techniques. It points out that the methodology selected must address the questions being asked by policy makers and/or users of geospatial data. In the current defensive fiscal environment experienced by governments in many OECD countries, it is important that the valuation method links the use of geospatial data services to a clearly defined and quantifiable outcome. There needs to be a ‘line of sight’ between application of geospatial data services and the benefits that are identified. The paper suggests that evaluations should clearly outline such relationships and suggests a hierarchy of methods that can be applied in such circumstances. The methods include cost effectiveness analysis, benefit cost analysis and regional and economy wide economic modelling. Section 4 comments on the issues that arise draws some conclusions and raises some questions for discussion. It concludes that there is a need to: align methodology to the decision maker’s needs; develop better evidence based economic assessments; adopt more structured approaches to addressing the rapid evolution in the use and application of geospatial data; develop greater capability in building better business cases; and reaching a consensus on internationally recognised methodologies.

Evaluation metrics were chosen through an analysis of interviews and a survey of professionals who use WFAQM forecasts as part of their daily responsibilities. The survey revealed that professional users generally focus on whether forecast air quality will exceed thresholds that trigger local air quality advisories (e.g., an event), their analysis scale is their region of responsibility, they are interested in short-term (approximate to 24 h) guidance, missing an event is worse than issuing a false alarm, and there are two types of users-one that takes the forecast at face value, and the other that uses it as one of several information sources. Guided by these findings, model performance of Environment and Climate Change Canada's current operational WFAQM (FireWork) was assessed over western Canada during three (2016-18) summer (May-September) wildfire seasons. Evaluation was performed at the geographic scale at which individual forecasts are issued (the forecast region) using gridded particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) fields developed from a machine learning-based downscaling of satellite and meteorological data. For the ""at face value"" user group, model performance was measured using the Peirce skill score. For the ""as information source"" user group, model performance was measured using the divergence skill score. For this metric, forecasts were first converted to event probabilities using binomial regression.

7036689,"Cost Benefit Analysis Of Survey Methods For Assessing Intertidal Sediment Disturbance: A Bait Collection Case Study","Coastal management requires cost-effective, yet accurate, assessments of habitat condition, especially in areas protected by statutory conservation measures. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide alternatives to manned aircraft and walk-over (WO) surveys. To support coastal managers with method selection, we compare the costs and benefits of the three techniques using the extent of bait collection (sediment scarring from manual digging) on intertidal mudflats from three UK sites. UAV and WO surveys were conducted in parallel and aerial photography was downloaded from the Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO). Digging was digitised from estimations on foot (WO) or by manually labelling imagery with confidence assigned (UAV/CCO). Method efficacy is compared with respect to spatial coverage, control over survey time/location, spatial resolution, positioning accuracy, and area of digging detected. Personnel hours and up-front costs (e.g. training/equipment), costs for personnel time standardised by shore area, personnel risk, and environmental impact are also compared. Regarding efficacy, CCO imagery had extensive shore coverage compared to UAV and WO, however, assessments are restricted to times/locations with available imagery. Each method's resolution was sufficient to detect digging. WO achieved the highest resolution (on foot), but the lowest positioning accuracy, in contrast to accurate feature delineation on aerial imagery. An additive two-way ANOVA revealed a significantly higher percent area of 'dug' sediment (all confidence levels) recorded by UAV than WO. CCO was the most cost-effective with no fieldwork/equipment costs. UAV had the highest up-front costs, but WO was more costly for personnel hours/ km2 for survey time and digitisation. For all methods, digitisation was the most time-consuming aspect. Compared to WO, UAV achieved rapid shore surveys and the CCO and UAV methods minimise personnel risks. UAV and WO both cause wildlife disturbance, with trampling an additional WO impact.

6691571,"Enhancing the standardized drought vulnerability index by integrating spatiotemporal information from satellite and in situ data","Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.",2019,"{""Oikonomou, Panagiotis""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.058","{}","{}",2024-04-26 18:46:25,"included",NA,NA

The goal of this project was to assist the Republic of South Africa Department of Water Affairs & Forestry to identify a cost-effective remote sensing methodology to accurately measure and monitor agricultural land use for National Water Act water management purposes. The most accurate results were obtained using object-oriented image segmentation techniques applied to SPOT multispectral and panchromatic data (overall accuracy = 89.41%). Accurate classifications were also obtained using just the SPOT multispectral data (85.33%). When applied to Landsat ETM+ and TM data in 2003 and 2005, the image segmentation approach out-performed all other algorithms yielding classification accuracies of 85.71% and 84. 30%, respectively. This is important because Landsat TM type data cover more geography (e.g., 185 & 185 km) than SPOT data (e.g., 60 × 60 km) and are more economical per km2.

7038048,"Mapping Open Data And Big Data To Address Climate Resilience Of Urban Informal Settlements In Sub-Saharan Africa","This perspective paper highlights the potentials, limitations, and combinations of openly available Earth observation (EO) data and big data in the context of environmental research in urban areas. The aim is to build the resilience of informal settlements to climate change impacts. In particular, it highlights the types, categories, spatial and temporal scales of publicly available big data. The benefits of publicly available big data become clear when looking at issues such as the development and quality of life in informal settlements within and around major African cities. Sub-Saharan African (SSA) cities are among the fastest growing urban areas in the world. However, they lack spatial information to guide urban planning towards climate-adapted cities and fair living conditions for disadvantaged residents who mostly reside in informal settlements. Therefore, this study collected key information on freely available data such as data on land cover, land use, and environmental hazards and pressures, demographic and socio-economic indicators for urban areas. They serve as a vital resource for success of many other related local studies, such as the transdisciplinary research project ""DREAMS-Developing REsilient African cities and their urban environMent facing the provision of essential urban SDGs"". In the era of exponential growth of big data analytics, especially geospatial data, their utility in SSA is hampered by the disparate nature of these datasets due to the lack of a comprehensive overview of where and how to access them. This paper aims to provide transparency in this regard as well as a resource to access such datasets.

Rooted in ""management"", PF brings the information age and space-age technology together with the science of producing food and fiber. In this process, there exists an increased opportunity to reduce environmental risks from pesticide use with improved environmental stewardship and greater economic profitability via more efficient use of scarce resources. PF thus is an example of combining newer techniques of satellites, remote sensing and computers with the familiar tools of soil testing, scouting and yield analyses. Information can help farmers reduce pesticide use, lower the need for insurance sprays, cut input costs and bring added environmental and economic soundness to the forefront. In order to exploit the potential for PF in accurately locating spatially variable pest/weed populations, a system of selectively applying cpas' (N, etc) is thus required. Development of ""patch"" sprayers, which are connected to computer-linked mapping, could allow treatment to patches within the field. Requirements for information acquisition, analysis strategy development, delivery and evaluation of results can be very intensive depending upon the state of knowledge about the soil, N needs, as well as pest identification and development profiles There remain serious questions about information ownership and economic benefits to all farmers.

Satellite remote sensing has been effectively used to distinguish relatively intact and degraded forests at a number of scales. However, the utility of remote sensing data for rapid and cost-effective assessments of habitat intactness across large and regions has not been adequately tested. To this end, we tested the ability of TM imagery to rapidly discriminate different levels of habitat degradation across large regions of the Chihuahuan Desert. We were able to identify relatively intact habitat in many cases. However, degraded habitat was often misidentified as relatively intact. The use of both mid- and late-season imagery provides some improvement by highlighting phenological differences among the intactness classes. Overall, low vegetation cover and inter- and intra-seasonal variability diminish the utility of TM imagery for large-scale conservation planning in the Chihuahuan Desert.

6863150,"Portability Of Semantic And Spatial-Temporal Machine Learning Methods To Analyse Social Media For Near-Real-Time Disaster Monitoring","Up-to-date information about an emergency is crucial for effective disaster management. However, severe restrictions impede the creation of spatiotemporal information by current remote sensing-based monitoring systems, especially at the beginning of a disaster. Multiple publications have shown promising results in complementing monitoring systems through spatiotemporal information extracted from social media data. However, various monitoring system criteria, such as near-real-time capabilities or applicability for different disaster types and use cases, have not yet been addressed. This paper presents an improved version of a recently proposed methodology to identify disaster-impacted areas (hot spots and cold spots) by combining semantic and geospatial machine learning methods. The process of identifying impacted areas is automated using semi-supervised topic models for various kinds of natural disasters. We validated the portability of our approach through experiments with multiple natural disasters and disaster types with differing characteristics, whereby one use case served to prove the near-real-time capability of our approach. We demonstrated the validity of the produced information by comparing the results with official authority datasets provided by the United States Geological Survey and the National Hurricane Centre. The validation shows that our approach produces reliable results that match the official authority datasets. Furthermore, the analysis result values are shown and compared to the outputs of the remote sensing-based Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The information derived from different sources can thus be considered to reliably detect disaster-impacted areas that were not detected by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, particularly in densely populated cities.",2021,"{""Havas, Clemens"",""Resch, Bernd""}","article",NA,"10.1007/s11069-021-04808-4","{""notes"": ""('havas_portabilitysemanticspatialtemporal_2021',)""}","{}",2024-07-13 00:12:58,"included",NA,NA

6863338,"Assessing The Influence Of Land-Cover Change And Conflicting Land-Use Authorizations On Ecosystem Conversion On The Forest Frontier Of Madre De Dios, Peru","Despite the many benefits natural forests provide, they are being lost worldwide at unsustainable rates as development frontiers expand. One approach to improving the efficacy of natural forest conservation efforts is to refine local forest conservation policies based on insights from the place-based study of conservation policies and land-use and land-cover change (LULC) dynamics. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of LULC and conservation policies on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru. The main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efficacy of designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conversion of granting conflicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation areas. Using statistical matching and a GIS-based analysis of LULC, this research shows that for the period 2006-2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios significantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly variable across conservation designations. Also, when present, conflicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, specifically overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation. This finding demonstrates that authorizing conflicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes. This case study also provides examples of how local forest conservation policies can be improved through detailed and frequent analyses of LULC and conservation policies, particularly in dynamic frontier landscapes where LULC and socio-economic conditions are rapidly changing.

Multi-temporal, multi-mode data were examined from airborne Lidar (Teledyne Optech, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, Titan), synthetic aperture radar (Radarsat-2, single and quad polarization), and optical (SPOT) sensors with near-coincident acquisition dates. Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA). The methodology was repeated in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) to determine the transferability of the methods to other boreal environments. Water mask frequency analysis showed accuracies of 93\% to 97\%, and kappa values of 0.8-0.9 when compared to optical data. Concordance results comparing the semi-permanent/permanent hydroperiod between 2015 and 2016 were found to be 98\% similar, suggesting little change in wetland surface water extent between these two years. The results illustrate that the decision-based methodology and data fusion could be applied to a wide range of boreal wetland types and, so far, is not geographically limited. This provides a platform for land use permitting, reclamation monitoring, and wetland regulation in a region of rapid development and uncertainty due to climate change.

7037107,"Citizen Science For Earth Observation (Citzens4eo): Understanding Current Use In The Uk","The role of Earth observation (EO) data in addressing societal problems from environmental through to humanitarian should not be understated. Recent innovation in EO means provision of analysis ready data and data cubes, which allows for rapid use of EO data. This in combination with processing technologies, such as Google Earth Engine and open source algorithms/software for EO data integration and analyses, has afforded an explosion of information to answer research questions and/or inform policy making. However, there is still a need for both training and validation data within EO projects - often this can be challenging to obtain. It has been suggested that citizen science can help here to provide these data, yet there is some perceived hesitancy in using citizen science within EO projects. This paper reports on the Citizen Science 4 EO (Citizens4EO) project that aimed to obtain an in-depth understanding of researchers' and practitioners' experiences with citizen science data in EO within the UK. Through a mixed methods approach (online and in-depth surveys and a spotlight case study) it was found that although the benefits of using citizen science data in EO projects were many (and highlighted in the spotlighted ""Slavery from Space"" case study), there were a number of common concerns around using citizen science. These were around the mechanics of deploying citizen science and the unreliability of a potentially misinformed or undertrained citizen base. As such, comparing the results of this study with those of a similar survey undertaken in 2016, it is apparent that progress towards optimizing citizen science use in EO has been incremental but positive with evidence of the realization of the benefits of citizen science for EO (Citizens4EO). As such, we conclude by offering priority action areas to support further use of citizen science by the EO community within the UK, which ultimately should be adopted further afield.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1080/01431161.2022.2076574","{""notes"": ""('boyd_citizenscienceearthobservation_2022',)""}","{""citizen science in EO""}",2024-12-13 18:04:56,"included",NA,NA
7038369,"Consistent Long-Term Monthly Coastal Wetland Vegetation Monitoring Using A Virtual Satellite Constellation","Long-term monthly coastal wetland vegetation monitoring is the key to quantifying the effects of natural and anthropogenic events, such as severe storms, as well as assessing restoration efforts. Remote sensing data products such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), alongside emerging data analysis techniques, have enabled broader investigations into their dynamics at monthly to decadal time scales. However, NDVI data suffer from cloud contamination making periods within the time series sparse and often unusable during meteorologically active seasons. This paper proposes a virtual constellation for NDVI consisting of the red and near-infrared bands of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer. The virtual constellation uses time-space-spectrum relationships from 2014 to 2018 and a random forest to produce synthetic NDVI imagery rectified to Landsat 8 format. Over the sample coverage area near Apalachicola, Florida, USA, the synthetic NDVI showed good visual coherence with observed Landsat 8 NDVI. Comparisons between the synthetic and observed NDVI showed Root Mean Squared Error and Coefficient of Determination (R2) values of 0.0020 sr−1 and 0.88, respectively. The results suggest that the virtual constellation was able to mitigate NDVI data loss due to clouds and may have the potential to do the same for other data. The ability to participate in a virtual constellation for a useful end product such as NDVI adds value to existing satellite missions and provides economic justification for future projects. © 2021 by the authors.

Since the most common methods of landslide hazard assessment using simple inventories and weighted overlays are heavily dependent on three-dimensional terrain visualization and analysis, stereo satellite images from the IKONOS Very High Resolution (VHR) sensor are used for this study. The DEMs created from IKONOS stereo images appear to be much more accurate and sensitive to micro-scale terrain features than a DEM created from digital contour data with a 2 m contour interval. Pan-sharpened stereo IKONOS images permit interpretation of recent landslides as small as 2-3 m in width as well as relict landslides older than 50 years.

6691527,"A Scalable Earth Observations-Based Decision Support System for Hydropower Planning in Africa","Hydropower is a key part of the increasing shift in power production from nonrenewables to renewable energy. In regions such as Africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty elimination. However, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often suboptimal due to the lack of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts. Here, we present a decision support system (DSS) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal time scales by combining data from earth observation satellites (EOS) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical models and hydrologic modeling. The large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based measurements. In addition, an EOS evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow in calibrating hydrologic models. Compared to a DSS forced with a climatological forecast (zero-skill), the hydropower production with the new DSS increased by 20%.

With great opportunity comes great challenges regarding efficient and effective data management because earth observation data is of different scales and characterized by complexity in spatial relationships related to the real world. To overcome the challenges is crucial for, for instance, data mining, land surveying, and especially emergency mapping for disaster response. To improve the querying efficiency of big earth observation data, we proposed a novel data management approach: Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding and Spatial Indexing. Among our contributions are: (1) proposing Global Multi-scale Grid Integer Coding Model (GMGICM), which presents clustering property in both the scale dimension and spatial dimension, and theoretically facilitates an efficient querying; (2) deliberately applying GMGICM on multi-scale earth observation data spatial indexing, which results in one-dimensional data index, which can be queried using simple B-tree, inversion, and other one-dimensional indexes; (3) designing a strategy to assure the completeness of spatial querying, which is not well solved by existing grid-based coding models. The advantages of our proposed approach have been demonstrated with both simulated and real remote sensing data, with spatial operation 20 times as fast as Geohash and spatial querying 10 times as fast as Oracle Spatial on average. The proposed approach can be easily adapted for three or higher-dimensional earth observation data and bring potential benefit to all big earth observation data analytic projects.",2020,"{""Guo, Congzhou"",""Lai, Guangling"",""Lei, Yi"",""Li, He"",""Qiu, Chunping"",""Tong, Xiaochong"",""Wu, Xiangyu"",""Zhang, Yong"",""Zhang, Yongsheng""}","article",NA,"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.03.010","{""notes"": ""('lei_globalmultiscalegrid_2020',)""}","{}",2024-07-12 19:29:39,"included",NA,NA
7037157,"High-Precision Gnss For Agricultural Operations","Nowadays, a precise management of agricultural inputs based on spatial variability has become possible due to the availability of new technologies, including Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture (UAVs), high-resolution remote sensing, sensors to measure soil and plant characteristics, and controllers to guide agricultural machinery and apply precise amount of inputs. The benefits of precision agriculture are as follows: • The return on the investment from crop production may be increased by improvements in yield and/or a reduction in inputs; • The risk of environmental pollution from over application of agrochemicals that are associated with traditional agriculture can be reduced; • Greater product quality assurance achieved from precise targeting and recording of field applications that improve traceability. In the last decade, the number of fully operational and commercially available GNSS has increased. These systems provide accurate, continuous, geographic position and speed information in three dimensions and under all weather conditions to users 24h a day. In the last two decades, the ability of Differential Global Positioning System to provide real-time, submeter- or even decimeter-level accuracy has revolutionized the agricultural industry. Applications of GNSS for agricultural purposes have thrived in recent years, and the literature is rich with numerous interesting examples. In this chapter, we limit our attention to five specific applications with which the authors are very closely involved: (1) GNSS in crop protection, (2) in variable rate application (VRA), (3) monitoring soil, plants, and production, (4) agricultural UAVs, and (5) ground platforms and autonomous tractors. Not all the operations in precision agriculture need the same level of accuracy. Most of them, such as yield monitoring or VRAs, can be accomplished satisfactorily with DGNSS that has submeter accuracy. Only some operations, however, demand high (~10mm range) geopositioning accuracy and precision, such as a plant-specific operation, precision guidance, and controlled traffic farming. This level of accuracy could be achieved with the use of real-time kinematic Global Positioning System. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The smallest losses were observed using tree species proportions predicted using ALS data and largest using satellite data. In those stands, respectively, in which tree species proportion errors actually caused economic losses, they were 468 (sic) ha(-1) on average with tree species proportions based on ALS data.

Methods and Results: We collected a dense time series of 24 Landsat 5 and 7 images spanning the year 2000 for an agricultural region in Fresno County. We intersected the Landsat time series with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) land use map and selected field samples to define the phenological characteristics of 17 major crop types or crop groups. We found the frequent overpass of Landsat enabled detection of crop field conditions (e. g., bare soil, vegetated) over most of the year. However, images were limited during the winter months due to cloud cover. Many samples designated as single-cropped in the CDWR map had phenological patterns that represented multi-cropped or non-cropped fields, indicating they may have been misclassified. Conclusions: We found the combination of Landsat 5 and 7 image data would clearly benefit pesticide exposure assessment in this region by 1) providing information on crop field conditions at or near the time when pesticides are applied, and 2) providing information for validating the CDWR map. The Landsat image time-series was useful for identifying idle, single-, and multi-cropped fields. Landsat data will be limited during the winter months due to cloud cover, and for years prior to the Landsat 7 launch (1999) when only one satellite was operational at any given time. We suggest additional research to determine the feasibility of integrating CDWR land use maps and Landsat data to derive crop maps in locations and time periods where maps are not available, which will allow for substantial improvements to chemical exposure estimation.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1186/1476-072x-9-46","{""notes"": ""('maxwell_landsatsatellitedatasupport_2010',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 16:34:46,"included",NA,NA
7036755,"Satellite-Based Et Mapping To Assess Variation In Et With Timing Of Crop Development","Evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated agriculture is an important issue in and and semiarid regions where it has large impact on water resources depletion and water management. Satellite-based remote sensing is a robust, economic and efficient tool for estimating actual ET from irrigated regions and for developing crop coefficient (K-c) curves. The technique can cover hundreds of sampled fields at a time so that large populations of ET and K, can be used to develop representative mean values. This paper uses a satellite remote sensing technique to analyse the impact of planting and development schedules of crops on ET for crops of dry beans, corn, potatoes, sugar beets and small grains (wheat and barley), which are major crops in the temperate, semiarid climate of southern Idaho. The results indicate that early planted and developing crops consume 6-10\% more water in the southern Idaho environment than late developing crops for most major crop types. This increase occurs primarily because early developing crops tend to have a relatively longer growing period than crops developing later in spring. ET quantified through this procedure may have application in evaluating irrigation/project performance and in determining economic productivity of water. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A critical enabling component in this historic achievement was the use of satellite data to produce more accurate maps and population estimates used in planning and implementing vaccination campaigns. This article employs a value-of-information approach to estimate the net socioeconomic benefits associated with this use of satellite data. We calculate the increase in the likelihood of halting transmission of polio associated with the use of satellite-based information compared to traditional data sources, and we consider the benefits associated with savings to the healthcare system as well as health benefits. Using a conservative approach focused on just 1 year of benefits, we estimate net socioeconomic benefits of between \$46.0 million and \$153.9 million. In addition to these quantified benefits, we also recognize qualitative benefits associated with improving human health, reaching marginalized communities, and building capacity among local populations.

In fact, the term ‘public good’ has a more specific meaning, originating in the discipline of Economics, which carries with it a set of assumptions and implications about how markets operate. In this context a public good has two main characteristics: non-rivalry and nonexcludability. In their most common digital format, Earth observation data can appear to be both nonrivalrous and non-excludable. However, it is not the digital medium itself which controls the ‘publicness’ of a good but the conditions of access to that good.

However, urban tree planting initiatives do not typically utilize data about both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the tree canopy, despite height being a critical determinant of the quality and value of urban canopy cover. We present a novel pipeline that uses airborne LiDAR data to train a multi-task machine learning model to generate estimates of both canopy cover and height in urban areas. We apply this to multi-source multi-spectral imagery for the case study of Chicago, USA. Our results indicate that a multi-task UNet convolutional neural network can be used to generate reliable estimates of canopy cover and height from aerial and satellite imagery. We then use these canopy estimates to allocate 75,000 trees from Chicago's recent green initiative under four scenarios, minimizing the urban heat island effect and then optimizing for an equitable canopy distribution, comparing results when only canopy cover is used, and when both canopy cover and height are considered. Through the introduction of this novel pipeline, we show that including canopy height within decision-making processes allows the distribution of new trees to be optimised to further reduce the urban heat island effect in localities where trees have the highest cooling potential and allows trees to be more equitably distributed to communities with lower quality canopies.",2023,"{""Disney, Mathias"",""Francis, John"",""Law, Stephen""}","article",NA,"10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128115","{""notes"": ""('francis_monitoringcanopyqualityimproving_2023',)""}","{}",2024-09-30 17:12:33,"included",NA,NA
7037308,"Hyperspectral Sensors And Application In Forestry","From the very beginning of the development of remote sensing, humans have been trying to create a tool to study the Earth’s dynamic surface and its phenomena. With the advancement of technology, first for the military and then for research purposes, sensors have been developed to collect data by recording the electromagnetic spectrum (multi and hyperspectral). From the moment they became available for civilian use, the potential benefits of using hyperspectral data became apparent. The development of hyperspectral systems followed the development of computer technologies and the progress of software for processing a large number of collected data. Nowadays, hyperspectral sensors are increasingly being used for various purposes: Ecosystem study, atmosphere, climate, hydrology, mineral exploitation, land use, land cover, and vegetation. Thanks to the wide variety of information they provide, hyperspectral sensors have large application potential in environmental monitoring and management. Also, they help to improve management and better decision-making at early problem defining. The first application of hyperspectral sensors in Croatian forestry relates to the European Community program of 2005, when the first imaging with a line hyperspectral scanner was conducted. Within the conducted imaging, the first spectral curves of Silver fir and White berried mistletoe were separated. On the basis of this separation, for the first time, the difference between these two species was established. In other words, hyperspectral imagery was used to distinguish shrubs of semi-parasitic species within the host canopy. Also, procedures for large-area imaging were defined. © 2019, University of Zagreb.

7037494,"Remote Sensing And Site-Specific Weed Management","Weeds typically occur in patches rather than uniformly across a field; however, conventional management practices rely on whole-field management. Site-specific weed management (SSWM), applying control measures only where weeds are located at densities greater than those that cause economic losses, has tremendous potential for economic and environmental benefits. Current commercially available systems can detect green vegetation and activate a herbicide spray nozzle. Researchers are actively exploring how ground-based, aerial, or satellite sensor systems can be further developed to delineate weeds from crops during the growing season. Aerial and satellite systems can provide large-area coverage on a regular basis, but typically do not have the spatial resolution necessary to detect small weeds among agricultural crops, which is necessary if effective control and minimized crop yield losses are to be achieved. Ground-based systems overcome spatial resolution issues and can analyze plant shape characteristics as well as spectral profiles for weed detection. The primary limitation for ground-based sensors is the highly complex computational capabilities and the relatively slow speeds required to allow image processing and sprayer activation in a single operation. To date, economic and technical limitations for SSWM have not favored widespread adoption. However, as research continues and technology advances, the opportunities for site-specific control of weeds will greatly increase.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0526:rsaswm]2.0.co;2","{""notes"": ""('shaw_remotesensingsitespecific_2005',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 19:03:26,"included",NA,NA
7037939,"Probabilistic Seasonal Dengue Forecasting In Vietnam: A Modelling Study Using Superensembles","Background With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control activities is rare. Methods and findings We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002-2020) of dengue data at the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines. We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings. Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate predictions (continuous rank probability score {[}CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI 60.6-148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5-80.5) at lead times of 1 to 3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI 102-575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI 120-168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control efforts and serotype-specific case data. Conclusions This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data, seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale, the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead. Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and, if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other climate-sensitive disease systems. Author summary Why was this study done? A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to the most at-risk places. Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in advance. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and locations. We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6 months ahead. The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks than the baseline model across all lead times. The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location, forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission. What do these findings mean? While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict, particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool. Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of scarce resources.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1371/journal.pmed.1003542","{""notes"": ""('colongonzalez_probabilisticseasonaldengueforecasting_2021',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 19:08:13,"included",NA,NA

These efforts will raise Korea's satellite technology to the next level. To prepare strategies for efficient and effective development of satellites, it is essential to elaborately assess the economic impacts of previous satellite development projects and their application. In this paper, we examine the economic impacts of Korea's investment into the research and development of national satellites, and their application in the perspective of satellite value chain.

7038540,"Crossing The (Watershed) Divide: Satellite Data And The Changing Politics Of International River Basins","Acquiring freshwater resources is a necessary component of sustainable human settlement subject to increasing pressure from population and climate changes. This sometimes scarce resource primarily comes from rivers, and international river basins (IRBs), where watersheds and watercourses cross political boundaries, are often spaces of great political tension and conflict worldwide. Such conflict potential has garnered interest from a wide range of research communities, and each emphasises public access to hydrologic data as integral to successful international management of IRBs. However; these hydrologic data, especially measurements of river flow rate, are often closely guarded state secrets. Satellites have been cited as a key technology set to challenge this data monopoly that have yet been unable to calculate river flow rate without some form of guarded ancillary data. Now, at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) offers a means of circumventing data limitations without any a priori information, and the forthcoming NASA/CNES Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite also promises to estimate flow rates solely from its novel measurements following launch. In this paper, we explore how these newly available estimates of river flow rate could reconfigure water-management and interstate relations in IRBs, and demonstrate AMHG, for two cases: the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong. For these basins we find that satellite flow rate retrievals will likely reinforce and favour state-level negotiations of water resource governance. Also, satellite flow retrievals can have the direct, concrete effect of improving hydrologic understanding of the upstream Ganges-Brahmaputra, a sorely needed advance that will positively benefit millions of Bangladeshis and affect state-level interactions between India, China, and Bangladesh. Finally, we avoid offering prescriptive water management solutions for each case, as local stakeholders will ultimately determine if and how such satellite retrievals will be used.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/geoj.12155","{""notes"": ""('gleason_crossingwatersheddividesatellite_2017',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 22:35:29,"included",NA,NA
7036960,"Modelling Coral Reef Habitat Trajectories: Evaluation Of An Integrated Timed Automata And Remote Sensing Approach","The rapid degradation of many reefs worldwide calls for more effective monitoring and predictions of the trajectories of coral reef habitats as they cross cycles of disturbance and recovery. Current approaches include in situ monitoring, computer modelling, and remote sensing observations. We aimed to combine these three sources of information for Aboré Reef in New Caledonia by using: (1) a generic timed automata model of reef habitat trajectories, (2) two high spatial resolution multispectral images acquired before and after hurricane Erika in a 2-year interval (March, 2003), and (3) extensive field data on Aboré's benthic community structure. Field and remote sensing observations were used to verify model predictions of habitat evolution during the 2-year interval. We also tested whether a fairly generic model of habitat evolution can be used to flag local incorrect image change detection interpretation. The automaton manipulates objects such as states, transitions and clocks (transition times), and we found that it is possible, with expert knowledge, to describe complex habitat trajectories with this formalism. On Aboré Reef, we analyzed 22 heterogeneous polygons mapped before and after hurricane Erika using a 36 habitat typology. We examined 75 trajectories suggested by the before-after image classifications and critically reviewed the benefits of the combined timed automata model-image approach. The Aboré Reef case study confirms that this is a fruitful path to maximize the benefits of both tools, and minimize their respective drawbacks. However, we conclude that timed automata and remote sensing analysis need to be locally optimized to achieve useful results, and suggests further improvements by using hybrid models able to manipulate continuous, and fuzzy, properties. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Landscape classifications have considerable potential as tools in rural land-use planning. To date, a plethora of numerical classifications have been developed, yet little attempt has been made to quantify differences between classifications which may arise through the use of different attribute data and classification techniques. The present paper quantifies differences between three hierarchical landscape classifications developed using closely related algorithms, but using contrasting attribute data. Two classifications were based on land cover; from field survey and remote sensing, respectively. The third was based primarily on abiotic environmental variables. Quantitative comparisons between the three classifications indicate that similar land classes are recognisable at different levels of environmental and ecological organisation. It is concluded that the use of remotely sensed land cover in the production of landscape classification has many advantages over previous approaches. Foremost among these benefits are the ease with which digital land cover data can be handled within Geographic Information Systems and the consequential ability to produce classifications rapidly at differing spatial resolutions. The potential roles of numerical landscape classifications in rural planning are reviewed.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/0743-0167(94)90054-x","{""notes"": ""('cherrill_comparison3landscapeclassifications_1994',)""}","{}",2024-12-12 21:13:32,"included",NA,NA

7038260,"System Modelling Of Very Low Earth Orbit Satellites For Earth Observation","The operation of satellites in very low Earth orbit (VLEO) has been linked to a variety of benefits to both the spacecraft platform and mission design. Critically, for Earth observation (EO) missions a reduction in altitude on can enable smaller and less powerful payloads to achieve the same performance as larger instruments or sensors at higher altitude, with significant benefits to the spacecraft design. As a result, renewed interest in the exploitation of these orbits has spurred the development of new technologies that have the potential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude range. In this paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve aerodynamic performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and resistance to atomic oxygen erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) for sustained drag compensation or mitigation in VLEO. Attitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic forces and torques in VLEO are also discussed. These system models are integrated into a framework for concept-level satellite design and this approach is used to explore the system-level trade-offs for future EO spacecraft enabled by these new technologies. A case-study presented for an optical very-high resolution spacecraft demonstrates the significant potential of reducing orbital altitude using these technologies and indicates possible savings of up to 75\% in system mass and over 50\% in development and manufacturing costs in comparison to current state-of-the-art missions. For a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, the reduction in mass and cost with altitude were shown to be smaller, though it was noted that currently available cost models do not capture recent commercial advancements in this segment. These results account for the additional propulsive and power requirements needed to sustain operations in VLEO and indicate that future EO missions could benefit significantly by operating in this altitude range. Furthermore, it is shown that only modest advancements in technologies already under development may begin to enable exploitation of this lower altitude range. In addition to the upstream benefits of reduced capital expense and a faster return on investment, lower costs and increased access to high quality observational data may also be passed to the downstream EO industry, with impact across a wide range of commercial, societal, and environmental application areas.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.07.004","{""notes"": ""('crisp_systemmodellinglowearth_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:40:21,"included",NA,NA
7037730,"Evaluation Of Satellite And Simulated Rainfall Products For Hydrological Applications In The Notwane Catchment, Botswana","In semi-arid catchments, hydrological modeling, water resources planning and management are hampered by insufficient spatial rainfall data which is usually derived from limited rain gauge networks. Satellite products are potential candidates to augment the limited spatial rainfall data in these areas. In this paper, the utility of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) product (3B42 v7) is evaluated using data from the Notwane catchment in Botswana. In addition, rainfall simulations obtained from a multi-site stochastic rainfall model based on the generalised linear models (GLMs) were used as additional spatial rainfall estimates. These rainfall products were compared to the observed rainfall data obtained from six (6) rainfall stations available in the catchment for the period 1998-2012. The results show that in general the two approaches produce reasonable spatial rainfall estimates. However, the TRMM products provided better spatial rainfall estimates compared to the GLM rainfall outputs on an average, as more than 90\% of the monthly rainfall variations were explained by the TRMM compared to 80\% from the GLMs. However, there is still uncertainty associated mainly with limited rainfall stations, and the inability of the two products to capture unusually high rainfall values in the data sets. Despite this observation, rainfall indices computed to further assess the daily rainfall products (i.e. rainfall occurrence and amounts, length of dry spells) were adequately represented by the TRMM data compared to the GLMs. Performance from the GLMs is expected to improve with addition of further rainfall predictors. A combination of these rainfall products allows for reasonable spatial rainfall estimates and temporal (short term future) rainfall simulations from the TRMM and GLMs, respectively. The results have significant implications on water resources planning and management in the catchment which has, for the past three years, been experiencing prolonged droughts as shown by the drying of Gaborone dam (currently at a record low of 1.6\% full), which is the main source of water supply to the city of Gaborone and neighbouring townships in Botswana.

7038282,"In-Season Prediction Of Corn Grain Yield Through Planetscope And Sentinel-2 Images","Crop growth and yield monitoring are essential for food security and agricultural economic return prediction. Remote sensing is an efficient technique for measuring growing season crop canopies and providing information on the spatial variability of crop yields. In this study, ten vegetation indices (VIs) derived from time series PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images were used to investigate the potential to estimate corn grain yield with different regression methods. A field-scale spatial crop yield prediction model was developed and used to produce yield maps depicting spatial variability in the field. Results from this study clearly showed that high-resolution PlanetScope satellite data could be used to detect the corn yield variability at field level, which could explain 15\% more variability than Sentinel-2A data at the same spatial resolution of 10 m. Comparison of the model performance and variable importance measure between models illustrated satisfactory results for assessing corn productivity with VIs. The green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) values consistently produced the highest correlations with corn yield, accounting for 72\% of the observed spatial variation in corn yield. More reliable quantitative yield estimation could be made using a multi-linear stepwise regression (MSR) method with multiple VIs. Good agreement between observed and predicted yield was achieved with the coefficient of determination value being 0.81 at 86 days after seeding. The results would help farmers and decision-makers generate predicted yield maps, identify crop yield variability, and make further crop management practices timely.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/agronomy12123176","{""notes"": ""('li_seasonpredictioncorngrain_2022',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:35:04,"included",NA,NA

Emerging free software providing access to satellite imagery and simple editing tools (e.g. Google Earth™) complement existing geographic information system (GIS) software and provide new opportunities for: (i) strengthening overall public health capacity through development of information for city infrastructures; and (ii) display of public health data directly on an image of the physical environment. Methods: We used freely accessible satellite imagery and a set of feature-making tools included in the software (allowing for production of polygons, lines and points) to generate information for city infrastructure and to display disease data in a dengue decision support system (DDSS) framework. Findings: Two cities in Mexico (Chetumal and Merida) were used to demonstrate that a basic representation of city infrastructure useful as a spatial backbone in a DDSS can be rapidly developed at minimal cost. Data layers generated included labelled polygons representing city blocks, lines representing streets, and points showing the locations of schools and health clinics. City blocks were colour-coded to show presence of dengue cases. The data layers were successfully imported in a format known as shapefile into a GIS software. Conclusion: The combination of Google Earth™ and free GIS software (e.g. HealthMapper, developed by WHO, and SIGEpi, developed by PAHO) has tremendous potential to strengthen overall public health capacity and facilitate decision support system approaches to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.2471/blt.07.045880","{""notes"": ""('lozanofuentes_googleearthstrengthenpublic_2008',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 23:08:05,"included",NA,NA
7652282,"Using Remotely Sensed Indicators Of Primary Productivity To Improve Prioritization Of Conservation Areas For Top Predators","The need to incorporate habitat dynamics into spatial conservation prioritization is increasingly recognized but often limited by the lack of available temporal data. To overcome this limitation, model-assisted monitoring has been advocated and developed over the last decade. However, predictive modelling often relies on static habitat features or interpolated climate data, failing to consider other relevant ecological processes such as primary productivity and its dynamics. The importance of primary productivity relies on its key role in determining the availability of food resources via trophic cascades. This study aims to assess how the spatiotemporal variation in the habitat quality for top predators (using raptors as case study) can be affected by temporal fluctuations in primary productivity, and whether its incorporation into habitat modelling improves predictions in space and time. Through model predictions we then incorporate interannual habitat-quality dynamics into spatial conservation planning to identify priority areas for raptor conservation based on a new set of dynamic priority-area indices. Using raptor occurrence data from two surveys (2001 and 2014), we found high model performance and transferability for all species (AUC(2001) = 0.89 +/- 0.10 and Boyce's Index(2001) of 0.78 +/- 0.20; AUC(2014) = 0.89 +/- 0.12 and Boyce's Index(2014) of 0.87 +/- 0.06). Annual mean and minimum values of EVI (indicators of productivity and phenology, respectively) and elevation were the most important predictor variables for most raptor species. However, the standard deviation of EVI (an indicator of seasonality) was also found to be an important predictor for migratory species breeding in shrublands and croplands. Interannual model predictions showed a large interannual variation in habitat availability across species, partially associated with regional land-use changes. Interannual habitat-quality dynamics was translated into marked changes in the priority areas for raptor conservation -areas mostly associated with deciduous forest and water environments (rivers and dams) in our study area. Our results shed light on the role of intra- and interannual dynamics of primary productivity in driving habitat quality for top predators. They also confirm the potential of remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes to inform about habitat-quality dynamics in a cost-effective, standardized and repeatable way. Incorporating interannual dynamics of primary productivity in habitat modelling supports raptor conservation prioritization by informing about adequacy, stability and legacy of raptor conservation areas.",2021,"{""Arenas-Castro, Salvador"",""Dominguez, Jesus"",""Honrado, Joao P."",""Regos, Adrian"",""Tapia, Luis""}","article",NA,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107503","{""notes"": ""('regos_remotelysensedindicatorsprimary_2021',)""}","{}",2025-02-26 19:44:08,"included",NA,NA
7037309,"Leveraging The Neon Airborne Observation Platform For Socio-Environmental Systems Research","During the 21st century, human-environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human-environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales.

Following the emergence and routine availability of commercial very high spatial resolution (0.6-10 m) multispectral satellite images, we reviewed the use of these new high-quality remote sensing data and products for coral reef fisheries management. The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements.

As national agencies invest in high-tech infrastructures like EO, there is a growing need for evaluate their socio-economic returns (not to be confused with their financial returns).

7038217,"Influence Of Plot Size On Efficiency Of Biomass Estimates In Inventories Of Dry Tropical Forests Assisted By Photogrammetric Data From An Unmanned Aircraft System","Applications of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to assist in forest inventories have provided promising results in biomass estimation for different forest types. Recent studies demonstrating use of different types of remotely sensed data to assist in biomass estimation have shown that accuracy and precision of estimates are influenced by the size of field sample plots used to obtain reference values for biomass. The objective of this case study was to assess the influence of sample plot size on efficiency of UAS-assisted biomass estimates in the dry tropical miombo woodlands of Malawi. The results of a design-based field sample inventory assisted by three-dimensional point clouds obtained from aerial imagery acquired with a UAS showed that the root mean square errors as well as the standard error estimates of mean biomass decreased as sample plot sizes increased. Furthermore, relative efficiency values over different sample plot sizes were above 1.0 in a design-based and model-assisted inferential framework, indicating that UAS-assisted inventories were more efficient than purely field-based inventories. The results on relative costs for UAS-assisted and pure field-based sample plot inventories revealed that there is a trade-off between inventory costs and required precision. For example, in our study if a standard error of less than approximately 3 Mg ha(-1) was targeted, then a UAS-assisted forest inventory should be applied to ensure more cost effective and precise estimates. Future studies should therefore focus on finding optimum plot sizes for particular applications, like for example in projects under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) mechanism with different geographical scales.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs9060610","{""notes"": ""('kachamba_influenceplotsizeefficiency_2017',)""}","{}",2024-12-24 18:47:48,"included",NA,NA

The availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and utilities depend on the sustainability of smart cities. The big streaming data generated and collected by smart building devices and systems contain useful information that needs to be used to make timely action and better decisions. The ultimate objective of these procedures is to enhance the city’s sustainability and livability. The replacement of decades-old infrastructures, such as underground wiring, steam pipes, transportation tunnels, and high-speed Internet installation, is already a major problem for major urban regions. There are still certain regions in big cities where broadband wireless service is not available. The decision support system is recently acquiring increasing attention in the smart city context. In this article, a deep learning–based sustainable decision support system (DLSDSS) has been proposed for energy building in smart cities. This study proposes the integration of the Internet of Things into smart buildings for energy management, utilizing deep learning methods for sensor information decision making. Building a socially advanced environment aims to enhance city services and urban administration for residents in smart cities using remote sensing techniques.

Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “benefit chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.",2008,"{""Fritz, Steffen""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1109/jsyst.2008.926688","{}","{""in benchmarks?""}",2024-04-22 02:30:50,"included",NA,NA
7038292,"Integrating Remote Sensing In Natura 2000 Habitat Monitoring: Prospects On The Way Forward","Monitoring and reporting on the state of nature gained increasing importance in the European Union with the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. Reporting habitat conservation status requires detailed knowledge on many aspects of habitats at different spatial levels. Remote sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for Natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited. One reason for this appears to be the knowledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community. We conducted a review of legal monitoring and reporting requirements on Natura 2000 habitats, looked into the current use of remote sensing in habitat reporting, and consulted monitoring experts in nature conservation administrations to find out about their attitude and expectations towards remote sensing. In this paper, we disclose and summarise the real data needs behind the legal requirements for Natura 2000 habitat monitoring and reporting, analyse opportunities and constraints for remote sensing, and highlight bottlenecks and pathways to resolve them. Monitoring experts are not unwilling to use remote sensing data, but they are unsure of whether remote sensing can suit their needs in a cost-effective way. They look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation. Based on our findings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into Natura 2000 habitat monitoring could benefit from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.jnc.2010.07.003","{""notes"": ""('vandenborre_integratingremotesensingnatura_2011',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 19:19:49,"included",NA,NA

6863626,"From Forest Dynamics To Wetland Siltation In Mountainous Landscapes: A Rs-Based Framework For Enhancing Erosion Control","Human activities have caused a significant change in the function and services that ecosystems have provided to society since historical times. In mountainous landscapes, the regulation of services such as water quality or erosion control has been impacted by land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially the loss and fragmentation of forest patches. In this work, we develop a Remote Sensing (RS)-based modelling approach to identify areas for the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) (i.e., natural forest conservation and restoration) that allow reducing the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to siltation in mountainous regions. We used time series Landsat 5TM, 7ETM+, 8OLI and Sentinel 2A/2B MSI (S2) imagery to map forest dynamics and wetland distribution in Picos de Europa National Park (Cantabrian Mountains, northern Spain). We fed RS-based models with detailed in situ information based on photo-interpretation and fieldwork completed from 2017 to 2021. We estimated a forest cover increase rate of 2 ha/year comparing current and past LULC maps against external validation data. We applied this forest gain to a scenario generator model to derive a 30-year future LULC map that defines the potential forest extent for the study area in 2049. We then modelled the distribution of wetlands to identify the areas with the greatest potential for moisture accumulation. We used an S2 mosaic and topography-derived data such as the slope and topographic wetness index (TWI), which indicate terrain water accumulation. Overall accuracy scores reached values of 86\% for LULC classification and 61\% for wetland mapping. At the same time, we obtained the potential erosion using the NetMap software to identify potential sediment production, transport and deposition areas. Finally, forest dynamics, wetland distribution and potential erosion were combined in a multi-criteria analysis aiming to reduce the amount of sediment reaching selected wetlands. We achieved this by identifying the most suitable locations for the conservation and restoration of natural forests on slopes and in riparian areas, which may reduce the risk of soil erosion and maximise sediment filtering, respectively. The results show a network pattern for forest management that would allow for controlling erosion effects across space and time at three levels: one, by reducing the load that originates upslope in the absence of forest cover; two, by intersecting runoff at watercourses related to sediment transport; and three, by a lack of former barriers, by trapping erosion near to the receiving wetland systems, main river axes and contributing streams. In conclusion, the proposed methodology, which could be transferred to other mountain regions, allows to optimise investment for erosion prevention and wetland conservation by using only very specific areas of the landscape for habitat management (e.g., for NBS implementation).",2022,"{""Alvarez-Martinez, Jose Manuel"",""Barquin, Jose"",""Hernandez-Romero, Gonzalo"",""Perez-Silos, Ignacio"",""Silio-Calzada, Ana"",""Vieites, David R.""}","article",NA,"10.3390/rs14081864","{""notes"": ""('hernandezromero_forestdynamicswetlandsiltation_2022',)""}","{maybe}",2024-07-18 21:44:30,"included",NA,NA
7037120,"Crowdsourcing To Enhance Insights From Satellite Observations","Insights from satellite observations are increasingly being used to enhance a range of domains from highly specialised scientific research through to everyday applications directly benefiting members of the public. A particular category of satellite observations-Earth Observations (EO)-is concerned with capturing information regarding the Earth's atmospheric and environmental conditions and observing human activity and its impact on the Earth's surface. A growing number of technologies and services heavily rely on EO data and the rapidly improving fidelity, coverage, timeliness and accessibility of such observations are providing significant opportunities for new applications of economic and societal benefit. With the increasing importance, relevance and size of EO data sets, it is critical to understand how the value of such data can be maximised by complementing EO with other sources of data and efficiently making complex interpretations and decisions. The wide adoption and availability of smartphones, Internet devices and increased accessibility to information has paved the way for large numbers of citizens and communities to participate in scientific, technological, societal and decision-making activities.

6863625,"Mapping Floristic Gradients Of Forest Composition Using An Ordination-Regression Approach With Landsat Oli And Terrain Data In The Central Hardwoods Region","Mapping forest properties with supervised remote sensing has historically and increasingly remained vital to research and management efforts, and the demand for such products will only increase as better tools and data increase the usability of such maps. Multispectral imagery by the Landsat program has been an invaluable resource for forest type characterization for several decades. As an alternative to traditional classification approaches dominating these efforts, we instead employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping forest composition as floristic gradients across a ∼5000-km2 forestland in southeastern Ohio's Central Hardwoods. Plot data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) from a comprehensive sample of both overstory and understory woody plants across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination solution. Floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reflectance provided by a multitemporal Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI) image and various terrain variables using Random Forests models. Approximately 61%, 49%, and 25% of the floristic variation among the three axes of the NMDS ordination were related to the remotely-sensed variables during regression modeling. The axes were predicted onto three images and merged to a RGB color composite for the final floristic gradient map, displaying multivariate vegetation variation across the landscape in terms of variation in color. The color values, by referencing ordination space position within the original solution, provide a statistical approximation of the taxonomic composition of individual forest stands in relation to the plot data. We found this approach highly effective and an attractive alternative to traditional classifications. It is time-efficient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is expressed in continuous fields rather than arbitrary breaks, and less subjective, overcoming the generalization problem inherent in categorizing vegetation assemblages a priori. Moving forward, our model will be a valuable tool in developing suitable management options on individual forest stands for the restoration of desired species, adapting to a changing climate, and improving wildlife habitat in forestlands across the Central Hardwoods. © 2018",2019,"{""Adams, B.

6691578,"Using satellite data to fill the gaps in the US air pollution monitoring network","Compliance with the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is determined at the county level using local air pollution monitors. However, the vast majority of counties have zero or one monitor, and air pollution concentrations can vary dramatically over short distances. In addition, recent evidence suggests monitor placement may be skewed to make NAAQS compliance easier. As a result, the network of air pollution monitors may not detect all areas with pollution levels that exceed the NAAQS. This paper explores this possibility using satellite-derived data on fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) to assess NAAQS compliance for the continental United States at a 1 kilometer (km) resolution. We compare the satellite-based assessments with official attainment designations made by the terrestrial monitor network and calculate the number of people living in “misclassified” areas—areas with PM2.5 levels that exceed the NAAQS but are classified as being in attainment based on the ground monitors and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) official determination. We estimate that about 24.4 million people are living in these misclassified areas— about as many as are living in properly classified nonattainment areas—and that if such areas had sped up their PM2.5 reductions as much as nonattainment areas did, 5,452 premature deaths would have been avoided, a welfare gain to society of $49 billion.",2018,"{""Sullivan, Daniel""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://www.rff.org/valuables/impact-assessments/","{}","{}",2024-04-26 18:56:51,"included",NA,NA
7038091,"The Utility Of Infrequent Snow Depth Images For Deriving Continuous Space-Time Estimates Of Seasonal Snow Water Equivalent","Snow water equivalent (SWE), particularly in mountains regions, has been an elusive hydrologic measurement. We examine the utility of a data assimilation approach to generate space-time continuous estimates of SWE from more readily available snow depth (SD) measurements. A multitemporal lidar data set provides a unique opportunity to assimilate single SD images and verify posterior estimates against SD images at nonassimilation times. Application over three water years shows significant improvement in the posterior estimates with an average correlation between estimated and measured SD fields of 0.88 compared to 0.52 for prior estimates that do not benefit from the assimilated SD data. We also show that posterior estimates are consistent with independent in situ SWE and streamflow measurements. This work demonstrates that using high-resolution/high-accuracy, but infrequent, SD measurements combined with a data assimilation framework could make significant inroads toward the goal of spatially distributed SWE and snowmelt estimates at the global scale. Plain Language Summery The mass of water stored in seasonal snowpacks (snow water equivalent) is a key parameter for water supply management. Yet, despite its importance and decades of effort, snow water equivalent has been an elusive variable to characterize over the mountainous areas of the globe, with no existing satellite capable of providing routine estimates of these important water stores. We propose a new approach using so-called data assimilation techniques to transform infrequently available measurements of snow depth to continuous estimates of snow water equivalent and snowmelt rates. We show that even a single snow depth measurement near the time of peak snow accumulation can result in accurate estimation of the evolution of snow water equivalent and snowmelt rates across the water year. Our results suggest a potential new pathway for the hydrologic community in its long-pursued goal of global-scale estimates (from satellite remote sensing) of snow water equivalent and its space-time variability. If applied at large scales with satellite-derived snow depth measurements, such methods could have significant implications for improved water resource and hazard management.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1029/2019gl082507","{""notes"": ""('margulis_utilityinfrequentsnowdepth_2019',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 18:03:45,"included",NA,NA
6863661,"Global Flood Mapper: A Novel Google Earth Engine Application For Rapid Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Sar","Timely and accurate information about the extent of floodwater is critical for emergency planning and disaster management efforts. Despite the advances in computational resources and in the field of remote sensing, there is a clear gap that restricts the disaster community from leveraging the technological resources in real time, which impedes on-ground response efforts. To bridge this gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, the paper presents a new web application, the Global Flood Mapper (GFM) that allows the user to generate flood maps quickly and without getting into technical intricacies. To derive the flood extent from Sentinel-1 satellite data, the pre-flood collection is considered as base and anomaly cells in the during-flood image(s) are identified using Z-Score values. Second, it advances an existing flood mapping method to (a) Map the peak of the floods by combining ascending and descending scenes when necessary, and (b) Check for false positives in hilly terrains by adding slope and elevation mask parameters. By comparing our results with Sentinel-2 MSI derived flood maps and field photographs, we show that the GFM can generate flood maps with precision. The GFM can be used to map and download the extent of multiple flood events of an area as vector data (.kml format), which can be a critical input for flood modeling and risk and impact assessments. The GFM shall enable first responders and practitioners across the globe to overcome technical barriers and lack of computational resources to map the extent of inundation during and after floods.",2022,"{""Malladi, Teja"",""Tripathy, Pratyush""}","article",NA,"10.1007/s11069-022-05428-2","{""notes"": ""('tripathy_globalfloodmappergoogle_2022',)""}","{}",2024-07-17 00:03:20,"included",NA,NA

In particular we show how the use of improvedAOOSdata in research, stockassessment, andultimately fisheriesmanagement has the potential to result in significant benefits in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish and Kodiak king crab fisheries. We show through a case study approach that information such as might be provided by an enhanced AOOS could conceivably contribute over $600 million in additional annual revenue in Alaska’s groundfish fishery. In addition we estimate that had the information from such a system been available in the 1970s and 1980s the Kodiak king crab stock collapse could have been avoided and $60 million in annual revenues generated. Benefit estimates (as measured by revenue increases) are based on the assumptions that when better data is delivered those data will be integrated into stock assessment models; when better data are integrated into the models the new data will actually improve the reliability of the models; and when the reliability of the models is improved predictions will be accepted by managers or industry members.",2008,"{""Wellman, Katharine""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1080/08920750701868051","{}","{}",2024-04-26 23:07:42,"included",NA,NA
7037237,"Predicting Mycosphaerella Leaf Disease Severity In A Eucalyptus Globulus Plantation Using Digital Multi-Spectral Imagery","Digital remote sensing is rapidly developing into an operational tool for forest health assessment at a range of scales. A key aspect of this development is the derivation of models relating spectral data contained in the images to the extent and severity of plant stress symptoms. This study assesses the utility of high spatial resolution (0.5m x 0.5m pixel size) airborne digital imagery to assess the presence and severity of defoliation and necrosis from Mycosphaerella leaf disease at the crown scale across a small plantation in north-western Tasmania, Australia. The best model of defoliation included the variance of reflectance at 780nm within the crown (r(2) = 0.5; p < 0.0001) and the best model of necrosis included the ratio of reflectance at 680nm/550nm (r(2) = 0.3; p < 0.0001). Maps derived from these linear models clearly illustrate the distribution and gradient of disease severity observed in the field. Error matrix analysis indicates moderate map accuracy for classified versions of both defoliation (OA = 71\%; Kappa = 0.63) and necrosis (OA = 67\%; Kappa = 0.54) but the maps reveal additional information about the distribution and severity of symptoms throughout the plantation. Methods such as those described in this paper may enable managers to more accurately target remedial actions. The transfer of this technology to space-borne platforms will potentially improve map accuracy and image availability, and reduce the cost of image collection. Together, these improvements increase the likelihood of remote sensing being incorporated into forest management strategies in future.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.2989/shfj.2007.69.3.7.357","{""notes"": ""('pietrzykowski_predictingmycosphaerellaleafdisease_2007',)""}","{}",2024-12-13 21:24:02,"included",NA,NA
6903587,"Evaluating Remote Sensing Approaches For Mapping The Bathymetry Of Lake Manzala, Egypt","Lake Manzala is considered the largest lagoon in Egypt. The lake has significant economic and environmental impacts that should be managed based on management models. The bathymetry of this lake, which is time consuming and laborious to obtain in the field, is one of the key input files for developing hydrological models of the lake. Remote sensing technology is used to determine satellite bathymetric maps with reasonable accuracy. The objective of the present work was to utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to determine the bathymetry of Lake Manzala. Generalized linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, bagging (BAG, an ensemble regression algorithm), least-squares boosting fitting ensemble (LSB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used in this study to process the images and manage the database of each image. The Landsat images were corrected for atmospheric conditions and the sunglint effect. Then values from the logarithms of corrected reflectance bands (coastal, blue, green, and red) and their ratio logarithms at locations corresponding to GPS surveys were extracted. Two assessing metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation (R), were used to calibrate the derived logarithm values for the model using observed data for the lake. The results show that the BAG and decision tree approaches perform well for Lake Manzala. Such methodologies should be applied for bathymetry determination, especially for shallow lakes, to save monitoring effort and costs. This approach facilitates the development of management models for lakes.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s41207-021-00285-0","{""notes"": ""('elshazly_evaluatingremotesensingapproaches_2021',)""}","{maybe}",2024-09-26 00:45:19,"included",NA,NA

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of the most commonly used satellite technologies in relief logistics: imagery and mapping, portable global positioning system (GPS) positioning devices, telecommunications, and GPS vehicle tracking. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines both the benefits and limitations of satellite technologies in light of the existing literature and through a complementary questionnaire survey with field workers involved in humanitarian operations in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Findings - The results show that the use of satellite technologies can facilitate most of the key logistics challenges encountered by relief actors. However, they also highlight important barriers within humanitarian organizations such as the lack of skilled workers and high costs, underlining the need for long- term training, resource investments, and cooperation between users and technology providers. Research limitations/implications - The research findings remain valid only in the context of catastrophic disaster responses, which lead to similar destructions, logistical problems, and needs for satellite technologies. Practical implications - This paper shows how satellite technologies can support humanitarian professionals in the field. It also provides policy recommendations that can facilitate the use of these technologies.

6863297,"Design Of Terrace Drainage Networks Using Uav-Based High-Resolution Topographic Data","Hillslope viticulture has a long history in Mediterranean Europe, and still holds important cultural and economic value. Steep hillsides have widely been levelled by terraces, in order to control surface water flow and facilitate cultivation. However, under unsustainable management and growing rainfall aggressiveness, terraced vineyards have become one of the most erosion-prone agricultural landscapes. The Valcamonica valley in Lombardy (Italy) presents a typical example of an ancient wine production region where rural land abandonment has previously caused widespread degradation of the traditional terracing systems. Recently, a local revival of wine production led to restoration plans of the terraces and their drainage functioning, to safeguard productivity and hydrogeologic safety. In this study, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey was carried out to reconstruct an accurate and precise 3D terrain model of a Valcamonica vineyard through photogrammetry. The resulting high-resolution topographic data allowed insights of surface flow-induced soil erosion patterns based on the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII). Three diverse drainage networks were designed and digitally implemented, allowing scenario analysis of the costs and benefits in terms of potential erosion mitigation.

However, site-specific treatments require maps of the soil variability to identify areas of land that share similar properties. In order to produce these maps, we propose a cost-efficient method that combines clustering algorithms with publicly available satellite imagery. The method does not require exploring the parcels with any special equipment or taking samples of the soil for laboratory analysis. The proposed method was tested in a case study for three vineyard parcels with topographical dissimilarities.

Satellite remote sensing offers a unique potential for mapping and monitoring fires at large spatial scales. Active fire information from satellites is one of the fundamental data in mitigating the smoke haze effect; therefore, active fire monitoring has become an essential tool for daily fires and smoke haze control, management, and mitigation in Thailand. The three critical sources of active fire hotspot information used in Thailand and elsewhere include (a) NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS); (b) the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), Active Fire Alert System; and (c) the Colorado School of Mines VIIRS NightFire Alert System. On their own, satellite-derived active fire information is insufficient, but the combination of satellite-derived data and traditional fire monitoring from ground-based methods can work well. Adding advanced geostationary fire detection is needed as a next step to enable fire suppression teams to reach fires as quickly as possible, resulting in much more efficient and safer fire control. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",2023,"{""Davies, D."",""Elvidge, C."",""McCarty, J.

6863466,"Development Of A Hydrological Telemetry System In Bago River","Hydrological monitoring is one of the key aspects in early warning systems that are vital to flood disaster management in flood-prone areas such as Bago River Basin in Myanmar. Thousands of people are affected due to the perennial flooding. Owing to the increasing pressure of rapid urbanization in the region and future climate change impacts, an early warning system in the basin is urgently required for disaster risk mitigation. This paper introduces the co-establishment of the telemetry system by a group of stakeholders. The co-establishment of the system through intensive consultations, proactive roles in responsibility sharing, and capacity building efforts, is essential in developing a base platform for flood forecasting and an early warning system in the basin. Herein, we identify the key challenges that have been central to the participatory approach in co-establishing the system. We also highlight opportunities as a result of the ongoing process and future impact on the disaster management system in the basin. We also highlight the potential for scientific contributions in understanding the local weather and hydrological characteristics through the establishment of the high-temporal resolution observation network. Using the observation at Zaung Tu Weir, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite estimates were assessed. Near real-time and standard versions of both satellite estimates show potential utility over the basin. Hourly aggregation shows slightly higher than 40% probability of detection (POD), on average, for both satellite estimates regardless of the production type. Thus, the hourly aggregation requires correction before usage. The results show useful skills at 60% POD for standard GSMaP (GSMAP-ST), 55% POD for near real-time GSMaP (GSMAP-NR), and 46% POD for GPM, at 3-hourly aggregations. Six-hourly aggregations show maximum benefit for providing useful skill and good correspondence to gauge the observation with GSMAP-ST showing the best true skill score (TSS) at 0.54 and an equitable threat score (ETS) at 0.37. While, both final run GPM and GSMAP-NR show lower POD, TSS, and ETS scores. Considering the latency of near real-time satellite estimates, the GSMAP-NR shows the best potential with a 4-hour latency period for monitoring and forecasting purposes in the basin. The result of the GSMAP-NR does not vary significantly from the GSMAP-ST and all GPM estimates. However, it requires some correction before its usage in any applications, for modeling and forecasting purposes. © 2018, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.",2018,"{""Acierto, R.

7037806,"Small Area Estimation In Diverse Timber Types Using Multiple Sources Of Auxiliary Data","Informed forest management requires reliable information. As the demand for finer scale estimates has increased, so has the cost for obtaining them from design-based ground sampling. Small area estimation (SAE) is an estimation technique that leverages ancillary information to augment design-based samples with the goal of increasing estimate precision without increasing ground-based sample intensities. This work presents three case studies spanning an industrial timberland ownership in the United States making use of SAE techniques in operational forest inventories. Case studies include an inventory of pre-thin plantation loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands that had achieved crown closure in Alabama and Mississippi, a mixed pine-hardwood inventory in Alabama, and pre-thinning plantation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in Washington State. Using area-level SAE techniques, vegetation indices derived from 10 m Sentinel imagery were shown to reduce estimate uncertainty for common stand parameters. Additionally, when available, lidar and age were shown to offer additional improvements in estimate precision. The results of this study indicate the operational potential for using commonly available auxiliary data for producing forest parameter estimates with enhanced precision. The implications of these findings span multiple inventory objectives including, for example, commercial forest management, carbon accounting, and wildfire fuel assessments. Study Implications: Forest management requires reliable quantitative information for informed decisions. Data from ground-based forest inventories are commonly used to construct design-unbiased direct estimates. Due to logistical and cost constraints, samples often do not provide estimates with sufficient precision for making confident decisions. The statistical estimation procedure, small area estimation, is able to leverage linearly related ancillary data across areas of interest to form composite estimates that have less uncertainty than direct estimates alone. This study shows how combining ground-based data with auxiliary data from remote sensing and stand records produced more precise estimates of forest stand parameters in three distinct timber types spanning a large ownership in the United States. Results indicate that significant inventory efficiency and confidence can be realized by incorporating commonly available auxiliary data into the estimation of forest characteristics. © 2022 The Author(s).

6691541,"Knowledge generation using satellite earth observations to support sustainable development goals (SDG): A use case on Land degradation","Land degradation is a critical issue globally requiring immediate actions for protecting biodiversity and associated services provided by ecosystems that are supporting human quality of life. The latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Landmark Assessment Report highlighted that human activities are considerably degrading land and threating the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion\npeople. In order to reduce and ideally reverse this prevailing situation, national capacities should be strengthened to enable effective assessments and mapping of their degraded lands as recommended by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The indicator 15.3.1 (“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”) requires regular data production by countries to inform and assess it through space and time. Earth\nObservations (EO) can play an important role both for generating the indicator in countries where it is missing, as well complementing or enhancing national official data sources. In response to this issue, this paper presents an innovative, scalable and flexible approach to monitor land degradation at various scales (e.g., national, regional, global) using various components of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) platform to leverage EO resources for informing SDG 15.3.1. The proposed approach follows the Data-Information-Knowledge pattern using the Trends.Earth model (http://trends.earth) and various data sources to generate the indicator. It also implements additional components for model execution and orchestration, knowledge management, and visualization. The proposed approach has been successfully applied at global, regional and national scales and advances the vision of (1) establishing data analytics platforms that can potentially support countries to discover, access and use the necessary datasets to assess land degradation; and (2) developing new capacities to effectively and efficiently use EO-based resources.",2020,"{""Giuliani, Gregory""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102068","{}","{maybe}",2024-04-23 22:19:26,"included",NA,NA
7037296,"Non-Point Source Critical Area Analysis In The Gisselo Watershed Using Gis","In the southeast in Noffkoping, Sweden, is a small fjord-like bay called Slatbaken. The water quality in Slatbaken-with its narrow outlet to the Baltic Sea-depends highly on the water quality of the streams that flow in it. While point pollution sources can be identified easily in general, the non-point sources are harder to find. The most important sources for non-point pollution are agricultural areas, and the pollutants are mostly nutrients like phosphorus, which come from the fertilisation of the fields. One important catchment area for Slatbaken is the 57.7 km(2) Gisselo river basin (part of the topographic map 8GNO), which contains large agricultural areas. The transport of water pollutants is based on the same hydrological processes as erosion and sediment transport. The implementation of such a model in a GIS allows the analysis of a large area with a high resolution. When choosing the model, special attention was paid to the possibility of using a verified model that is easy to implement in a commercial GIS without the need of too much expert knowledge. This may allow its widespread use in many administrative applications that need non-point source information. A feasibility test for an enhanced GIS USLE model was done in the Gisselo drainage basin before it was implemented for all river basins in the whole administrative area of Norrkopings kommun. It is possible to use the suggested simplified USLE model to estimate the load of both pollutants and sediments, and it is able to show the areas that are critical for the water quality at the outlet of the water basin. The model has been evaluated in three studies {[}Int. J. Geogr. Inf. Syst. 2 (4) (1988) 365; A GIS to target critical areas for non point source management, in: Proceedings of the International Non Point Source Management Symposium, Austin, TX, November 7, 1989; Vatten 48 (1992) 117]. Then, implemented in a very simple GIS that allowed only rough estimates of terrain models and distances, the model was able to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Svarta river basin of 1539 km(2) in the same region as Gisselo and the Bornsjo river basin outside Stockholm. Besides an estimated R-2 of 0.91-0.98 (verified by a more than one year measurement from manual and automated sampling stations in the whole river basin), the benefit with the GIS implemented USLE was the possibility to identify the risk areas with high spatial accuracy. During the last decade, both available databases and software have changed the possibilities to identify areas at risk of nutrient leakage. Schein {[}GIS Methods for Monitoring Sustainable Development by Analysis of Land-use and Land Cover Changes in the Surroundings of Linkoping (Sweden), Institut fur Photogrammetrie und Fernerkundung, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany] and Schein and Sivertun {[}Method and models for sustainable development monitoring and analyses in GIS, in: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Geo-Spatial Knowledge Processing for Natural Resource Management, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy, June 28-29, 2001] show that the enhanced land use data available through the European Union agricultural support program can be used together with remote sensing data to fine tune the modified GIS USLE model. The problems with the new 50 x 50 m digital elevation data now available are also pointed out here. Obvious errors in the data and possibilities to enhance the model by introducing a better terrain model were two important suggestions in these works. In this article, two modifications to the original model are suggested. One is enhancement of the digital terrain model by using height curves from the digital 1:50 000 scale topographic map, and the other is a smooth distance function that better reflects the impact of nutrients on water bodies. Because of its easy implementation on standard low cost systems, the GIS USLE model is suitable for analysing huge areas for critical places. The results can lead to more detailed studies in the risk areas thus identified or to investigations on the effect of land use changes, or can be used simply for taking care in the use of fertilisers and other chemicals in the critical agricultural areas.

In practice it is often difficult to access sufficient water supply and use data to determine crop water consumption and irrigation performance. Energy balance techniques using remote sensing data have been developed by various researchers over the last 20 years, and can be used as a tool to directly estimate actual evapotranspiration, i.e., water consumption. This study demonstrates how remote sensing-based estimates of water consumption and water stress combined with secondary agricultural production data can provide better estimates of irrigation performance, including water productivity, at a variety of scales than alternative options. A principle benefit of the described approach is that it allows identification of areas where agricultural performance is less than potential, thereby providing insights into where and how irrigation systems can be managed to improve overall performance and increase water productivity in a sustainable manner. To demonstrate the advantages, the approach was applied in Rechna Doab irrigation system of Pakistan's Punjab Province. Remote sensing-based indicators reflecting equity, adequacy, reliability and water productivity were estimated. Inter- and intra-irrigation subdivision level variability in irrigation performance, associated factors and improvement possibilities are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

7037022,"Land Cover Classification In Mangrove Ecosystems Based On Vhr Satellite Data And Machine Learning-An Upscaling Approach","Mangrove forests grow in the inter-tidal areas along coastlines, rivers, and tidal lands. They are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans. In order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems. Since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous. In this study, we investigated the potential of combining Sentinel-2 and Worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in Iran with an area of 768 km(2). The upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from Worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on Sentinel-2 images. We used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems. The approach resulted in a 65.5\% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover. Mapping accuracies improved with this approach, resulting in medium overall accuracy even though the user's accuracy of some classes, such as tidal zone and shallow water, was low. Conservation and sustainable management in these ecosystems can be improved in the future.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs12172684","{""notes"": ""('toosi_landcoverclassificationmangrove_2020',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 00:15:21,"included",NA,NA

A logit model estimated with data from a 2005 mail survey of cotton producers in 11 southern USA states was used to evaluate the adoption of remote sensing. The most frequently made management decisions using remote sensing were the application of plant growth regulators, the identification of drainage problems and the management of harvest aids. A producer who was younger, more highly educated and had a larger farm with irrigated cotton was more likely to adopt remote sensing. In addition, farmers who used portable computers in fields and produced their own map-based prescriptions had a greater probability of using remote sensing.

6447794,"Assessing the value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs: An example from the Great Barrier Reef","The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reef protection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5–10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.",2011,"{""Bouma, Jetske A."",""Dekker, Arnold G."",""Kuik, Onno""}","journal","Science of The Total Environment","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.07.023","{""url"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711007418"", ""date"": ""2011-10-01"", ""pages"": ""4497"", ""end_page"": ""4503"", ""access_date"": ""2023-04-17 23:16:57"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711007418/pdfft?md5=2b814fe55383aafde7b6542ad13f7865&pid=1-s2.0-S0048969711007418-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y"", ""short_title"": ""Assessing the value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs"", ""database_provider"": ""ScienceDirect"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""Science of The Total Environment""}","{benchmark}",NA,NA,NA,NA
7036709,"Ocean Colour Opportunities From Meteosat Second And Third Generation Geostationary Platforms","Ocean colour applications from medium-resolution polar-orbiting satellite sensors have now matured and evolved into operational services. These applications are enabled by the Sentinel-3 OLCI space sensors of the European Earth Observation Copernicus programme and the VIIRS sensors of the US Joint Polar Satellite System programme. Key drivers for the Copernicus ocean colour services are the national obligations of the EU member states to report on the quality of marine, coastal and inland waters for the EU Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Further applications include CO2 sequestration, carbon cycle and climate, fisheries and aquaculture management, near-real-time alerting to harmful algae blooms, environmental monitoring and forecasting, and assessment of sediment transport in coastal waters. Ocean colour data from polar-orbiting satellite platforms, however, suffer from fractional coverage, primarily due to clouds, and inadequate resolution of quickly varying processes. Ocean colour remote sensing from geostationary platforms can provide significant improvements in coverage and sampling frequency and support new applications and services. EUMETSAT's SEVIRI instrument on the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation platforms (MSG) is not designed to meet ocean colour mission requirements, however, it has been demonstrated to provide valuable contribution, particularly in combination with dedicated ocean colour polar observations. This paper describes the ongoing effort to develop operational ocean colour water turbidity and related products and user services from SEVIRI. SEVIRI's multi-temporal capabilities can benefit users requiring improved local-area coverage and frequent diurnal observations. A survey of user requirements and a study of technical capabilities and limitations of the SEVIRI instruments are the basis for this development and are described in this paper. The products will support monitoring of sediment transport, water clarity, and tidal dynamics by providing hourly coverage and long-term time series of the diurnal observations.

Information on wood quality and timber assortments is essential for wood valuation and procurement planning as varying wood dimensions and qualities may be utilized and refined in different places, including sawmills, plywood mills, pulp mills, heating plants or combined heat and power plants. We investigate here alternative approaches for generating detailed timber assortments for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula spp.) from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial images, harvester data and field data. For this purpose, we used 665 circular plots, and logging recovery information recorded from 249 clear-cut stands using cut-to-length harvesters. We estimated timber assortment volumes, economic values and wood paying capabilities (WPC) for each stand in different bucking scenarios, and used the resulting timber assortment estimates to assess logging recoveries. The bucking scenarios were (1) bucking-to-value using maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality (theoretical maximum), and (2) bucking-to-value using sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals for Norway spruce and Scots pine and veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m for birch, either excluding quality (the usual business practice) or including quality (a novel business practice). The results showed that our procedure can assist in locating stands that are likely to be more valuable and have the desired timber assortment distributions. We conclude that the method can estimate WPC with root mean square errors of 28.7\%, 66.0\% and 45.7\% in Norway spruce, Scots pine and birch, respectively, for sawlogs and 19.3\%, 63.7\% and 29.5\% for pulpwood.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/f12091221","{""notes"": ""('sanz_integratingdetailedtimberassortments_2021',)""}","{}",2024-09-30 21:37:15,"included",NA,NA

Pacific Coast","Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally, FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog, its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year (2000-2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months (June-September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average r(2) of 0.82 and p-value of < 0.01. This strong relationship demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California. This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC data for all summer months for the years 2000-2020.

7038232,"A Global Vision For Monitoring Ecosystem Services With Satellite Sensors","Ecosystem services can be defined as “an activity or function of an ecosystem that provides benefit (or occasionally detriment) to humans” (Mace et al. 2012; see also Burkhard et al. 2012; Crossman et al. 2012). Repeated efforts have been made to quantify, value, map, monitor, and analyze the various ecosystem service components that sustain human well-being: from the early attempts of Costanza et al. (1997) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005) to the more recent integrative initiatives of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2013) and the Global System for Monitoring Ecosystem Service Change (Tallis et al. 2012; GEO BON ES 2013). The latter initiatives join more than 50 international organizations and 80 governmental representations under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations in order to develop the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Their aim is to compile extensive and standard monitoring of multiple services to allow policymakers and scientists to explore, better understand, and prioritize trade-offs across socioecological settings and scales (from the national to the global level). The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) identified four main sources of data: national statistics, field-based observations, remote sensing, and numerical simulation models (Tallis et al. 2012). Of these, remote sensing offers the potential to use the same standard protocols from local to global scales and through time, which is essential for long-term monitoring and for trade-off assessment across regions. Satellite-based earth observation is probably the most economically feasible means to systematically retrieve global information with high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution over large areas (Ayanu et al. 2012). Decline in the cost involved in obtaining such data and increase in the computational power of higher resolution sensors to cope with larger data sets will maximize this advantage (Kreuter et al. 2001). © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1201/b15628","{""notes"": ""('alcarazsegura_globalvisionmonitoringecosystem_2013',)""}","{}",2024-10-28 00:29:03,"included",NA,NA
6862950,"Determining The Optimal Phenological Stage For Predicting Common Dry Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris) Yield Using Field Spectroscopy","On-farm crop productivity and yield prediction are valuable for, among others, designing food policies, on-farm and after-farm planning and pricing, and marketing. Whereas existing prediction approaches are generally reliable, these require extensive and tedious field surveys and adequate ancillary agrometeorological data. Remote sensing offers great potential for quick and reliable means of predicting crop yield, but it necessitates establishment of optimal phenological and spectral bands. Given the socio-economic value of common dry bean, we sought to determine the potential of multi-temporal ground-based hyperspectral data to predict yield of three cultivars grown under irrigated and rain-fed regimes. Canopy-level hyperspectral data were collected from the Gadra, Ukulinga and Caledon cultivars at distinct phenological stages and sparse partial least squares regression was used for spectral analysis. Results indicated that variation in yield could be explained at specific growth stages under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. With the exception of the Gadra cultivar under irrigation, models developed with data at the flowering and pod development stage were more accurate. These findings highlight the potential of temporal phenological ground-based hyperspectral data in predicting common dry bean yield under different watering regimes. The findings provide an opportunity for large-scale yield prediction using airborne or space-borne hyperspectral sensors. © 2017 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.",2017,"{""Abdel-Rahman, E."",""Mutanga, O."",""Odindi, J."",""Rajah, P.""}","jour",NA,"10.1080/02571862.2017.1317854","{""notes"": ""('rajah_determiningoptimalphenologicalstage_2017',)""}","{maybe}",2024-09-30 17:30:07,"included",NA,NA

We found that pXRF spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models can predict sand, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), silt contents, and clay with validation R-2 of 0.81, 0.74, 0.73, 0.68, and 0.64 at the pedon scale but performed less well for soil pH (R-2 = 0.51). A combination of EMI, Sentinel-2, and DEM data showed promise in mapping sand, silt contents, and TN at two depths and Ap horizon thickness and soil depth across the field. A clustering analysis using combinations of mapped soil properties or proximal and remote sensing data suggested that data fusion improved the characterization of field-scale variability of soil properties. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the most accurate management zones (MZs) for topsoil can be generated only using estimated soil property maps while it was the most costly as compared to other data sources. For an intermediate-high (for topsoil) and high (subsoil) accuracy and a moderate economic budget, the combination of sensors (proximal + remote sensing + DEM) might be a better approach for effective MZs generation than collecting soil samples for laboratory analysis while the latter produced the most accurate maps for topsoil. It can be concluded that pXRF spectra can be useful for predicting key soil properties (e.g., sand, TN, OC, silt, clay) at different soil depths, and a combination of proximal and remote sensing provides an effective way to delineate soil MZs that are useful for decision-making.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.catena.2021.105190","{""notes"": ""('chatterjee_characterizationfieldscalesoil_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 22:56:09,"included",NA,NA

7036650,"A Call For An Aloft Air Quality Monitoring Network: Need, Feasibility, And Potential Value","Changing precursor emission patterns in conjunction with stringent health protective air quality standards necessitate accurate quantification of nonlocal contributions to ozone pollution at a location due to atmospheric transport, that by nature predominantly occurs aloft nocturnally. Concerted efforts to characterize ozone aloft on a continuous basis to quantify its contribution to ground-level concentrations, however, are lacking. By applying our classical understanding of air pollution dynamics to analyze variations in widespread surface-level ozone measurements, in conjunction with process-based interpretation from a comprehensive air pollution modeling system and detailed backward-sensitivity calculations that quantitatively link surface-level and aloft pollution, we show that accurate quantification of the amount of ozone in the air entrained from aloft every morning as the atmospheric boundary layer grows is the key missing component for characterizing background pollution at a location, and we propose a cost-effective continuous aloft ozone measurement strategy to address critical scientific gaps in current air quality management. Continuous aloft air pollution measurements can be achieved cost-effectively through leveraging advances in sensor technology and proliferation of tall telecommunications masts. Resultant improvements in ozone distribution characterization at 400-500 m altitude are estimated to be 3-4 times more effective in characterizing the surface-level daily maximum 8-h average ozone (DM8O(3)) than improvements from surface measurements since they directly quantify the amount of pollution imported to a location and furnish key missing information on processes and sources regulating background ozone and its modulation of ground-level concentrations. Since >80\% of the DM8O(3) sensitivity to tropospheric ozone is potentially captured through measurements between 200 and 1200 m altitude (a possible design goal for future remote sensing instrumentation), their assimilation will dramatically improve air quality forecast and health advisories.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1021/acs.est.8b02496","{""notes"": ""('mathur_callaloftairquality_2018',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 02:29:02,"included",NA,NA
7038014,"Map-Based Site-Specific Seeding Of Consumption Potato Production Using High-Resolution Soil And Crop Data Fusion","Maximizing potato productivity and economic return calls for a proper seeding technology that is capable to manage in-field soil variability by optimizing the input seed densities. Current study evaluates the agronomic and economic potential of site-specific seeding (SSS) of consumable potato in comparison with uniform rate seeding (URS) approach. Two treatments of map-based SSS were tested in two study sites i.e., Dal (5.5 ha) and Bottelare (5.4 ha) in Belgium. In the first treatment, soil apparent electrical conductivity measured with an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor (EMI-SSS) was used as the management zone proxy data, and in the second treatment, soil fertility attributes measured with an on-line visible and near-infrared spectroscopy were fused with Sentinel-2 retrieved normalized difference vegetation index (VNIRS-SSS). In-row seed-to-seed distances were varied by 29, 31, 36, 40, 43 cm for Dal, and 25, 31, 36, 43, 47 cm for Bottelare following the prescription rule of sowing more seeds to the more fertile zones and vice-versa, whereas 36 cm seeding interval was applied for the control URS treatment. Yield analysis indicated that the SSS improved tuber yields, saved seed costs, and accordingly increased net economic return compared to the URS. The highest yield was harvested in Dal field for VNIRS-SSS (59.13 t/ha), followed by EMI-SSS (58.39 t/ha) and URS (56.16 t/ha). The VNIRS-SSS also produced higher yield (16.75 t/ha) at Bottelare site than EMI-SSS (16.49 t/ha) and URS (13.70 t/ha). The net profit of the SSS treatments was 5.35 to 56.0\% higher than that of the URS treatment. The VNIRS-SSS treatment produced the highest net return (380.27 (sic)/ha) for Dal, while EMI-SSS resulted in the highest net return (447.67 (sic)/ha) for Bottelare. Therefore, regardless of the type of data/sensor used, map-based SSS is recommended for improving the production of consumption potato and increasing net economic margin.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.compag.2020.105752","{""notes"": ""('munnaf_mapbasedsitespecific_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-25 01:10:34,"included",NA,NA

With a focus on landslide detection, this work reaffirms the capability of wireless sensor networks for disaster mitigation. A complete functional system consisting of 50 geological sensors and 20 wireless sensor nodes was deployed in Idukki, a district in the southwestern region of Kerala State, India, a highly landslide prone area. The wireless sensor network system has, for the past three years, gathered vast amounts of data such as correlated sensor data values on rainfall, moisture, pore pressure and movement, along with other geological, hydrological and soil properties, helping to provide a better understanding of the landslide scenario. Using the wireless sensor networks, system was developed an innovative three level landslide warning system (Early, Intermediate and Imminent). This system has proven its validity by delivering a real warning to the local community during heavy rains in the July 2009 monsoon season. The implementation of this system uses novel data aggregation methods for power optimization in the field deployment.

7037971,"Measuring Conservation Value At Fine And Broad Scales: Implications For A Diverse And Fragmented Region, The Agulhas Plain","This study explores the implications of spatial scale for conservation planning in the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Regional planning relies on broad-scale data but fine-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level. This study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for fine-scale implementation. Two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using C-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning. The first conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large-planning units defined by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha). The second system was identified at a finer scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the field), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha). Using classification trees, this study compared reserve-design efficiency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns,of conservation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales. A similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identified using minimum set analysis) at the broad and fine scale. There was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of fine-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan. However, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the fine scale. The use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a fine scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape. The implications of moving from broad- to fine-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective benefits are discussed. Maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and fine-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.

6863293,"Dynamic Partitioning Of Tropical Indian Ocean Surface Waters Using Ocean Colour Data - Management And Modelling Applications","Over the past few decades, partitioning of the surface ocean into ecologically-meaningful spatial domains has been approached using a range of data types, with the aim of improving our understanding of open ocean processes, supporting marine management decisions and constraining coupled ocean-biogeochemical models. The simplest partitioning method, which could provide low-latency information for managers at low cost, remains a purely optical classification based on ocean colour remote sensing. The question is whether such a simple approach has value. Here, the efficacy of optical classifications in constraining physical variables that modulate the epipelagic environment is tested for the tropical Indian Ocean, with a focus on the Chagos marine protected area (MPA). Using remote sensing data, it was found that optical classes corresponded to distinctive ranges of wind speed, wind stress curl, sea surface temperature, sea surface slope, sea surface height anomaly and geostrophic currents (Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Tukey honestly significantly different tests, alpha = 0.01). Between-class differences were significant for a set of sub-domains that resolved zonal and meridional gradients across the MPA and Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge, whereas between-domain differences were only significant for the north-south gradient (PERMANOVA, alpha = 0.01). A preliminary test of between-class differences in surface CO2 concentrations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 demonstrated a small decrease in mean pCO(2) with increasing chlorophyll (chl), from 418 to 398 ppm. Simple optical class maps therefore provide an overview of growth conditions, the spatial distribution of resources - from which habitat fragmentation metrics can be calculated, and carbon sequestration potential. Within the 17 year study period, biotic variables were found to have decreased at up to 0.025\%a(-1) for all optical classes, which is slower than reported elsewhere (Mann-Kendall-Sen regression, alpha = 0.01). Within the MPA, positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions and negative Southern Oscillation Indices were weakly associated with decreasing chl, fluorescence line height (FLH), eddy kinetic energy, easterly wind stress and wind stress curl, and with increasing FLH/chl, sea surface temperature, SSH gradients and northerly wind stress, consistent with reduced surface mixing and increased stratification. The optical partitioning scheme described here can be applied in Google Earth Engine to support management decisions at daily or monthly scales, and potential applications are discussed.",2020,"{""Schwarz, Jill N.""}","article",NA,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111308","{""notes"": ""('schwarz_dynamicpartitioningtropicalindian_2020',)""}","{maybe}",2024-07-18 21:10:04,"included",NA,NA
7037252,"An Evaluation Of Remote Sensing Derived Soil Ph And Average Spring Groundwater Table For Ecological Assessments","Ecological assessments such as species distribution modelling and benchmarking site quality towards regulations often rely on full spatial coverage information of site factors such as soil acidity, moisture regime or nutrient availability. To determine if remote sensing (RS) is a viable alternative to traditional data sources of site factor estimates, we analysed the accuracy (using ground truth validation measurements) of traditional and RS sources of pH and mean spring groundwater level (MSL, in m) estimates. Traditional sources were a soil map and hydrological model. RS estimates were obtained using vegetation indicator values (IVs) from a Dutch national system as an intermediate between site factors and spectral response. IVs relate to those site factors that dictate vegetation occurrence, whilst also providing a robust link to canopy spectra. For pH, the soil map and the RS estimate were nearly as accurate. For MSL, the RS estimates were much closer to the observed groundwater levels than the hydrological model, but the error margin of the estimates still exceeded the tolerance range of moisture sensitive vegetation. The relatively high accuracy of the RS estimates was made possible by the availability of local calibration points and large environmental gradients in the study site. In addition, the error composition of the RS estimates could be analysed step-by-step, whereas the traditional sources had to be accepted 'as-is'. Also considering that RS offers high spatial and temporal resolution at low costs, RS offered advantages over traditional sources. This will likely hold true for any other situation where prerequisites of accurate RS estimates have been met. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, in the remote sensing field, the large size of discovered information makes it hard to manually look for interesting information quickly and easily. The purpose of this paper is to automate the process of identifying interesting spatiotemporal knowledge (expressed as rules). Design/methodology/approach: The proposed approach is based on case-based reasoning (CBR) process. CBR allows the recognition of useful and interesting rules by simulating a human reasoning process, and combining objective and subjective interestingness measures. It takes advantage of statistics' power from objective criteria and the reliability of subjective criteria. This helps improve the discovery of interesting rules by taking into consideration the different properties of interestingness measures. Findings: The proposed approach combines several interestingness measures with complementary properties to improve the detection of the interesting rules. Based on a CBR process, it, also, offers three main advantages to users in a remote sensing field: automatism, integration of the users' expectations and combination of several interestingness measures while taking into account the reliability of each one. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared to other approaches using several real-world datasets.

The purpose of this study is to accurately measure CO2 emissions at the city scale in China and examine the environmental Kuznets curve, thereby providing a reference for decision-making. Corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data were used to accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions at the provincial and city scales in China. Then, based on the STRIPAT model, 291 cities in China were used to verify the environmental Kuznets curve. Our results show that on the provincial scale, the R-2 between the estimated value and the statistical value of carbon dioxide reaches 0.85. Western cities in China emit more CO2, as do economically developed cities and industry- and mining-dominated cities. There are two CO2 emission hot spots in the north and one cold spot in the south. It was found that the environmental Kuznets curve on the city scale exists. This study has practical value in utilizing NPP-VIIRS data for the estimation of city CO2 emissions. The results also have academic value for determining factors that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions and can provide a reference for relevant decision makers.

6863672,"Combining Passive Acoustics And Environmental Data For Scaling Up Ecosystem Monitoring: A Test On Coral Reef Fishes","Ecological surveys of coral reefs mostly rely on visual data collected by human observers. Although new monitoring tools are emerging, their specific advantages should be identified to optimise their simultaneous use. Based on the goodness-of-fit of linear models, we compared the potential of passive acoustics and environmental data for predicting the structure of coral reef fish assemblages in different environmental and biogeographic settings. Both data types complemented each other. Globally, the acoustic data showed relatively low added value in predicting fish assemblage structures. The predictions were best for the distribution of fish abundance among functional entities (i.e., proxies for fish functional groups, grouping species that share similar eco-morphological traits), for the simplest functional entities (i.e., combining two eco-morphological traits), and when considering diet and the level in the water column of the species. Our study demonstrates that Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) improves fish assemblage assessment when used in tandem with environmental data compared to using environmental data alone. Such combinations can help with responding to the current conservation challenge by improving our surveying capacities at increased spatial and temporal scales, facilitating the identification and monitoring of priority management areas.",2022,"{""Bruggemann, J.

6903550,"Catching ""Butterflies"" In The Morning: A New Methodology For Rapid Detection Of Aerially Deployed Plastic Land Mines From Uavs","It is estimated that there are at least 100 million military munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) devices in the world of various size, shape, and composition. Millions of these are surface plastic land mines with low-pressure detonation regimes, such as the mass-produced Soviet PFM-1. These aerially deployed land mines are concentrated primarily in postconflict developing countries such as Afghanistan and represent a continued humanitarian threat, while also thwarting economic and social development in impacted regions. Identification of this particular type of MEC category poses a significant geophysical challenge, as these mines contain almost no metal (nonferrous aluminum). As a result, standard MEC detection and remediation methodologies based on geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic induction prove largely ineffective and possibly dangerous. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles can rapidly collect large remotely sensed data sets with no risk to MEC technicians. We present results of an experiment focused on remotely assessing thermal signatures of plastic land mines relative to background geology to show that this type of analysis permits rapid detection of randomly dispersed plastic MECs with a high degree of accuracy and low associated costs. © 2018 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1190/tle37050367.1","{""notes"": ""('desmet_catchingbutterfliesmorningmethodology_2018',)""}","{}",2024-10-03 22:21:04,"included",NA,NA
7037949,"Development Of A Multi-Spatial Resolution Approach To The Surveillance Of Active Fire Lines Using Himawari-8","Satellite remote sensing is regularly used for wildfire detection, fire severity mapping and burnt area mapping. Applications in the surveillance of wildfire using geostationary-based sensors have been limited by low spatial resolutions. With the launch in 2015 of the AHI (Advanced Himawari Imaginer) sensor on board Himawari-8, ten-minute interval imagery is available covering an entire earth hemisphere across East Asia and Australasia. Existing active fire detection algorithms depend on middle infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) channels to detect fire. Even though sub-pixel fire detection algorithms can detect much smaller fires, the location of the fire within the AHI 2 x 2 km (400 ha) MIR/TIR pixel is unknown. This limits the application of AHI as a wildfire surveillance and tracking sensor. A new multi-spatial resolution approach is presented in this paper that utilizes the available medium resolution channels in AHI. The proposed algorithm is able to map firelines at a 500 m resolution. This is achieved using near infrared (NIR) (1 km) and RED (500 m) data to detect burnt area and smoke within the flagged MIR (2 km) pixel. Initial results based on three case studies carried out in Western Australia shows that the algorithm was able to continuously track fires during the day at 500 m resolution. The results also demonstrate the utility for wildfire management activities.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs8110932","{""notes"": ""('wickramasinghe_developmentmultispatialresolution_2016',)""}","{}",2024-11-19 19:54:54,"included",NA,NA
7038336,"Use Of Noaa-Avhrr Ndvi Images For The Estimation Of Dynamic Fire Risk In Mediterranean Areas","Wildfires are a major cause of land degradation in the Mediterranean region due to their frequent recurrence in the same areas. The evaluation of fire risk is therefore of high practical importance, particularly during the summer arid season, when fires are most frequent and harmful. Recent studies have demonstrated that the evaluation of dynamic fire risk can be carried out by the use of remotely sensed images, and specifically of NOAA-AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. This use relies on the sensitivity of the index to vegetation dryness, which is a major predisposing factor for fire occurrence. Several problems, however, remain linked to the spatial variability of the risk in environmentally heterogeneous areas, which requires the application of suitable processing techniques to the low-resolution imagery. The current work reports on the development and testing of different methodologies for estimating dynamic fire risk by the use of NOAA-AVHRR data. The investigation was conducted in Tuscany (Central Italy) using a large archive of fires that occurred in the region and NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data of 16 years (1985-2000). Relying on previous methodological achievements of our group and other research groups, several procedures were tested to extract information related to fire risk from the remotely sensed images. These trials led to define an optimum method which is based on the identification of pixels where the accordance between interyear variations in fire probabilities and NDVI values is maximum. The accuracy of the risk estimates from this optimum method was finally evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. In this way, the performance of the methodology was assessed, together with its potential for operational fire risk monitoring and forecasting in Mediterranean areas. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

ASPEN is a dynamic tool that rapidly assesses the benefit and cost effectiveness of environmental data obtained from any set of observing systems, whether ground-based or space-based, whether an individual sensor or a collection of sensors. The ASPEN assessed cost effectiveness accounts for the level of ability to measure the environment, the cost(s) associated with acquiring these measurements, and the degree of usefulness of these measurements to users and applications. It computes both the use benefit, measured as a requirements-satisfaction metric, and the cost effectiveness (equal to the benefit-to-cost ratio). ASPEN provides a uniform interface to compare the performance of different observing systems and to capture the requirements and priorities of applications. This interface describes the environment in terms of geophysical observables and their attributes. A prototype implementation of ASPEN is described and demonstrated in this study to assess the benefits of several observing systems for a range of applications. ASPEN could be extended to other types of studies, such as assessing the cost effectiveness of commercial data to applications in all the NOAA mission service areas, and ultimately to societal application areas, and thereby become a valuable addition to the observing systems assessment toolbox.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/bams-d-22-0004.1","{""notes"": ""('boukabara_optimizingobservingsystemsaspen_2022',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:23:34,"included",NA,NA
6691547,"Assessing the full effects of public investment in space","Many space-related impact studies have been carried out in the past, but there is no conclusive, comprehensive evaluation of the economic and social effects of public investments in space. Such evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in official statistics; social benefits, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts from R&D are complex and occur in the long term. However, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts. The full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a ""bottom-up"" and a ""top-down"" perspective. In the bottom-up perspective, each effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the effects. Although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields both detailed and integrated results. Our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts. Next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identified, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies. Finally, suggestions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard. The core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost benefit analysis. Effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values. For effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion. Our core recommendations are to clearly define the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies. Social, strategic and environmental impacts deserve special attention, aiming at a more comprehensive coverage of impacts.

6903568,"Do Big Unstructured Biodiversity Data Mean More Knowledge?","Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of ""big unstructured data"" for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on ""big data."" Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritize data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs. standardized data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: (1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardized long-termspecies population studies; (2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and (3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2018.00239","{""notes"": ""('bayraktarov_unstructuredbiodiversitydataknowledge_2019',)""}","{interesting,maybe}",2024-09-26 01:00:35,"included",NA,NA

Farms and ranches are large, so many of precision agriculture's early adopters reside in the region. Crop yield maps at season's end reveal sizable variations across fields. Farm management relying upon uniform chemical applications is ineffective and wasteful. We provided information about crop and range status in near-real-time, so that in-season decisions could be made to optimize final yields and minimize environmental degradation. We created learning communities, in which information is shared among scientists, farmers, ranchers, and data providers. The new information for agricultural producers was satellite and aerial imagery. Value-added information was derived from ETM+, AVHRR, IKONOS, and MODIS sensors. The emphasis was on reducing the time between acquisition of data by a satellite and delivery of value-added products to farmers and ranchers. To distribute large spatial data sets in short times to rural users we relied upon satellite transmission (Direct PC). Results include: (1) management zone delineation, (2) variable-rate fertilizer applications, (3) weed detection, (4) irrigation efficiency determination, (5) detection of insect infestation, (6) specification of crop damage due to inadvertent chemical application, and (7) determination of livestock carrying capacities on rangelands.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1117/12.454211","{""notes"": ""('seielstad_applicationsremotesensingprecision_2002',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 00:17:09,"included",NA,NA

The benchmark values for the assessment are gauge-observed data gathered without missing precipitation data at nine ground-based measuring stations over the basin. The results indicate that the TRMM and CCS-CDR satellites provide more robust precipitation estimations in 75\% of high-altitude stations at daily, monthly, and annual time scales. Furthermore, the comparative analysis reveals some precipitation underestimations for each satellite. The underestimation values obtained by TRMM CDR, CCS-CDR, and CFSR are 8.93 mm, 20.34 mm, 9.77 mm, and 17.23 mm annually, respectively.

6863347,"Competition And Burn Severity Determine Post-Fire Sapling Recovery In A Nationally Protected Boreal Forest Of China: An Analysis From Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery","Anticipating how boreal forest landscapes will change in response to changing fire regime requires disentangling the effects of various spatial controls on the recovery process of tree saplings. Spatially explicit monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery through moderate resolution Landsat imagery is a popular technique but is filled with ambiguous information due to mixed pixel effects. On the other hand, very-high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery accurately measures crown size of tree saplings but has gained little attention and its utility for estimating leaf area index (LAI, m2/m2) and tree sapling abundance (TSA, seedlings/ha) in post-fire landscape remains untested. We compared the explanatory power of 30 m Landsat satellite imagery with 0.5-m WorldView-2 VHR imagery for LAI and TSA based on field sampling data, and subsequently mapped the distribution of LAI and TSA based on the most predictive relationships. A random forest (RF) model was applied to assess the relative importance and causal mechanisms of spatial controls on tree sapling recovery. The results showed that pixel percentage of canopy trees (PPCT) derived from VHR imagery outperform all Landsat-derived spectral indices for explaining variance of LAI (R2VHR = 0.676 vs. R2Landsat = 0.427) and TSA (R2VHR = 0.508 vs. R2Landsat = 0.499). The RF model explained an average of 55.5% (SD = 3.0%, MSE = 0.382, N = 50) of the variation of estimated LAI. Understory vegetation coverage (competition) and post-fire surviving mature trees (seed sources) were the most important spatial controls for LAI recovery, followed by burn severity (legacy effect), topographic factors (environmental filter) and nearest distance to unburned area (edge effect). These analyses allow us to conclude that in our study area, mitigating wildfire severity and size may increase forest resilience to wildfire damage. Given the easily-damaged seed banks and relatively short seed dispersal distance of coniferous trees, reasonable human help to natural recovery of coniferous forests is necessary for severe burns with a large patch size, particularly in certain areas. Our research shows the VHR WorldView-2 imagery better resolves key characteristics of forest landscapes like LAI and TSA than Landsat imagery, providing a valuable tool for land managers and researchers alike. © 2019 by the authors.

6863341,"National Forest Carbon Inventories: Policy Needs And Assessment Capacity","Previous research has identified the importance of the role of land cover in the global carbon cycle. In particular, forests have been identified as a significant carbon sink that can mitigate the rate of global climate change. Policy makers are faced with complex and difficult challenges in getting timely and useful information in monitoring global forest resources. Recent advances in the tools and methods of forest carbon accounting have produced new, innovative approaches to forest-based carbon inventories. But it is important as new tools are developed that scientists understand the needs of policy makers and that policy makers understand the capabilities and limitations of forest inventory methods. This paper explores four different policy applications that rely, or could benefit from, national carbon inventories. The goal is to help build a bridge between the communities of climate policy makers and scientists specialized in forest carbon inventories. To this end, we pursue three specific objectives: First we provide an overview for policy makers about approaches to forest carbon inventories, paying particular attention to the contributions of remote sensing technologies. Second, we outline the issues particularly relevant to forest inventory scientists who are interested in responding to public policy needs. We then discuss the tradeoffs between information cost, accuracy, precision, transparency and timeliness that need to be balanced in long-term monitoring of forest carbon. Finally, the article concludes with a series of observations and recommendations for the implementation of forest carbon inventories as increasingly central components of global climate change policy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2009,"{""Andersson, K."",""Evans, T.

6903604,"Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Prediction And Satellite Data For Forecasting Us Maize Yield","Seasonal agricultural production forecasting is essential for agricultural supply chain and economic prediction. However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble. (3) Using the ""T + P + VPD + EVI"" model with climate prediction from bias-corrected climate prediction from CFSv2 outperformed the yield forecast in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates reports released by the United States Department of Agriculture, with root-mean-square error of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79\% of multiyear averaged yield) by early August. Plain Language Summary Given the significant advances in both seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing, these data have not been fully used in crop yield forecasting at regional scale, and their benefits are to be quantified compared to survey-based approaches. Here we evaluated the benefits of using seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing data in forecasting U.S. maize yield at both national and county levels. To achieve this goal, we built a seasonal forecasting system for U.S. maize yield by bridging the most advanced seasonal climate prediction products from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) with a statistical crop modeling framework. We found we could not achieve a better forecasting performance than the official survey-based forecast from United States Department of Agriculture until we used both climate and remote sensing observations in our model. Compared with using historical climate information for the unknown future in each growing season, using climate prediction from NCEP gave better forecasting performance once we corrected the bias in the seasonal climate prediction products. Using our climate-remote sensing combined model and bias-corrected climate prediction from NCEP, we achieved a better forecasting performance than the United States Department of Agriculture forecast.

The aim was to understand the spatio-temporal behaviour of subfield areas identified by the K-means algorithm from NDVI maps obtained from satellite images and the ground yield data variability to increase the efficiency of delimiting management zones in an organic farming system. Experiments were conducted on a surface of 29 ha. NDVI time series derived from Sentinel-2 images and k-means algorithm for rapidly delineating the sunflower subfield areas were used. The crop achene yields in the whole field ranged from 1.3 to 3.77 t ha-1 with a significant within-field spatial variability. The cluster analysis of hand-sampled data showed three subfields with achene yield mean values of 3.54 t ha-1 (cluster 1), 2.98 t ha-1 (cluster 2), and 2.07 t ha-1 (Cluster 3). In the cluster analysis of NDVI data, the k-means algorithm has early delineated the subfield crop spatial and temporal yield variability. The best period for identifying subfield areas starts from the inflorescences development stage to the development of the fruit stage. Analyzing the NDVI subfield areas and yield data, it was found that cluster 1 covers an area of 42.4\% of the total surface and 50\% of the total achene yield; cluster 2 covers 35\% of both surface and yield. Instead, the surface of cluster 3 covers 22.2\% of the total surface with 15\% of achene yield. K-means algorithm derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI images delineates the sunflower subfield areas.

Although there are no substantive figures for desirable levels of green spaces in urban areas for the benefit of inhabitants, the paper proposes minimum desirable areal percentages. The paper defines natural capital and ES and the procedures adopted by researchers in balancing the supply and demand for ES for urban areas.

7037708,"Use Of Social Networks For Outreach, Education And Training On Space Applications: Know-How And Experience Of Planete Sciences Midi-Pyrenees And Cnes","Using space technologies and activities for outreach activities, education and training purposes have been developed in France since the creation of CNES in 1962, with one main partner: Planete Sciences. Beyond the development of technological activities and projects (experimental rockets, satellites, and stratospheric balloons), the increasing interest for space applications and services in the daily life (GMES and environment, Galileo, Climate Change, etc.) adds a new dimension to outreach activities. In this context, the social networks have become essential components of the communication on Internet. Acknowledging that the development of social media is a disruption in communication, CNES and Planete Sciences Midi-Pyrenees have integrated these tools in their outreach strategy and experiment what can be done in the space sector with these new tools and evaluate their potential benefits and specific role: blogs and social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) can be considered as a ""market place"", in order to target a new audience, in particular young people. Focusing on earth observation and attractive education tools, Planete Sciences Midi-Pyrenees created the blog ""Un autre regard sur la Terre"" in 2010. CNES included the social networks in its communication strategy since 2008. 4 years of experience allow a first evaluation of the results and the impact. The two complementary approaches show that social media provides a very powerful support for communication and outreach activities during the major space events but can also enable in-depth and educative activities. The powerful dimension of the image is a very strong factor. One main challenge is to go beyond the event itself and to disseminate background messages or in-depth information, with the objective to transform the initial interest raised by social media in a long lasting curiosity or in an involvement in other type of activities, including the practice of hands-on activities by teachers in the classroom. Additional issues and risks related to the use of social media have been identified. - The fact that a longer experience is needed in order to perform a more comprehensive evaluation. - The issue of the ""reaction speed"" and the control of the value of the information by professional organisations. - The issues raised by the use of social networks by employees. - The management of the e-reputation. A last recommendation is related to the resources and manpower needed to animate, drive and develop an online community and manage the social media. This activity requires also a very good knowledge of space activities and shall involve skilled people and experts. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

7038102,"Translation Of Remote Sensing Data Into Weed Management Decisions","Remote sensing and associated spatial technologies provide tremendous opportunity to enhance weed management and improve-protect the environment through judicious use of the most efficacious control methods for a given site. They can also be invaluable assets for detection of invasions, assessment of infestation levels, monitoring rate of spread, and determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts for weed management. In combination with other technologies such as global positioning systems and geographic information systems, sampling strategies can be devised to efficiently determine the location of weed populations in agricultural and wildland situations. Maps created from remote sensing or sampling (or both) allow site-specific weed management of only the areas requiring corrective action. Potential benefits to the land managers and the ecosystem as a whole will come from reductions in inputs, reduced environmental liability from the detrimental effects of applying control measures to entire areas, crop yield increases through better management decisions, and early detection and effective management of invading species. Improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, temporal frequency, image turnaround time, and cost of image acquisition, combined with the realization of the value of the data, are enhancing the acceptance and usage of remote sensing technologies. However, remote sensing will be best used by providing accurate, site-specific data that can be converted into information used by decision support systems (DSSs). Advances in these DSSs, and their ability to incorporate remote sensing data, have been rapid and widespread in the past 10 yr. As a result, federal management and research agencies, academic institutions, and private entities have collectively developed efforts to use this information in monitoring and management efforts for invasive species in western rangelands, aquatic ecosystems and forestry, and site-specific weed management in agronomics.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1614/ws-04-072r1","{""notes"": ""('shaw_translationremotesensingdata_2005',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:37:38,"included",NA,NA

7036816,"Overview And Applications Of The New York State Mesonet Profiler Network","Vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, moisture, wind, and aerosols are essential information for weather monitoring and prediction. Their availability, however, is limited in space and time because of the significant resources required to observe them. To fill this gap, the New York State Mesonet (NYSM) Profiler Network has been deployed as a national testbed to facilitate the research, development, and evaluation of ground-based profiling technologies and applications. The testbed comprises 17 profiler stations across the state, forming a long-term regional observational network. Each profiler station comprises a ground-based Doppler lidar, a microwave radiometer (MWR), and an environmental Sky Imager-Radiometer (eSIR). Thermodynamic profiles (temperature and humidity) from the MWR, wind and aerosol profiles from the Doppler lidar, and solar radiance and optical depth parameters from the eSIR are collected, processed, disseminated, and archived every 10 min. This paper introduces the NYSM Profiler Network and reviews the network design and siting, instrumentation, network operations and maintenance, data and products, and some example applications that highlight the benefits of the network. Some sample applications include improved situational awareness and monitoring of the sea-land breeze, long-range wildfire smoke transport, air quality (PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth) and boundary layer height. Ground-based profiling systems promise a path forward for filling a critical gap in the U.S. observing system with the potential to improve analysis and prediction for many weather-sensitive sectors, such as aviation, ground transportation, health, and wind energy.Significance StatementThe New York State Mesonet (NYSM) Profiler Network enables routine measurement of aboveground weather data and products to monitor weather and air quality across the state at high resolutions. The NYSM Profiler Network provides real-time vertical profile information to users across the emergency management, aviation, utility, and public health sectors, including NOAA and NASA, for operations and research, filling a critical gap in monitoring the low-level atmosphere. These data have been used to improve situational awareness and monitor boundary layer dynamics, sea-land breeze development, precipitation type, and air quality. Most important, the NYSM Profiler Network provides a national testbed for the creation and evaluation of new ground-based profiling instrumentation and products.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1175/jamc-d-21-0104.1","{""notes"": ""('shrestha_overviewapplicationsyorkmesonet_2021',)""}","{}",2024-11-22 18:08:31,"included",NA,NA

7037733,"Empowering The Rural Poor Through Eo Products And Services - An Impact Assessment","With the advent of technology in the form of space-based imaging, network-based computation and information technology, the focus has shifted to how these technologies could change the livelihoods of rural community and put them on the path of developmental processes. Many rural villages in India do not have right kind of infrastructure and connectivity, which makes it difficult for any developmental program to perform successfully, This makes them more vulnerable and further cut off from the mainstream developmental programs in the country. There are large tracts of and and semi-arid lands in many parts of the country, which requires scientific inputs and improved farming practices for sustenance of poor communities under tough conditions. Unless some simple and cost-effective methods are evolved and taken to the field level, it is difficult to see positive developments in such areas and stop people from migrating to different areas for livelihood options. Integrated watershed development program with innovative practices and holistic approach could bring about positive changes in such poverty stricken areas that host vulnerable groups who experience the hardship due to poor local natural resources conditions and living standards. An optimal combination of space technology and information technology has been successfully used, through participatory methods, to empower the rural poor in realizing better livelihood possibilities. An attempt is made in this paper to find solutions for such problematic areas with some innovative tools and techniques that involve user-friendly delivery of EO products and services for the benefit of the rural community and help them in decision making at local level.

7036922,"Willingness To Pay For An Early Warning System For Infectious Diseases","Early warning systems for infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks are designed with the aim of increasing the health safety of citizens. As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people’s willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was €21.80 (median €10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80–90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks. However, our results have to be interpreted in light of the usual drawbacks of willingness to pay experiments. © 2020, The Author(s).",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s10198-020-01171-2","{""notes"": ""('himmler_willingnesspaywarningsystem_2020',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:30:56,"included",NA,NA
7038430,"Evaluation Of The Trmm Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis And Its Applicability In Supporting Reservoir Operation And Water Resources Management In Hanjiang Basin, China","In this study, we first evaluated a satellite-based precipitation product (3B42V7) using gauge observations and then investigated its utility in supporting reservoir operation and water resources management in Hanjiang basin from January 1998 to December 2013. Direct comparison of 3B42V7 with gauge observations shows that it can well capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation over the study basin. However, the 3B42V7 estimates generally show slight underestimation of precipitation, especially for extreme precipitation events, which need be considered in the future algorithm development. Next, we conducted the long-term (2008-2013) hydrologic evaluation of the 3B42V7 product using a calibrated monthly hydrologic model. The results show that the performance of the monthly hydrologic model driven by 3B42V7 is compatible to the results driven by gauge-based simulations according to high values of Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (0.83 and 0.66 for observation-driven and 3B47V7 driven simulations, respectively) and small values of biases (-8.16\% and -3.98\%). We further evaluated the applicability of 3B42V7 in reservoir operation through a set of operation experiments, in which modeled inflow series were used to make decisions. The results indicate that reservoir operations based on modeled streamflow using the 3B42V7 estimates perform well in water allocation decision-making and strongly agree with actual inflow based operations. Despite that 3B42V7 tends to slightly underestimate precipitation, the resultant operations do not impact the functions and benefits of reservoir operation much. This suggests that the 3B42V7 precipitation estimates are valuable and useful for monthly stream flow simulation and long-term reservoir operation in Hanjiang basin. This study provides a new insight on the evaluation and utility of the remote sensing based precipitation estimates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

7038109,"Operational Applications Of Satellite Snow Cover Observations","ABSTRACT: Several federal and state water resources agencies and NASA have recently completed an Applications Systems Verification and Transfer (ASVT) project on the operational applications of satellite snow cover observations. When satellite snow cover data were tested in both empirical seasonal runoff estimation and short term modeling approaches, a definite potential for reducing forecast error was evident. Three years of testing in California resulted in reduction of seasonal stream flow forecast error was evident. Three years of testing in California resulted in reduction of seasonal stream flow forecast error from 15 percent to 10 percent on three study basins; and modeling studies on the Boise River basin in Idaho indicated that satellite snow cover could be used to reduce short term forecast error by up to 9.6 percent (5 day forecast). Potential benefits from improved satellite snow cover based predictions across the 11 western states total 10 million dollars for hydropower and 28 million dollars for irrigation annually. The truly operational application of the new technology in the West, however, will only be possible when the turnaround time for all data is reduced to 72 hours, and the water management agencies can be assured of a continuing supply of operational snow cover data from space.

6903621,"Integrating Field And Satellite Data For Spatially Explicit Inference On The Density Of Threatened Arboreal Primates","Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/eap.1438","{""notes"": ""('cavada_integratingfieldsatellitedata_2017',)""}","{}",2024-09-26 01:06:46,"included",NA,NA
6863244,"Is Acoustic Tracking Appropriate For Air-Breathing Marine Animals? Dugongs As A Case Study","Marine animals face increased pressure through expanded shipping and recreational activities. Effective conservation and management of large species like marine mammals or sea turtles depend on knowledge of movement and habitat use. Previous studies have used data collected from either satellite or acoustic telemetry but rarely both. In this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efficacy of satellite and acoustic telemetry to define dugong movement patterns; compare the benefits and limitations of each approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate telemetry data to the boundaries of a Go Slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike within an urbanised coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). Twenty-one dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the Eastern Banks of Moreton Bay in July-September 2012 and July 2013 and fitted with GPS and acoustic transmitters. Both satellite and acoustic telemetry produced reliable presence and movement data for individual dugongs. When the dugongs were within the range of the acoustic array, there was relatively good correspondence between the overall space use measures derived from GPS and acoustic transmitters, demonstrating that acoustic tracking is a potentially valuable and cost-effective tool for monitoring local dugong habitat use in environments equipped with acoustic receiver arrays. Acoustic technology may be particularly useful for species that establish home ranges with stable residency especially near large urban or port environs. However, the relative merits of the two technologies depend on the research question in the context of the species of interest, the location of the study and whether the study site has an established acoustic array.

This interdisciplinary assessment combines data and models from meteorology, plant sciences, and economics under a value of information framework based on Bayesian decision theory. An economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector uses changes in yields for various ENSO phases to translate physical (yield) effects of ENSO changes into economic effects on producers and on domestic and foreign consumers.

7037366,"An Active Service Recommendation Model For Multi-Source Remote Sensing Information Using Fusion Of Attention And Multi-Perspective","With the development and popularization of remote sensing earth observation technology and the remote sensing satellite system, the problems of insufficient proactiveness, relevance and timeliness of large-scale remote sensing supporting services are increasingly prominent, which seriously restricts the application of remote sensing resources in multi-domain and cross-disciplinary. It is urgent to help terminal users make appropriate decisions according to real-time network environment and domain requirements, and obtain the optimal resources efficiently from the massive remote sensing resources. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm using fusion of attention and multi-perspective (MRS_AMRA). Based on MRS_AMRA, we further implement an active service recommendation model (MRS_ASRM) for massive multi-source remote sensing resources by combining streaming pushing technology. Firstly, we construct value evaluation functions from multi-perspective in terms of remote sensing users, data and services to enable the adaptive provision of remote sensing resources. Then, we define multi-perspective heuristic policies to support resource discovery, and fusion these policies through the attention network, to achieve the accurate pushing of remote sensing resources. Finally, we implement comparative experiments to simulate accurate recommendation scenarios, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as DIN and Geoportal. Furthermore, MRS_AMRA achieves an average improvement of 10.5% in the recommendation accuracy NDCG@K, and in addition, we developed a prototype system to verify the effectiveness and timeliness of MRS_ASRM. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs15102564","{""notes"": ""('zhu_activeservicerecommendationmodel_2023',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 21:40:52,"included",NA,NA

For the automation of calculation, a new ModelBuilder type tool was developed within the ArcGIS software called EO-Incity (Earth Observation-Income city). The sum of light (SOL) data extracted by means of the EO-Incity tool and the observed income data were integrated in an algorithm within the MATLAB software in order to calculate a transfer equation and the average error. The results achieved were subsequently reintegrated in EO-Incity and used for the estimation of the income value at local level. The regression analyses highlighted a stable and strong relationship between SOL and income for the analyzed cities. The EO-Incity tool and the machine learning model proved to be efficient in the real-time estimation of the income at local level.

A short overview of EO benefits is given with specific reference to cultural heritage applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the case of a EU FP7 Project ITACA (Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites), which started in January 2014 and it is currently underway. The paper briefly describes the ITACA project and its aims. During the project an economic impact assessment is carried out, initially from a qualitative point of view, through the submission of a questionnaire to the partners involved in the project. The same questionnaire was given also to identified End-Users in order to investigate the precise stakeholders' nature and behaviour and the likely economic modifications they will undergo once the project takes shape and new technical propositions are made potentially available also by way of different service models. Factors affecting positively and negatively the various stakeholder’s communities will be listed and discussed in full. Next stage is involving the quantification of potential benefits ITACA project may produce. Therefore, an evaluation of effects on economic activities of the areas and on communities the archaeological sites is being made. Once qualitative and quantitative assessments are completed, a business plan outlining also the appropriate road/roads to market is going to be prepared and suggestions will be made about which organizational/governance model best fit the expected results. This paper also deals with considerations about strength, weakness, opportunities and threats before during and after project’s deployment.

6903584,"Image To Attribute Model For Trees (Itam-T): Individual Tree Detection And Classification In Alberta Boreal Forest For Wildland Fire Fuel Characterization","Regional and municipal decision makers rely on fuel (vegetation) maps to inform decisions on tree stand management related to wildfire management and response. Remote sensing of trees is used in commercial applications but has limited uptake in the fire management community. A two-stage detection and identification convolutional network for high-resolution RGB drone imagery is developed to address this limitation. The detection routine is based on DeepForest, an existing convolutional neural network implementation designed to recognize trees in aerial imagery. Retraining the model and implementing an adaptive window-size workflow improves tree detection, with F-1 scores reaching 85\% and averaging 72\% for k-fold cross-validation in boreal forest. For classification, a VGG19 network with added data augmentation and dropout layers is trained. When this network is implemented, manually annotated trees are recognized as coniferous with an average F-1 of 97\% and deciduous with an 87\% F-1. Overall, the developed image-to-attribute model for trees reaches a maximum F-1 score of 85\% considering classification after identification, with averages of 72\% for coniferous trees and 57\% for deciduous trees over six sites. Tree height, size, and stem density are extracted from the tree location output and geometric data.

7038517,"Benchmarking Optical/Thermal Satellite Imagery For Estimating Evapotranspiration And Soil Moisture In Decision Support Tools","Generally, one expects evapotranspiration (ET) maps derived from optical/thermal Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery to improve decision support tools and lead to superior decisions regarding water resources management. However, there is lack of supportive evidence to accept or reject this expectation. We benchmark three existing hydrologic decision support tools with the following benchmarks: annual ET for the ET Toolbox developed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, predicted rainfall-runoff hydrographs for the Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis model developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the average annual groundwater recharge for the Distributed Parameter Watershed Model used by Daniel B. Stephens \& Associates. The conclusion of this benchmark study is that the use of NASA/USGS optical/thermal satellite imagery can considerably improve hydrologic decision support tools compared to their traditional implementations. The benefits of improved decision making, resulting from more accurate results of hydrologic support systems using optical/thermal satellite imagery, should substantially exceed the costs for acquiring such imagery and implementing the remote sensing algorithms. In fact, the value of reduced error in estimating average annual groundwater recharge in the San Gabriel Mountains, California alone, in terms of value of water, may be as large as \$1 billion, more than sufficient to pay for one new Landsat satellite.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/1752-1688.12371","{""notes"": ""('hendrickx_benchmarkingopticalthermalsatellite_2016',)""}","{}",2024-10-28 18:53:46,"included",NA,NA
7038553,"Estimation Of Surface Soil Moisture With Downscaled Land Surface Temperatures Using A Data Fusion Approach For Heterogeneous Agricultural Land","Field-scale surface soil moisture (SSM, 0–10 cm), which is closely linked with land surface temperature (LST), is particularly important to agricultural water resource management. Active and passive microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrievals on the order of kilometer squared resolutions are difficult to apply to heterogeneous agricultural land surfaces that may need SSM data at a resolution of 30 m. In this study, the High-resolution Urban Thermal Sharpener and Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model were applied to downscale optical and thermal remote sensing data simultaneously by blending Landsat and MODIS red-near infrared-LST data, with the ultimate goal to generate field-scale SSM values from the trapezoidal approach. To evaluate the performance of the downscaled LST E (based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model method) and SSM, an irrigation district (Area 1) in Inner Mongolia and an irrigation district in the North China Plain (Area 2) with varying spatial heterogeneity were selected as the testbeds. Results indicated that the downscaled LST E was highly consistent with synchronous Landsat LST H and in situ LST measurements in Area 1, with the root-mean-square error ranging from 0.73 to 2.75 K. Compared with the MODIS SSM, the average root-mean-square error of the downscaled SSM improved from 0.048 to 0.038 cm 3 /cm 3 for both areas. The downscaled LST E and SSM developed in this study enhance the spatiotemporal resolutions of the SSM estimates, maximizing the potential of remotely sensed information for agricultural water resource management. ©2019.

7037206,"Urban-Change Detection Systems: Remote-Sensing Inputs","This paper explores the application of remote-sensing technology to provide inputs to systems for urban-change detection and as such focuses primarily on the urban data user environment. Urban-change detection refers to the general problem of monitoring the urban system and discerning changes that are occurring within that system that are of use to urban planners, managers, and researchers. Conventional aerial photography and, more recently, color-infrared imagery have proved extremely useful in providing inventories of changes in various urban subsystems at more frequent time intervals than conventionally collected data. The problem addressed here is to integrate remote-sensing data with conventionally collected data in a system that describes and reports urban change. As research continues into the utility of remote sensing for the acquisition of data concerning specific urban phenomenon an increasing proportion of the data requirements of urban-change detection systems can be supplied by remote-sensing technology. However, the cost parameters related to these elements in some cases are unknown. Remote-sensing technology must be considered within the context of user needs, which determines the appropriate imagery scale, size of aerial unit of obsevation, any necessary classification schemes, and the need for appropriate data items. This paper attempts to define the general environment which remote-sensing data inputs in an urban context must operate. In the final analysis the utility of remote sensing in this area rests on stark economic conditions in the trade-off between costs and data-delivery-time requirements. © 1970.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/0031-8663(72)90013-0","{""notes"": ""('dueker_urbanchangedetectionsystems_1972',)""}","{}",2024-12-17 03:32:52,"included",NA,NA

In this paper, we provide guidance to help data providers and intermediaries within the EO value chain (from data to applications) increase the societal value ofthe EO data, information, and data products that they work with. We first describe the EO value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit. We then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the EO value chain. Finally, we present ""10 rules"" that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of Earth science information. The 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions. Some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole. Each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points. The rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection ofsolutions. The next set ofrules are best applied throughout a project, and include such concepts as evaluation, interoperability, trust, adoption, and documentation.

7036905,"Gap-Free Monitoring Of Annual Mangrove Forest Dynamics In Ca Mau Province, Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Using The Landsat-7-8 Archives And Post-Classification Temporal Optimization","Ecosystem services offered by mangrove forests are facing severe risks, particularly through land use change driven by human development. Remote sensing has become a primary instrument to monitor the land use dynamics surrounding mangrove ecosystems. Where studies formerly relied on bi-temporal assessments of change, the practical limitations concerning data-availability and processing power are slowly disappearing with the onset of high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud-computing services, such as in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). This paper combines the capabilities of GEE, including its entire Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 archives and state-of-the-art classification approaches, with a post-classification temporal analysis to optimize land use classification results into gap-free and consistent information. The results demonstrate its application and value to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove forests and land use changes in Ngoc Hien District, Ca Mau province, Vietnamese Mekong delta. The combination of repeated GEE classification output and post-classification optimization provides valid spatial classification (94–96% accuracy) and temporal interpolation (87–92% accuracy). The findings reveal that the net change of mangroves forests over the 2001–2019 period equals −0.01% annually. The annual gap-free maps enable spatial identification of hotspots of mangrove forest changes, including deforestation and degradation. Post-classification temporal optimization allows for an exploitation of temporal patterns to synthesize and enhance independent classifications towards more robust gap-free spatial maps that are temporally consistent with logical land use transitions. The study contributes to a growing body of work advocating full exploitation of temporal information in optimizing land cover classification and demonstrates its use for mangrove forest monitoring. © MDPI AG.

Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanut–cotton–corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La Niña or El Niño ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels.

7037108,"Practicing Critical Zone Observation In Agricultural Landscapes: Communities, Technology, Environment And Archaeology","The aims of agricultural land management change continuously, reflecting shifts in wider societal priorities. Currently, these include addressing the climate crisis, promoting environmental sustainability, and supporting the livelihoods of rural communities while ensuring food security. Working toward these aims requires information on the character of agricultural land and how dynamic processes influence it. Remote and near-surface sensing data are important sources of information on the characteristics of soils, plants, water, topography, and related processes. Sensing data are collected, analysed, and used in decision-making by specialists in multiple domains connected to land management. While progress has been made to connect the use of sensing data across agricultural and environmental applications under the umbrella of integrated sustainable land management, archaeological and heritage uses of these data remain largely disconnected. This creates barriers to accounting for the impacts of past human activities on contemporary agricultural landscapes through the alteration of soils, topography, and plant communities. In parallel, it hinders the creation of knowledge about the archaeological features which form an essential part of the heritage of agricultural landscapes. The ipaast-czo project explores the potential of a coordinated approach across all these domains, which would reduce these barriers and provide benefits by better integrating information generated using sensing. To do so, both conceptual and practical barriers to developing shared practices and how these might be overcome were considered. In this study, a conceptual framework designed to create a shared understanding of how agricultural landscapes work and enable collaboration around their management was proposed. This framework treats present-day rural agricultural landscapes as Critical Zones: complex entities shaped by long-term human-environment interactions including contemporary farming. Practitioners in precision agriculture and archaeological remote and near-surface sensing, as well as users of these data, were engaged using workshops and interviews. The relationships between practitioners' objectives, data requirements for their applications, and their perceptions of the benefits and disadvantages of changing working practices were interrogated. The conceptual framework and assessment of practical benefits and challenges emerging from this work provide a foundation for leveraging shared sensing data and methods for long-term integrated sustainable land management.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/land12010179","{""notes"": ""('opitz_practicingcriticalzoneobservation_2023',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 21:05:04,"included",NA,NA
6447802,"A Conceptual Framework for Assessing the Benefits of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems","The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Speciﬁcally, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and speciﬁcally, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the beneﬁts of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal beneﬁt areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “beneﬁt chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the beneﬁts, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and beneﬁt curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.",2008,"{""Bouma, J."",""Fritz, S."",""Obersteiner, M."",""Reyers, B."",""Scholes, R.J.""}","journal","IEEE Systems Journal","10.1109/JSYST.2008.926688","{""url"": ""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4595696/"", ""date"": ""2008/09//"", ""pages"": ""338"", ""end_page"": ""348"", ""access_date"": ""2023-09-29 20:16:07"", ""link_to_pdf"": ""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stampPDF/getPDF.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595696&ref=aHR0cHM6Ly9pZWVleHBsb3JlLmllZWUub3JnL2RvY3VtZW50LzQ1OTU2OTY="", ""database_provider"": ""DOI.org (Crossref)"", ""journal_name_user_abbr_2"": ""IEEE Systems Journal""}","{benchmark}",NA,NA,NA,NA
6903526,"Societal Need For Improved Understanding Of Climate Change, Anthropogenic Impacts, And Geo-Hazard Warning Drive Development Of Ocean Observatories In European Seas","Society's needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

7038450,"Vessel-Based, Shallow Water Mapping With A Phase-Measuring Sidescan Sonar","Coastal areas have traditionally been difficult locations to collect consistent, high-resolution bathymetric data via vessel-based acoustic surveys. The use of phase-measuring sidescan sonar is becoming more prevalent, particularly in shallow (< 20 m) coastal waters. Instruments used in the field over the last decade by the lead author are discussed here. This work is intended to serve as an introduction to the coastal scientist interested in the operation, use, and data sets associated with these instruments. Hydrographers unfamiliar with phase-measuring sidescan sonar will also benefit from insights regarding survey planning, data acquisition, and processing. These instruments collect co-located sidescan backscatter and swath bathymetry. The effective bathymetric swath widths can be 2 to 3 times that of multibeam echosounders making phase-measuring sidescan sonars ideal for shallow water mapping operations. These large effective swath widths offset the high levels of noise and processing needed in these bathymetric data sets relative to multibeam data. The sidescan backscatter and bathymetric data sets can be used individually, but the co-location allows for uses and analyses not feasible with other data sets. These instruments are well-suited to collect data for a suite of seafloor mapping projects and science-based investigations.

7037262,"Estimating The Benefits Of Land Imagery In Environmental Applications: A Case Study In Nonpoint Source Pollution Of Groundwater","Moderate-resolution land imagery (MRLI) is crucial to a more complete assessment of the cumulative, landscape-level effect of agricultural land use and land cover on environmental quality. If this improved assessment yields a net social benefit, then that benefit reflects the value of information (VOI) from MRLI. Environmental quality and the capacity to provide ecosystem services evolve because of human actions, changing natural conditions, and their interaction with natural physical processes. The human actions, in turn, are constrained and redirected by many institutions and regulations such as agricultural, energy, and environmental policies. We present a general framework for bringing together sociologic, biologic, physical, hydrologic, and geologic processes at meaningful scales to interpret environmental implications of MRLI applications. We set out a specific application using MRLI observations to identify crop planting patterns and thus estimate surface management activities that influence groundwater resources over a regional landscape. We tailor the application to the characteristics of nonpoint source groundwater pollution hazards in Iowa to illustrate a general framework in a land use-hydrologic-economic system. In the example, MRLI VOI derives from reducing the risk of both losses to agricultural production and damage to human health and other consequences of contaminated groundwater. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/978-94-007-4839-2_10","{""notes"": ""('bernknopf_estimatingbenefitslandimagery_2012',)""}","{}",2024-10-28 19:28:32,"included",NA,NA

However, the use of different types of images concerning the same landscape may influence social preferences and thus perceptions of landscape management and planning decisions. We evaluated landscape preferences and perceptions in four landscapes of southern Chile. We specifically: (1) compared people's perceptions related to living in, visiting, the scenic beauty, well-being, risks, and level of landscape disturbance; and (2) evaluated the influence of the type of scene (i.e., eye-level or aerial images) in these preferences and perceptions. Preferences and perceptions resulted to be better when using eye-level (4.0 +/- 1.1) than aerial (3.7 +/- 0.6) images. In general, we observed a negative association between preferences and perceptions and the landscape disturbance; however, it was consistent when using aerial images but was masked when valuing landscape through eye-level images. Implications of these results are relevant because by far, most landscape preference studies use traditional eye-level images.

7036680,"Strategic Considerations In Indian Space Programme - Towards Maximising Socio-Economic Benefits","Strategic thinking and planning have been the hallmarks of Indian space programme, whose objectives are sharply focused on deriving socio-economic benefits of space technology. The purpose of this paper is to identify various strategies, which played a role in different phases of the programme, contributing to social and economic outcomes and effectiveness. While self-reliant development of technological capacity and evaluation of applications with involvement of users formed the backbone of strategy in the initial phase of the programme, subsequent strategies were centred on development of organisational culture and systems, industry role and promotion of spin offs. Other strategies dealt with the response to challenges inherent in space endeavours in terms of risk management, sustainability, investments and long-term commitments. judicious make or buy decisions, safeguard of sensitive technologies, space commerce and finally harmonising international cooperation with national objectives. The strategies in the programme were consistently driven by a clear-cut vision and objectives to develop and use space technology in diverse areas where space systems become relevant for socio-economic development such as telecommunications and broadcasting, meteorology, disaster management support, remote sensing of natural and anthropogenic phenomena, and positioning and navigation services. This paper synthesises various studies and experiences in India in order to analyse strategies in the face of changes in technology, application needs and international policies. It also examines the effectiveness of these strategies in terms of economic and social costs and benefits. Based on the above analysis, a typical conceptual model for use of space for development is suggested. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

7036594,"High Resolution Satellite Image Orientation Models","A few years ago high resolution satellite imagery became available to a limited number of government and defense agencies that managed such imagery with highly sophisticated software and hardware tools. Such images became available to civil users in 1999 with the launch of Ikonos, the first civil satellite offering a spatial resolution of 1 m. Since then other high resolution satellites have been launched, among which there are EROS-A (1.8 m), QuickBird (0.61 m), Orbview-3 (1 m), EROS-B (0.7 m), Worldview-1 (0.5 m) and GeoEye-1 (0.41 m), with many others being planned to launch in the near future. High resolution satellite imagery is now available in different formats and processing levels at an affordable price. The diverse types of sensors and their growing availability are revolutionizing the role of satellite imagery in a number of applications, ranging from intelligency to insurance, media, marketing, agriculture, utilities, urban planning, forestry, environmental monitoring, transportation, real estate etc. As a possible alternative to aerial imagery, high resolution satellite imagery has also impact in cartographic applications, such as in orthophoto production, especially for areas where the organization of photogrammetric surveying may be critical. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/978-1-4419-0050-0_4","{""notes"": ""('crespi_resolutionsatelliteimageorientation_2009',)""}","{}",2024-11-18 22:24:10,"included",NA,NA

This paper explores a scaled-up participatory method developed by YouthMappers, for creating missing geospatial data derived from remotely sensed imagery in order to contribute to persistent data needs in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries.

This natural disaster causes considerable damage to the biodiversity of this region during the dry fire season. The area selected for the present study, Eravikulam National Park, which is predominantly of grassland vegetation, is also prone to forest fires. This study aims to delineate the forest fire risk zones in Eravikulam National Park using remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. In the present study, methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) were used to derive the weights, and the results were compared. We have used seven factors, i.e. land cover types, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, slope angle, slope aspect, distance from the settlement, and distance from the road to prepare the fire risk zone map. The area of the prepared risk zone maps is divided into three zones, namely low, moderate, and high. From the study, it was found that the fire occurring in this area is due to natural as well as anthropogenic factors. The prepared forest fire risk zone maps are validated using the fire incidence data for the period from January 2003 to June 2019 collected from the records of the Forest Survey of India. The investigation revealed that 72\% and 24\% of the fire incidences occurred in the high risk zone of the maps prepared using the AHP and FR methods, respectively, which ascertained the superiority of the AHP method over the FR method for forest fire risk zone mapping. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis gives an area under the ROC curve (ALIC) value of 0.767 and 0.567 for the AHP and FR methods, respectively.

7036572,"Rejuvenation Of Agriculture In India: Cost Benefits In Using Eo Products","India is looking for rejuvenating its sagging agricultural production and productivity by integrating high technology space inputs for both irrigated and rainfed areas. The Earth Observations (EO) products today serve as major inputs to policy, planning and targeted interventions, contributing to building social capitals, natural resources assets and environmental gains on the long-term basis. The benefits are mostly indirect and often difficult to quantify in terms of money. The cost benefit analysis of EO products is therefore an involved exercise and not many examples exist globally. The present paper, taking into account major national as well as some local level agriprojects in India, highlights the criticality of EO products in terms of their short-term as well as long-term economic and social values. Three aspects viz., catalytic, timeliness and enabling have been analyzed to visualize the role of EO products in a holistic fashion. In the catalytic role, EO inputs have been found to play a role in the successful implementation of major natural resources development projects. The cost of EO inputs may be of less than 2-5% to the total cost of the development projects, but the nature of such inputs are critical and catalytic. For example, a major project on reclamation of around 0.6 Mha sodic soils in Indo-Gangetic Plans costs US$89 million where EO products costs less than 2%; but demonstrates their catalytic roles in terms of identification, monitoring and evaluation and as inputs to mid-course corrections. The second aspect is timeliness in terms of opportunity cost. In India, Forecasting Agricultural Output Using Space-borne, Agro-meteorological and Land Observations (FASAL) project is carried out for in-season multiple crop production forecasting in support of strategic decision on trade, price and procurements. In the past, timely forecasts from FASAL have been found to be accurate and helpful for the country to plan many of its activities, including taking early decisions on wheat import to meet the shortfalls. The enabling role EO products have been demonstrated in several projects especially those related to building physical and social infrastructure and also natural resources assets building. The cost effective role EO has played in the watershed development planning and implementation in India, including improving the livelihoods as well as natural resources assets building, is one success story worth emulating in many developing countries. The most important aspect, however, is how the information is put to use for decision making and actual ground level implementation. The paper attempts to provide a glimpse of these aspects in a coherent fashion. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An economic model that involves application of spatial and temporal scientific, technical, and economic data in decision making is described. The value of information (VOI) contained in geospatial data is the difference between the net benefits (in present value terms) of a decision with and without the information. A range of technologies is used to collect and distribute geospatial data. These technical activities are linked to examples that show how the data can be applied in decision making, which is a cultural activity. The economic model for assessing the VOI in geospatial data for decisionmaking is applied to three examples: (1) a retrospective model about environmental regulation of agrochemicals; (2) a prospective model about the impact and mitigation of earthquakes in urban areas; and (3) a prospective model about developing private–public geospatial information or an ecosystem services market.

7038438,"Potential Applications Of Wireless Sensor Networks For Wildlife Trapping And Monitoring Programs","There are notable costs in maintaining a wildlife trapping program, primarily labor and travel costs associated with frequently and regularly checking large numbers of traps. Wireless sensor networks have the potential to significantly decrease operational costs of terrestrial wildlife trapping and monitoring programs, particularly those involving labor-intensive live-trapping. Furthermore, sensor networks can collect, transmit, and store vast volumes of environmental data, which may be used in research or to refine wildlife management or monitoring. In a modeled example, we estimated that operational cost savings of up to 70\% could accrue from use of wireless sensor networks. Cost savings were greater when more traps were included in the network, but declined as rates of sprung traps increased. A simple benefit-cost analysis suggested that use of wireless sensor networks is justifiable economically, although widespread use may be constrained by legislative or regulatory requirements for field staff to service or check traps or the need to replace bait. Should increasing use reduce hardware costs, this technology has great potential for reducing costs of trap-based control programs and increasing the quantity and quality of data from wildlife monitoring studies.

7036998,"Exploring The Utility Of Bathymetry Maps Derived With Multispectral Satellite Observations In The Field Of Underwater Archaeology","Bathymetry maps derived with satellite-based multispectral sensors have been used extensively for environmental and engineering coastal studies and monitoring. However, so far this technique has not been widely exploited in other coastal applications, such as underwater archaeology. Submerged settlements and shipwrecks are often located in water depths where the application of multispectral satellite data is feasible. This could lead to more efficient field work practices thus enabling more optimal allocations of costs and labour during archaeological excavations. This study explores the contribution of processed satellite bathymetry maps to the recording of two archaeological coastal sites: a submerged prehistoric settlement in Greece and a shipwreck of a modern cargo vessel in Italy. The results indicate that even though the accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry is high, the level of detail (spatial resolution) is not sufficient to fully replace field-based measurements. However, the use of satellite data complements the existing techniques and can help to place the archaeological sites within a broader spatial context as well as to efficiently monitor the deterioration of a site due to natural causes or human activity, which inevitably leads to risk management.

The most important value loops and program outputs are used to derive a set of highlevel program goals that suggest what NASA and NOAA should do, as well as how they should conduct business. The analysis concludes that international partnerships represent a strong potential partner for certain science missions with greater potential value delivery than currently-prioritized efforts with defense stakeholders and concludes that weather and land-use missions, in addition to climate missions, should be given highest priority; water, human health, and solid Earth missions should be given lower priority based on each science category’s potential for delivering value to the entire stakeholder network.",2012,"{""Sutherland, Timothy""}","ARTICLE",NA,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spacepol.2012.09.007","{}","{}",2024-04-25 02:30:34,"included",NA,NA

7037117,"Wetland Extent Tools For Sdg 6.6.1 Reporting From The Satellite-Based Wetland Observation Service (Swos)","Wetlands are the most fragile and threatened ecosystems worldwide, and also one of the most rapidly declining. At the same time wetlands are typically biodiversity hotspots and provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, such as water supply and purification, disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and carbon sequestration. Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme, as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation. In this respect, the Satellite-based Wetland Observation Service (SWOS), a Horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has developed and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on EO data, specifically designed for less experienced satellite data users. The SWOS monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the Ramsar Convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities. The four main components of the SWOS approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the GEO Wetlands Community Portal.

7038471,"Wind And Solar Energy For Sustainable Energy Production For Family Farms In Coastal Agricultural Regions Of Libya Using Measured And Multiple Satellite Datasets","Generating electricity from renewable energy instead of fossil fuels brings great benefits to the environment and sustainable development. Thus, assessing the potential of wind and solar energy in agricultural coastal areas can identify sustainable energy solutions for meeting energy demand and producing fresh water for agricultural applications and domestic use. However, it is difficult to accurately assess the wind and solar energy potential in Libya due to the civil war, lack of measured data, and its limited availability. Consequently, this concise work is unique because it is the first to use daily measurement data from Az-Zāwiyah, Libya, for evaluating wind and solar energy based on one year of measured data for 2022. Moreover, the present study aims to investigate the potential of wind and solar energy as promising renewable sources for meeting energy demand in coastal agricultural regions in Libya using multiple datasets for the first time. In this paper, five satellite products (TerraClimate, ERA5, ERA5-Land, MERRA-2, and CFSR) were assessed and compared against measured data for January 2022–December 2022 to understand their suitability, accuracy, and reliability. The results showed that CFSR and ERA5-Land demonstrate the most favorable performance for assessing the wind resource, while all satellite products can be utilized for preliminary solar resource assessment. Then, the assessment of wind and solar resources was evaluated in five agricultural coastal regions (Aljmail, Az-Zāwiyah, Castelverde, Msallatah, and Sabratah) based on the best satellite product for the period of 2000–2022. Furthermore, the performance of the wind and solar power systems was investigated for typical farms, which were chosen to estimate the required energy demand according to daily electrical consumption. The results show that the positive outcomes of implementing these systems were highlighted, with an emphasis on their potential benefits to the entire Libyan agricultural sector. Accordingly, scaling up and generalizing the proposed systems and generalizing them to include all farms in Libya could have a significant impact on national electricity generation, mitigate greenhouse gases, and contribute to the development of the agricultural sector and the country’s economy. © 2023 by the authors.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/en16186725","{""notes"": ""('lagili_windsolarenergysustainable_2023',)""}","{}",2024-12-14 22:24:08,"included",NA,NA
6691734,"The benefits to Mexican agriculture of an El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO) early warning system","Weather agencies worldwide are attempting to determine if systematic disturbances in climate, such as the El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO), can be detected far enough in advance so that decisions can be altered to better accommodate these disturbances. Mexico is one country where ENSO related climatic disturbances have been observed. If climate forecasters were able to disseminate information on upcoming ENSO-induced weather patterns with sufficient lead time, Mexican farmers could adjust by altering a variety of crop decisions, such as growing less (or more) water consumptive crops, planting drought resistant varieties, or altering planting times. This could have a positive impact on crop production, enhancing food security, farmers’ incomes, and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to value such forecasts in a Mexican agricultural setting. \n\nTo assess the economic consequences of climate arising from various ENSO phases, estimates of regional crop yield sensitivity for key crops were modeled using a crop biophysical simulator. The value of a forecast is then measured by the expected increase in economic benefits due to changes in cropping patterns, production and consumption arising from the yield changes under each ENSO phase forecast. These economic estimates are derived from an economic model of Mexican agriculture. The value of the ENSO information will depend on its accuracy in terms of predictions of the weather consequences of each phase.\n\nThe economic model is a stochastic, price endogenous, mathematical programming model that represents agronomic and economic conditions in a five-state Mexican region. This model depicts agricultural behavior across the three ENSO phases and provides the basis for calculating the value of information. The benefits of an ENSO early warning system for Mexico is approximately US$ 10 million annually, based on a 51-year time period of ENSO frequencies and when a forecast skill of 70% is assumed. This value translates into an internal rate of return for such an early warning system of approximately 30%. The values for higher skill levels are correspondingly higher. The values estimated here should be viewed as lower bound estimates of the value of an ENSO early warning system because benefits are not estimated for other parts of Mexican agriculture, such as non commercial (subsistence) agricultural areas, areas where there is only a weak ENSO signal that is not very predictable, and the livestock sector. Also, benefits here do not include benefits that could occur with adjustments in energy generation, water management, or any other economic sectors that may be positively affected by the existence of an ENSO early warning system.\n",2002,"{""Adams, Richard""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1923(02)00201-0","{}","{}",2024-04-26 19:09:05,"included",NA,NA
7037900,"An Updated Survey On The Use Of Geospatial Technologies In New Zealand's Plantation Forestry Sector","Background: Geospatial technologies have developed rapidly in recent decades and can provide detailed, accurate data to support forest management. Knowledge of the uptake of geospatial technologies, as well as barriers to adoption, in New Zealand's plantation forest management sector is limited and would be beneficial to the industry. This study provides an update to the 2013 benchmark study by Morgenroth and Visser. Methods: An online survey was sent to 29 companies that own or manage plantation forests in New Zealand. The survey was split into seven sections, composed of multiple-choice and open-ended questions, on the topics of: demographic information, data portals and datasets, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, and four remote-sensing technologies. These included aerial imagery, multispectral imagery, hyperspectral imagery, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Each section included questions relating to the acquisition, application and products created from each remote-sensing technology. Questions were also included that related to the barriers preventing the uptake of technologies. To determine the progression in the uptake of these technologies the results were compared to Morgenroth and Visser's study conducted five years earlier. Results: Twenty-three companies responded to the survey and together, those companies managed approximately 1,172,000 ha (or 69\% of New Zealand's 1.706 million ha plantation forest estate (NZFOA, 2018)). The size of the estates managed by individual companies ranged from 1,000 ha to 177,000 ha (quartile 1 = 19,000 ha, median = 33,000 ha, quartile 3 = 63,150 ha). All companies used GNSS receivers and acquired three-band, Red-Green-Blue, aerial imagery. Multispectral imagery, hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data were acquired by 48\%, 9\% and 70\% of companies, respectively. Common applications for the products derived from these technologies were forest mapping and description, harvest planning, and cutover mapping. The main barrier preventing companies from acquiring most remotely-sensed data was the lack of staff knowledge and training, though cost was the main barrier to LiDAR acquisition. The uptake of all remote-sensing technologies has increased since 2013. LiDAR had the largest progression in uptake, increasing from 17\% to 70\%. There has also been a change in the way companies acquired the data. Many of the companies used unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAV) to acquire aerial and multispectral imagery in 2018, while in 2013 no companies were using UAVs. ESRI ArcGIS continues to be the dominant geographic information system used by New Zealand's forest management companies (91\%), though 22\% of companies now use free GIS software, like QGIS or GRASS. The use of specialised software (e.g. FUSION, LAStools) for LiDAR or photogrammetric point cloud analysis increased since 2013, but most forestry companies who are processing .las files into various products (e.g. digital terrain model) are using ArcGIS. Conclusions; This study showed that there had been a progression in the uptake of geospatial technologies in the New Zealand plantation forest management sector. However, there are still barriers preventing the full utilisation of these technologies. The results suggest that the industry could benefit from investing in more training relating to geospatial technologies.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.33494/nzjfs502020x118x","{""notes"": ""('degouw_updatedsurveygeospatialtechnologies_2020',)""}","{}",2024-12-16 22:02:22,"included",NA,NA
7037546,"Farmer Perception, Recollection, And Remote Sensing In Weather Index Insurance: An Ethiopia Case Study","A challenge in addressing climate risk in developing countries is that many regions have extremely limited formal data sets, so for these regions, people must rely on technologies like remote sensing for solutions. However, this means the necessary formal weather data to design and validate remote sensing solutions do not exist. Therefore, many projects use farmers' reported perceptions and recollections of climate risk events, such as drought. However, if these are used to design risk management interventions such as insurance, there may be biases and limitations which could potentially lead to a problematic product. To better understand the value and validity of farmer perceptions, this paper explores two related questions: (1) Is there evidence that farmers reporting data have any information about actual drought events, and (2) is there evidence that it is valuable to address recollection and perception issues when using farmer-reported data? We investigated these questions by analyzing index insurance, in which remote sensing products trigger payments to farmers during loss years. Our case study is perhaps the largest participatory farmer remote sensing insurance project in Ethiopia. We tested the cross-consistency of farmer-reported seasonal vulnerabilities against the years reported as droughts by independent satellite data sources. We found evidence that farmer-reported events are independently reflected in multiple remote sensing datasets, suggesting that there is legitimate information in farmer reporting. Repeated community-based meetings over time and aggregating independent village reports over space lead to improved predictions, suggesting that it may be important to utilize methods to address potential biases.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs10121887","{""notes"": ""('osgood_farmerperceptionrecollectionremote_2018',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 17:23:52,"included",NA,NA

7036657,"Cost-Effectiveness Of Conservation Strategies Implemented In Boreal Forests: The Area Selection Process","To protect land from commercial exploitation is a common conservation practice. However, this requires large financial resources and it is therefore important to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies used in the selection of these conservation areas. In this study we compare four strategies and relate the differences in cost-effectiveness to differences in the selection process. We measure conservation benefits both as the amount of three tree structures and as the number of species in three species groups. We also estimate both the information cost associated with selecting conservation areas and the opportunity cost. we found the key habitat strategy to be the over-all most cost-effective. in this strategy, the areas have a flexible size and are selected by the authorities in a national field survey. The least cost-effective strategy was one where the selection was based only on forest classes in a satellite map. Intermediate were the retention group strategy, where small areas are left by the forest owner at harvesting, and the nature reserve strategy, where large areas are selected by the authorities. We emphasize that the differences we found are associated with the selection process and that other aspects, such as long-term survival of species, may rank the strategies differently. We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of a selection strategy depends on the size of the planning area for selection of conservation areas, the size of the conservation areas, the objective of the agent making the selection, and the amount and type of information on which the selection is based.

However, echosounders are expensive and, in addition, the equipment requires a great deal of experience on the part of the specialist. From another perspective, orbital and aerial images (acquired by RPA’s-Remotely Piloted Aircraft) can offer bathymetric maps of larger locations that are difficult to access at a low operating cost. Therefore, the present study’s main objective was to evaluate the utility of RGB images obtained with RPA’s in water reservoirs. Thus, Artificial Neural Networks were used for depth training and prediction. Subsequently, it compared to the bathymetric data from the same pond in question, raised from acoustic sensors, quantifying the vertical uncertainty through three estimators. Regarding the statistical analysis, the RMSE and Ф estimators showed better reliability. The 300-point sample showed the best quality in processing. The results showed that the methodology could improve the management of water resources.

Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery.

The estimated tree information was assessed and used to evaluate how erroneous inventory data affect economic value and loss due to suboptimal harvesting decisions. Field measured data used as reference come from 23 field plots collected in a study area in south-eastern Norway typical of managed boreal forests in Norway.; Results: The accuracy of the forest inventory was generally in line with previous studies. Our results show that using mean values from the area-based approach may yield large economic losses, while adding a diameter distribution to the area-based approach yielded less loss than the individual tree crown methods. Adding information from imagery had little effect on the results.; Conclusions: Taking inventory costs into account, diameter distributions from the area-based approach without additional information seems favourable. © 2014, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/s13595-014-0389-x","{""notes"": ""('bergseng_assessingforestinventoryinformation_2015',)""}","{}",2024-12-18 18:32:07,"included",NA,NA

A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000–$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.",2020,"{""Stroming, Signe""}","ARTICLE",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GH000254","{}","{}",2024-04-22 02:48:42,"included",NA,NA

Developed in the 1980s to support Ontario's land use planning process, the OWES is comprehensive in terms of the number of wetland attributes that are recognized, but also labor-intensive and costly to implement. Limited resources for field work, lack of direct access to many wetlands, a high proportion of unevaluated wetlands in many areas, and developments in digital remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) technology have prompted efforts to consider a less expensive and more rapid, remote-based system. In support of this goal, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry has begun development of remote sensing-based wetland mapping standards and investigated and statistically tested remote based and automated scoring of selected OWES attributes. Preliminary testing to date indicates that GIS-based desktop interpretations of hydrology, soil, and vegetation characteristics can be used to identify wetlands and approximate outer wetland boundaries. Testing of a remote-based, wetland-type community key indicated that it can reduce the amount of field work required to complete a wetland evaluation. Automated desktop scoring of selected OWES attributes also holds potential as a means of streamlining the evaluation process. We conclude that remote-based wetland identification, mapping, and scoring have the potential to significantly streamline wetland conservation efforts by reducing the amount of field work required. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

7036991,"Discharge Estimation And Forecasting By Modis And Altimetry Data In Niger-Benue River","Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world and its forecast is essential in flood risk reduction and disaster response decision. The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting. In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2. The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

6863365,"Observation Of Pm2.5 Using A Combination Of Satellite Remote Sensing And Low-Cost Sensor Network In Siberian Urban Areas With Limited Reference Monitoring","The lack of reference ground-based PM2.5 observation leads to large gaps in air quality information, particularly in many areas of the developing world. This study investigated a new solution for urban air-quality monitoring in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. We developed an observation-based method by combining satellite remote-sensing techniques and a newly established low-cost sensor network to estimate long-term PM2.5 concentrations over Krasnoyarsk, a highly industrialized Siberian city. First, a physical model was developed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using satellite remote-sensing with the aid of ground-based meteorological and radiosonde observations. Observations from the ground-based sensor network were then used to calibrate the deviations in the satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations. The results show that the satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations obtained by our physical model were in good agreement with the sensor observations (R = 0.78 on the monthly scale). The deviation in satellite-derived annual PM2.5 concentrations resulted from data restrictions that occurred at noon and data loss in winter were identified as 20% and 30%, respectively. The regional transport of smoke from forest wildfires increased PM2.5 concentration to 150 μg/m3 in the summer 2018. The average PM2.5 concentrations in the urban districts could reach 35 μg/m3, which far exceeded the World Health Organization air quality guideline. These results underscore the good ability of our new method to determine PM2.5 concentrations in regions with limited reference ground-based monitoring. Use of sensor and meteorological observations greatly improved satellite detection of PM2.5 concentration. In addition, our method has the potential for global application to improve determination of PM2.5 concentrations, especially in sparsely monitored regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,"{""Bilal, M."",""Fung, J.

7038108,"Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Network For High-Speed Sar Ship Detection","As an active microwave imaging sensor for the high-resolution earth observation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been extensively applied in military, agriculture, geology, ecology, oceanography, etc., due to its prominent advantages of all-weather and all-time working capacity. Especially, in the marine field, SAR can provide numerous high-quality services for fishery management, traffic control, sea-ice monitoring, marine environmental protection, etc. Among them, ship detection in SAR images has attracted more and more attention on account of the urgent requirements of maritime rescue and military strategy formulation. Nowadays, most researches are focusing on improving the ship detection accuracy, while the detection speed is frequently neglected, regardless of traditional feature extraction methods or modern deep learning (DL) methods. However, the high-speed SAR ship detection is of great practical value, because it can provide real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military planning. Therefore, in order to address this problem, we proposed a novel high-speed SAR ship detection approach by mainly using depthwise separable convolution neural network (DS-CNN). In this approach, we integrated multi-scale detection mechanism, concatenation mechanism and anchor box mechanism to establish a brand-new light-weight network architecture for the high-speed SAR ship detection. We used DS-CNN, which consists of a depthwise convolution (D-Conv2D) and a pointwise convolution (P-Conv2D), to substitute for the conventional convolution neural network (C-CNN). In this way, the number of network parameters gets obviously decreased, and the ship detection speed gets dramatically improved. We experimented on an open SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) to validate the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method. To verify the strong migration capacity of our method, we also carried out actual ship detection on a wide-region large-size Sentinel-1 SAR image. Ultimately, under the same hardware platform with NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU, the experimental results indicated that the ship detection speed of our proposed method is faster than other methods, meanwhile the detection accuracy is only lightly sacrificed compared with the state-of-art object detectors. Our method has great application value in real-time maritime disaster rescue and emergency military planning.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.3390/rs11212483","{""notes"": ""('zhang_depthwiseseparableconvolutionneural_2019',)""}","{}",2024-11-21 20:37:34,"included",NA,NA
6863608,"Future Perspectives Of Earth Observation: Indian Scenario","Civilian Earth Observation programmes have demonstrated the utility of space-based data to a variety of users-specifically those associated with the natural resources management. Its future will depend upon how the systems meet the demand of monitoring global environment; mapping, charting and geodesy; long-term global change research and assessment; monitoring and managing the renewable and non-renewable resources and national security applications. The future Earth Observation Systems (EOS) will have to take into consideration the aspects relate to the globalisation and standardisation of programmes world-over; data continuity and the need to monitor processes rather than events. Technological changes are also going to re-define many of the concepts of observation from space and issues like spatial resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution may no more be a concern for observation systems. In the Indian context, with the launch of IRS-1C, in December 1995, user services have been significantly enhanced. Presently, plans are onway to define the continuity to these missions. A broad analysis has been done of the observation needs of the future and also what has been achieved today and suggestions are made for the future observation systems design and implementation. The need analysis has been done keeping in mind the global change applications; mapping and cartographic applications; natural resources and environmental management applications etc. The paper discusses the strategy adopted for assessing the future requirements and also for defining the future Indian missions. Based on this evaluation and also the need for identifying low-cost, quick turn-around, application specific solutions, candidate payloads for the continuation series have been defined. These candidate payloads cater to a majority of the application needs and specific gap-areas would be taken care of. A decade profile of Indian Remote Sensing missions has been defined which addresses the concept of continuity, operational missions and the advanced missions up to 2005.

7036935,"Impact Of Satellite Imagery Spatial Resolution On Land Use Classification Accuracy And Modeled Water Quality","Remote sensing offers an increasingly wide array of imagery with a broad variety of spectral and spatial resolution, but there are relatively few comparisons of how different sources of data impact the accuracy, cost, and utility of analyses. We evaluated the impact of satellite image spatial resolution (1m from Digital Globe; 30m from Landsat) on land use classification via ArcGIS Feature Analyst, and on total suspended solids (TSS) load estimates from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Camboriu watershed in Southeastern Brazil. We independently calibrated SWAT models, using both land use map resolutions and short-term daily streamflow (discharge) and TSS load data from local gauge stations. We then compared the predicted TSS loads with monitoring data outside the model training period. We also estimated the cost difference for land use classification and SWAT model construction and calibration at these two resolutions. Finally, we assessed the value of information (VOI) of the higher-resolution imagery in estimating the cost-effectiveness of watershed conservation in reducing TSS at the municipal water supply intake. Land use classification accuracy was 82.3\% for 1m data and 75.1\% for 30m data. We found that models using 1m data better predicted both annual and peak TSS loads in the full study area, though the 30m model did better in a sub-watershed. However, the 1m data incurred considerably higher costs relative to the 30m data (\$7000 for imagery, plus additional analyst time). Importantly, the choice of spatial resolution affected the estimated return on investment (ROI) in watershed conservation for the municipal water company that finances much of this conservation, although it is unlikely that this would have affected the company's decision to invest in the program. We conclude by identifying key criteria to assist in choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for different contexts.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1002/rse2.61","{""notes"": ""('fisher_impactsatelliteimageryspatial_2018',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 17:33:57,"included",NA,NA
7038541,"Using Remote Sensing Data For Earthquake Damage Assessment In Afghanistan: The Role Of The International Charter","Afghanistan is located in a zone of high-seismic activity. Given the rugged and mountainous nature of the country and the location of villages, towns and cities, there is propensity for widespread death and destruction due to landslides whenever an earthquake occurs. Use of satellite imagery by humanitarian agencies in Afghanistan in preparation for and response to natural and man-made disasters has been very limited, mostly to International organizations such as the United Nations. Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) due to their vantage position have demonstrated their ability to rapidly provide vital information and services in a disaster situation. EOS has been used in emergency situations where the ground resources are often lacking. The perception amongst humanitarian agencies and civil protection authorities in most developing countries is that the cost of satellite imagery is not cheap. With limited budgets available for purchasing satellite data, they tend to opt for less expensive solutions such as interagency survey teams to assess damages. The rugged and mountainous nature of Afghanistan and the lack of roads in most parts of the country, survey teams are most often hampered, leading to delays in delivery of information from the field to the decision makers. Recent earthquake in the Hindu Kush of the country in April 2004 witnessed the triggering of the International Charter for free delivery of satellite imagery. Image analysis and interpretation of both pre and crisis data did not show observable features of damages. The damage assessment maps were used by the humanitarian community for decision-making. Availability and access to space technology in addressing natural disasters have been the main obstacles facing developing countries particularly those poor countries without their own space programs. This problem has been solved through the introduction of The International Charter for major disasters. However, knowledge about the Charter is not common knowledge in most developing countries; Disaster Management Authorities, the Academic Institutions, humanitarian agencies and the affected communities have very little idea about the availability and access to free satellite imagery. There is need for a massive awareness campaign to educate decision makers about the International Charter and the potentials of using space technology in addressing problems relating to disaster management and the environment. The skills to process satellite imagery and integrate it with other GIS layers are lacking in most developing countries; there is need to embark on a massive capacity building exercise to ensure optimization of the benefits of the technology. The Charter needs to find innovative ways of quickly sending value added information products to disaster management authorities instead of relying on in-country skills in image processing. This paper elaborates on the experiences gained working with images received from the International Charter, and the immense pressures from the humanitarian community for rapid delivery of information. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1007/3-540-27468-5_60","{""notes"": ""('korsukandeh_remotesensingdataearthquake_2005',)""}","{}",2024-10-25 23:00:01,"included",NA,NA

Managing high priority refuges could improve species resilience and facilitate dispersal during periods of environmental change. In this study, we identified drought refuges in semi-arid Australia for a threatened bird, the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. Using a Poisson regression model, we quantified the effect of remotely sensed vegetation indices, rainfall, soil moisture and site characteristics on malleefowl breeding activity at 144 sites surveyed from 2000 to 2017 during and after drought. We tested the effect of two vegetation productivity indices on malleefowl breeding activity - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - averaged across three temporal and three spatial scales during the mound building and incubation stage of the breeding cycle. We found that NDVI and EVI were better predictors of malleefowl breeding activity than soil moisture and winter rainfall. The model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value contained NDVI averaged over 3 months (June-August) and a 1-km radius. Malleefowl breeding activity had a strong positive association with NDVI (0.42 +/- se 0.03) and a negative association with slope (-0.34 +/- se 0.03) and vegetation patch size (-0.23 +/- se 0.02). We found the proportion of refugia (top 20\% of predicted breeding activity) in protected areas was highly variable, decreasing from 42\% in an extreme wet year (2011) to 14\% in an extreme drought year (2007). Expanding the reserve network to include refugia predicted to occur in the south of semi-arid Victoria could improve resilience of malleefowl to climate change. We demonstrate how remotely sensed vegetation indices combined with citizen science data can identify where to protect native vegetation with high, stable productivity.

The objective of this study is to explore several game pricing methods with risk aversion for pricing of data products in neutrosophic environments. First, to reflect the uncertainty of problem parameters, the idea of neutrosophic variables is adopted. With the aid of neutrosophic variables, the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees of players can be intuitively and conveniently obtained. Subsequently, considering the risk aversion of decision makers, the optimistic value theory is introduced into neutrosophic variables for calculating the optimistic value of player's profits. Then, different pricing models are constructed under the Bertrand and Stackelberg game scenarios, respectively. After deriving the corresponding equilibrium equations, some numerical instances are provided to testify the feasibility of our methods. Furthermore, the influences of dissimilar market power structures are examined.

Charging this amount leads to an acceptance rate of 43\%, with 57\% of users no longer acquiring the imagery. Furthermore, we noticed significant differences in values for images among the sectors. The results show that users are more willing to pay a fixed yearly amount to join an HR-image pooling system than to be charged per image. Hence, we recorded a mean membership value of \& euro;3,022, with 12\% of users willing to pay up to \& euro;15,000 to join such a service.

7036597,"An Open-Book Watershed Model For Prototyping Space-Borne Flood Monitoring Systems In International River Basins","A new era involving both simple and complex hydrologic modeling of un-gauged river basins may now emerge with the anticipated global availability of high resolution satellite rainfall data from the proposed Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. This era of application pertains to rapid prototyping of GPM-based flood monitoring systems for downstream nations in International River Basins (IRBs) where basin-wide in-situ rainfall data is unavailable due to lack of either an infrastructure or a treaty for real-time data sharing with upstream riparian nations. In this paper, we develop, verify and apply an open-book watershed model for demonstrating the value of a parsimonious modeling scheme in quick prototyping of satellite rainfall-based flood monitoring systems for lowermost nations in flood-prone IRBs. The open-book watershed modeling concept was first formulated by Yen and Chow {[}1969. A laboratory study of surface runoff due to moving rainstorms. Water Resources Research 5(5), 989-1006] more than 30 years ago as a convenient and pragmatic framework to understand the underlying physics behind surface hydrologic phenomena. Our developed model is based on first principles of conservation of mass and momentum that parsimoniously represents the static geophysical features of a basin with minimum calibration. Such a generic and parsimonious representation has the added potential to supplement complex hydrologic models for stakeholder involvement and conflict management in transboundary river basins, among many additional applications. We first demonstrate the physical consistency of our model through sensitivity analysis of some geophysical basin parameters pertinent to the rainfall-runoff transformation. Next, we simulate the stream-flow hydrograph for a 4-month long period using basin-wide radar (WSR-88D) rainfall I data over Oklahoma assuming an open-book river basin configuration. Finally, using the radar-simulated hydrograph as the benchmark, and assuming a two-nation hypothetical IRB over Oklahoma, we explored the impact of assimilating NASA's real-time satellite rainfall data (IR-3B41RT) over the upstream nation on the flow monitoring accuracy for the downstream nation. We developed a relationship defining the improvement in flow monitoring that can be expected from assimilating IR-3B41RT over transboundary regions as a function of the relative area occupied by the downstream nation for a semi-arid region. The relative improvement in flow monitoring accuracy for the downstream nation was found to be clearly high (over 35\% reduction in root mean squared error) when more than 90\% of the basin is transboundary. However, flow monitoring accuracy reduces considerably and even becomes negative when 60\% or less of the basin area is transboundary to the downstream nation. Our findings, although hypothetical and very regime-specific, illustrate very clearly the feasibility of utilizing anticipated GPM data to alleviate the current flood monitoring limitations experienced by many nations in IRBs through the application of a generic and parsimonious model.

6903651,"Predicting Breeding Habitat For Amphibians: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Across Yellowstone National Park","The ability to predict amphibian breeding across landscapes is important for informing land management decisions and helping biologists better understand and remediate factors contributing to declines in amphibian populations. We built geospatial models of likely breeding habitats for each of four amphibian species that breed in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We used field data collected in 2000-2002 from 497 sites among 16 basins and predictor variables from geospatial models produced from remotely sensed data (e. g., digital elevation model, complex topographic index, landform data, wetland probability, and vegetative cover). Except for 31 sites in one basin that were surveyed in both 2000 and 2002, all sites were surveyed once. We used polytomous regression to build statistical models for each species of amphibian from (1) field survey site data only, (2) field data combined with data from geospatial models, and (3) data from geospatial models only. Based on measures of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores, models of the second type best explained likely breeding habitat because they contained the most information (ROC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88). However, models of the third type could be applied to the entire YNP landscape and produced maps that could be verified with reserve field data. Accuracy rates for models built for single years were highly variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.78. Accuracy rates for models built with data combined from multiple years were higher and less variable, ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Combining results from the geospatial multiyear models yielded maps of ""core"" breeding areas (areas with high probability values for all three years) surrounded by areas that scored high for only one or two years, providing an estimate of variability among years. Such information can highlight landscape options for amphibian conservation. For example, our models identify alternative areas that could be protected for each species, including 6828-10 764 ha for tiger salamanders, 971-3017 ha for western toads, 4732-16 696 ha for boreal chorus frogs, and 4940-19 690 ha for Columbia spotted frogs.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1890/10-1261.1","{""notes"": ""('bartelt_predictingbreedinghabitatamphibians_2011',)""}","{}",2024-10-03 21:59:25,"included",NA,NA

6863569,"Cross-Scale Sensing Of Field-Level Crop Residue Cover: Integrating Field Photos, Airborne Hyperspectral Imaging, And Satellite Data","Conservation tillage practices can bring benefits to agricultural sustainability. Accurate spatial and temporal resolved information of field-scale crop residue cover, which reflects tillage intensity, is highly valuable for evaluating the outcomes of government conservation programs and voluntary ecosystem service markets, as well as facilitating agroecosystem modeling to quantify cropland biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing has the potential to cost-effectively detect crop residue cover, however, existing regional-scale studies were limited by insufficient ground truth data, scale mismatch between coarse satellite pixels and ground data, and the lack of key spectral data for detecting crop residues. Therefore, this study developed an innovative cross-sensing framework to integrate proximal sensing, airborne hyperspectral imaging, and satellite Earth Observation through deep learning to quantify field-level crop residue cover fractions at the regional scale. Specifically, we have collected intensive ground orthographic photos and conducted airborne hyperspectral surveys at corn and soybean fields of Champaign and nearby counties in Illinois, the heartland of the U.S. Corn Belt. Through semi-automatic labeling aided by ResNet-50 and superpixel image segmentation, we obtained 6719 records of ground residue fractions. With these ground data, we developed the 1-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) model using airborne hyperspectral reflectance, which has 0.5 m spatial resolution and 3–5 nm spectral resolution from 400 to 2400 nm, to predict residue fractions. By applying the CNN model to airborne pixels, we augmented “ground truth” data of crop residues and further combined them with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) satellite data to quantify regional residue fractions at 30 m resolution. Results show that airborne hyperspectral imagery with CNN can accurately detect residue fractions (R2 = 0.82, relative RMSE = 11.73%) to effectively generate quasi “ground truth” data to support satellite upscaling to all fields. With independent ground data for testing, we found that the ground-airborne-satellite integrative framework achieved better predictions in estimating crop residue cover (R2 = 0.67, relative RMSE = 17.53%) than the conventional ground-satellite upscaling (R2 = 0.22, relative RMSE = 32.09%). We also found that the shortwave infrared wavelengths, particularly 2100–2300 nm, are vital for predicting crop residue cover. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data have a comparable capability to track residue fractions due to similar shortwave infrared wavelengths. This study highlights the high accuracy of hyperspectral imaging to detect agroecosystem tillage management practices and the advantages of cross-scale sensing to cost-effectively integrate multi-source data to quantify field-level agroecosystem variables across scales. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2023,"{""Guan, K."",""Huang, Y."",""Jiang, C."",""Li, K."",""Li, Z."",""Ma, Z."",""Mei, W."",""Peng, B."",""Wang, S."",""Wang, S."",""Wu, X."",""Yang, Y."",""Zhang, C."",""Zhou, Q."",""Zhou, W.""}","jour",NA,"10.1016/j.rse.2022.113366","{""notes"": ""('wang_crossscalesensingfield_2023',)""}","{}",2024-07-12 23:20:44,"included",NA,NA
7038342,"An Information-Theoretic Approach To Reconciling Historical Climate Observations And Impacts On Agriculture","Decision-makers in climate risk management often face problems of how to reconcile diverse and conflicting sources of information about weather and its impact on human activity, such as when they are determining a quantitative threshold for when to act on satellite data. For this class of problems, it is important to quantitatively assess how severe a year was relative to other years, accounting for both the level of uncertainty among weather indicators and those indicators' relationship to humanitarian consequences. We frame this assessment as the task of constructing a probability distribution for the relative severity of each year, incorporating both observational data\}such as satellite measurements\}and prior information on human impact\}such as farmers' reports\}the latter of which may be incompletely measured or partially ordered. We present a simple, extensible statistical method to fit a probability distribution of relative severity to any ordinal data, using the principle of maximum entropy. We demonstrate the utility of the method through application to a weather index insurance project in Malawi, in which the model allows us to quantify the likelihood that satellites would correctly identify damaging drought events as reported by farmers, while accounting for uncertainty both within a set of commonly used satellite indicators and between those indicators and farmers' ranking of the worst drought years.

Monitoring resource use is a BLM responsibility, but conventional monitoring is inadequate for the vast areas encompassed in this and other public-land units. New monitoring methods are needed that will reduce monitoring costs. An understanding of data-set relationships among old and new methods is also needed. This study compared two conventional methods with two remote sensing methods using images captured from two meters and 100 meters above ground level from a camera stand (a ground, image-based method) and a light airplane (an aerial, image-based method). Image analysis used SamplePoint or VegMeasure software. Aerial methods allowed for increased sampling intensity at low cost relative to the time and travel required by ground methods.

Using a bootstrap method to measure standard error, the 95\% confidence interval of predictions was found to have a similar order of magnitude to quadrat sampling in situ at a precision (standard error/mean) of 10\%.

7037469,"Enhancing Catch-And-Release Science With Biotelemetry","Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is widely practised by anglers and is a common fisheries management strategy or is a by-product of harvest regulations. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research that examines not only the mortality associated with C\&R, but also the sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences. Biotelemetry offers a powerful means of remotely monitoring the behaviour, physiology and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment, but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry in C\&R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and challenges. There are now about 250 C\&R studies but only one quarter of these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C\&R studies that have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We found that the majority of C\&R telemetry studies used either radio or acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite technologies. Most C\&R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies (< 8\%) have used physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C\&R and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as death. We conclude that C\&R science has the potential to benefit greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding the lethal and sublethal impacts of C\&R. However, there are still a number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C\&R biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby offer C\&R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries management and conservation.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1111/j.1467-2979.2007.00265.x","{""notes"": ""('donaldson_enhancingcatchreleasescience_2008',)""}","{}",2024-12-17 04:30:31,"included",NA,NA
7037583,"Assessing The Benefit Of Satellite-Based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence In Crop Yield Prediction","Large-scale crop yield prediction is critical for early warning of food insecurity, agricultural supply chain management, and economic market. Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.1016/j.jag.2020.102126","{""notes"": ""('peng_assessingbenefitsatellitebased_2020',)""}","{""probs not""}",2024-10-30 18:28:42,"included",NA,NA
7652711,"Remote Sensing For The Analysis Of Anthropogenic Geomorphology: Potential Responses To Sediment Dynamics In The Agricultural Landscapes","Agricultural modern land transformations are usually undertaken with minimal landscape planning, and soil conservation practices are largely ignored during the construction phase. As a consequence, changes to terrain morphology induce dramatic geomorphological effects that can endure well beyond any single farming cycle and over many human generations. Thus, agricultural activities that may not be obvious to the observers of contemporary landscapes can continue to influence surface processes and landforms strongly; these effects are even more critical in the current situation of climate change and rainfall event intensification. An understanding and successful prediction of pathways of runoff and associated soil erosion due to terracing are, therefore, of considerable societal relevance. Such predictions would allow improvements to the protection of the environment by the reduction of impacts of the agricultural activities or by a correct restoration of abandoned agricultural land (especially terraces). Using two examples from northern Spain and northern Italy, this chapter shows how new remote sensing technologies (i.e., airborne lidar), available to the public, can provide a better understanding of the interaction between anthropogenic elements, potential erosion, and the associated sediment delivery. During the planning and management phase, the farmers and authorities in charge of monitoring both the subsidy process and land management should consider an approach similar to that presented in this research, together with a holistic view of the processes in the areas, specifically related to climate and soil. It is currently possible to forecast how agricultural practices could affect sediment fluxes in the future, and thus to have a better understanding of the human-landscape interactions. This type of integrated analysis is a cost-effective strategy for the management, restoration, or development of terraced lands, especially in areas with high economic value for agricultural productions and tourism. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,"{""Sofia, G."",""Tarolli, P.""}","chap",NA,"10.1016/b978-0-444-64177-9.00009-6","{""notes"": ""('tarolli_remotesensinganalysisanthropogenic_2020',)""}","{}",2025-02-27 20:35:11,"included",NA,NA
7037393,"Remote Sensing Satellites And Privacy: A Framework For Policy Assessment","Current and forthcoming capabilities of remote sensing technology will affect the ease with which satellites provide newer or less expensive means for uncovering otherwise private information. Consequently, RSS (Remote Sensing Satellites) technology is moving from the relatively obscure domains of oil companies and military strategists to the attention of those concerned with privacy rights and the social, political, and economic consequences of access to and distribution of information. We explicate factors determining how, if at all, to control the use and availability of information gathered by remote sensing satellites. While we discuss the intrinsic value of privacy, we emphasize the economic and social objectives privacy rights instrumental^ promote, such as incentives to generate information and to promote competition or cooperation. To evaluate the need for policy regarding RSS data flows, we propose some generalizations on the effects and desirability of RSS-supplied information. An important consideration is the extent to which relations between the observer and the observed should be regarded as adversarial or complementary. Applying the framework to four categories of problematic situations, depending upon whether the observer or the observed are private parties or governmental entities, illuminates the effects RSS may have on market competition, political systems, civil liberties, and international agreements. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

7036858,"Geometric Accuracy Assessment Of Very High-Resolution Optical Data Orthorectified Using Terrasar-X Dsm To Support Disaster Management In Indonesia","Advanced remote sensing satellite data with detail spatial resolution can be an alternative to aerial photography and outweigh in providing rapid and vast spatial, remote area, and consist of multispectral bands to produce continues information. The various types of very high spatial resolution satellite, benefit in producing information for large-scale mappings, such as updating an urban map and supporting disaster management for mitigation, preparedness, emergency response, and recovery effectively and efficiently. Large-scale mapping information for disaster management, particularly for quick response is essential to map the impacted sites, measure the number of houses and infrastructure damaged and determine the evacuation area. However, in producing large-scale mapping, the information should refer to the geospatial specification standard, such as accurate geometric, detail thematic information and completeness. This study aims to identify the use of Pleiades imagery for supporting large-scale mapping, including for disaster management by assessing the geometry accuracy from a standard product acquired from the ground station and precise orthorectification using different types of DSM, including TerraSAR-X and improvement using ground control points. The results show that the improved accuracy to meet geometric accuracy standard for scale 1:5000 can be achieved using a primary product data which process using an insertion of GCPs and selecting the better DSM, while for the standard ortho product can be achieved using shifting the coordinate position of the image. Assessment of the thematic extraction visually shows that the imagery meets the information for large-scale mapping, but detail attribution requires information from field data. © 2018 Insight Society.",NA,NA,"article",NA,"10.18517/ijaseit.8.6.7486","{""notes"": ""('sari_geometricaccuracyassessmentresolution_2018',)""}","{}",2024-10-30 17:22:24,"included",NA,NA
7037411,"Identifying Effective Approaches For Monitoring National Natural Capital For Policy Use","In order to effectively manage natural resources at national scales national decision makers require data on the natural capital which supports the delivery of Ecosystem Services (ES). Key data sources used for the provision of national natural capital metrics include Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS), which provides information on land cover at an increasing range of resolutions, and field survey, which can provide very high resolution data on ecosystem components, but is constrained in its potential coverage by resource requirements. Here we combine spatially representative field data from a historic national survey of Great Britain (Countryside Survey (CS)) with concurrent low resolution SRS data land cover map within modelling frameworks to produce national natural capital metrics. We present three examples of natural capital metrics; top soil carbon, headwater stream quality and nectar species plant richness which show how highly resolved, but spatially representative field data can be used to significantly enhance the potential of low resolution SRS land cover data for providing national spatial data on natural capital metrics which have been linked to Ecosystem Services (ES). We discuss the role of such metrics in evaluations of ecosystem service provision and areas of further development to improve their utility for stakeholders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

6863184,"Grassland Wildfires In The Southern Great Plains: Monitoring Ecological Impacts And Recovery","Devastating wildfires in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas in 2016 and 2017 resulted in significant social, economic, and environmental losses, with the agricultural sector among those severely affected. Several satellite-based indices were evaluated as potential monitoring tools for post-wildfire ecological recovery and management of grasslands. All indices evaluated provided useful information and indicated rapid vegetation recovery from wildfire. The Leaf Water Stress Index (LSWI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) showed a distinct response to the wildfire events, and differentiated between burned and unburned areas throughout the post-wildfire growing seasons better than the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI). In particular, the LSWI may provide a useful tool for mapping the footprint of wildfire, with potential utility for organizations that provide post-fire recovery resources. The GPP, which estimates the biomass productivity of vegetation, can provide information to livestock operators to guide the re-stocking of cattle in the aftermath of wildfire. In sum, satellite-based proxies can provide timely information both to characterize a wildfire's footprint and to guide post-fire grazing management in a manner that balances short term needs for forage with long-term productivity and ecological function.",2020,"{""Brown, David"",""Robertson, Shelby"",""Steiner, Jean L."",""Teet, Stephen"",""Wang, Jie"",""Wetter, Jeffrey"",""Wu, Xiaocui"",""Xiao, Xiangming"",""Zhou, Yuting""}","article",NA,"10.3390/rs12040619","{""notes"": ""('steiner_grasslandwildfiressouthernplains_2020',)""}","{}",2024-07-15 16:02:36,"included",NA,NA

The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphere–fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexico’s 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made.
