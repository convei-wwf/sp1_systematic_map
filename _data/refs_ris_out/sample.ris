TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Outdoor Thermal Comfort Assessment In Local Climate Zones In The Rural–Urban Continuum Of Ethekwini Municipality, South Africa
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Due to the need to continuously monitor and understand the thermal environment and its socioeconomic implications, this study used remotely sensed data to analyze thermal comfort variation in LCZs, including along the rural to urban gradient of the eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. LCZs were mapped using multi-temporal and multi-spectral Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 data using the approach by World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT), while thermal data were used to retrieve land surface temperatures (LSTs). Data for training classification of LCZs and accuracy assessment were digitized from GoogleEarth guided by knowledge gained and data collected during a field survey in March 2022 as well as pre-existing maps. LCZs were mapped using the random forest classifier in SAGA GIS software while a single channel algorithm based on band 10 was used to compute LST for different scenes. The LSTs were adjusted and further used to derive thermal comfort based on the Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) categories as an indicator for outdoor thermal comfort on the extremely low- and extremely high-temperature periods in the cool and hot seasons, respectively. LCZs were mapped with high accuracy (overall accuracy of 90.1% and kappa of 0.88) while inter-class separability was high (>1.5) for all LCZ pairs. Built-up LCZs dominate the eastern parts of the municipality, signifying the influence of the sea on development within the area. Average LST was coolest in the dense forest, open low-rise and water LCZs in the cool and hot seasons, respectively. The compact high-rise LCZ was the warmest in both the hot (36 °C) and the cool (23 °C) seasons. The sea sands were among coolest regions in both seasons due to their high water content, attributed to their high water table and close proximity to the ocean. There was no thermal stress during the cool season, while most areas recorded moderate to strong heat stress in the hot season. Some areas in the densely built-up LCZs recorded very strong heat stress in the hot season. The findings suggest that policies and strategies should enhance heat mitigation capacities in strong-heat-stress areas during the hot season. Municipal authorities and citizens must work together to build strategies to minimize temperature extremes and associated socioeconomic pressures. Urban development policies, plans and strategies should consider implications on the thermal environment as well as the value of conservation of LCZs with high-heat mitigation value such as dense forests and expansion of built-up LCZs with low-heat absorption levels such as open low-rise. The study was based mainly on remotely sensed temperatures with some ground data used to validate results, which may limit the assessment. Overall, the study provides insights towards achievement of global sustainable and climate-smart development targets. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - The Impact Of Crop Farmers’ Decisions On Future Land Use, Land Cover Changes In Kintampo North Municipality Of Ghana
JO  - International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management
PY  - 2019
AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to assess the rate and land category contributing to the changes in seven land-uses in the Kintampo North Municipality of Ghana and the effect of the decisions of land users on future landscapes. Design/methodology/approach: LANDSAT images were classified to generate land use/cover maps to detect changes that had occurred between 1986 and 2014. In total, 120 farmers were also interviewed to determine their perceptions on land use changes. Interval, category and transition levels of changes were determined. Savanna woodland, settlement and forest were mostly converted to farmland in both intervals (1986-2001 and 2001-2014). Findings: Results showed that rock outcrop, plantation, cropland and savanna woodland increased at an annual rate of 13.86, 1.57, 0.82 and 0.33 per cent, respectively, whilst forest, settlement and water body decreased at 4.90, 1.84 and 1.17 per cent annual rate of change, respectively. Approximately, 74 per cent of farmers will not change land use in the future, while 84.2 per cent plan to increase farm sizes. Research limitations/implications: The study shows that more land cover will be targeted for conversion as farmers expand their farmlands. There is the need for strict implementation of appropriate land use/cover policies to sustain food production in the region in this era of changing climate and population increase. Originality/value: This research assessed the land use changes in the Kintampo North Municipality and its impacts on agriculture and carbon stocks release via land use changes. It identified how the decisions of the local farmers on land management will affect future landscape. © 2019, Enoch Bessah, Abdullahi Bala, Sampson Kweku Agodzo, Appollonia Aimiosino Okhimamhe, Emmanuel Amoah Boakye and Saratu Usman Ibrahim.

TI  - Carbon Emission Patterns And Carbon Balance Zoning In Urban Territorial Spaces Based On Multisource Data: A Case Study Of Suzhou City, China
JO  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information
PY  - 2023
AB  - The concept of green and low-carbon development is integrated into territorial spatial planning and district control research. It is one of the systematic policy tools for emission reduction and carbon sequestration, greatly contributing to achieving the double carbon goal. This paper presents a method for measuring the carbon emissions of urban territorial spaces using multisource big data, aiming to identify the spatial patterns and levels of carbon emissions at microspatial scales. The spatial patterns of carbon emissions were used to construct a carbon balance zoning method to evaluate the regional differences in the spatial distribution of carbon emissions, taking Suzhou as an example to achieve carbon balance zoning at the micro scale of the city. Based on our research, the following was determined: (1) Suzhou’s total carbon emissions in 2020 was approximately 240.3 million tons, with the industrial sector accounting for 81.32% of these emissions. The total carbon sink was about 0.025 million tons. (2) In Suzhou City, the high-value plots of carbon emissions are mainly located in industrial agglomeration areas. By contrast, low-value plots are primarily located in suburban areas and various carbon sink functional areas, exhibiting a scattered distribution. (3) The territorial space unit was divided into four functional areas of carbon balance, with 36 low-carbon economic zone units accounting for 37.11%, 29 carbon-source control zone units accounting for 29.90%, 14 carbon-sink functional zone units accounting for 14.43%, and 18 high-carbon optimization zone units accounting for 18.56%. As a result of this study, carbon balance zoning was achieved at the grassroots space level, which will assist the city in low-carbon and refined urban governance. Some ideas and references are also provided to formulate policies for low-carbon development at the micro scale of a city. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Environmental Impact Assessment Of Transportation And Land Alteration Using Earth Observational Datasets: Comparative Study Between Cities In Asia And Europe
JO  - Heliyon
PY  - 2023
AB  - Developments in the transportation field are emerging because of the growing worldwide demand and upgrading requirements. This study measured the transportation development, shortage distance, and decadal land transformation of Kuala Lumpur and Madrid using various remote sensing and GIS approaches. The kernel density estimation (KDE) tool was applied for road and railway density analysis, and hotspot information increased the knowledge about assessable areas. Landsat datasets were used (1991–2021) for land transformation and related analyses. The built-up land increased by 1327.27 and 404.09 km2 in Kuala Lumpur and Madrid, respectively. In the last thirty years, the temperature increased 6.45 °C in Kuala Lumpur and 4.15 °C in Madrid owing to urban expansion and road construction. Chamberi, Retiro, Moratalaz, Salama, Wangsa Maju, Titiwangsa, Bukit Bintang, and Seputeh have very high road densities. KDE measurements showed that the road densities in Kuala Lumpur (4498.34) and Madrid (9099.15) were high in the central parts of the city, and the railway densities were 348.872 and 2197.87, respectively. The observed P values were 0.99 and 0.96 for traffic signals and 0.98 and 0.99 for bus stops, respectively. The information provided by this study can support local planners, administrators, scientists, and researchers in understanding the global transportation issues that require implementation strategies for ensuring sustainable livelihoods. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - Seeing The Broader Picture: Stakeholder Contributions To Understanding Infrastructure Impacts Of The Interoceanic Highway In The Southwestern Amazon
JO  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is a large research literature on the impacts of roads and other infrastructure, which highlights the economic benefits, environmental harms and social problems. Most previous research on infrastructure impacts adopts a top-down approach, such as via the use of governmental or remotely-sensed data. This paper argues that a bottom-up approach that features stakeholder perspectives offers complementary advantages to understanding infrastructure impacts that can support improved planning and governance. We conducted stakeholder workshops about impacts of the Interoceanic Highway in the tri-national "MAP" frontier of the southwestern Amazon. The findings confirm previous research in several respects, but also indicate several contrasts. The range of impacts is much broader than topics featured in previous research, and some of the most commonly reported problems, such as diverse forms of crime, have been rarely studied as infrastructure impacts. We conclude by discussing the implications, in terms of criminological research on infrastructure impacts, synergies among diverse impacts of infrastructure, and improved planning of infrastructure for better governance of impacts.

JO  - Hrvatski Geografski Glasnik
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper outlines the primary research conducted on the small island of Ilovik, Croatia and the following spatial statistical analysis performed with a central goal of examining current sustainability of the village and providing future planning recommendations. For two weeks in mid-June of 2011, residents were interviewed about their current socio-economic status and perceptions of tourism, the natural environment, and government. Their responses were assigned numeric values with dummy variables excluding the least common response, and were entered as attributes of building footprint polygons digitized in a GIS to allow for spatial statistical analysis. Tests included Local and Global Getis Ord G, Ordinary Least Squares, and Geographically Weighted Regression. Clear hot and cold spots were found, showing where additional water sources are needed or where water quality should be addressed and that a coastal vs. inland divide exists. Weak correlations existed between income and all other attributes, but from the results one could suggest a focus on increasing tourism and decreasing the supply of houses for sale.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment In Mountainous Area: A Case Study Of Sichuan-Tibet Railway, China
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the southeastern Tibetan Plateau with complex geological conditions, the frequent and disastrous geological hazards have posed a severe challenge to the construction and operation safety of the planning Sichuan-Tibet railway. Based on the remote sensing and field investigation, the detailed landslide inventory of Jiacha-Langxian segment of Sichuan-Tibet railway was established. After analyzing the general development characteristics of landslides, a total of seven causative variables were selected as input parameters to evaluate landslide susceptibility using the weight of the evidence model. Combined with the probability prediction map and field validation, the landslide susceptibility was classified into four categories: very high, high, moderate and low susceptibility. Based on the landslide susceptibility assessment map, the very high and high susceptibility zones are mainly distributed on the both sides of the Yarlung Zangbo river and its tributaries, and the moderate and low susceptibility zones are located 5 km north to the river. Considering the terrain and landslide disaster prone situation in this region, the planning railway line in tunnel on the north bank of the Yarlung Zangbo river is considered to be reasonable. As for the subgrade and bridge section of the railway, especially for tunnel entrance, necessary slope reinforcement should be carried out. Considering the objective safety threat from landslides to the railway, we hold the opinion that it is necessary to compare the scheme of changing route and taking engineering protection measures in the Langzhen-Langxian segment.

TI  - Hydrogen Isotopes As A Sentinel Of Biological Invasion By The Japanese Beetle, <I>Popillia Japonica</I> (Newman)
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2016
AB  - Invasive species alter ecosystems, threaten native and endangered species, and have negative economic impacts. Knowing where invading individuals are from and when they arrive to a new site can guide management. Here, we evaluated how well the stable hydrogen isotope composition (delta H-2) records the recent origin and time since arrival of specimens of the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica Newman) captured near the Portland International Airport (Oregon, U.S.A.). The delta H-2 of Japanese beetle specimens collected from sites across the contiguous U.S.A. reflected the delta H-2 of local precipitation, a relationship similar to that documented for other organisms, and one confirming the utility of delta H-2 as a geographic fingerprint. Within weeks after experimental relocation to a new isotopic environment, the delta H-2 of beetles changed linearly with time, demonstrating the potential for delta H-2 to also mark the timing of arrival to a new location. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the recent geographical origin and timing of arrival of each specimen based on its delta H-2 value. The geographic resolution was broad, with values consistent with multiple regions of origin in the eastern U.S.A., slightly favoring the southeastern U.S.A. as the more likely source. Beetles trapped from 2007-2010 had arrived 30 or more days prior to trapping, whereas the median time since arrival declined to 3-7 days for beetles trapped from 2012-2014. This reduction in the time between arrival and trapping at the Portland International Airport supports the efficacy of trapping and spraying to prevent establishment. More generally, our analysis shows how stable isotopes can serve as sentinels of biological invasions, verifying the efficacy of control measures, or, alternatively, indicating when those measures show signs of failure.

TI  - Empirical Correction Of Stray Light Within The Meris Oxygen A-Band Channel
JO  - Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology
PY  - 2010
AB  - Spaceborne spectrometers like the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on board the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) are widely used for the remote sensing of atmospheric and oceanic properties and make an important contribution to the monitoring of the earth's atmosphere system. To enable retrievals with high accuracy, the spectral and radiometric properties of the instruments have to be characterized with high precision. One of the main sources of radiometric errors is stray light caused by multiple reflections and scattering at the optical elements within the instruments. If not corrected for properly, the stray light-induced offsets of measured intensity can lead to significant errors in the derived parameters. The effect of stray light is particularly momentous in the case of measurements inside strong absorption bands like the oxygen A band at 0.76 μm or the ρστ absorption band of water vapor around 0.9 μm. For example, the retrieval of surface and cloud-top pressure from MERIS measurements in the O2 A band can be biased because of an insufficient correction of stray light in the operational processing chain. To correct for the residual stray light influence after the operational stray light correction in the O2 A-band channel of MERIS, an empirical stray light correction of the measured radiance at 0.76 μm has been developed based on optimizing the coefficients of a simple brightness-dependent stray light model. The optimal model coefficients were found by adjusting the retrievals of surface and cloud-top pressure to accurate reference data for several selected scenes. To account for the limited accuracy of the MERIS spectral calibration, the center wavelength of the O2 A-band channel was additionally adjusted within a ±0.1-nm tolerance range. The correction was tested on a variety of clear and cloudy scenes at different locations by applying the surface and cloud-top pressure retrieval algorithms to data recorded over the whole lifetime of MERIS. The results indicate the potential to greatly improve the accuracy of the retrieved pressure values using the proposed correction factors. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Earth Observation And Machine Learning To Meet Sustainable Development Goal 8.7: Mapping Sites Associated With Slavery From Space
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - A large proportion of the workforce in the brick kilns of the Brick Belt of Asia are modern-day slaves. Work to liberate slaves and contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 8.7 would benefit from maps showing the location of brick kilns. Previous work has shown that brick kilns can be accurately identified and located visually from fine spatial resolution remote-sensing images. Furthermore, via crowdsourcing, it would be possible to map very large areas. However, concerns over the ability to maintain a motivated crowd to allow accurate mapping over time together with the development of advanced machine learning methods suggest considerable potential for rapid, accurate and repeatable automated mapping of brick kilns. This potential is explored here using fine spatial resolution images of a region of Rajasthan, India. A contemporary deep-learning classifier founded on region-based convolution neural networks (R-CNN), the Faster R-CNN, was trained to classify brick kilns. This approach mapped all of the brick kilns within the study area correctly, with a producer's accuracy of 100%, but at the cost of substantial over-estimation of kiln numbers. Applying a second classifier to the outputs substantially reduced the over-estimation. This second classifier could be visual classification, which, as it focused on a relatively small number of sites, should be feasible to acquire, or an additional automated classifier. The result of applying a CNN classifier to the outputs of the original classification was a map with an overall accuracy of 94.94% with both low omission and commission error that should help direct anti-slavery activity on the ground. These results indicate that contemporary Earth observation resources and machine learning methods may be successfully applied to help address slavery from space. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - What's Your Angle? Analyzing Angled Parking Via Satellite Imagery To Aid Bike-Network Planning
JO  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
PY  - 2021
AB  - U.S. cities prioritize the storage of automobiles over the safe movement of bicycles. While this generally occurs by allocating street curbs for car parking instead of bike lanes, the privileging of the automobile is even more evident in the case ofangledparking, in which cars sit roughly perpendicular to the flow of traffic. Such a layout takes up nearly double the space in the right of way as does parallel parking, which leaves even less room for bike lanes. Though angled parking is defended as a traffic-calming measure, numerous studies indicate that this layout is associated with higher rates of collisions than parallel parking. In addition, angled parking also inherently increases the number of cars that can be parked along a given curb, which incentivizes automobile travel generally. However, one challenge of understanding the impact that angled parking has on safety and bicycle infrastructure is that cities do not always maintain accurate records as to where angled parking occurs. For example, San Francisco, CA has ambitious air-quality, climate-mitigation, and active transportation goals, all of which are undermined by angled parking. Yet, its supply of this parking layout is unquantified, given that parking angle was omitted from the city's parking census. This study uses satellite imagery to resolve this data gap, and calculates that San Francisco dedicates 50 miles of street curbs to angled parking. While some assume angled parking is a planning response to San Francisco's famed hills, the majority of it occurs on streets with no incline at all. As to angled parking's traffic-calming effect, this benefit appears to be non-existent in San Francisco; average vehicle speeds differed by less than a half-mile per hour between angled-parking streets and adjacent non-angled streets. The angled parking identified here-particularly the four miles that overlap with the city's bike-lane network-represents opportunities for conversion to more balanced road layouts. Overall, this methodology can serve as the basis for identifying angled parking in other cities, a configuration that should be re-evaluated by transportation planners given its car-centric effects, debatable ability to calm traffic, and preclusion of separated bicycle facilities.

TI  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle And Ground Remote Sensing Applied In 3d Reconstruction Of Historical Building Groups In Ancient Villages
JO  - 5th International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications, EORSA 2018 - Proceedings
PY  - 2018
AB  - As an important carrier of material cultural heritage, historical building groups (HBGs) in ancient villages full of historical imprint and architectural aesthetics value. However, the historical building groups undermines from natural and human activities constantly, thus the 3D digital protection for the historical building groups being of great urgency. Aiming at 3D real modeling for historical building groups in ancient villages with high-precise and fine real simulation, this paper put forward a technology process based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) Remote Sensing(RS) and Ground RS technology. During the RS image acquisition, low-altitude RS images acquired by Remote Sensor on Multi-rotor UAV and ground RS images acquired by Remote Sensor on 3-Axis Handheld Stabilized Camera. In the technology process, firstly, the Relative Orientation(RO) of ground RS images solved by Automatic Vertical Aerial Triangulation(AV-AT), the Exterior Orientation(EO) of ground RS images solved by Rigid Registration with the production of AV-AT and Photo Control Point(PCP); Secondly, the EO of low altitude RS images solved by Rigid Registration with PCP and Photo Position Metadata; finally, based on the above EO, Context Capture conduct 3D real modeling process, in which contains supplemental images matching, colored point cloud generating, point cloud optimization, TIN generating and texture mapping. The technology process applied in the 3D real modeling of a typical historical village in Dongguan, and the precision of production was evaluated by geometry measurement. In the 3D real modeling results of large cultural heritage, preliminary experiments shows that the precision of geometry and the spatial resolution of texture mapping is generally better than the Grade I according to the Specification for the Digital Products of 3D Model on Geographic Information. Therefore, the technology process achieves the integrating low-altitude RS images with ground RS images, makes full use of the advantages of different position of the RS from ground and low-altitude, and it is able to acquire more complete image information for large cultural heritages, with obvious advantages in building a 3D real scene model in high accuracy and good recovery. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Characterizing The Climatic Niche Of Mast Seeding In Beech: Evidences Of Trade-Offs Between Vegetation Growth And Seed Production
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2021
AB  - Masting is a complex mechanism which is mainly driven by a combination of internal plant resources and climatic conditions. While the driving role of climate in masting is being intensively studied, the interplay among climate, seed production, vegetation growth and phenology still needs further investigation. The objectives of this study were to identify the climatic determinants of different levels of seed production and of NDVI-based vegetation growth and phenology in European beech, and to evaluate if exists a trade-off between these two plant processes. To answer these questions, we used a 25-year-long dataset of beech seed production. We exploited the concept of ecological niche assuming that a mast year can be modeled like a species with variable preferences for different resources, which are the underlying annual climatic conditions; we performed an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), a presence-only modeling tool conventionally used in zoology and botany, and used seasonal (spring, summer, autumn) Standardized Precipitation-Evaporation Index (SPEI) observations, considering the current year (y−0), and up to one (y−1) and two (y−2) years before the masting event. For analyzing the role of vegetation growth and phenology, we used seasonal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and associated NDVI-based phenological metrics derived from Landsat imagery. Results indicated the driving role of climate for masting, especially in VHSP years. A moist summer and dry spring at y−2 and a dry summer at y−1 represented the main driving climatic conditions for masting; while a moist spring during the observation year represented the key condition for triggering higher intensities of seed production. Summer NDVI at y−0 and y−1 represented the variables discriminating best between masting and non-masting years and resulted as driven by opposite summer climatic conditions than seed production, thus indicating a trade-off between seed production and vegetation phenology. We concluded that reproduction and vegetation growth act as two different climate-dependent plant responses in beech, in a way that certain conditions through the years promote mast seeding and the opposite conditions favor vegetation growth. The understanding of climate-growth-masting relationships represents indispensable knowledge for providing a holistic view of masting mechanisms and developing adaptive forest management strategies in this species. © 2020

TI  - A New Method For Spatial Estimation Of Water Quality Using An Optimal Virtual Sensor Network And In Situ Observations: A Case Study Of Chemical Oxygen Demand
JO  - SENSORS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate water quality estimation is important for water environment monitoring and water resource management and has emerged as a pivotal aspect of ecological rehabilitation and sustainable development. However, due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of water quality parameters, it is still challenging to obtain highly accurate spatial patterns of them. Taking chemical oxygen demand as an example, this study proposes a novel estimation method for generating highly accurate chemical oxygen demand fields in Poyang Lake. Specifically, based on the different water levels and monitoring sites in Poyang Lake, an optimal virtual sensor network was first established. A Taylor expansion-based method with integration of spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity was developed by considering environmental factors, the optimal virtual sensor network, and existing monitoring stations. The proposed approach was evaluated and compared with other approaches using a leave-one cross-validation process. Results show that the proposed method exhibits good performance in estimating chemical oxygen demand fields in Poyang Lake, with mean absolute error improved by 8\% and 33\%, respectively, on average, when compared with classical interpolators and remote sensing methods. In addition, the applications of virtual sensors improve the performance of the proposed method, with mean absolute error and root mean squared error values reduced by 20\% to 60\% over 12 months. The proposed method provides an effective tool for estimating highly accurate spatial fields of chemical oxygen demand concentrations and could be applied to other water quality parameters.

TI  - Digital Mapping Of Soil Ecosystem Services In Scotland Using Neural Networks And Relationship Modelling—Part 1: Mapping Of Soil Classes
JO  - Soil Use and Management
PY  - 2019
AB  - A digital mapping approach was applied to soils in Scotland, producing maps at 100-m resolution and different levels of classification. This used neural networks to predict fuzzy soil class weightings based upon site descriptors from existing soil survey data. The intention of this work was to produce a set of soil maps for Scotland, which provide greater spatial resolution mapping than currently available, and provide fuzzy data to be used in mapping of ecosystem services using a novel approach explained in a second paper. When selecting the class with the highest weighting for test data points, Producer's Accuracy of 70.7% was achieved in mapping the broadest classification (five classes), while Producer's Accuracy levels of 59.9% and 43.7% were achieved for 11 and 30 classes, respectively. Evaluation of confusion matrices generated from the neural network model tests showed that, particularly for the classification systems with 11 and 30 classes, misclassification errors were more common between similar soil classes than between classes that were very different from one another. This implies that straightforward estimation of classification accuracy that measures “correct” and “incorrect” gives misleading results, and that the fuzzy classification maps are more useful than the crisp classification accuracy values. These fuzzy classification maps are therefore potentially useful for evaluating ecosystem services relating to soil type. We conclude that the mapping approach used here provides a classification accuracy comparable to other approaches and that the outputs can be used for mapping soil properties, processes, functions and ecosystem services. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science

TI  - Determining The Habitat Fragmentation Thru Geoscience Capabilities In Turkey: A Case Study Of Wildlife Refuges
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Technical forest management started 180 years ago in Turkey, during which time there have been various approaches and policy changes. The primary objective of forestry has been considered as timber production, so the intangible benefits have never been given the proper attention they deserve. The majority of Turkey's wildlife has prospered within the forest ecosystems. This situation has gradually led to a change of status, so some forests and land areas have been reassigned with the conservation agendas as the primary purpose; however timber production has never slowed down. Thus, operational forestry practices, such as roading, logging, etc., have kept on exploiting these lands to their full extent despite their conservation statuses. In Turkey and anywhere else, since forestry has always evolved around extracting the timber out of the forest lands, the accessibility has long been provided, building roads to take related services to forested ecosystems. The remnants of these roads, along with the more standardized new ones can be found everywhere, regardless of the land status. Such expansion has resulted in habitat fragmentation emerging as a major threat for the protected areas. In this study, the expansion of all-weather and dry-weather accessible roads and suburban spread was examined in two adjacent, Ilgaz and Gavurdagi, wildlife refuges for the years of 1960, 1993, 2010 and 2019, relying heavily on the mapping, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. It was found that 275.5 km dry-weather roads in 1960 rose to 700 km in 2019, which meant 254\% increase. Additionally, when the core along with the surrounding 3000 m buffer area was considered, 51 km all-weather roads in 1960 increased almost four and a half times by 2019. Suburban expansion was relatively stable inside the core area but had almost quadrupled within the surrounding areas, exposing the refuges to more people. These findings indicated that the wildlife habitats of Turkey are fragmented and under heavy human pressure.

TI  - Development Of A Benchmark Eddy Flux Evapotranspiration Dataset For Evaluation Of Satellite-Driven Evapotranspiration Models Over The Conus
JO  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - A large sample of ground-based evapotranspiration (ET) measurements made in the United States, primarily from eddy covariance systems, were post-processed to produce a benchmark ET dataset. The dataset was produced primarily to support the intercomparison and evaluation of the OpenET satellite-based remote sensing ET (RSET) models and could also be used to evaluate ET data from other models and approaches. OpenET is a web-based service that makes field-delineated and pixel-level ET estimates from well-established RSET models readily available to water managers, agricultural producers, and the public. The benchmark dataset is composed of flux and meteorological data from a variety of providers covering native vegetation and agricultural settings. Flux footprint predictions were developed for each station and included static flux footprints developed based on average wind direction and speed, as well as dynamic hourly footprints that were generated with a physically based model of upwind source area. The two footprint prediction methods were rigorously compared to evaluate their relative spatial coverage. Data from all sources were post-processed in a consistent and reproducible manner including data handling, gap-filling, temporal aggregation, and energy balance closure correction. The resulting dataset included 243,048 daily and 5,284 monthly ET values from 194 stations, with all data falling between 1995 and 2021. We assessed average daily energy imbalance using 172 flux sites with a total of 193,021 days of data, finding that overall turbulent fluxes were understated by about 12\% on average relative to available energy. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that daily average latent energy flux may be typically understated slightly more than sensible heat flux. This dataset was developed to provide a consistent reference to support evaluation of RSET data being developed for a wide range of applications related to water accounting and water resources management at field to watershed scales.

TI  - Data-Driven Optimal Scheduling For Underground Space Based Integrated Hydrogen Energy System
JO  - IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Integrated hydrogen energy systems (IHESs) have attracted extensive attention in mitigating climate problems. As a kind of large-scale hydrogen storage device, underground hydrogen storage (UHS) can be introduced into IHES to balance the seasonal energy mismatch, while bringing challenges to optimal operation of IHES due to the complex geological structure and uncertain hydrodynamics. To address this problem, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based optimal scheduling method for underground space based IHES is proposed. The energy management problem is formulated as a Markov decision process to characterize the interaction between environmental states and policy. Based on DDPG theory, the actor-critic structure is applied to approximate deterministic policy and actor-value function. Through policy iteration and actor-critic network training, the operation of UHS and other energy conversion devices can be adaptively optimised, which is driven by real-time response data instead of accurate system models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling method and the benefits of underground space are verified through time-domain simulations.

TI  - Factors Controlling Hydrological Processes And Characteristics In The Susita Catchment Area - Romania
JO  - Journal of Environmental Protection and Ecology
PY  - 2018
AB  - Within this paper are evaluated some climatic factors which impact the hydrological responses in Susita catchment area. The Susita River is located in the Eastern part of Romania, between the Curvature Carpathians and the Lower Siret Plain, covering a surface of 370 km2. The data used in this paper were provided by specialised institutions, such as the National Meteorological Administration, Water Management Agency Vrancea, or from GIS data sources. Time series of precipitation and mean temperature values were statistically and spatially analysed in the catchment area. Based on Thornthwaite relationship there have been determined the annual values of potential evapotranspiration used latter in correlations. The results consist in representation of the precipitation, air temperatures, potential evapotranspiration and discharges regime in inter-annual regime. Also correlations between variables such as temperature, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation and discharges where conducted at different timescales to for Susita catchment, at Ciuruc stream gauge. Another result consists in mass curve analysis with the aim to identify the changes in the relations between precipitation and discharges. The correlations between precipitation and discharges are considered to be good especially at multi-annual regime, while the temperature and the evapotranspiration are negatively correlated with the discharges but are not representative in describing a direct link between them. From the performed analysis has been observed the connections between the climatic factors and flow regime. The analysis of physical factors that determine the hydrological regime represents an important step towards a continuous hydrological modelling parameterisation, through which can be observed the effects of environmental change on the flowing regime. © 2018 Scibulcom Ltd.

TI  - Sparse Representation-Based Inundation Depth Estimation Using Sar Data And Digital Elevation Model
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Floods increase every year worldwide, and prompt information about the affected areas is essential for early disaster response. There has been extensive development in applying remote sensing data to identify floods. In fact, remote sensing data are the only tool to identify the extent of large-scale floods within hours after their occurrence. However, few studies have addressed methods to estimate inundation depth. Inundation depth can be advantageous for identifying areas where people may need assistance during evacuation and estimating damage loss. We present a practical application of sparse representation that integrates a synthetic aperture radar-based flood binary map with a digital elevation model to estimate inundation depths. We assume that the floodwaters can be modeled as a combination of water bodies at a state of rest. A dictionary of water bodies computed under potential inundation levels is constructed from the digital elevation model. Then, the actual flood extent is represented as a sparse linear combination of the water body dictionary. The inundation depth can be estimated because each water body from the linear combination is associated with an inundation level. To assess our proposed procedure, we computed the inundation depth of the flood in the town of Mabi, Okayama Prefecture, produced during the 2018 heavy rainfall. An average absolute value difference of about 60 cm between our results and a field survey performed by a third party was observed. Two other floods produced by the 2019 Hagibis typhoon were analyzed to illustrate the relevant information that can provide inundation depths. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Topology Optimization Design Of A Space Mirror
PY  - 2015
AB  - As key components of the optical system of the space optical remote sensor, Space mirrors' surface accuracy had a direct impact that could't be ignored of the imaging quality of the remote sensor. In the future, large-diameter mirror would become an important trend in the development of space optical technology. However, a sharp increase in the mirror diameter would cause the deformation of the mirror and increase the thermal deformation caused by temperature variations. A reasonable lightweight structure designed to ensure the optical performance of the system to meet the requirements was required. As a new type of lightweight approach, topology optimization technology was an important direction of the current space optical remote sensing technology research. The lightweight design of rectangular mirror was studied. the variable density method of topology optimization was used. The mirror type precision of the mirror assemblies was obtained in different conditions. PV value was less than lambda/10 and RMS value was less than lambda/50(lambda = 632.8nm). The results show that the entire The mirror assemblies can achieve a sufficiently high static rigidity, dynamic stiffness and thermal stability and has the capability of sufficient resistance to external environmental interference.

JO  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
PY  - 2014
AB  - During the 200912010 summer, a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the waste-water discharge at Davis Station, East Antarctica was completed. As part of this, histological alteration of gill and liver tissue in Antarctic Rock-cod (Trematomus bernacchii) from four sites along a spatial gradient from the wastewater outfall were assessed. All fish within 800 m of the outfall exhibited significant histological changes in both tissues. Common pathologies observed in fish closest to the outfall include proliferation of epithelial cells with associated secondary lamellar fusion in the gills and multifocal granulomata with inflammation and necrosis as well as cysts in the liver. Fish from sites >800 m from the outfall also exhibited alterations but to a lesser degree, with prevalence and severity decreasing with increasing distance from the outfall. This study highlights the value of histopathological investigations as part of EIAs and provides the first evidence of sub-lethal alteration associated with wastewater discharge in East Antarctica.

TI  - Distribution And Extent Of Benthic Habitats In Puck Bay (Gulf Of Gdansk, Southern Baltic Sea)
JO  - OCEANOLOGIA
PY  - 2021
AB  - The majority of the southern Baltic Sea seabed encompasses homogenous soft-bottom sediments of limited productivity and low biological diversity, but shallow productive areas in the coastal zone such as wetlands, vegetated lagoons and sheltered bays show a high variety of benthic habitat types offering favourable biotopic conditions for benthic fauna. Within Polish marine areas, semi-enclosed Puck Bay (the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk) features an exceptionally diverse environment covering a range of benthic habitats which underscores its unique biological value and aesthetic quality and providing an impetus for conservation and ecosystem-based development. Full-coverages maps on benthic habitats in this area are therefore a necessary foundation for maritime spatial planning and implementation of strategies for sustainable management and protection of the coastal environment. This study presents the first comprehensive description and distribution of benthic habitats in Puck Bay which were categorised using the revised EUNIS 2019 classification system. Typological analyses were carried out based on inventory datasets from 1995 to 2019 including scientific publications, satellite images, open databases, topographic and geological maps, reports, theses, information available on websites and unpublished data shared willingly by individual researchers and administrative institutions. Collating various spatial data sources, that were first georeferenced and then visualized using techniques available in ArcMap 10.4.1 software (Esri), resulted in the mapping of benthic habitats and sites of important and protected plant species, which can contribute to the high confidence in environmental assessments and monitoring activities.

TI  - Emerging Technologies For Assessing Ecosystem Services: A Synthesis Of Opportunities And Challenges
JO  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
PY  - 2023
AB  - Rapid technological development opens up new opportunities for assessing ecosystem services (ES), which may help to overcome current knowledge gaps and limitations in data availability. At the same time, emerging technologies, such as mobile devices, social media platforms, and artificial intelligence, give rise to a series of challenges and limitations. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the broad range of technologies that are increasingly used for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data on ES, including Earth observation, mobile technologies, data science, modeling/simulation, immersive technologies, visualization, and web-based tools. To identify current opportunities and challenges, we systematically reviewed the literature on ES of the last 10 years (2012-2022). We first describe the state-of-the-art of emerging technologies, synthesizing their applicability, opportunities, and limitations. Then, we discuss open issues, future research needs, and potential for further applications in ES research. Our findings indicate great opportunities to increase knowledge on ES thanks to low costs, high data availability, and high flexibility of the technologies. We also find a strong potential to support decision-making, learning and communication. However, limitations and challenges related to the accuracy of the variables and models, accessibility to data, technologies, and information as well as ethical concerns need to be addressed by the research community to assure an inclusive and meaningful use of the technologies. Our findings also suggest that further insights into ES may be achieved through a better integration of different technologies in the future, e.g., Earth observation, data science, and web-based platforms, a stronger transdisciplinary collaboration to advance knowledge on ES, and by broadening the perspective to technological developments in other related fields of research.

TI  - Monte-Carlo Siamese Policy On Actor For Satellite Image Super Resolution
JO  - IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the past few years supervised and adversarial learning have been widely adopted in various complex computer vision tasks. It seems natural to wonder whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling. We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote sensing datasets. Based on our experiments, we report considerable improvement over state-of-the-art methods by encapsulating supervised models in a reinforcement learning framework. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Wavelength Selection Method Based On Partial Least Square From Hyperspectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Orthomosaic Of Irrigated Olive Orchards
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Identifying and mapping irrigated areas is essential for a variety of applications such as agricultural planning and water resource management. Irrigated plots are mainly identified using supervised classification of multispectral images from satellite or manned aerial platforms. Recently, hyperspectral sensors on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have proven to be useful analytical tools in agriculture due to their high spectral resolution. However, few efforts have been made to identify which wavelengths could be applied to provide relevant information in specific scenarios. In this study, hyperspectral reflectance data from UAV were used to compare the performance of several wavelength selection methods based on Partial Least Square (PLS) regression with the purpose of discriminating two systems of irrigation commonly used in olive orchards. The tested PLS methods include filter methods (Loading Weights, Regression Coefficient and Variable Importance in Projection); Wrapper methods (Genetic Algorithm-PLS, Uninformative Variable Elimination-PLS, Backward Variable Elimination-PLS, Sub-window Permutation Analysis-PLS, Iterative Predictive Weighting-PLS, Regularized Elimination Procedure-PLS, Backward Interval-PLS, Forward Interval-PLS and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling-PLS); and an Embedded method (Sparse-PLS). In addition, two non-PLS based methods, Lasso and Boruta, were also used. Linear Discriminant Analysis and nonlinear K-Nearest Neighbors techniques were established for identification and assessment. The results indicate that wavelength selection methods, commonly used in other disciplines, provide utility in remote sensing for agronomical purposes, the identification of irrigation techniques being one such example. In addition to the aforementioned, these PLS and non-PLS based methods can play an important role in multivariate analysis, which can be used for subsequent model analysis. Of all the methods evaluated, Genetic Algorithm-PLS and Boruta eliminated nearly 90\% of the original spectral wavelengths acquired from a hyperspectral sensor onboard a UAV while increasing the identification accuracy of the classification.

TI  - Forewarned Is Forearmed: Harmonized Approaches For Early Detection Of Potentially Invasive Pests And Pathogens In Sentinel Plantings
JO  - NEOBIOTA
PY  - 2019
AB  - The number of invasive alien pest and pathogen species affecting ecosystem functioning, human health and economies has increased dramatically over the last decades. Discoveries of invasive pests and pathogens previously unknown to science or with unknown host associations yet damaging on novel hosts highlights the necessity of developing novel tools to predict their appearance in hitherto naive environments. The use of sentinel plant systems is a promising tool to improve the detection of pests and pathogens before introduction and to provide valuable information for the development of preventative measures to minimize economic or environmental impacts. Though sentinel plantings have been established and studied during the last decade, there still remains a great need for guidance on which tools and protocols to put into practice in order to make assessments accurate and reliable. The sampling and diagnostic protocols chosen should enable as much information as possible about potential damaging agents and species identification. Consistency and comparison of results are based on the adoption of common procedures for sampling design and sample processing. In this paper, we suggest harmonized procedures that should be used in sentinel planting surveys for effective sampling and identification of potential pests and pathogens. We also review the benefits and limitations of various diagnostic methods for early detection in sentinel systems, and the feasibility of the results obtained supporting National Plant Protection Organizations in pest and commodity risk analysis.

TI  - Massively-Parallel Change Detection For Satellite Time Series Data With Missing Values
JO  - Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering
PY  - 2020
AB  - Large amounts of satellite data are now becoming available, which, in combination with appropriate change detection methods, offer the opportunity to derive accurate information on timing and location of disturbances such as deforestation events across the earth surface. Typical scenarios require the analysis of billions of image patches/pixels. While various change detection techniques have been proposed in the literature, the associated implementations usually do not scale well, which renders the corresponding analyses computationally very expensive or even impossible. In this work, we propose a novel massively-parallel implementation for a state-of-the-art change detection method and demonstrate its potential in the context of monitoring deforestation. The novel implementation can handle large scenarios in a few hours or days using cheap commodity hardware, compared to weeks or even years using the existing publicly available code, and enables researchers, for the first time, to conduct global-scale analyses covering large parts of our Earth using little computational resources. From a technical perspective, we provide a high-level parallel algorithm specification along with several performance-critical optimizations dedicated to efficiently map the specified parallelism to modern parallel devices. While a particular change detection method is addressed in this work, the algorithmic building blocks provided are also of immediate relevance to a wide variety of related approaches in remote sensing and other fields. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Monitoring Changes In Urban Cover Using Landsat Satellite Images And Demographical Information
PY  - 2019
AB  - The monitoring of urban cover is very important for the planner, management, governmental and non-governmental organizations for optimizing the use of urban resources and minimizing the environmental losses. The study here aims at analyzing the changes that occurred in urban green cover over a time span of 1991-2001 using multi-date Landsat satellite images data over the Varanasi district, India and its relation to demographical changes. The Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier has been used for image classification. The urbanization indicators such as Land Consumption Ratio (LCR) and Land Absorption Coefficient (LAC) were also used in order to understand the changes in urban cover and population dynamics. All the analysis indicates significant changes in the urban cover values with increasing population at both spatial and temporal scale.

TI  - Modeling Salinized Wasteland Using Remote Sensing With The Integration Of Decision Tree And Multiple Validation Approaches In Hetao Irrigation District Of China
JO  - CATENA
PY  - 2022
AB  - The salinized wasteland (SW) is a buffer zone to accumulate salt introduced from irrigation water in salinized irrigation districts. It is crucial to identify the locations and sizes of SW to achieve effective land management and reclamation, as well as agricultural sustainable development. However, the SW is less explored due to the lack of low-cost and effective techniques. In this study, a decision tree-based remote sensing model was proposed to distinguished SW from other land types using the high-resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images in the Hetao Irrigation District of China during 2017-2020. Meanwhile, multiple validation approaches including points (field and random points) and area (small and medium-sized SWs, i.e., SWA, SWB) matching validations were adopted. To establish the model of SW, four spectral indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Salinity Index (SI), as well as a series of multi-period and multi-year remote sensing images were used. The threshold values of the four spectral indices were determined based on the probability density curve. The SW remote sensing model was highly accurate and reliable. The average producer accuracy (PA) and average user accuracy (UA) were respectively 88.0\% and 81.6\% for field investigation (field points matching validation), and 85.9\% and 80.1\% for Google Earth image investigation (random points matching validation). Besides, the average overlapping rate and misclassification rate were respectively 95.6\% and 2.3\% for small-sized typical SWs (area validation), and 92.9\% and 4.7\% for medium-sized typical SWs during 2017-2020. The model indicated that the SW area in the region was respectively 9969, 9694, 9660, and 9608 ha from 2017 to 2020. The area of small and medium-sized SWs decreased with time, while that of large-sized SWs was the opposite.

TI  - A Novel Moisture Adjusted Vegetation Index (Mavi) To Reduce Background Reflectance And Topographical Effects On Lai Retrieval
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2014
AB  - A new moisture adjusted vegetation index (MAVI) is proposed using the red, near infrared, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance in band-ratio form in this paper. The effectiveness of MAVI in retrieving leaf area index (LAI) is investigated using Landsat-5 data and field LAI measurements in two forest and two grassland areas. The ability of MAVI to retrieve forest LAI under different background conditions is further evaluated using canopy reflectance of Jack Pine and Black Spruce forests simulated by the 4-Scale model. Compared with several commonly used two-band vegetation index, such as normalized difference vegetation index, soil adjusted vegetation index, modified soil adjusted vegetation index, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, MAVI is a better predictor of LAI, on average, which can explain 70% of variations of LAI in the four study areas. Similar to other SWIR-related three-band vegetation index, such as modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI) and reduced simple ratio (RSR), MAVI is able to reduce the background reflectance effects on forest canopy LAI retrieval. MAVI is more suitable for retrieving LAI than RSR and MNDVI, because it avoids the difficulty in properly determining the maximum and minimum SWIR values required in RSR and MNDVI, which improves the robustness of MAVI in retrieving LAI of different land cover types. Moreover, MAVI is expressed as ratios between different spectral bands, greatly reducing the noise caused by topographical variations, which makes it more suitable for applications in mountainous area. © 2014 Zhu et al.

TI  - A Scoping Review Of Mhealth Monitoring Of Pediatric Bronchial Asthma Before And During Covid-19 Pandemic
JO  - Paediatric Respiratory Reviews
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mobile (m) Health technology is well-suited for Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) in a patient's habitual environment. In recent years there have been fast-paced developments in mHealth-enabled pediatric RPM, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating evidence synthesis. To this end, we conducted a scoping review of clinical trials that had utilized mHealth-enabled RPM of pediatric asthma. MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched from September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2021. Our scoping review identified 25 publications that utilized synchronous and asynchronous mHealth-enabled RPM in pediatric asthma, either involving mobile applications or via individual devices. The last three years has seen the development of evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and participatory mHealth interventions. The quality of the studies has been improving, such that 40% of included study reports were randomized controlled trials. In conclusion, there exists high-quality evidence on mHealth-enabled RPM in pediatric asthma, warranting future systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of the benefits of such RPM. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Gender Parity In Urbanizing City: A Case Study Of Barasat City, India
JO  - GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
PY  - 2023
AB  - For sustainable urbanization, promoting equal value for men and women is indispensable. Although an urban environment provides women greater admittance to education, health and well-being, jobs, services, and infrastructure, compared to women living in rural areas, there are still disparities in access and opportunities for women within a city. The study emphasizes adopting a comprehensive and intersectional approach to assess the spatial variation of gender equality, which takes into account the multidimensional nature of gender-driven disparities and the effect of unplanned urbanization by integrating geoinformatics with geostatistics. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to create a composite index of gender parity that covers multiple dimensions of gender parity, i.e., health parity, social parity, economic parity, education parity, and empowerment parity. The use of the local indicator of spatial association statistics has conclusively demonstrated the capability of identifying specific clusters of greater gender parity and outliers. The built-up area has been estimated by remote sensing technique, and the percentage of built-up has been used as the measure of the level of urbanization. The correlation allows the calculation of relationships among different dimensions of gender parity and built-up percentage. It has been found that the built-up strongly influences economic parity followed by health and educational parity. While correlating among the dimensions of gender parity, it has been observed that educational parity has the strongest impact on improving overall gender parity. By identifying spatial locations of poor gender parity and the key determinants of gender parity, policymakers can allocate resources and develop targeted interventions to address the specific needs of those areas. Additionally, incorporating gender parity considerations into urban planning can help ensure that urban development is more inclusive and responsive to the needs of women.

TI  - Modelling And Mapping Erosion In Smallholder Agro-Ecosystems, Tanzania
JO  - LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - The West Usambara Highlands in north-eastern Tanzania have many smallholder agro-ecosystems with unknown composition, management, and vulnerability to erosion. Their specific locations and spatial extent are difficult to trace by satellite images or remote sensing imagery alone. To address these limitations, we combined ground soil surveys, geographic information system, and erosion modelling to (a) locate and map smallholder agro-ecosystems, (b) determine their biophysical characteristics, and (c) model their soil losses. Land resource information was collected from 301 random 0.1-ha plots sampled from a total area of 200km(2). Annual soil losses were estimated using the universal soil loss equation. The study located six dominant agro-ecosystems with the following spatial extent: maize-bean (24.9\%), maize-bean-agroforestry (31.2\%), maize-bean-agroforestry-high value trees (18.9\%), tree farms (7.0\%), forests (15.6\%), and grazing lands (2.3\%). Agroforestry and other tree-based agro-ecosystems dominate the area due to historical land use change and later institutional interventions. This study finds combined use of soil surveys, geographic information system, and modelling to be reliable in locating, mapping, and assessing soil losses in smallholder agro-ecosystems. The agro-ecosystems differ significantly (p<0.05) in slope, vegetation cover, soil conditions, and soil losses. Soil loss in the maize-bean agro-ecosystem (28.3tha(-1)yr(-1)) was 18 times higher compared with natural forests (1.57tha(-1)yr(-1)) due to lower soil cover and inefficient conservation and cultivation practices. Our results show that adoption of soil conservation measures and improved vegetation cover technologies across the agro-ecosystems reduces soil losses by 37\% and increases organic carbon levels by 16\%.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Geographical information systems (GIS) are the systems that store location-based data and analyze them. GIS originated from the conventional cartographic techniques of simply drawing maps with a pencil and board. Following the adoption of computer technology, GIS further evolved as a geo-referenced dynamic information system, which can today be considered as a multi-disciplinary instrument that links different disciplines like geography, computer science, remote sensing, civil engineering, statistics, marketing, and other social and behavioral sciences. In this chapter, GIS is defined and its importance and functions are described in detail. Usage of GIS in marketing is explained, especially its development in marketing theory. Also, the value and scope of GIS in tourism management with a view to understand the spread of GIS applications in tourism is explored. © 2018 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global-Scale Modeling Of Future Changes In Sown Areas For Major Crops Based On A Logit Model
JO  - Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica
PY  - 2007
AB  - Potential dynamics of agricultural crop sown area has attracted a wide range of attention from numerous researchers due to its ecological and socio-economic implications. This paper describes a method to develop and implement an integrated model to dynamically simulate future changes in sown areas of the world's major crops (rice, maize, wheat and soybean) at a global scale. The general hypothesis of this study is that crop sown area change is directly linked with farmer decisions on crop choice, and what kind of crop to be cultivated is highly dependent on the random utility of available crops. The modeling approach is based on a crop choice model, which is a Multinomial Logit Model and used to model farmer crop choice decisions among a variety of available alternatives by using an optimization approach. The assessment of model performance by comparing model estimates with FAO statistical data (2001-2003) and MODIS land cover product (2001) indicates its reliability and dignity for addressing the complicated dynamic change of agricultural land use change at present and capability for long-term scenario investigation and applications for the future. From model simulation for crop sown area change during 2005-2035 in different regions in the world, global potential cropping patterns of major crops can be interpreted. Moreover, the results present that the change rates and trajectories of crops in different regions show a great variation over time and space. This study is an attempt of detecting future sown area change at a global level by using a simplified approach along with some assumptions. Although some uncertainty remains in the model, the outcomes can help to understand and explain the causes, locations, consequences and trajectories of land-use change, and provide a great support service for land-use planning and policy-making activities.

TI  - An Integrated Method To Create Habitat Suitability Models For Fragmented Landscapes
JO  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
PY  - 2010
AB  - Given the pervasive influence of human induced habitat fragmentation in ecological processes, landscape models are a welcome advance. The development of GIS software has allowed a greater use of these models and of analyses of the relationship between species and habitat variables. Habitat suitability models are thus theoretical concepts that can be used for planning in fragmented landscapes and habitat conservation. The most commonly used models are based on single species and on the assignment of suitability values for some environmental variables. Generally the cartographic basis for modeling suitability are thematic maps produced by a Boolean logic. In this paper we propose a model based on a set of focal species and on maps produced by a fuzzy classification method. Focal species, selected by an expert-based approach, provide a practical way of extending the scope of habitat suitability models to the conservation of biodiversity at landscape scale. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion may allow more consideration of the connectivity of an area because it allows a better detection of ecological gradients within a landscape. We applied this methodology to the Tuscany region focusing on terrestrial mammals. Performing a fuzzy classification we produced five land cover maps and through image processing operations we obtained a suitability model which applies a continuity criterion. The resulting suitability fuzzy model seems better for the study of connectivity and fragmentation, especially in areas with high spatial complexity. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Study On Variations Of Shoreline Changes And Temporal-Spatial Potentiality For Cloud Seeding At Urumia Lake
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2015
AB  - Protecting the living environment has become one of the greatest human concerns; sudden increase of population, industry and technology development, unrestrained over consumption of the citizens and climate changes, have all caused many problems for mankind. Shores are special zones that are in contact with three Atmosphere, Hydrosphere and Lithosphere environments of earth. Shore lines are of the most important linear features of the earth's surface which have an animated and alive nature. In this regard, optimized management of the shores and environmental protection for stable development require observing the shorelines and their variations. Protection of shorelines within appropriate time periods is of high importance for the purpose of optimized management of the shores. The twenty first century has been called the era of information explosion. A time that, through benefits of new technologies, information experts attempt to generate more and up to date information in various fields and to provide them for managers and decision makers in order to be considered for future planning and also to assist the planners to arrange and set a comprehensive plan. Aerial images and remote sensing technology are economic methods to acquire the required data. Such methods are free from common time and place limitations in survey based methods. Among remote sensing data, the ones acquired from optical images have several benefits which include low cost, interpretation simplicity and ease of access. That is why most of the researches concerning extraction of shorelines are practiced using optical images. On the other hand, wide range coverage of satellite images along with rapid access to them caused these images to be used extensively for extracting the shorelines. The attempt in this research is to use satellite images and their application in order to study variations of the shorelines. Thus, for this purpose, Landsat satellite images from TM and ETM+ sensors in the 35 time period has been used. In order to reach better results, images from MODIS satellite has been used as auxiliary data for the images that are with an error margin. Initial classification on the images was conducted to distinguish water and non water applications. Neural network classification was applied with specific scales on the images and the two major applications were thereby extracted. Then, in order to authenticate the proceedings, Error matrix and Kappa coefficient has been applied on the classified images. Base pixel method of neural network was used for the purpose of information extraction while authenticity of that was evaluated too. The outcomes display the trend of Urmia shoreline has been approximately constant between the years of 1976 to 1995 and has experienced very low variations. In 1998 the lake experienced increase of water and therefore advancement of the shoreline of the lake due to increase of precipitation and the volume of inflowing water to the basin. During 2000 to 20125, however, the lake's shoreline has experienced a downward trend, which was intensified in 2007 and reached to its most critical level ever since, that is decreasing to about one third. Further, temporal and spatial potentiality evaluation of clouds seeding in Urmia lake zone has been studied as a solution for improvement and recovery of the current status of the lake, and an algorithm was proposed for optimized temporal- spatial study on could seeding. Ecological, meteorological and synoptic data were used for timing study of the cloud's seeding plan, which upon study; it is easy to evaluate precipitation potential and quality of the system. At the next step, the rate of humidity and also stability of the precipitating system can be analyzed using radar acquired data. Whereas extracted date from MODIS images are expressing the spatial position, therefore in order to study the location of the cloud's seeding, MODIS images of the selected time intervals along with applying MCM algorithm were used to conclude thick clouds. Also, with interpolation of the TRMM da a, it is possible to deduce maximum precipitation in the form of spatial arena. One of the data categories that is used both for temporal and spatial analysis is radar images which in addition to time, displays the existing humidity range, movement direction, and positions of accumulated precipitation cores. Therefore, using this algorithm, it is possible to conclude the most optimized spatial position in order to execute the seeding plan.

TI  - Development Of A Hydrological Telemetry System In Bago River
JO  - Journal of Disaster Research
PY  - 2018
AB  - Hydrological monitoring is one of the key aspects in early warning systems that are vital to flood disaster management in flood-prone areas such as Bago River Basin in Myanmar. Thousands of people are affected due to the perennial flooding. Owing to the increasing pressure of rapid urbanization in the region and future climate change impacts, an early warning system in the basin is urgently required for disaster risk mitigation. This paper introduces the co-establishment of the telemetry system by a group of stakeholders. The co-establishment of the system through intensive consultations, proactive roles in responsibility sharing, and capacity building efforts, is essential in developing a base platform for flood forecasting and an early warning system in the basin. Herein, we identify the key challenges that have been central to the participatory approach in co-establishing the system. We also highlight opportunities as a result of the ongoing process and future impact on the disaster management system in the basin. We also highlight the potential for scientific contributions in understanding the local weather and hydrological characteristics through the establishment of the high-temporal resolution observation network. Using the observation at Zaung Tu Weir, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite estimates were assessed. Near real-time and standard versions of both satellite estimates show potential utility over the basin. Hourly aggregation shows slightly higher than 40% probability of detection (POD), on average, for both satellite estimates regardless of the production type. Thus, the hourly aggregation requires correction before usage. The results show useful skills at 60% POD for standard GSMaP (GSMAP-ST), 55% POD for near real-time GSMaP (GSMAP-NR), and 46% POD for GPM, at 3-hourly aggregations. Six-hourly aggregations show maximum benefit for providing useful skill and good correspondence to gauge the observation with GSMAP-ST showing the best true skill score (TSS) at 0.54 and an equitable threat score (ETS) at 0.37. While, both final run GPM and GSMAP-NR show lower POD, TSS, and ETS scores. Considering the latency of near real-time satellite estimates, the GSMAP-NR shows the best potential with a 4-hour latency period for monitoring and forecasting purposes in the basin. The result of the GSMAP-NR does not vary significantly from the GSMAP-ST and all GPM estimates. However, it requires some correction before its usage in any applications, for modeling and forecasting purposes. © 2018, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Maximum Entropy Model Of The Bearded Capuchin Monkey Habitat Incorporating Topography And Spectral Unmixing Analysis
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2012
AB  - Movement patterns of bearded capuchin monkeys (Cebus (Sapajus) libidinosus) in northeastern Brazil are likely impacted by environmental features such as elevation, vegetation density, or vegetation type. Habitat preferences of these monkeys provide insights regarding the impact of environmental features on species ecology and the degree to which they incorporate these features in movement decisions. In order to evaluate environmental features influencing movement patterns and predict areas suitable for movement, we employed a maximum entropy modelling approach, using observation points along capuchin monkey daily routes as species presence points. We combined these presence points with spatial data on important environmental features from remotely sensed data on land cover and topography. A spectral mixing analysis procedure was used to generate fraction images that represent green vegetation, shade and soil of the study area. A Landsat Thematic Mapper scene of the area of study was geometrically and atmospherically corrected and used as input in a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) procedure and a linear spectral unmixing approach was used to generate the fraction images. These fraction images and elevation were the environmental layer inputs for our logistic MaxEnt model of capuchin movement. Our models' predictive power (test AUC) was 0.775. Areas of high elevation (>450 m) showed low probabilities of presence, and percent green vegetation was the greatest overall contributor to model AUC. This work has implications for predicting daily movement patterns of capuchins in our field site, as suitability values from our model may relate to habitat preference and facility of movement.

TI  - Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Fuzzy-Embedded Hyperbolic Sigmoid Nonlinear Principal Component And Weighted Least Squares Approach
JO  - Journal of Applied Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is one of the significant research topics in the remote sensing community. The high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, the high correlation among pixels, and the availability of fewer numbers of training samples affect the HSI classification accuracy. We propose an approach to extract the best representative bands from the high-dimensional imagery for better classification. Initially, the spectral bands are extracted by re-representing the traditional principal component analysis in terms of Hebbian learning, formulated and solved as a fuzzy optimization problem. Next, a spatial filter is applied to these spectral bands to obtain the smoothed image that preserves the spatial details. Finally, the spectral and spatial features are trained with the nonlinear support vector machine with the radial basis function kernel to obtain the classification map. Performance of the proposed approach is tested by varying different values of the parameters used in our model. The classification accuracy of the proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The proposed approach can be applied in real-world applications, such as food quality, environment change detection, mineralogy, and pharmaceutical drug design. © 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - Autonomous aerial robots provide new possibilities to study the habitats and behaviors of endangered species through the efficient gathering of location information at temporal and spatial granularities not possible with traditional manual survey methods. We present a novel autonomous aerial vehicle system—TrackerBots—to track and localize multiple radio-tagged animals. The simplicity of measuring the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values of very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars commonly used in the field is exploited to realize a low-cost and lightweight tracking platform suitable for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to uncertainty and the nonlinearity of the system based on RSSI measurements, our tracking and planning approaches integrate a particle filter for tracking and localizing and a partially observable Markov decision process for dynamic path planning. This approach allows autonomous navigation of a UAV in a direction of maximum information gain to locate multiple mobile animals and reduce exploration time and, consequently, conserve on-board battery power. We also employ the concept of search termination criteria to maximize the number of located animals within power constraints of the aerial system. We validated our real-time and online approach through both extensive simulations and field experiments with five VHF radio-tags on a grassland plain. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Practical Challenges In The Conduct Of Pragmatic Trials Embedded In Health Plans: Lessons Of Impact-Afib, An Fda-Catalyst Trial
JO  - CLINICAL TRIALS
PY  - 2020
AB  - IMPACT-AFib was an 80,000-patient randomized clinical trial implemented by five US insurance companies (health plans) aimed at increasing the use of oral anticoagulants by individuals with atrial fibrillation who were at high risk of stroke and not on treatment. The underlying thesis was that patients could be change agents to initiate prescribing discussions with their providers. We tested the effect of mailing information to both patients and their providers. We used administrative medical claims and pharmacy dispensing data to identify eligible patients, to randomize them to an early or delayed intervention, and to assess clinical outcomes. The core data were analysis-ready datasets each site had created and curated for the FDA's Sentinel System, supplemented by updated "fresh" pharmacy and enrollment data to ensure eligibility at the time of intervention. Following mutually agreed upon procedures, sites linked to additional internal source data to implement the intervention-educational information mailed to patients and their providers in the early intervention arm, and to providers of patients in the delayed intervention arm approximately 12 months later. The primary analysis compares the early intervention arm to the delayed intervention arm, prior to the delayed intervention being conducted (i.e. compares intervention to non-intervention). The endpoints of interest were evidence of initiation of anticoagulation (primary) as well as clinical endpoints, including stroke and hospitalization for bleeding. Major challenges, some unanticipated, identified during the planning phase include convening multi-stakeholder investigator teams and advisors, addressing ethical concerns about not intervening in a usual care comparison group, and identifying and avoiding interference with sites' routine programs that were similar to the intervention. Needs and challenges during theimplementation phaseincluded the fact that even limited site-specific programming greatly increased time and effort, the need to refresh research data extracts immediately before outreach to patients and providers, potential difficulty identifying low-cost medications such as warfarin that may not be reimbursed by health plans and so not discoverable in dispensing data, the need to develop workarounds when "providers" in claims data were facilities, difficulty addressing clustering of patients by provider because providers can have multiple identifiers within and between health plans, and the need to anticipate loss to follow up because of health plan disenrollment or change in benefits. As pragmatic trials begin to shape evidence generation within clinical practice, investigators should anticipate issues inherent to claims data and working with multiple large sites. In IMPACT-AFib, we found that investing in collaboration and communication among all parties throughout all phases of the study helped ensure common understanding, early identification of challenges, and streamlined actual implementation.

TI  - Management Of Offshore Oil Pollution And Logistics Transportation Based On Decision Tree
JO  - Arabian Journal of Geosciences
PY  - 2021
AB  - Decision tree algorithm is one of the most widely used inductive thinking algorithms in data mining. Its construction does not require any domain knowledge or parameter settings, and it is widely suitable for exploratory knowledge discovery. The decision tree algorithm has clear structure, fast calculation speed, high precision, and higher flexibility and reliability. It can be used to process multidimensional data, and the acquired knowledge is intuitive and easy to understand. Decision tree algorithms are now widely used in medicine, manufacturing, financial analysis, astronomy, molecular biology, and remote sensing image classification. For example, in the field of marine oil pollution, the influence of bacterial flora has been studied through experiments with simulated bar graphs and bio-enhanced seawater oil pollution remediation, environmental parameters, and microbial metabolism have been found to affect the oil diffusion rate at the same time. In the early days, due to the high concentration of microorganisms, the established bacterial colonies that degraded petroleum had a certain degrading ability. As the abundance of microbial communities increases, the benefits of TCOB-4 and TCOB-5 gradually decrease. The oil of TCOB-5 is highly degradable, and may continue to function during the test period, and is compatible with other oil-degrading bacteria. The dominant position. With the rapid development of third-party logistics, logistics profits, the third source of profits, have become a black hole in the entire supply chain. If transportation costs can be reduced, the efficiency of the logistics system can be improved and profits can be maximized. Therefore, studying the decisions of third-party logistics transportation providers has undoubtedly become the top priority of ensuring fast transportation, reducing transportation costs, and conducting effective logistics management research. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

TI  - Analysis Of The Spatial Association Of Geographical Detector-Based Landslides And Environmental Factors In The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau, China
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2021
AB  - Steep canyons surrounded by high mountains resulting from large-scale landslides characterize the study area located in the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. A total of 1766 large landslides were identified based on integrated remote sensing interpretations utilizing multisource satellite images and topographic data that were dominated by 3 major regional categories, namely, rockslides, rock falls, and flow-like landslides. The geographical detector method was applied to quantitatively unveil the spatial association between the landslides and 12 environmental factors through computation of the q values based on spatially stratified heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a certainty factor (CF) model was used for comparison. The results indicate that the q values of the 12 influencing factors vary obviously, and the dominant factors are also different for the 3 types of landslides, with annual mean precipitation (AMP) being the dominant factor for rockslide distribution, elevation being the dominant factor for rock fall distribution and lithology being the dominant factor for flow-like distribution. Integrating the results of the factor detector and ecological detector, the AMP, annual mean temperature (AMT), elevation, river density, fault distance and lithology have a stronger influence on the spatial distribution of landslides than other factors. Furthermore, the factor interactions can significantly enhance their interpretability of landslides, and the top 3 dominant interactions were revealed. Based on statistics of landslide discrepancies with respect to diverse stratification of each factor, the high-risk zones were identified for 3 types of landslides, and the results were contrasted with the CF model. In conclusion, our method provides an objective framework for landslide prevention and mitigation through quantitative, spatial and statistical analyses in regions with complex terrain.

TI  - Eo Constellation Mps Based On Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms
JO  - RAST 2013 - Proceedings of 6th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies
PY  - 2013
AB  - Missions involving multiple spacecraft can offer a number of benefits over single platforms. Earth Observation (EO) constellations have the potential to offer critical services for the society such as global monitoring and disaster management. This trend is opening new challenges to the automated Mission Planning & Scheduling (MPS) systems aiming at gaining maximum value from the constellations, by increasing the overall efficiency and the system responsiveness. In this paper, we describe an innovative ground-based automated planning & scheduling system for multiple platforms. The mission used as target for our design is the Disaster Monitoring Constellation, the first Earth Observation constellation of low cost small satellites. The novelty of this project is in designing an MPS as self-organizing multi agent architecture, inspired by Ant Colony Optimization algorithms, offering a system adaptable to the problem changes and able to synchronize the satellites' plans in order to avoid duplications. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Impact Of Extreme Drought And Incentive Programs On Flooded Agriculture And Wetlands In California's Central Valley
JO  - PEERJ
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Between 2013 and 2015, a large part of the western United States, including the Central Valley of California, sustained an extreme drought. The Central Valley is recognized as a region of hemispheric importance for waterbirds, which use flooded agriculture and wetlands as habitat. Thus, the impact of drought on the distribution of surface water needed to be assessed to understand the effects on waterbird habitat availability. Methods: We used remote sensing data to quantify the impact of the recent extreme drought on the timing and extent of waterbird habitat during the non-breeding season (July-May) by examining open water in agriculture (rice, corn, and other crops) and managed wetlands across the Central Valley. We assessed the influence of habitat incentive programs, particularly The Nature Conservancy's BirdReturns and The Natural Resources Conservation Service's Waterbird Habitat Enhancement Program (WHEP), at offsetting habitat loss related to drought. Results: Overall, we found statistically significant declines in open water in post-harvest agriculture (45-80\% declines) and in managed wetlands (39-60\% declines) during the 2013-2015 drought compared to non-drought years during the period of 2000-2011. Crops associated with the San Joaquin Basin, specifically corn, as well as wetlands in that part of the Central Valley exhibited larger reductions in open water than rice and wetlands in the Sacramento Valley. Semi-permanent wetlands on protected lands had significantly lower (39-49\%) open water in the drought years than those on non-protected lands while seasonal wetlands on protected lands had higher amounts of open water. A large fraction of the daily open water in rice during certain times of the year, particularly in the fall for BirdReturns (61\%) and the winter for WHEP (100\%), may have been provided through incentive programs which underscores the contribution of these programs. However, further assessment is needed to know how much the incentive programs directly offset the impact of drought in post-harvest rice by influencing water management or simply supplemented funding for activities that might have been done regardless. Discussion: Our landscape analysis documents the significant impacts of the recent extreme drought on freshwater wetland habitats in the Central Valley, the benefits of incentive programs, and the value of using satellite data to track surface water and waterbird habitats. More research is needed to understand subsequent impacts on the freshwater dependent species that rely on these systems and how incentive programs can most strategically support vulnerable species during future extreme drought.

TI  - Monitoring Of Large-Scale Forest Restoration: Evidence Of Vegetation Recovery And Reversing Chronic Ecosystem Degradation In The Mountain Region Of Pakistan
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Global ecosystem restoration efforts are aimed at climate change mitigation. In response to the challenge of global warming and supporting local adaptation, the Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Program (BTAP) was launched in 2014 to restore depleted forest ecosystems by extensive afforestation and/or reforestation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. Under the BTAP, afforestation of all categories was carried out in an area of 300,000 ha, and 160 million plants were distributed under Farm Forestry and 4509 enclosures were established for Assisting Natural Regeneration (ANR) with the help of the local community. The present study evaluated historic deforestation trends using bi-temporal (1990-2010) change analysis and the performance of recent forest ecosystem restoration efforts based on time series analysis of stallite images. A total of 226 afforestation sites of the BTAP - Phase I were examined to determine the vegetation growth and evidence of ecosystem restoration efforts by regression and trend analysis of the annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites from 2014 to 2021. The forest plantation and protected natural regeneration performance across the three key forest management regions of the Southern, Malakand and Northern zones remained variable, with growth values of 29\%, 47\% and 24\%, respectively. The results suggest that the three forest regions lost 3.2\% of the forest between 1990 and 2010. While accounting for most conservative figures validated from satellite data, the BTAP interventions during 2014-2018 improved the overall forest cover from 14.5\% to 16.5\% in these regions. The framework developed in this study and the derived results can help to formulate an evidence-based assessment of indicators for ecological restoration and nature-based solutions.

TI  - The Effect Of Habitat Degradation On The Long Term Survival Of The Critically Endangered Madagascar Spider Tortoise (<I>Pyxis Arachnoides</I>)
JO  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2012
AB  - Pyxis arachnoides inhabits the dry, coastal forests of southwest Madagascar; a biologically unique ecoregion severely threatened by unsustainable small scale agricultural practices. Using remotely sensed data we established vegetation loss remains unabated within our study area at 1.2\% year(-1); consistent with ecoregion wide vegetation loss between 1990 and 2000. We monitored tortoise population density on four occasions over 8 years and developed a stage class projection matrix to model the finite growth rate, matrix sensitivities and elasticities of the population. Monitoring revealed an actual mean population decline of 10.8\% between 2003 and 2011. Our projection matrix model suggested the finite rate of growth to be lambda = 0.986, indicative of 1.4\% year(-1) decline for the duration of the existence of the population, with adult survival as the most sensitive parameter to overall survival of the population. Projection modeling suggests that the population would possibly become functionally non viable in approximately 170 years. As our study was heavily reliant on the use of surrogate data, more information is needed on pre-adult survival and wild reproductive rates. Our study site currently represents a population of exceptional density, therefore, other less dense populations, subjected to the further stresses of poaching will likely become functionally non viable much sooner. This study highlights the utility of population projection matrices in determining the vulnerability of chelonians; a globally threatened taxon. In the case of the spider tortoise, well coordinated development programs and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers forcing this species closer to extinction.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Changes In Ecological-Environmental Quality Caused By Farmland Consolidation Using Google Earth Engine: A Case Study From Liaoning Province In China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Farmland consolidation (FC) is among the measures to solve farmland issues, such as farmland fragmentation, and its impact on the ecological environment has always been controversial. In terms of long-term series and large-area analysis, the calculation of a large amount of data makes the analysis of the ecological-environmental quality of farmland consolidation very difficult. To solve this problem, our study applied a remote sensing ecological index model on the Google Earth Engine platform to analyze the changes in the ecological-environmental quality in two prefecture-level cities in Liaoning Province over the past 20 years. In addition, we analyzed the impacts of FC projects on the ecological environment from 2006 to 2018 and compared them to farmland without consolidation. The study results show that FC caused negative impacts on the quality of the ecological environment during the FC period (2006-2018) and that the FC's positive effects take time to develop. In each FC phase, the results showed that FC exhibited negative effects before 2010 because the proportion of ecological-environmental quality reductions (0-47.67\%) was higher than the proportion of increases (9.62-46.15\%) in those FC phases. Since 2011, the area experiencing positive ecological-environmental benefits (31.96-72.01\%) enabled by FC is higher than the area of negative impact (2.24-18.07\%). This seems to be triggered by policy evolution. Based on the trend analysis, the proportion of FC areas with improved ecological-environmental quality grew faster (Gini index decreased 0.09) than that of farmland without consolidation (Gini index decreased 0.05) from before FC to after FC. Moreover, the new FC projects (2011-2018) performed better than the early projects (2006-2010), which may be due to policy evolution and technological advancements. However, the new FC projects (2011-2018) caused a dramatic decrease in ecological-environmental quality in a small number of areas due to the study time constraints. In conclusion, we believe that FC could improve the ecological-environmental quality of farmland, whereas some measures are needed to reduce its temporal negative impact on ecological-environmental quality, which may be caused by human interference. The remote sensing ecological index obtained using the Google Earth Engine platform provided an effective and reliable method for detecting the impacts of FC on the ecological-environmental quality of farmland. This could provide the basis and support for the monitoring of ecological-environmental changes in FC areas at a regional level.

TI  - Modelling Landscape Permeability For Dispersal And Colonization Of Tigers (<I>Panthera Tigris</I>) In The Greater Panna Landscape, Central India
JO  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - ContextConservation approaches focussed within protected areas (PAs) have proved successful for tiger (Panthera tigris) conservation in India, but India's growing tiger population requires a landscape-level approach to ensure protection of both source populations and dispersing individuals. Thus, spatially explicit mapping of corridors to support existing metapopulations and provide opportunities for recolonization (i.e., stepping stones, satellite cores) are essential to guide conservation and management planning.ObjectiveWe aimed to model functional connectivity for dispersal and natural colonization of tigers in Central India, and validate our predictions using movement data of translocated tigers in the region.MethodsWe first mapped 28 forest patches in the Greater Panna Landscape (GPL) in Central India. Using a resistance surface, we modelled connectivity with least cost path analysis and circuit theory. Centrality scores and pinch-points were calculated, enabling identification of stepping stones and satellite cores. We validated the predicted corridors through spatial path randomization of independent tiger telemetry data.ResultsWe identified 67 corridor links, 10 stepping stones and 11 satellite cores. Validation confirmed high prediction accuracy, with empirical dispersal paths having mean connectivity values higher than 70\% to 98\% of the randomised paths.ConclusionFunctional connectivity assessment in heterogeneous landscapes can benefit from deploying multiple connectivity methods and empirical validation. Our analysis identified corridors, stepping stones and satellite cores that were consistent between multiple connectivity modelling methods and strongly reflected actual observed patterns of tiger dispersal in this landscape. These "consensus" areas provide useful insights for spatial planning for tiger conservation at landscape level.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Image Denoising With Multi-Sourced Information
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - In this paper, a new multi-source-information-based method for remote-sensing image denoising is proposed. Different from the conventional denoising algorithm, the proposed method employs the features of similar reference images from the different band, different sensors, or from multi-temporal images when denoising a target image. The noise-free reference images as a prior is introduced into the denoising object function. The prior's information about the reference image is explored in two aspects: dictionary learning and edge-feature prediction. For dictionary learning, we improve the basis training process by incremental singular value decomposition. For edge-feature prediction, we construct the relationship between gradients of the target image and the reference image by linear ridge regression. The new denoising object function employs both the sparsity of the coefficient and the edge similarity between the target image and the reference image. We also present the optimization scheme for the proposed denoising model. Some typical cases based on different feature relations between a target image and a reference image are comprehensively discussed. Reasonably utilizing the similarity between the target image and the reference image, the proposed algorithm smooths out more noise and conserves more detail at the same time. Better performance of the proposed method is confirmed when compared with other state-of-the-art reference-based denoising methods. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - A Polsar Change Detection Index Based On Neighborhood Information For Flood Mapping
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Change detection using Remote Sensing (RS) techniques is valuable in numerous applications, including environmental management and hazard monitoring. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have proven to be even more effective in this regard because of their all-weather, day and night acquisition capabilities. In this study, a polarimetric index based on the ratio of span (total power) values was introduced, in which neighbourhood information was considered. The role of the central pixel and its neighbourhood was adjusted using a weight parameter. The proposed index was applied to detect flooded areas in Dongting Lake, Hunan, China, and was then compared with the Wishart Maximum Likelihood Ratio (MLR) test. Results demonstrated that although the proposed index and the Wishart MLR test yielded similar accuracies (accuracy of 94\% and 93\%, and Kappa Coefficients of 0.82 and 0.86, respectively), inclusion of neighbourhood information in the proposed index not only increased the connectedness and decreased the noise associated with the objects within the produced map, but also increased the consistency and confidence of the results.

TI  - Towards A Diachronic-Synchronic View Of Future Communication Policies In Africa
JO  - Africa media review
PY  - 1989
AB  - Democratic communication policy Africa cannot be exploited by nations that have a technological edge. Traditional, indigenous systems have to be analyzed by a diachronic-synchronic study to establish more effective communication systems for Africa. It is proposed in this diachronic- synchronic view that communication is a cultural transaction and transmission taking place over time. Old processes are synchronized with modern technology resulting in the closure of the cultural gap between traditional and modern societies. Traditional communication processes have been ignored for too long and communication as an industry has become an elite enterprise boasting expensive gadgets (television and radio, newspapers and magazines). Communication is culture, since it is a manifestation of the cultural norms of society. This monopolistic pattern of cultural or media imperialism is pervasive in the Third World. Communication theory is a multidisciplinary field which strongly reflects the music, art, religion, etc. of the society. The communication of religion has become a big cultural activity worldwide, and televangelism is a significant feature of it, although it strictly controlled in Nigeria despite the pervasiveness of religion in society. The traditional communication system consists of the village council of elders and chiefs and the gongman as a broadcaster or reporter. Modern communication systems utilize television, satellite systems, and computers. These powerful instruments, however, have become liabilities in Third World countries. Dominating powers sell these instruments of power and culture to a people who pay for the equipment by foreign loans. A very grave communication problem in Africa is the low literacy rate and the preeminence of foreign languages as the only medium for reaching majority of the literate public. The culture of the poorer nations is often distorted. Exhibition of Africa culture is rare, and Western culture is transmitted to poor nations through satellite systems. Perhaps a moratorium on all cultural, technological and media hardware of little value to the national objective should be declared to be followed by a renewal of faith in an authentic, indigenous culture.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness Of Conservation Strategies Implemented In Boreal Forests: The Area Selection Process
JO  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2009
AB  - To protect land from commercial exploitation is a common conservation practice. However, this requires large financial resources and it is therefore important to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies used in the selection of these conservation areas. In this study we compare four strategies and relate the differences in cost-effectiveness to differences in the selection process. We measure conservation benefits both as the amount of three tree structures and as the number of species in three species groups. We also estimate both the information cost associated with selecting conservation areas and the opportunity cost. we found the key habitat strategy to be the over-all most cost-effective. in this strategy, the areas have a flexible size and are selected by the authorities in a national field survey. The least cost-effective strategy was one where the selection was based only on forest classes in a satellite map. Intermediate were the retention group strategy, where small areas are left by the forest owner at harvesting, and the nature reserve strategy, where large areas are selected by the authorities. We emphasize that the differences we found are associated with the selection process and that other aspects, such as long-term survival of species, may rank the strategies differently. We conclude that the cost-effectiveness of a selection strategy depends on the size of the planning area for selection of conservation areas, the size of the conservation areas, the objective of the agent making the selection, and the amount and type of information on which the selection is based.

However, acquiring the complete set of MR modalities is not always possible in clinical practice, due to the acquisition protocols, image corruption, scanner availability, scanning cost or allergies to certain contrast materials. The missing information can cause some restraints to brain tumor diagnosis, monitoring, treatment planning and prognosis. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop brain tumor segmentation methods to address the missing modalities problem. Based on the recent advancements, in this review, we provide a detailed analysis of the missing modality issue in MR-based brain tumor segmentation. First, we briefly introduce the biomedical background concerning brain tumor, MR imaging techniques, and the current challenges in brain tumor segmentation. Then, we provide a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art methods with five categories, namely, image synthesis-based method, latent feature space-based model, multi-source correlation -based method, knowledge distillation-based method, and domain adaptation-based method. In addition, the principles, architectures, benefits and limitations are elaborated in each method. Following that, the corresponding datasets and widely used evaluation metrics are described. Finally, we analyze the current challenges and provide a prospect for future development trends. This review aims to provide readers with a thorough knowledge of the recent contributions in the field of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities and suggest potential future directions.

TI  - Property Values And Cyanobacterial Algal Blooms: Evidence From Satellite Monitoring Of Inland Lakes
JO  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
PY  - 2022
AB  - We examine how the frequency of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) generates economic costs through the mechanism of residential property values. We assemble nearly two decades worth of nationwide data on property sales near US inland lakes along as well as satellite-derived measures of the annual frequency of cyanoHABs in over 2000 large lakes during the years 2008-2011. We combine these data sources to estimate broad scale hedonic property models to recover the marginal willingness to pay to reduce the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms in seven climate regions across the United States. We find heterogeneity in the marginal cost of cyanoHABs, with a 10-percentage point increase in annual occurrence reducing average home values for near-shore properties by 3.5\% in the Upper Midwest, 3.8\% in the South, 3.3\% in the Southeast, and 4.3\% in the Northeast. We find null or inconclusive results for other regions. We use our estimates to illustrate the household-, lake-, and regional-level impacts of counterfactual changes in the frequency of cyanoHABs.

TI  - Pre-Spillover Prevention Of Emerging Zoonotic Diseases: What Are The Targets And What Are The Tools?
JO  - Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology
PY  - 2007
AB  - The uneven standards of surveillance, human- or animal-based, for zoonotic diseases or pathogens maintained and transmitted by wildlife H R s, or even domestic species, is a global problem, readily apparent even within the United States, where investment in public health, including surveillance systems, has a long and enviable history. As of 2006, there appears to be little scientific, social, or political consensus that animalbased surveillance for zoonoses merits investment in international infrastructure, other than the fledgling efforts with avian influenza, or targeted nontraditional avenues of surveillance and research. National institutions charged with strategic planning for emerging diseases or intentional releases of zoonotic agents have emphasized improving diagnostic capabilities for detecting human infections, modifying the immune status of human or domestic animals through vaccines, producing better antiviral or antibacterial drugs, and enhancing human-based surveillance as an early warning system. With the possible exception of extensive human vaccination, each of these approaches target post-spillover events and none of these avenues of research will have the slightest impact on reducing the risk of additional emergence of viruses or other pathogens from wildlife. Novel schemes of preventing spillover of human pathogens from animal H R s can only spring from improving our understanding of the ecological context and biological interactions of pathogen maintenance among H R s. Although the benefit derived from investments to improve surveillance and knowledge of zoonotic pathogens circulating among wildlife H R populations is uncertain, our experience with HIV and the looming threat of pandemic avian influenza A inform us of the outcomes we can expect by relying on detection of post-spillover events among sentinel humans. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Sentinel Sar-Optical Fusion For Crop Type Mapping Using Deep Learning And Google Earth Engine
JO  - ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accurate crop type mapping provides numerous benefits for a deeper understanding of food systems and yield prediction. Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification accuracies for crop types. We compared the results of the 3D U-Net to the state-of-the-art deep learning networks, including SegNet and 2D U-Net, as well as commonly used machine learning method such as Random Forest. The results showed (1) fusing multi-temporal SAR and optical data yields higher training overall accuracies (OA) (3D U-Net 0.992, 2D U-Net 0.943, SegNet 0.871) and testing OA (3D U-Net 0.941, 2D U-Net 0.847, SegNet 0.643) for crop type mapping compared to standalone multi-temporal SAR or optical data (2) optical data fused with denoised SAR data via a denoising convolution neural network (OA 0.912) performed better for crop type mapping compared to optical data fused with boxcar (OA 0.880), Lee (OA 0.881), and median (OA 0.887) filtered SAR data and (3) 3D convolutional neural networks perform better than 2D convolutional neural networks for crop type mapping (SAR OA 0.912, optical OA 0.937, fused OA 0.992). © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

TI  - Restoration Of Damaged Forest And Roles Of Remote Sensing
JO  - Concepts and Applications of Remote Sensing in Forestry
PY  - 2023
AB  - Ecological damage refers to the reduction in the value of the environment due to human activities and natural disasters such as climate change and biological disease. The area where ecological damage mainly occurs is the forest, and restoration and management of damage are more important than other ecosystems. If a damaged forest is left unattended, secondary damage such as landslides is highly likely, so it should be restored prior to other ecosystems. The intensity of forest damage is worsening worldwide, and the importance of forest restoration projects at the national level is increasing. However, it is difficult to proceed forest restoration owing to lack of data on location and features of damaged forestry or vegetation species. In the absence of data on damaged forest, policy decision such as restoration prioritization and planning becomes difficult. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current state of research to detect damaged forest using remote sensing and of the main findings and methodological challenges therein. In addition, the use and role of remote sensing to establish legally appropriate ecological restoration including forest at the national level will be introduced. The results will suggest the importance of remote sensing for the identification and appropriate restoration approaches for damaged forests. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

TI  - A Comprehensive Survey On Gnss Interferences And The Application Of Neural Networks For Anti-Jamming
JO  - IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
PY  - 2023
AB  - In recent years, modern systems are highly reliant on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as reliable positioning, navigation, and timing services have become crucial in many safety-critical, security, and emergency applications. Although GNSS technology offers precise and global positioning and navigation, the GNSS signals are susceptible to intentional and unintentional Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) as the signal strength is weak when they reach the receiver. Hence, the receiver's performance gets degraded as the interference signal may cause navigation error or saturate the receiver's operation. Therefore, the research on interference mitigation is of high interest to the GNSS community and is emerging rapidly. In order to have a beneficial and extensive outlook, an in-depth survey on GNSS interferences and the application of metaheuristic based neural networks for interference cancellation has been presented in this paper; with an emphasis on one of the major GNSS threats i.e. jamming. Various solutions adopted by the researchers to cope up with the interference have been surveyed and presented. Also, to have a more intuitive insight, a comparative analysis of the existing mitigating techniques has been summarized. In addition, the review focuses on the neural network approach for anti-jamming and also discusses the implementation strategy of particle swarm optimization based back propagation neural network (PSO-BPNN) to address the shortcomings of traditional training algorithms. Finally, the future aspects to further enhance the neural network algorithms for anti-jamming have also been provided for the benefit of researchers.

TI  - Impacts Of Groundwater And Climate Variability On Terrestrial Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems: A Review Of Geospatial Assessment Approaches And Challenges And Possible Future Research Directions
JO  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
PY  - 2022
AB  - Terrestrial groundwater dependent vegetation (TGDV) are crucial ecosystems which provide important goods and services such as carbon sequestration, habitat, water purification and aesthetic benefits in semi-arid environments. Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts on surface water resources have led to increased competing claims on groundwater resources to meet an exponential water demand for environmental needs, agricultural and developmental needs. This has led to the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources, resulting in groundwater table declines, threatening the sustainability of TGDV. It is on this premise that the review aims to provide a detailed overview on the progress in remote sensing of TGDV. More specifically, the paper provides a background on TGDV and threats, and then further explores recent knowledge on vegetation response to groundwater variability and climate change impacts on TGDV. This review also focuses on recent progress in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques for mapping and monitoring of TGDV and explores the available satellite products and delineation techniques. Finally, the challenges of remote sensing and future research direction are explored. To date, research on TGDV has gained considerable interest with the year 2020 resulting in the most scientific journal publications. Of significant importance is an increase in studies integrating field measurements, model-based techniques with remotely sensed estimates. Despite this progress, only 0.06\% of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) research has utilized remote sensing techniques in the past 20 years, with the top three publishing countries namely, Australia, USA, and China. The literature reveals that TDGV are highly heterogenous, complex ecosystems with unique responses to varying groundwater levels. The vegetation responses differ with the landscape, vegetation type, and seasonality at specific groundwater table thresholds. Despite significant progress in TGDV scientific research, further remote sensing studies are required to understand the annual and inter-annual vegetation response to groundwater variability at local scales. Further, climate impacts are difficult to discriminate from other influences such as disturbances, management, and anthropogenic activities. Moreover, new generation remote sensing products integrated with machine learning techniques have the potential to improve TGDV delineation. Despite these challenges, the development of cloud computing technologies such as google earth engine (GEE) and artificial intelligence (AI) provide advanced computer-processing capabilities for long-term monitoring and integration of multi-source datasets required to capture the effects of climate and groundwater variability on TGDV.

TI  - Integrating Remote-Sensed And Historical Geodata To Assess Interactions Between Rural Buildings And Agroforestry Land
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - The rural built heritage constitutes a unique example, due to architectural and technical issues, which plays a central role in the formation of rural landscape. In this research, interactions between rural buildings and the surrounding land have been examined. Two case studies exemplifying some of typical dynamics of some internal mountain areas of Mediterranean region have been considered. These areas are located in Basilicata Region (Southern Italy) and suffer from land and rural buildings heritage abandonment, as well as from the concurrent disappearance of agroforestry systems with high ecological value. A multi-chronological geo-database incorporating different land cover datasets over a period of 62 years (1955-1988-2008-2017) has been implemented into a GIS to assess relationships between some rural buildings and the surrounding land have been then assessed. This has been achieved by integrating different types of remote-sensed geodata: historical aerial photos, digital orthophotos and satellite images. The analyses carried out have shown that the intensity of land abandonment can also be related to the type of rural building and prevalent agricultural activity. Moreover, thanks to this methodology, it has been possible to produce several spatial information useful to support public decision-makers at different level.

TI  - Mapping Eucalypts Trees Using High Resolution Multispectral Images: A Study Comparing Worldview 2 Vs. Spot 7
JO  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as a major threat to many ecological and socio-economic systems. Nevertheless, the management of some of these plants is often controversial due to the positive socioeconomic and ecosystem roles they play. This necessitates proper mapping and monitoring of the extent and spatial distribution of such plants to prioritize resource allocation and management. However, mapping plant species using remote sensing in a heterogeneous environment such as an urban area is often challenged by high levels of spectral muddle. This study investigated the utility of the high and medium spectral and spatial resolution imageries from the WorldView-2 (WV-2) and SPOT-7 satellites, respectively, to map eucalypts trees in urban areas. Furthermore, the classification performances of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were compared. Both WV-2 and SPOT-7 imageries attained overall accuracies of 81.67\% (0.78 kappa) and 72.78\% (0.67 kappa), respectively, when the RF algorithm was used and 80\% (0.76 Kappa) and 71.11\% (0.65 Kappa), respectively when SVM algorithm was used. The user's accuracies for the eucalypts class in both WV-2 and SPOT 7 imageries were 73.33\% and 60\%, respectively, for the RF and 70\% and 56.67\% for the SVM algorithm, respectively. Thus, WV-2 imagery is more suitable for mapping eucalypts trees in a heterogeneous urban environment. Therefore, the classification of WV-2 imageries using RF produced a relatively more accurate map of the eucalypts trees for the study areas, the southern part of Johannesburg city.

TI  - Assessment Of Urban Ecological Quality And Spatial Heterogeneity Based On Remote Sensing: A Case Study Of The Rapid Urbanization Of Wuhan City
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rapid urbanization significantly affects the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystem and the foundation of regional ecosystem services, thereby detrimentally influencing the ecological environment and urban ecological security. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also require accurate and timely assessments of where people live in order to develop, implement and monitor sustainable development policies. Sustainable development also emphasizes the process of protecting the ecological environment for future generations while maintaining the current needs of mankind. We propose a comprehensive evaluation method for urban ecological quality (UEQ) using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS images to extract remote sensing information representing four ecological elements, namely humidity, greenness, heat and dryness. An improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (IRSEI) evaluation model is constructed by combining the entropy weight method and principal component analysis. This modeling is applied to the city of Wuhan, China, from 1995 to 2020. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted on the geographic clusters of the IRSEI. The results show that (1) from 1995 to 2015, the mean IRSEI of Wuhan city decreased from 0.60 to 0.47, indicating that environmental deterioration overwhelmed improvements; (2) the global Moran’s I for IRSEI ranged from 0.535 to 0.592 from 1995 to 2020, indicating significant heterogeneity in its spatial distribution, highlighting that high and low clusters gradually developed at the edge of the city and at the city center, respectively; (3) the high clusters are mainly distributed in the Huangpi and Jiangxia districts, and the low clusters at the city center, which exhibits a dense population and intense human activity. This paper uses remote sensing index methods to evaluate UEQ as a scientific theoretical basis for the improvement of UEQ, the control of UEQ and the formulation of urban sustainable development strategies in the future. Our results show that the UEQ method is a low-cost, feasible and simple technique that can be used for territorial spatial control and spatiotemporal urban sustainable development. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables For Spatially Predicting The Risks Of Bark Beetle Disturbance
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2016
AB  - Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests. Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power, even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors, and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model. Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions. The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change And Landscape Pattern Variation Of Eco-Environmental Quality In Jing-Jin-Ji Urban Agglomeration From 2001 To 2015
JO  - IEEE ACCESS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Identifying the changes and relationships between regional eco-environment quality and landscape pattern in an urban agglomeration have a great significance in realizing sustainable development goal. However, limited research has been performed to understand the spatiotemporal change of eco-environment quality, the variation of landscape pattern, and their relationship in an urban agglomeration. This study selected the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) urban agglomeration as the study area. A comprehensive index, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), was utilized to understand the eco-environment spatiotemporal change and landscape pattern variation at class-level and landscape-level of JJJ during 2001 similar to 2015, then, their relationship was explored. The major conclusions were as follows: (1) The average RSEI value of JJJ increased from 0.43 to 0.46, which represented that the eco-environment of JJJ had improved in the fourteen years. Among it, the improved region was mainly located in Zhangjiakou city, while the degraded region was mainly distributed in the eastern Hebei plain. (2) The landscape characteristics of entire JJJ eco-environment were becoming more aggregated, connected, diverse, and regular. However, fair, moderate, and good grades were getting more concentrated and continuous; poor grade indicated a more fragmented and disconnected trend; excellent grade displayed an expanded and concentrated situation. (3) Human factors have an increasing influence on regional eco-environment changes. (4) Fair, moderate, and good grades showed a more dominant and stronger influence on the variation of landscape pattern in JJJ. Specifically, the fair grade had a positive correlation with the variation of landscape pattern, while moderate and good grades had a negative one. All of these conclusions could be valuable information for relevant decision-makers in managing or achieving the optimal eco-environment landscape pattern.

TI  - Pm<Sub>2.5</Sub> Pollution Is Substantially Affected By Ammonia Emissions In China
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
PY  - 2016
AB  - Urban air quality in China has been declining substantially in recent years due to severe haze episodes. The reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions since 2013 does not yet appear to yield substantial benefits for haze mitigation. As the reductions of those key precursors to secondary aerosol formation appears not to sufficient, other crucial factors need to be considered for the design of effective air pollution control strategies. Here we argue that ammonia (NH3) plays a - so far - under-estimated role in the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols, a main component of urban fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in China. By analyzing in situ concentration data observed in major cities alongside gridded emission data obtained from remote sensing and inventories, we find that emissions of NH3 have a more robust association with the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 levels than emissions of SO2 and NOx. As a consequence, we argue that urban PM2.5 pollution in China in many locations is substantially affected by NH3 emissions. We highlight that more efforts should be directed to the reduction of NH3 emissions that help mitigate PM2.5 pollution more efficiently than other PM2.5 precursors. Such efforts will yield substantial co-benefits by improving nitrogen use efficiency in farming systems. As a consequence, such integrated strategies would not only improve urban air quality, but also contribute to China's food-security goals, prevent further biodiversity loss, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lead to economic savings.

TI  - Accounting For Value Changes In Cultivated Land Resources Within The Karst Mountain Area Of Southwest China, 2001-2020
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2022
AB  - Cultivated land resources are important natural resource assets that are related to food security and sustainable development. Due to the many restrictive factors of the karst landform on agricultural production, the quantity and quality of cultivated land in the karst mountainous areas in Southwest China are poor. Reclaiming cultivated land to develop economy or to avoid transitional reclamation to protect ecology is an important proposition in this area. Analyzing changes in the physical and monetary value of cropland resources can help us to formulate more reasonable policies for the development and utilization of cultivated land resources, and to achieve a win-win scenario for economic development and ecological protection. Using multi-source remote sensing data and 20-year landcover data obtained by the GEE platform, this paper evaluated the cropland resources of the karst mountain areas of China at the pixel level. It was found that under the apparent outflow of the physical account of the cultivated land resources, the monetary value still maintained growth, proving that the current cultivated land-use policy in Guizhou Province has significantly improved the value of local cultivated land resources.

TI  - Temporal-Spatial Variations And Influencing Factors Of Lakes In Inland Arid Areas From 2000 To 2017: A Case Study In Xinjiang
JO  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS \& RISK
PY  - 2019
AB  - Lakes are the most important water resource in arid and semi-arid regions and are good indicators of climate change. The study of lake expansion and contraction can reveal important information about climate change and regional responses. In this study, MOD09A1 global surface reflectance data of MODIS are used to extract the water areas of 12 main lakes in Xinjiang using a support vector machine method to investigate the temporal-spatial dynamics and driving factors of lake area variations between 2000 and 2017. The results indicate that (1) In general, the Xinjiang lakes exhibited large fluctuations between 2000 and 2017; the area of the lakes shrunk by 16.98 km(2)/year during 2007-2009 but expanded by 80.67 km(2)/year after 2010. (2) The changes in the Xinjiang lakes exhibited obvious spatial differences. There were strong fluctuations in the areas of the Tail-end lakes and the K value describing the degree of fluctuation in the lake area was 0.2\%. The fluctuations in the areas of the Mountain lakes were more stable with a K value of 0.09\% and the area of the Plateau lakes increased every year, with an annual increase of 19.90 km(2). (3) The lakes with the larger fluctuations in the area were Ebinur Lake, Manasi Lake, and Barkol Lake, and the range of the areas was 370.85, 276.55, and 61.5 km(2), respectively. Because of the regional diversity of Xinjiang, the driving forces that affect the area of the lakes differ in different areas. The main factors affecting the lake area change in the Tail-end lakes are the amount of inflowing water and the water use by agriculture and animal husbandry. The main reason for the stability of the Mountain lakes is the balance between water inflow and outflow. The main factor contributing to the expansion of the Plateau lakes area is the abundant supply of glacier/snow melt water. Overall, the main factor contributing to the expansion of Plateau lakes area is abundant glacier snow melt water supply. On the whole, the main factors affecting the temporal and spatial variation of the lake areas in Xinjiang are precipitation (r = .67, p = .003 < .01), temperature (r = .611, p = .007 < .01), and the increase in cultivated land area (r = -.021, p = .004 < .01).

TI  - Utility Of Orbital Surveillance System For Snow Monitoring In The Indian Context
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Photo-Interpretation and Remote Sensing
PY  - 1979
AB  - Since snow covered areas in the Himalayas contribute significantly to the discharge of the major rivers of North India, snow monitoring is essential for effective control and management of the available water resources, particularly in the lean period. As accumulation and melting of snow are dynamic processes the need arises for periodic monitoring. Conventional survey methods are time consuming and expensive due to adverse terrain conditions and weather. As such, updating information at reasonably frequent intervals calls for a strategy invoiving remote sensing techniques. Potentials of such techniques such as aerial and orbital photography and multispectral scanning systems as also microwave sensing systems are briefly discussed. Particular emphasis is laid on a Landsat type surveillance system, which is at the operational stage. As a case study demonstrating the system capability an area in the Sutlej catchment has been analysed on Landsat imagery acquired in October and December, 1972. The snow covered area is found to be considerably more in the December, 72 imagery. Such a map overlaid on a contoured 1:250,000 base updated every month can be useful input attempts at watershed modelling incorporating other dynamic features also. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - The Value Of Migration Information For Conservation Prioritization Of Sea Turtles In The Mediterranean
JO  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
PY  - 2016
AB  - AimConservation plans often struggle to account for connectivity in spatial prioritization approaches for the protection of migratory species. Protection of such species is challenging because their movements may be uncertain and variable, span vast distances, cross international borders and traverse land and sea habitats. Often we are faced with small samples of information from various sources and the collection of additional data can be costly and time-consuming. Therefore it is important to evaluate what degree of spatial information provides sufficient results for directing management actions. Here we develop and evaluate an approach that incorporates habitat and movement information to advance the conservation of migratory species. We test our approach using information on threatened loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean. LocationThe Mediterranean Sea. MethodsWe use Marxan, a spatially explicit decision support tool, to select priority conservation areas. Four approaches with increasing amounts of information about the loggerhead sea turtle are compared, ranging from (1) the broad distribution, (2) multiple habitat types that represent foraging, nesting and inter-nesting habitats, (3) mark-recapture movement information to (4) telemetry-derived migration tracks. ResultsWe find that spatial priorities for sea turtle conservation are sensitive to the information used in the prioritization process. Setting conservation targets for migration tracks altered the location of conservation priorities, indicating that conservation plans designed without such data would miss important sea turtle habitat. We discover that even a small number of tracks make a significant contribution to a spatial conservation plan if those tracks are substantially different. Main conclusionsThis study presents a novel approach to improving spatial prioritization for conserving migratory species. We propose that future telemetry studies tailor their efforts towards conservation prioritization needs, meaning that spatially dispersed samples rather than just large numbers should be obtained. This work highlights the valuable information that telemetry research contributes to the conservation of migratory species.

TI  - A Combination Of Climate, Tree Diversity And Local Human Disturbance Determine The Stability Of Dry Afromontane Forests
JO  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background Anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly affecting the vitality of tropical dry forests. The future condition of this important biome will depend on its capability to resist and recover from these disturbances. So far, the temporal stability of dryland forests is rarely studied, even though identifying the important factors associated with the stability of the dryland forests could serve as a basis for forest management and restoration. Methodology In a degraded dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, we explored remote sensing derived indicators of forest stability, using MODIS satellite derived NDVI time series from 2001 to 2018. Resilience and resistance were measured using the anomalies (remainders) after time series decomposition into seasonality, trend and remainder components. Growth stability was calculated using the integral of the undecomposed NDVI data. These NDVI derived stability indicators were then related to environmental factors of climate, topography, soil, tree species diversity, and local human disturbance, obtained from a systematic grid of field inventory plots, using boosted regression trees in R. Results Resilience and resistance were adequately predicted by these factors with an R-2 of 0.67 and 0.48, respectively, but the model for growth stability was weaker. Precipitation of the wettest month, distance from settlements and slope were the most important factors associated with resilience, explaining 51\% of the effect. Altitude, temperature seasonality and humus accumulation were the significant factors associated with the resistance of the forest, explaining 61\% of the overall effect. A positive effect of tree diversity on resilience was also important, except that the impact of species evenness declined above a threshold value of 0.70, indicating that perfect evenness reduced the resilience of the forest. Precipitation of the wettest month was the most important factor explaining 43.52\% of the growth stability variation. Conclusion A combination of climate, topographic factors and local human disturbance controlled the stability of the dry forest. Also tree diversity is an important stability component that should be considered in the management and restoration programs of such degraded forests. If local disturbances are alleviated the recovery time of dryland forests could be shortened, which is vital to maintain the ecosystem services these forests provide to local communities and global climate change.

TI  - Risk Zoning Of Flood Disaster Based On Gis: A Case Study Of Xiangjiang River, Hunan Province, China
JO  - 2011 International Conference on Remote Sensing, Environment and Transportation Engineering, RSETE 2011 - Proceedings
PY  - 2011
AB  - The risk zoning of flood disaster is an important content of risk evaluation and management. It provides science basis for the risk management and environmental policy-making. The risk assessment index system was built by using the method of risk assessment of natural disasters and geographic information system (GIS). The system contains the integrated risk probability (PI) and the comprehensive socioeconomic vulnerability (S i) of flood disaster from two aspects of 9 influence factors and applies to the Hunan section of Xiangjiang River. With the support of ArcGIS, maps of every indexes of flood risk were outlined. Then the regionalization of comprehensive risk of flood disaster (Ri) was also drawn by overlaying the maps gotten from addition method. The results show that, the highest value of Pi is distributed in Xiangyin and along the lower reaches of Xiangjiang River, Qidong, Dongan and the areas of high altitude are the lowest; the highest value of Si is distributed in Chang-Zhu-Tan region, and the lower is in Lingling, Dongan and Wangcheng; the highest value of R i is distributed in Xiangyin and Chang-Zhu-Tan area, the lower is in Hengyang City, and the lowest is in Lingling and Dongan. The result is identical with the actual situation of the study area. © 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Pm2.5 Mitigation In China: Socioeconomic Determinants Of Concentrations And Differential Control Policies
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2018
AB  - Elucidating the key impact factors on PM2.5 concentrations is crucial to formulate effective mitigation policies. In this study, we employed an extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model to identify the socioeconomic determinants of PM2.5 concentrations for 12 different regions and across China. The evaluation was based on a balanced panel dataset integrating long-term satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations and socio-economic data in China from 1999 to 2011. Empirical results indicate that the influencing factors can be ranked in descending order of importance as: proportion of secondary sector of the economy, GDP per capita, urbanization, population, energy intensity, and proportion of tertiary sector. Proportion of secondary sector is the greatest contribution to increasing PM2.5 concentrations, especially for heavily polluted regions. GDP per capita is secondary in importance, and its impact is weakened by the existence of an EKC relationship between GDP per capita and PM2.5 concentrations. Therefore, PM2.5 pollution is an economic development mode problem, rather than a general economic development problem. The impact of urbanization varies across regions; while promoting urbanization will be conducive to decreased PM2.5 concentrations in Northwest China and Northeast China, it will contribute to increased PM2.5 concentrations in other regions. Population and energy intensity are significant in most regions, but neither are decisive factors because of the small absolute value of their coefficients. Finally, different combinations of mitigation policies are proposed for different regions in this study to meet the mitigation targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Spatial Prediction And Mapping Of Soil Ph Across A Tropical Afro-Montane Landscape
JO  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
PY  - 2020
AB  - Soil pH is an indispensable part of the soil bionetwork, but so vulnerable to the dynamics of land-use change. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of soil pH is thus important for sustainable land use planning and management. In this study, we developed an approach based on geographically weighted regression-kriging (GWRK) to predict the continuous variation of soil pH up to 15 cm depth. The approach is compared to multiple linear regression-kriging (MLRK) using a total of 220 soil observations and 28 candidate auxiliary data, including climatic, topographic, and remotely sensed data. Results revealed that organic matter, sand, silt, temperature, and Landsat 8 operational land imager band 7 can explain the spatial variability of soil pH. GWR-based (local) models remarkably improved the prediction accuracy of soil pH compared to the MLR-based (global) models considering the root mean square error (i.e., 0.33 vs. 0.15; 0.37 vs. 0.17, respectively) and the coefficient of multiple determination (R-2) (i.e., 0.59 vs. 0.74; 0.43 vs. 0.55, respectively). In conclusion, the use of GWR-based models revealed that the correlations between soil pH and environmental covariates were not stationary in space. Forested areas tended to be very strongly to moderately acidic, while croplands were slightly acidic to neutral. The GWR-based models demonstrated their utility in improving predictive soil mapping. These findings will support spatially-targeted soil pH management for improved food security and ecosystem health.

TI  - Challenges And Opportunities Of Area-Based Conservation In Reaching Biodiversity And Sustainability Goals
JO  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard nature's diversity. In view of expanding human land use, increasing climate change and unmet conservation targets, area-based conservation requires efficiency and effectiveness more than ever. In this review, I identify and relate pressing challenges to promising opportunities for effective and efficient protected area governance and management, to enhance research, decision-making and capacity building in area-based conservation under uncertain future developments. I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments. Post-2020 international biodiversity and sustainable development goals could be met earlier if protected areas were more effective. I consequently conclude with the need for a global information system that is to support area-based conservation by synthesizing challenges and opportunities for protected area management effectiveness and efficiency at the local to global level.

JO  - TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY
PY  - 2007
AB  - Intelligent housing is a novelty in Lithuania yet. Such housing is not popular in our country. Specialists of automation claim that such situation occured not only because people lack knowledge but also because the concept of intelligent housing is interpreted erroneously (most people think that remotely controled door of garage, for instance, makes their housing intelligent). Intelligent helpers started to emerge in households only recently. Intelligent ambient assisted enviornment model, created by authors, helps to evaluate intelligent ambient assisted environment by social, cultural, political, legal, economical, technological and environmental factor analysis. Basing on this model also ambient assisted environment supply and demand as well as various criteria evaluation, the system able to select the best intelligent devices alternatives accordingly to each family needs was created. Through analysis of separate parts of an existing household, it is possible to distinguish intellingent devices that I study, ie intelligent lock, intelligent robot-cleaner, intelligent infant respiratory monitor, intelligent sentinel and intelligent keyboard. Users of intelligent devices are families of young people, who want to save time and who appreciate convenience and innovations. Advantages and benefits of devices used by families of young people are being analysed. In order to provide the best guarantee for rational selection of variants of intelligent devices, decisions must be based on the system of criteria which describes variants of intelligent devices, the decision support system must reflect consumer requirements to the best possible extent, and the data provided in the system must be real and updated easily. Computer and internet technologies, multi-variant evaluation methods as well as principles and requirements applicable to favourable residential environment are combined to achieve the goal.

TI  - Assessment Of Runoff Potential For Disaster Risk Reduction Using Geospatial Technology In Opa Watershed, Southwestern Nigeria
JO  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Flood prediction is very important in land and water resources management. Many flood disasters could be mitigated with adequate preparedness especially in urban watershed. This study assessed the runoff potential of Opa watershed in Southwest Nigeria using remote sensing and the Soil Conservation Service or SCS curve number (CN) techniques. The 2007 NigSat image of the year 2007 was classified into different land cover classes and combined with its hydrological soil groups to determine the curve number of each sub-watershed. The sub-watershed with low curve number is considered to have lower runoff potential while the one with higher curve number is considered to have higher runoff potential. The CN was also used to estimate the potential maximum retention, (S) and potential runoff, (Q) for each sub-watershed using a rainfall event of 2-year return period in the watershed. The weighted runoff was used to determine sub-watersheds with highest and lowest runoff potential. The study showed that urban sub-watershed 9 with average CN value of 85.93 has highest weighted runoff potential (5.53 mm) while the vegetated sub-watershed 10 with average CN value of 69.46 has the lowest weighted runoff potential (0.34 mm). The study concluded that using available geospatial technology and appropriate hydrologic assessment techniques constitute an effective flood prediction method for disaster risk reduction and sustainable urban watershed management.

TI  - Increasing Fragmentation And Squeezing Of Coastal Wetlands: Status, Drivers, And Sustainable Protection From The Perspective Of Remote Sensing
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Coastal wetlands arc of great ecological and economic value but face significant degradation and losses because of human activities. Nevertheless, the changes in spatiotcmporal landscape patterns, which have occurred as a result of coastal wetland losses, have not been well documented under the rapid urbanization in coastal zones. In this study, an algorithm based on periodic tidal inundations and full time-series indices was developed to map the detailed status and trends in the coastal wetlands in Fujian Province from 1994 to 2018 by using more than archived 5000 Landsat images. The results showed that in 2018, there were 1136.56 km(2) of coastal wetlands along the coast of Fujian with an overall accuracy of 95.63\%, which were mainly distributed in estuaries and bays. These coastal wetlands consisted of tidal flats, low marshes, and high marshes with proportions of 84.91\%, 13.05\%, and 2.04\%, respectively. An unprecedented loss of coastal wetlands has occurred in Fujian Province, with an annual rate of 15.44 km(2)/a from 1994 to 2018. Many coastal wetlands were reclaimed, dredged, and converted into inland areas for aquaculture ponds, ports, and built-up areas in different urbanization periods, which has led to a great loss of coastal spaces with an area of 476.87 km(2). The interplay between the loss of coastal wetlands and seaward urbanization will lead to severe fragmentation and squeezing effects in the coastal zone and will weaken the coastal protection from marine disasters that is provided by coastal wetlands. Therefore, we conceived two conceptional frameworks for sustainable coastal protection based on the current situations of the coastal communities to provide a trade-off between economic development and the protection of coastal developing countries in the world.

TI  - Comparative Regional-Scale Soil Salinity Assessment With Near-Ground Apparent Electrical Conductivity And Remote Sensing Canopy Reflectance
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2016
AB  - Soil salinity is recognized worldwide as a major threat to agriculture, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Producers and decision makers need updated and accurate maps of salinity in agronomically and environmentally relevant ranges (i.e., <20 dS m-1, when salinity is measured as electrical conductivity of the saturation extract, ECe). State-of-the-art approaches for creating accurate ECe maps beyond field scale (i.e., 1 km2) include: (i) Analysis Of Covariance (ANOCOVA) of near-ground measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and (ii) regression modeling of multi-year remote sensing canopy reflectance and other co-variates (e.g., crop type, annual rainfall). This study presents a comparison of the two approaches to establish their viability and utility. The approaches were tested using 22 fields (total 542 ha) located in California's western San Joaquin Valley. In 2013 ECa-directed soil sampling resulted in the collection of 267 soil samples across the 22 fields, which were analyzed for ECe, ranging from 0 to 38.6 dS m-1. The ANOCOVA ECa-ECe model returned a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 and root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) of 3.05 dS m-1. For the remote sensing approach seven years (2007-2013) of Landsat 7 reflectance were considered. The remote sensing salinity model had R2 = 0.73 and RMSPE = 3.63 dS m-1. The robustness of the models was tested with a leave-one-field-out (lofo) cross-validation to assure maximum independence between training and validation datasets. For the ANOCOVA model, lofo cross-validation provided a range of scenarios in terms of RMSPE. The worst, median, and best fit scenarios provided global cross-validation R2 of 0.52, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. The lofo cross-validation for the remote sensing approach returned a R2 of 0.65. The ANOCOVA approach performs particularly well at ECe values <10 dS m-1, but requires extensive field work. Field work is reduced considerably with the remote sensing approach, but due to the larger errors at low ECe values, the methodology is less suitable for crop selection, and other practices that require accurate knowledge of salinity variation within a field, making it more useful for assessing trends in salinity across a regional scale. The two models proved to be viable solutions at large spatial scales, with the ANOCOVA approach more appropriate for multiple-field to landscape scales (1-10 km2) and the remote sensing approach best for landscape to regional scales (>10 km2). © Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Wetlands Shrinkage, Fragmentation And Their Links To Agriculture In The Muleng-Xingkai Plain, China
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2012
AB  - In the past five decades, the wetlands in the Muleng-Xingkai Plain, Northeast China, have experienced rapid shrinkage and fragmentation. In this study, wetlands cover change and agricultural cultivation were investigated through a time series of thematic maps from 1954, and Landsat satellite images representing the last five decades (1976, 1986, 1995, 2000, and 2005). Wetlands shrinkage and fragmentation were studied based on landscape metrics and the land use changes transition matrix. Furthermore, the driving forces were explored according to socioeconomic development and major natural environmental factors. The results indicate a significant decrease in the wetlands area in the past five decades, with an average annual decrease rate of 9004 ha/yr. Of the 625,268 ha of native wetlands in 1954, approximately 64\% has been converted to other land use types by 2005, of which conversion to cropland accounts for the largest share (83\%). The number of patches decreased from 1272 (1954) to 197 (1986) and subsequently increased to 326 (2005). The mean patch size changed from 480 ha (1954) to 1521 ha (1976), and then steadily decreased to 574 ha (2005). The largest patch index (total core area index) indicates wetlands shrinkage with decreased values from 31.73 (177,935 ha) to 3.45 (39,421 ha) respectively. Climatic changes occurred over the study period, providing a potentially favorable environment for agricultural development. At the same time population, groundwater harvesting, and fertilizer application increased significantly, resulting in wetlands degradation. According to the results, the shrinkage and fragmentation of wetlands could be explained by socioeconomic development and secondarily aided by changing climatic conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration Of Mediterranean Oak Savanna At Multiple Temporal And Spatial Resolutions. Implications For Water Resources Management
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Mediterranean oak savanna is composed of a mixture of scattered oak trees, crops, pasture, and shrubs. It is the most widespread agroforestry landscape in Europe, and its conservation faces multiple threats including water scarcity, which has been exacerbated by global warming and greater climate variability. Evapotranspiration (ET) can be used as a proxy of the vegetation water status and response to water shortage conditions, providing relevant information about the ecosystem stability and its hydrological dynamics. This study evaluates a framework to estimate ET at multiple spatial and temporal scales and applies it to the monitoring of the oak savanna vegetation water consumption for the years 2013-2015. We used a remote sensing-based energy balance model (ALEXI/DisALEXI approach), and the STARFM data fusion technique to provide daily ET estimates at 30 m resolution. The results showed that modeled energy balance components compared well to ground measurements collected by an eddy covariance system, with root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging between 0.60 and 2.18 MJ m(-2) d(-1), depending on the sensor dataset (MODIS or Landsat) and the flux. The daily 30 m ET series generated by STARFM presented an RMSE value of 0.67 mm d(-1), which yielded a slight improvement compared to using MODIS resolution or more simple interpolation approaches with Landsat. However, the major advantage of the high spatio-temporal resolution was found in the analysis of ET dynamics over different vegetation patches that shape the landscape structure and create different microclimates. Fine-scale ET maps (30 m, daily) provide key information difficult to detect at a coarser spatial resolution over heterogeneous landscapes and may assist management decisions at the field and farm scale.

JO  - Comprehensive Remote Sensing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Protected destination systems (PDSs) are touristic spaces with two parts: a protected area and a gateway region where nature meets commerce.

TI  - A Random Forest Machine Learning Approach For The Retrieval Of Leaf Chlorophyll Content In Wheat
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - Developing rapid and non-destructive methods for chlorophyll estimation over large spatial areas is a topic of much interest, as it would provide an indirect measure of plant photosynthetic response, be useful in monitoring soil nitrogen content, and offer the capacity to assess vegetation structural and functional dynamics. Traditional methods of direct tissue analysis or the use of handheld meters, are not able to capture chlorophyll variability at anything beyond point scales, so are not particularly useful for informing decisions on plant health and status at the field scale. Examining the spectral response of plants via remote sensing has shown much promise as a means to capture variations in vegetation properties, while offering a non-destructive and scalable approach to monitoring. However, determining the optimum combination of spectra or spectral indices to inform plant response remains an active area of investigation. Here, we explore the use of a machine learning approach to enhance the estimation of leaf chlorophyll (Chlt), defined as the sum of chlorophyll a and b, from spectral reflectance data. Using an ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res spectroradiometer, 2700 individual leaf hyperspectral reflectance measurements were acquired from wheat plants grown across a gradient of soil salinity and nutrient levels in a greenhouse experiment. The extractable Chlt was determined from laboratory analysis of 270 collocated samples, each composed of three leaf discs. A random forest regression algorithm was trained against these data, with input predictors based upon (1) reflectance values from 2102 bands across the 400-2500 nm spectral range; and (2) 45 established vegetation indices. As a benchmark, a standard univariate regression analysis was performed to model the relationship between measured Chlt and the selected vegetation indices. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) was significantly reduced when using the machine learning approach compared to standard linear regression. When exploiting the entire spectral range of individual bands as input variables, the random forest estimated Chlt with an RMSE of 5.49 μg·cm-ls and an R2 of 0.89. Model accuracy was improved when using vegetation indices as input variables, producing an RMSE ranging from 3.62 to 3.91 μg·cm-2, depending on the particular combination of indices selected. In further analysis, input predictors were ranked according to their importance level, and a step-wise reduction in the number of input features (from 45 down to 7) was performed. Implementing this resulted in no significant effect on the RMSE, and showed that much the same prediction accuracy could be obtained by a smaller subset of indices. Importantly, the random forest regression approach identified many important variables that were not good predictors according to their linear regression statistics. Overall, the research illustrates the promise in using established vegetation indices as input variables in a machine learning approach for the enhanced estimation of Chlt from hyperspectral data. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Tracking Changes In Aquaculture Ponds On The China Coast Using 30 Years Of Landsat Images
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2021
AB  - Although coastal aquaculture ponds provide high-quality fish protein for billions of people, they are threatened by urbanization, pollution, and climate change. Moreover, colossal aquaculture ponds pose damages such as natural wetland shrinkage and water quality deterioration. However, understanding the trends and drivers of coastal aquaculture ponds on a national scale remains a challenge. In this study, a decision-tree classifier was used to quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of aquaculture ponds over last 30 years in 12 provinces located on the coast of China. Moreover, we analyzed their trends and drivers, including geographical conditions, socioeconomic factors, and development policies. The key results of the study include the following: (1) from 1990 to 2020, the cumulative area and holding area of aquaculture ponds reached 21997.90 km(2) and 9613.66 km(2), representing 3.7-fold and 1.6-fold increase, respectively, than the 1990 values. Based on geographical conditions, most aquaculture ponds tend to be located in coastal plains and bays following the distribution of low-lying land. (2) Influenced by different levels of socioeconomic development and changed policies, the holding area of aquaculture ponds experienced a "rapidly increasing period" from 1990 to 2011, growing by 246 km(2) per year; "stable period" between 2011 and 2017; and "sharply shrinking period" after 2017 declining by 417 km(2)/year. (3) Coastal land reclamation played a critical role in the expansion of aquaculture ponds by cumulatively contributing approximately 22\% of the land resource in the past 30 years. In the future, as a result of increasing land competition, the extent of aquaculture ponds on the China coast tends to decrease continually.

TI  - Monin-Obukhov Length As A Cornerstone Of The Sebal Calculations Of Evapotranspiration
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2007
AB  - The paper looks at the pivotal role that the Monin-Obukhov length (L) can play within the sensible heat balance method for calculating evapotranspiration from remotely sensed multispectral data. It focuses on the possibility of using L as a cornerstone parameter for calculations of sensible heat flux from the pixel data. The paper shows that L can be separated from the other unknowns and can be found either by means of any general one-dimensional root finding method, or iteratively, starting with L similar or equal to -infinity. A simple algorithm is suggested to reduce the number of iterations. The paper goes on to show that all other output parameters can be calculated directly from the value of L that is established, and an analytical expression for the evaporative fraction found. A novel approach is proposed that allows a close approximation of the evaporative fraction to be derived directly without the need for time-consuming iterations within the main calculation step. Estimates of evapotranspiration from cotton in Southern Kazakhstan showed that the approximation performed well when compared with estimates of ETcrop made using an iterative approach. An experimental approach for calculating E-24 is described for use in areas with minimal. cloud cover. Comparison of SEBAL estimated Et-c with calculated Et-o for the short season cotton crop in Southern Kazakhstan indicated that for the actively transpiring cotton crop the crop factors were the same as those determined experimentally for low short season cotton in Kansas by Hunsaker {[}Hunsaker, D.J., 1999.

TI  - Leaf Area Index As An Indicator Of Ecosystem Services And Management Practices: An Application For Coffee Agroforestry
JO  - Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment
PY  - 2014
AB  - Scalable indicators are promising to assess ecosystem services. In a large (660. ha) coffee agroforestry farm, we calibrated the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), calculated on a High Resolution (HR) satellite image and ground-truth LAI, providing a 2-layer (shade trees and coffee) LAI calibration with LAI 2000 and a new technique based on the cumulative distribution of LAI along transects. The effective and apparent clumping of coffee leaves were computed (0.76 and 0.89, respectively). We also calibrated the relationship between the derived HR-LAI farm map and NDVI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to re-construct LAI time-series (2001-2011).Coffee LAI, as derived from MODIS after substracting the contribution of shade tree LAI varied seasonally between 2.4 and 4.4m2m-2, with a maximum by the end of wet season (peak of harvest), steep decline during the drier-cooler season, minimum after annual coffee pruning, recovery during the next rainy season and pause during the grain filling period. MODIS also detected significant inter-annual variations in LAI originating from annual pruning, or plot renovation followed by a progressive LAI recovery during up to 4 years. We related the coffee-LAI time-series with farm registries to examine the impacts of management on LAI and on selected ecosystem services, namely yield and hydrological services. Nitrogen fertilization was adjusted annually by the farmer and appeared as the best yield predictor (R2=0.53). Combining N-fertilization with LAI from 6 significant months of the year, the prediction was improved (R2=0.74), confirming LAI as an important co-predictor of yield. We ended up with a yield prediction model including also the percentage of pruned resprouts (R2=0.79), with potential uses for regional yield mapping or reconstruction of historical yield time-series. The impacts of varying LAI (from nil to double actual values) on hydrological services were simulated. LAI affected the partitioning between green water (evapotranspiration) and blue water (infiltration, aquifer recharge, streamflow), thus the water provisioning. We discussed how LAI was influenced by natural factors (phenology, interaction between vegetative and reproductive components, climate) and by management (pruning, renovation). We confirmed LAI as a powerful scalable indicator for several key ecosystem services. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecosystem Health Assessment Of Desert Nature Reserve With Entropy Weight And Fuzzy Mathematics Methods: A Case Study Of Badain Jaran Desert
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Badain Jaran Desert is the fourth largest desert in the world, and its ecological environment has received widespread attention. In order to accurately assess the ecosystem health of the desert, the entropy weight method and fuzzy mathematics method were used on a spatial scale. This study builds an assessment indicator system based on the criteria of physiological factors, ecological factors and environmental factors. 11 indicators from field surveys, laboratory analysis and remote sensing are selected including biomass, net primary productivity (NPP), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), water use efficiency (WUE), light utility efficiency (LUE), soil crust, soil water content, precipitation, soil organic matter, soil nutrient and species diversity. The results showed that most areas of Badain Jaran Desert were in healthy and sub-healthy status. the area in healthy and sub-healthy status accounting for 68.1% and 27.7% of the total area, respectively. there is 4% of the total area encounter an unhealthy status, and 0.2% of present the sick status. The unhealthy and sick areas were mainly distributed in the areas with frequent human activities on the edge of the desert, while the healthy and sub-healthy status are mainly distributed in the interior of the desert, indicating that the overall ecological environment of Badain Jaran Desert was relatively stable, but the protection and restoration of the ecological environment in the periphery of the desert need to be strengthened to prevent further degradation. The purpose of this study was to form a technical system of ecosystem health assessment in arid desert nature reserve, providing technical support for ecosystem health assessment, ecosystem degradation monitoring, disease prevention, ecosystem protection and restoration, sustainable development of the reserve and ecosystem health control in arid desert nature reserve. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects Of Agriculturalization On Nutrient Extraction In The Argentinean Pampas. The Case Of Benito Juarez County
JO  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
PY  - 2021
AB  - The increasing loss of N and P is one of the greatest negative global consequences of agricultural advance. The aim of this study was to calculate an apparent N and P balance in the county of Benito Juarez during the 1989/90, 2002/03 and 2011/12 agroproductive periods, and relating the results achieved with the agriculture surface in each campaign. Initially, the N and P balance indicator was applied in all three campaigns. Then, the loss of nutrients per unit surface was established, based on data from satellite images of the county and the value of the N and P balances. As a result, remarkable temporal variations were observed with respect to the fertilized surfaces and the applied doses. Likewise, the growth of the agricultural area and alterations in the production values and yield of the crops stand out. The balances of both nutrients were negative in the three campaigns, showing a continuous generation of deficit balances, whit greater loss of tn of N than P per surface unit (km(2)). Obviously, agricultural sustainability is affected, so this study shows the nutrient situation in the county, establishing the need for a sustainable management of fertilization.

TI  - Vulnerability Assessment Of Crop Production To Climate Change Across Northwest China During 1995–2014
JO  - Journal of Mountain Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Crop production vulnerability to climate change in Northwest China depends upon multiple socio-ecological factors. Knowledge regarding the specific indicators and methods suitable for assessing crop production vulnerability is limited that address spatiotemporal variations across large and diverse zones. We propose an integrated assessment framework to quantify the vulnerability of crop production derived from crop yield sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive consequences across 338 counties in Northwest China during 1995–2014. Maps on these indices were generated using climatic and socioeconomic data with spatial mapping method. Different clusters of crop production vulnerability were then identified by a k-means cluster method to assess the heterogeneity of vulnerability at a regional scale. Results show that the vulnerability of crop production in 338 counties varies significantly in both geographical and socioeconomic aspects, specifically, vulnerability indicators are generally higher in Minhe, Menyuan, Hualong, and Ledu, and Xayar had the lowest value of vulnerability. This indicates that adaptation strategies for regional crop production need to focus on several levels, from the improvement of adaptive ability to crop yield fluctuation by promoting irrigation agriculture and optimizing limited water resources in typical arid areas, to agriculture-related financial policies incentivizing the capital investment and technology upgrade of crop production on traditional farming regions. This study provides convincing evidence that the factors related to socioeconomic policies are particularly alarming when a crop’s risk is compared to precipitation fluctuations. We recommend these findings be used to facilitate regional agriculture planning to reduce crop production vulnerability and ensure sustainable food security in specific regions. © 2021, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Management Strategy Influences Landscape Patterns Of High-Severity Burn Patches In The Southwestern United States
JO  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context Spatial patterns of high-severity wildfire in forests affect vegetation recovery pathways, watershed dynamics, and wildlife habitat across landscapes. Yet, less is known about contemporary trends in landscape patterns of high-severity burn patches or how differing federal fire management strategies have influenced such patterns. Objectives We assessed fires managed for ecological/resource benefit and fires that are fully suppressed and investigated: (1) whether spatial patterns of high-severity patches differed by management strategy, (2) whether spatial patterns were related to fire size and percent high-severity fire, and (3) temporal trends in spatial patterns. Methods We examined high-severity spatial patterns within large fires using satellite-derived burn severity data from 735 fires that burned from 1984 to 2017 in Arizona and New Mexico, USA. We calculated a suite of spatial pattern metrics for each individual fire and developed a method to identify those which best explained variation among fires. Results Compared to managed fires, spatial pattern metrics in suppression fires showed greater patch homogeneity. All spatial pattern metrics showed significant relationships with fire size and percent high-severity fire for both management strategies. Mean annual spatiotemporal trends in suppression fires have moved toward smaller, more complex, fragmented patches since the early 2000s. Conclusions Increases in fire size and proportion high-severity fire are driving more homogenous patches regardless of management type, with percent high-severity more strongly driving average temporal trends. Anticipated shifts in fire size and severity will likely result in larger, more contiguous, and simple-shaped patches of high-severity fire within southwestern conifer forests.

TI  - Using Satellite Radar Backscatter To Predict Above-Ground Woody Biomass: A Consistent Relationship Across Four Different African Landscapes
JO  - Geophysical Research Letters
PY  - 2009
AB  - Regional-scale above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates of tropical savannas and woodlands are highly uncertain, despite their global importance for ecosystems services and as carbon stores. In response, we collated field inventory data from 253 plots at four study sites in Cameroon, Uganda and Mozambique, and examined the relationships between field-measured AGB and cross-polarized radar backscatter values derived from ALOS PALSAR, an L-band satellite sensor. The relationships were highly significant, similar among sites, and displayed high prediction accuracies up to 150 Mg ha-1 (±∼20%). AGB predictions for any given site obtained using equations derived from data from only the other three sites generated only small increases in error. The results suggest that a widely applicable general relationship exists between AGB and L-band backscatter for lower-biomass tropical woody vegetation. This relationship allows regional-scale AGB estimation, required for example by planned REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) schemes.

TI  - Damage Identification And Assessment Using Image Processing On Post-Disaster Satellite Imagery
JO  - GHTC 2017 - IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, Proceedings
PY  - 2017
AB  - Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis often have a devastating effect on human life and cause noticeable damage to infrastructure. Active research has been ongoing to mitigate the impact of these catastrophes and preclude the economic losses. The existing methods that utilize pre-event and post-event images not only require the immediate and guaranteed availability of the appropriate data set but are also encumbered by manual mapping of the images, necessitating the indication of corresponding control points in the two images. This paper highlights the use of only post-event imagery in the absence of reference data to achieve a more timely delivery to produce damage maps as the output. This eliminates the need for manual georeferencing of images. Our method incorporates simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) for segmenting the images into uniform superpixels and extraction of 62 features for each superpixel. We used various classifiers of which Random Forest classifier was found to give a comparatively high accuracy of 90.4% over others. To enumerate the accuracy of the method proposed, we used 1500 data regions of which 20% were used for testing, and 80% were used for training. The aerial images taken by GeoEye1 after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami are utilized in this study to detect building damage. In the case of availability of ground truth, we compare the histograms of the pre- and post-imagery to quantify similarity as the SSD (Sum of Squared Distances) value and thus, our approach produces an assessment as an output map displaying the extent of damage in the area covered by each superpixel. We consider 6 levels of damage ranging from 1 to 6, where 1 signifies no damage, and 6, maximum damage. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Developing Grain Production Policy In Terms Of Multiple Cropping Systems In China
JO  - LAND USE POLICY
PY  - 2014
AB  - Multiple cropping is one of the simplest ways to increase grain production, and it has an important role in the food security of China. This paper evaluates the multiple cropping systems of China, and identifies the regional obstacles that limit the use of multiple cropping with the aim to give some implications for developing grain production policy. A time series analysis of remote sensing data coupled with an econometrics model-stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) was used to derive the multiple cropping index (MCI), potential multiple cropping index (PMCI), multiple cropping efficiency (MCE), and potential increment of multiple cropping index (PIMCI) to evaluate the multiple cropping systems. Regional obstacles to the use of multiple cropping were identified by zoning socioeconomic and ecological environmental factors that impact its application. The MCE of China in 2005 was 87.5\%, with a gap of 22\% between the MCI and the PMCI. The Bohai Rim, the rim of Tianshan Mountain, the Sichuan Basin, and the middle reach of Yangtze River are the main regions that larger PIMCI could be anticipated. The whole country (excluding areas that lacked data) was divided into seven distinct regions in terms of the impact factors and further classified into low-efficiency high-potential regions (LHRs), high-efficiency low-potential regions (HLRs), high-efficiency medium-potential regions (HMRs), and medium-efficiency high-potential regions (MHRs) according to regional multiple cropping performance. Considering about the obstacles and benefits to each region, different strategies should be implemented to different regions for regional grain production increase. Special attention should be paid to the improvement of MCE in north and southwest China with the expectation to increase grain production of China. The results would help implement "The plan to increase grain production capacity by 50 million tons nationwide" launched by the central government of China. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
