TI  - Novel Approach To Accurate And Rapid Flood Mapping Using Single Sar Image
JO  - 34th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2013, ACRS 2013
PY  - 2013
AB  - Flooding is the most common disaster in Asia, initiatives such as Sentinel Asia has been providing satellite imagery via WEB-GIS technologies for disaster management activities. Sentinel Asia has been providing SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery for rapid flood mapping. The technique uses dB value difference between the pre-flood image and the flood data image to identify the flood area using a threshold. This technique is not effective in identifying the actual flood area as it identifies dried water bodies in the pre-flood image as flooded area and partially flooded paddy fields as dry land. Through our work we have introduced and novel approach using a fusion of statistical modeling of SAR image dB values and past optical data to accurately identify the flood area for rapid flood mapping. This technique was able to accurately identify the partially flooded paddy area improving the flood mapping accuracy by 20%. The use of archived optical data also enables the model to accurately identify the perennial water bodies otherwise identified as flooded area. The ability to use a single SAR image is another major advantage of this approach. Over all this approach is able to generate faster maps with better accuracy compared to the existing methods used for rapid flood mapping.

TI  - Trends Of Resistance To Antimicrobials Recommended Currently And In The Past For Management Of Gonorrhea In The Apex Std Center In India And Comparison Of Antimicrobial Resistance Profile Between 2002-2006 And 2007-2012
JO  - Sexually Transmitted Diseases
PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae jeopardizes public health and continues to spread out to currently recommended and older antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance provides essential clues toward the modification of treatment guidelines. The aim of the study was to determine gonococcal AMR profile and trends between 2007 and 2012 and to evaluate any change in AMR profile in comparison with published trends in 2002 to 2006. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 261 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from consecutive patients between 2007 and 2012 was determined for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefpodoxime) and azithromycin by the disk diffusion technique and the Etest method. P value was determined using χ2 test for comparisons of trends between the 2 periods. Results: In comparison of AMR trends between 2002-2006 and 2007-2012, penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains increased significantly from 21.2% to 47.9% (P < 0.0001), 13.6% to 25.3% (P = 0.0002), and 78% to 89.7% (P = 0.0001), respectively. An insignificant increase from 2.4% to 4.2% (P > 0.05) in decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and 0.8% to 1.5% (P > 0.05) for azithromycin resistance was observed. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin over both the periods, except for one isolate in 2002. Conclusions: The study highlights that there is a continuous increase in resistance to previously recommended antibiotics despite their disuse for treatment. The increase in number of strains with decreased susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin resistance, currently recommended for management of gonorrhea, is of serious concern. These trends should be monitored continuously to change antibiotic policy. Copyright © 2015 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association All rights reserved.

TI  - Amerigeoss: A Geo Regional Initiative For The Americas
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2016
AB  - The AmeriGEOSS initiative is a framework that seeks to promote collaboration and coordination among the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) members of the American continent, "to realize a future wherein decisions and actions, for the benefit of the region, are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth observations and information". The Americas Caucus members (Argentina, Bahamas, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the United States, and Uruguay) have recognized the value of working together as one region to meet GEO objectives. In October 2014, the AmeriGEOSS initiative was born as a way to continue the progress made at that meeting in identifying regional needs GEO can address. The GEO Americas Caucus endorsed and presented the initiative to the GEO-XII Plenary and Ministerial in Mexico City last November 2015. The initiative is focused on the four GEO Societal Benefit Areas prioritized by the Americas Caucus members: food security and sustainable agriculture, disaster resilience, water resources management, and biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability. Foundational activities, e.g. data infrastructure and capacity building, are also a focus. Through this initiative, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) agencies and GEO Ministerial and other end users are joining to apply space-based and in-situ Earth observations for societal benefit. By leveraging and tailoring GEO global initiatives such as the GEO Global Agricultural Monitoring System (GEOGLAM), the GEO Global Water Sustainability (GE-OGLOWS), and the new Pole-to-Pole Marine Biodiversity Network (mBON), the initiative seeks to make the applications of Earth observations affordable for all in the region. These global initiatives are tailored and linked to local activities, to meet the regional needs. Copyright © 2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Scenario Simulation Of Ecological Risk Assessment Based On Ecosystem Service Values In The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - In this study, a framework for ecological risk assessment based on ecosystem service values and risk probability was established. Remote sensing was used to estimate the value of ecosystem services at the regional scale. Considering the natural and anthropogenic factors and using the entropy weight method to assign weights, probability index was constructed. In addition, multiple scenarios based on the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) method were simulated to reduce subjective uncertainty in the assessment. The results showed that the ecosystem service values generated by the gas regulation value accounted for the largest proportion, with a ratio of 46\% in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. From 2005 to 2015, the value of ecosystem services decreased, falling by 2.5 x 10(7) Yuan. The level of ecological risk was relatively high, with a corresponding area ratio of 32.89\%. Spatially, the areas with high risk were concentrated in the southeastern areas, and areas with relatively low risk were distributed in the western and northern areas. This high risk was probably caused by urbanization which was characterized by reduction of farmland and increase in impervious surface. Multi-scenario simulation showed that the areas of unstable ecological risk zones covered 30\% and were mainly concentrated in the surroundings of developing cities. In areas of unstable risk distribution, the relationship between development and protection should be considered. This framework increases the reliability and practicability of ecological risk assessment results and has potential application value for regional risk control in the context of urbanization.

TI  - Methods And Applications For Ecological Vulnerability Evaluation In A Hyper-Arid Oasis: A Case Study Of The Turpan Oasis, China
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Turpan Oasis is a typical fragile environment that lies in an arid region of eastern Xinjiang and is affected by natural conditions and human activities. The severity of the land degradation and desertification in this area is increasing; therefore, ecological vulnerability evaluations are important for environmental management of the region. In this study, theories and methods of evaluating ecological vulnerability and the typical characteristics of ecological vulnerability were summarized. By combining the environmental characteristics of the research area and the driving factors of ecological vulnerability, a multilayer vulnerability evaluation index system was built, and a pressure-state-response model was established to evaluate the ecological vulnerability. GIS and remote sensing technologies were applied to extract each index and create a spatial distribution map of vulnerability. The results showed that the vulnerability index values ranged from 3.08 to 6.59, with an average value of 5.19. Regions with moderate vulnerability accounted for 81.85 \% of the total area, whereas regions with light and serious vulnerability accounted for 4.19 and 13.95 \% of the total area, respectively. Thus, more than 80 \% of the area had moderate vulnerability, and nearly 14 \% of the area had serious vulnerability. The degree of vulnerability increased from east to west, and the ecological vulnerability in the inner oasis was significantly lower than that in the outer oasis. The key factors for ecological restoration and reconstruction are to control desertification and to ensure ecological water use to the greatest extent.

TI  - Future Perspectives Of Earth Observation: Indian Scenario
JO  - Space Technology
PY  - 1998
AB  - Civilian Earth Observation programmes have demonstrated the utility of space-based data to a variety of users-specifically those associated with the natural resources management. Its future will depend upon how the systems meet the demand of monitoring global environment; mapping, charting and geodesy; long-term global change research and assessment; monitoring and managing the renewable and non-renewable resources and national security applications. The future Earth Observation Systems (EOS) will have to take into consideration the aspects relate to the globalisation and standardisation of programmes world-over; data continuity and the need to monitor processes rather than events. Technological changes are also going to re-define many of the concepts of observation from space and issues like spatial resolution, spectral resolution and temporal resolution may no more be a concern for observation systems. In the Indian context, with the launch of IRS-1C, in December 1995, user services have been significantly enhanced. Presently, plans are onway to define the continuity to these missions. A broad analysis has been done of the observation needs of the future and also what has been achieved today and suggestions are made for the future observation systems design and implementation. The need analysis has been done keeping in mind the global change applications; mapping and cartographic applications; natural resources and environmental management applications etc. The paper discusses the strategy adopted for assessing the future requirements and also for defining the future Indian missions. Based on this evaluation and also the need for identifying low-cost, quick turn-around, application specific solutions, candidate payloads for the continuation series have been defined. These candidate payloads cater to a majority of the application needs and specific gap-areas would be taken care of. A decade profile of Indian Remote Sensing missions has been defined which addresses the concept of continuity, operational missions and the advanced missions up to 2005. The impact on utilisation accruing from these proposed missions has also been assessed. A perspective of the Indian Remote Sensing programme for the next decade is provided.

TI  - Temporal And Spatial Variations Of Net Primary Productivity And Its Response To Groundwater Of A Typical Oasis In The Tarim Basin, China
JO  - Journal of Arid Land
PY  - 2021
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) of the vegetation in an oasis can reflect the productivity capacity of a plant community under natural environmental conditions. Owing to the extreme arid climate conditions and scarce precipitation in the arid oasis regions, groundwater plays a key role in restricting the development of the vegetation. The Qira Oasis is located on the southern margin of the Taklimakan Desert (Tarim Basin, China) that is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding vegetation growth and water scarcity in the world. Based on remote sensing images of the Qira Oasis and daily meteorological data measured by the ground stations during the period 2006–2019, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of NPP in the oasis as well as its relation with the variation of groundwater depth using a modified Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model. At the spatial scale, NPP of the vegetation decreased from the interior of the Qira Oasis to the margin; at the temporal scale, NPP of the vegetation in the oasis fluctuated significantly (ranging from 29.80 to 50.07 g C/(m2·month)) but generally showed an increasing trend, with the average increase rate of 0.07 g C/(m2·month). The regions with decreasing NPP occupied 64% of the total area of the oasis. During the study period, NPP of both farmland and grassland showed an increasing trend, while that of forest showed a decreasing trend. The depth of groundwater was deep in the south of the oasis and shallow in the north, showing a gradual increasing trend from south to north. Groundwater, as one of the key factors in the surface change and evolution of the arid oasis, determines the succession direction of the vegetation in the Qira Oasis. With the increase of groundwater depth, grassland coverage and vegetation NPP decreased. During the period 2008–2015, with the recovery of groundwater level, NPP values of all types of vegetation with different coverages increased. This study will provide a scientific basis for the rational utilization and sustainable management of groundwater resources in the oasis. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Two Concepts Of Secularism
JO  - Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East
PY  - 2011
AB  - Secularism, for many of us, is not a terra incognita, and yet it is certainly an improperly defined and unexplained concept. For more than 150 years, intellectuals, politicians, and theologians have used secular and secularism in a rather ambiguous way. These terms therefore need to be clarified. The time has come to rethink our whole approach to the question of secularism. Given the inapplicability of the French model of secularism to the Muslim world, it becomes necessary to find a criterion by which state involvement, when it occurs in the domain of religion, can appear to the members of a religious group as both legitimate and fair. The Indian concept of secularism based on the toleration and equal protection of all religious communities without being supportive of any particular religion can supply this criterion. That said, to pursue a secular politics of rejecting sectarianism and demanding toleration requires that strategic priorities be rearranged without making historical shortcuts. In this case, a secular politics of toleration is a twofold struggle, a resistance to uniformization and an invitation to democratization. If such a strategy is to find any role in the regulation of the lives and activities of Islamic societies today, an alternative concept of secularism, rather than simply an alternative to it, needs to be worked out. The challenge is not to abandon secularism but to formulate it as a philosophy with spiritual values, rather than solely a policy of the state. This is the only way of rethinking our whole approach to the future in Muslim societies to the extent that the pluralist model of a "shared home" can be presented as "a third way" solution to the crisis of political societies in the Middle East and in opposition to the secular authoritarianism of the state and the rise of religious fundamentalism in civil society. © 2011 by Duke University Press.

TI  - A Sensor Web Architecture For Integrating Smart Oceanographic Sensors Into The Semantic Sensor Web
JO  - IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering
PY  - 2018
AB  - Effective ocean and coastal data management are needed to manage marine ecosystem health. Past ocean and coastal data management systems were often very specific to a particular application and region, but this focused approach often lacks real-time data and sharing/interoperating capability. The challenge for the ocean observing community is to devise standards and practices that enable integration of data from sensors across devices, manufacturers, users, and domains to enable new types of applications and services that facilitate much more comprehensive understanding and analyses of marine ecosystem. A given kind of sensor may be deployed on various platforms such as floats, gliders or moorings, and thus must be integrated with different operation, and data management systems. Simplifying the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems would benefit system operators and is important for the broader application of diverse sensors. This paper describes a geospatial 'sensor web' architecture developed by the 'NeXOS' project for ocean and coastal data management, based on the concepts of spatial data infrastructure and the Sensor Web Enablement framework of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This approach reduces the effort to propagate data from deployed sensors to users. To support the realization of the proposed Next generation Ocean Sensors (NeXOS) architecture, hardware and software specifications for a Smart Electronic Interface for Sensors and Instruments (SEISI) are described. SEISI specifies small lower-power electronics, minimal operating system, and standards-basedresearch software to enable web-based sharing, discovery, exchange, and processing of sensor observations as well as operation of sensor devices. An experimental scenario is presented in which sensor data from a low-power glider with low-bandwidth intermittent satellite communications is integrated into the geospatial sensor web using the NeXOS architecture. © 1976-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Geo-Morphometric Prioritization Of Aglar Micro Watershed In Lesser Himalaya Using Gis Approach
JO  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - Lesser Himalayan watersheds are most susceptible to conservational deprivation, that needs to accurate management and planning of available natural resources such as soil and water which are pre-requisites for sustainable growth of the watershed in the mountains regions. The analysis of watershed through morphometric together with geomorphic maps i.e., soil distribution, land cover, and slope map can play a role in forecasting to understand the behavior of hydrological processes in a Himalayan watershed. An attempt has been made to quantify the geo-morphometric parameters and their characteristics for watershed prioritization using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) approach and linked the geomorphologic parameters with the hydrological characteristics of the watershed. The sub-catchment Aglar UP (SC-1), Paligaad (SC-2), and Balganga (SC-3), located in the lesser Himalayas in Jaunpur block of Uttarakhand state having elevation between (670-2975 m). The sub-watershed (SC-1) and (SC-2) are third order and (SC-3) is a 1st order stream, having a dendritic drainage pattern with low drainage density < 0.5 km per km(2), indicates the impact of lithology and topography on drainage pattern. The average bifurcation ratio of (SC-1) is combatively less than (SC-2) which shows a high infiltration rate with low overland flow and presence of strong structural control on the drainage pattern. Lower values of circularity ratio and elongation ratio of < 0.5 advocated elongated shape of the watershed with lesser peak flows for an extended time. The less value of the form factor in the elongated type of watershed suggested about flatter peak flow. Based on the obtained morphometry parameters of linear and shape, watershed prioritization has been carried out for erosion risk. Based on weight and ranking, (SC-2) got the highest priority, is the most susceptible to erosion, whereas (SC-1) receives the least priority which means the least erosion. The results from this study helps to understand the hydrological behavior and soil erosion factors of lesser Himalayan watersheds that would be useful to water resource conservation to the planners, policy makers and agriculturists. The study gets the attentions from the scientists, researchers, involved in their respective fields.

TI  - Caelis: A System For Aerosol Measurement Network
PY  - 2018
AB  - Aerosols are of main importance in atmospheric and climate studies, thus the number of instruments and measurement networks which focus on its characterization are growing. Many challenges are derived from: standardization of protocols, monitoring of the instrument status to evaluate the network data quality, manipulation and distribution of large volume of data (raw and processed). CAELIS is a software system which aims at simplifying the management of a network, providing tools by monitoring the instruments, processing the data in real time and offering the scientific community a new tool to work with the data. CAELIS has been successfully applied since 2008 to the photometer calibration facility managed by the University of Valladolid, Spain, in the frame of AERONET. Thanks to the use of advanced tools, this facility has been able to analyze a growing number of stations and data in real time, which means great benefit to the network management and data quality control. Additionally, the system provides tools to assist research studies, as for example aerosol climatology analysis or aerosol satellite sensor product validation. The present work describes the system architecture of CAELIS and some examples of applications and data processing.

TI  - A Novel Post-Fire Method To Estimate Individual Tree Crown Scorch Height And Volume Using Simple Rpas-Derived Data
JO  - FIRE ECOLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - BackgroundAn accurate understanding of wildfire impacts is critical to the success of any post-fire management framework. Fire severity maps are typically created from satellite-derived imagery that are capable of mapping fires across large spatial extents, but cannot detect damage to individual trees. In recent years, higher resolution fire severity maps have been created from orthomosaics collected from remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS). Digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) point clouds can be derived from these same systems, allowing for spectral and structural features to be collected concurrently. In this note, a methodology was developed to analyze fire impacts within individual trees using these two synergistic data types. The novel methodology presented here uses RPAS-acquired orthomosaics to classify trees based on a binary presence of fire damage. Crown scorch heights and volumes are then extracted from fire-damaged trees using RPAS-acquired DAP point clouds. Such an analysis allows for crown scorch heights and volumes to be estimated across much broader spatial scales than is possible from field data.ResultsThere was a distinct difference in the spectral values for burned and unburned trees, which allowed the developed methodology to correctly classify 92.1\% of trees as either burned or unburned. Following a correct classification, the crown scorch heights of burned trees were extracted at high accuracies that when regressed against field-measured heights yielded a slope of 0.85, an R-squared value of 0.78, and an RMSE value of 2.2 m. When converted to crown volume scorched, 83.3\% of the DAP-derived values were within +/- 10\% of field-measured values.ConclusionThis research presents a novel post-fire methodology that utilizes cost-effective RPAS-acquired data to accurately characterize individual tree-level fire severity through an estimation of crown scorch heights and volumes. Though the results were favorable, improvements can be made. Specifically, through the addition of processing steps that would remove shadows and better calibrate the spectral data used in this study. Additionally, the utility of this approach would be made more apparent through a detailed cost analysis comparing these methods with more conventional field-based approaches.

AB  - We applied a robust framework for agricultural drought identification in the State of Espírito Santo, Brazil, by employing the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on data obtained through the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). By doing so, we analyzed the interrelationships between the VCI and anomalies in the Land Surface Temperature (LST), along with connections between the VCI and data considering water deficits in vulnerable areas. When it came to image processing, we focused on the use of analytics and GIS algorithms, while the Scott–Knott method elucidated the statistical analyses. Consequently, we identified drought areas followed by periods susceptible to their occurrence, indicating 2016 as the driest year. The North macroregion presented the lowest average values regarding VCI values in the most vulnerable periods, followed by the Central one. We also call attention to the highest LST averages observed in 2015 and 2016, as strong El Niño events marked the same timeframe periods. The methodological approach was efficient for the identification, analysis, and characterization of agricultural drought occurrences, enabling mitigation actions, as well as the management of the exploitation and protection of water resources. Moreover, further research should be conducted by incorporating other indices to enhance the understanding of agricultural drought and its effects on vegetation. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Higher Temporal Evapotranspiration Estimation With Improved Sebs Model From Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Data
JO  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable in hydrologic cycle that directly affects the redistribution of precipitation and surface balance. ET measurements with high temporal resolution are required for coupling with models of highly dynamic processes, e.g., hydrological and land surface processes. The Haihe River Basin is the focus of China's industrial base and it is one of the three major grain-producing regions within the country. However, this area is facing serious water resource shortages and water pollution problems. The present study used geostationary satellite remote sensing data, in situ meteorological observations, and the surface energy balance system (SEBS) model with a new kB(-1) parameterization to estimate 3-hourly and daily energy and water fluxes in the Haihe River Basin. The results of the SEBS model were validated with point-scale data from five observation flux towers. Validation showed that 3-hourly and daily ET derived from the SEBS model performed well (R-2 = 0.67, mean bias = 0.027 mm/h, RMSE = 0.1 mm/h). Moreover, factors influencing ET were also identified based on the results of this study. ET varies with land cover type and physical and chemical properties of the underlying surface. Furthermore, ET is also controlled by water availability, radiation, and other atmospheric conditions. It was found that ET had strong correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Specifically, daily ET fluctuated with the NDVI when the NDVI was <0.29, and ET increased rapidly as the NDVI increased from 0.29 to 0.81. For NDVI values >0.81, indicating a state of saturation, the rate of increase of ET slowed. This research produced reliable information that could assist in sustainable management of the water resources and in improved understanding of the hydrologic cycle of the Haihe River Basin.

TI  - Balancing A Radio Telescope As A Capstone Design Project
JO  - ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, Proceedings (IMECE)
PY  - 2007
AB  - The exciting contributions to science and education made by radio astronomy over the last three decades would not have been possible without the development of radio telescopes of increasing sensitivity and power. The Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI) is located near Brevard, North Carolina. It was built in 1962 and was a facility for tracking the spacecraft of the NASA Mercury and Gemini missions. In the late 1970's it was used by the National Security Agency for monitoring Soviet satellite activity and was decommissioned in 1992. It was later purchased by PARI and is now used for astronomical education and research as a not-for-profit organization. The Pisgah Astronomy Research Institute is a radio telescope facility that is now an educational and research center within the University of North Carolina, www.pari.edu. The two large dishes, 26E and 26W, Figure 1, and both have 85 feet (26 meter) apertures, and were initially developed for cold war satellite tracking, but modern upgrades have helped convert them into deep space research instruments. In addition, PARI has opened it facilities to students and has specifically invited student design projects that while providing services to PARI to improve their equipment and enhance their scientific and educational missions also provide a capstone learning experience for our seniors. This year's project represents the second consecutive one for North Carolina A&T engineering students. The objective of this 2006-2007 projects was to 1) determine if the radio telescope 26E is out of balance and 2) develop an appropriate design to bring the telescope into balance on each of the two axes, x=lower (major) axis, and y=upper (minor) axis. Through a series torque vs declination angle measurements the engineering students determined that the radio telescope x-axis was top heavy and that approximately two to three tons of counterweights needed to be added to the existing system of counterweights. Unfortunately for 26E, there was no provision for adding such counterweights as no supporting structure existed for adjustments. There was such a structure on 26W. This was a design challenge for the team involving decision making, safety, robustness, modeling, tool usage and fabrication of materials. Students learn a lot about field engineering problems from this project, and they begin to appreciatehow each of them could best add value to the creation of an improved instrument. They were able to apply what they have learned about materials, tolerances, analysis, safety, and other subjects to improve important scientific instruments, and they found that they learned much to enhance their careers.

TI  - Temporal Dynamics Of Evapotranspiration In Semiarid Native Forests In Brazil And Spain Using Remote Sensing
JO  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in integrated water resource planning, development and management. This process is particularly relevant in semiarid regions. The aim of this study is, hence, to compare spatial and temporal patterns of actual ET, as well as the temporal trends in two different semiarid forests, Caatinga (Brazil) and Tierra de Pinares (Spain). We used the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) to assess actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in both areas. In the Brazilian semiarid forest, Caatinga is the main vegetation, while it is Pinares in Spain. For this purpose, 69 Landsat-5 and 42 Landsat-8 images (1995-2019) were used. The Mann-Kendall test was applied to assess the occurrence of trends in precipitation, temperature and potential ET data; and the Temporal Stability Index (TSI) to know which areas have greater seasonal ETa. The annual amplitude of the potential evapotranspiration (ET0) is the same in both areas, however, the Caatinga values are higher. In the Caatinga forest, when ET0 presents its highest values throughout the year, ETa presents the lowest, and vice versa. In the Pinares forest, ETa follows the ET0 dynamics during the year, and the difference between ET0 and ETa is maximum during the summer. The Caatinga forest showed a greater spatial variation of ETa than the Pinares forest as well as a greater extension with lower temporal stability of ETa than the Pinares forest. Both the Caatinga forest and the Pinares forest showed significant positive trends in annual ET0 and ETa. We estimate that the value of ETa increases more rapidly in Pinares than in the Brazilian Caatinga. Taking Caatinga as a hydrological mirror, some consequences are expected to Pinares, such as significant changes in the water balance, increase of biodiversity vulnerability, and reduction of water availability in soil and reservoirs.

TI  - Validating And Linking The Gimms Leaf Area Index (Lai3g) With Environmental Controls In Tropical Africa
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2014
AB  - The recent Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) LAI3g product provides a 30-year global times-series of remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI), an essential variable in models of ecosystem process and productivity. In this study, we use a new dataset of field-based LAI(True) to indirectly validate the GIMMS LAI3g product, LAI(avhrr), in East Africa, comparing the distribution properties of LAI(avhrr) across biomes and environmental gradients with those properties derived for LAI(True). We show that the increase in LAI with vegetation height in natural biomes is captured by both LAI(avhrr) and LAI(True), but that LAI(avhrr) overestimates LAI for all biomes except shrubland and cropland. Non-linear responses of LAI to precipitation and moisture indices, whereby leaf area peaks at intermediate values and declines thereafter, are apparent in both LAI(True) and LAI(avhrr), although LAI(True) reaches its maximum at lower values of the respective environmental driver. Socio-economic variables such as governance (protected areas) and population affect both LAI responses, although cause and effect are not always obvious: a positive relationship with human population pressure was detected, but shown to be an artefact of both LAI and human settlement covarying with precipitation. Despite these complexities, targeted field measurements, stratified according to both environmental and socio-economic gradients, could provide crucial data for improving satellite-derived LAI estimates, especially in the human-modified landscapes of tropical Africa.

TI  - Effects Of Land Use And Land Cover Change On Ecosystem Service Values In Oasis Region Of Northwest China
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2009
AB  - Ecosystem services are "the benefits of nature to households, communities, and economies", which can be obtained directly or indirectly from ecosystem structure, functions or process. Land use and land cover change (LUCC) directly affects ecosystem functions and ecosystem service values with far-reaching consequences. Located in a typical Mountain-Oasis-Desert System of arid region, Qiemo oasis is one of the most important oases in Tarim River Basin, China. Taking Qiemo oasis as a case study, this paper analyzed land use and land cover change from 1989 to 2004 using remote sensing images of 1989 and 2004. Furthermore, based on Chinese ecosystem service values of unit area of different ecosystem types, the dynamic changes of ecosystem services value caused by LUCC were evaluated. The results indicated that the area of forest, Gobi desert and Salina land decreased from 1989 to 2004. On the other hand, the area of farmland, water land and building land increased, in which the forest land and farmland changed the most. Area of forest land decreased 41.73% and farmland increased 58.04%. The total ecosystem services value had decreased from 22 265×104 US$ to 21 373×?104 US$ during the past 15 years. The reduction of forest land was responsible for the reduction of the ecosystem service value. Population increasing and economic development were main driving forces for these changes. At last, some measures were put up for a sustainable development in this region. © 2009 SPIE.

TI  - Geochemistry And Multiomics Data Differentiate Streams In Pennsylvania Based On Unconventional Oil And Gas Activity
JO  - Microbiology Spectrum
PY  - 2022
AB  - Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) extraction is increasing exponentially around the world, as new technological advances have provided cost-effective methods to extract hard-to-reach hydrocarbons. While UOG has increased the energy output of some countries, past research indicates potential impacts in nearby stream ecosystems as measured by geochemical and microbial markers. Here, we utilized a robust data set that combines 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (DNA), metatranscriptomics (RNA), geochemistry, and trace element analyses to establish the impact of UOG activity in 21 sites in northern Pennsylvania. These data were also used to design predictive machine learning models to determine the UOG impact on streams. We identified multiple biomarkers of UOG activity and contributors of antimicrobial resistance within the order Burkholderiales. Furthermore, we identified expressed antimicrobial resistance genes, land coverage, geochemistry, and specific microbes as strong predictors of UOG status. Of the predictive models constructed (n = 30), 15 had accuracies higher than expected by chance and area under the curve values above 0.70. The supervised random forest models with the highest accuracy were constructed with 16S rRNA gene profiles, metatranscriptomics active microbial composition, metatranscriptomics active antimicrobial resistance genes, land coverage, and geochemistry (n = 23). The models identified the most important features within those data sets for classifying UOG status. These findings identified specific shifts in gene presence and expression, as well as geochemical measures, that can be used to build robust models to identify impacts of UOG development. IMPORTANCE The environmental implications of unconventional oil and gas extraction are only recently starting to be systematically recorded. Our research shows the utility of microbial communities paired with geochemical markers to build strong predictive random forest models of unconventional oil and gas activity and the identification of key biomarkers. Microbial communities, their transcribed genes, and key biomarkers can be used as sentinels of environmental changes. Slight changes in microbial function and composition can be detected before chemical markers of contamination. Potential contamination, specifically from biocides, is especially concerning due to its potential to promote antibiotic resistance in the environment. Additionally, as microbial communities facilitate the bulk of nutrient cycling in the environment, small changes may have long-term repercussions. Supervised random forest models can be used to identify changes in those communities, greatly enhance our understanding of what such impacts entail, and inform environmental management decisions.

TI  - A Multistage Stochastic Programming Approach To The Optimal Surveillance And Control Of The Emerald Ash Borer In Cities
JO  - INFORMS Journal on Computing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Emerald ash borer (EAB), a wood-boring insect native to Asia and invading North America, has killed untold millions of high-value ash trees that shade streets, homes, and parks and caused significant economic damage in cities of the United States. Local actions to reduce damage include surveillance to find EAB and control to slow its spread. We present a multistage stochastic mixed-integer programming (M-SMIP) model for the optimization of surveillance, treatment, and removal of ash trees in cities. Decision-dependent uncertainty is modeled by representing surveillance decisions and the realizations of the uncertain infestation parameter contingent on surveillance as branches in the M-SMIP scenario tree. The objective is to allocate resources to surveillance and control over space and time to maximize public benefits. We develop a new cutting-plane algorithm to strengthen the M-SMIP formulation and facilitate an optimal solution. We calibrate and validate our model of ash dynamics using seven years of observational data and apply the optimization model to a possible infestation in Burnsville, Minnesota. Proposed cutting planes improve the solution time by an average of seven times over solving the original M-SMIP model without cutting planes. Our comparative analysis shows that the M-SMIP model outperforms six different heuristic approaches proposed for the management of EAB. Results from optimally solving our M-SMIP model imply that under a belief of infestation, it is critical to apply surveillance immediately to locate EAB and then prioritize treatment of minimally infested trees followed by removal of highly infested trees. Summary of Contributions: Emerald ash borer (EAB) is one of the most damaging invasive species ever to reach the United States, damaging millions of ash trees. Much of the economic impact of EAB occurs in cities, where high-value ash trees grow in abundance along streets and in yards and parks. This paper addresses the joint optimization of surveillance and control of the emerald ash borer invasion, which is a novel application for the INFORMS society because, to our knowledge, this specific problem of EAB management has not been published before in any OR/MS journals. We develop a new multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (MSS-MIP) formulation, and we apply our model to surveillance and control of EAB in cities. Our MSS-MIP model aims to help city managers maximize the net benefits of their healthy ash trees by determining the optimal timing and target population for surveying, treating, and removing infested ash trees while taking into account the spatiotemporal stochastic growth of the EAB infestation. We develop a new cutting plane methodology motivated by our problem, which could also be applied to other stochastic MIPs. Our cutting plane approach provides significant computational benefit in solving the problem. Specifically, proposed cutting planes improve the solution time by an average of seven times over solving the original M-SMIP model without cutting planes. We calibrate and validate our model using seven years of ash infestation observations in forests near Toledo, Ohio. We then apply our model to an urban forest in Burnsville, Minnesota, that is threatened by EAB. Our results provide insights into the optimal timing and location of EAB surveillance and control strategies. Copyright: © 2020 INFORMS

TI  - Cash For Carbon: A Randomized Trial Of Payments For Ecosystem Services To Reduce Deforestation
JO  - Science
PY  - 2017
AB  - We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forestowning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Measuring The Semi-Century Ecosystem-Service Value Variation In Mekelle City Region, Northern Ethiopia
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2021
AB  - The Mekelle city region is facing severe ecosystem degradation. The study area has experienced unprecedented land-use dynamics over the past 47 years, but the effect of these dynamics on ecosystem-service values remains unknown. Estimating the various ecosystem services from a city region perspective has not been attempted so far. The rationale of this study was to estimate the spatial-temporal ecosystem-service value variations. The methodology employed was land-use/land-cover (LULC) datasets of remotely sensed datasets of the years 1972, 1984, 2001, 2012, and 2019, and ecosystem service value coefficient, expert focus group discussion, and document review were used. The digital satellite images were processed, classified, and analyzed using Earth Resource Development Assessment System (ERDAS) Imagine. Computations of changes in the land-use categories were made using Arc GIS 10.5.1, Eviews for time series data analysis, and XLSTAT analytical tools were used. Over the whole study period from 1972 to 2019, a loss of USD 128.6 million was observed, which is a reduction of 501.9\%. The study shows that due to land-use changes, the total ecosystem service value is decreasing annually, suggesting that much more severe ecosystem degradation is due to occur. The results are relevant to policy development and indicate that ecological restoration is the best option in the study area.

TI  - Vulnerability Of Human Communities In Mexican Mangrove Ecosystems: An Ecosystem-Based Adaptation Approach
JO  - Investigaciones Geograficas
PY  - 2018
AB  - Well-conserved mangroves decrease vulnerability to extremes such as sea level rise and hurricanes. In Mexico, some inhabitants depend on mangrove environmental services. In La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve, wetland connectivity is decreasing because of fires and human activities. Degradation was aggravated for the effects of hurricanes Paulina (1997) and Mitch (1998). The Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) approach was used to identify the local benefits provided by mangroves and increases their adaptive capacity to changing climate. To evaluated conservation status, the vegetation structure was monitoring by transects. The land cover change was assessing by remote sensing techniques and demographic statistics was used to evaluate local social vulnerability to weather extremes. The application of semi-structural interviews to local inhabitants and civil protection authorities indicated that 19.9% of the total area was changed, mostly mangroves and grassland to agriculture use. Perception surveys showed that inhabitants recognize the protection that mangroves provide against floods, intense winds and storm surges. Although 61% of the 162 persons surveyed are engaged in some conservation activity (managing mangrove nurseries and planting it in restored areas and avoiding the hunting of wildlife), communities have no full aware of the environmental services. This study is an example to local adaptation climate change initiatives and conservation strategies because could help inhabitants to recognize their capacities for develop their own well-being. Recommendations are made on the environmental management and the economic conversion of the villagers to reduce the social vulnerability of the region.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring And Analysis Of Ecological Environment In Weinan City, Northwest China Based On Rsei Model
JO  - Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology
PY  - 2016
AB  - Based on the data of remote sensing images from Landsat in 1995 and 2015, this paper used the principal component analysis (PCA) method to determine the weights of four ecological indexes (greenness, dryness, wetness and heat), and then selected a evaluation model of remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) to monitor and analyze the ecological environment quality of Weinan City from 1995 to 2015. The results showed that the mean values of RSEI in Weinan City increased from 0.489 to 0.556 during 1995-2015, which indicated the ecological environment quality had been improved. The improved area of ecological quality was mainly distributed in the central area of Weinan City and its proportion was 49.6%. While the proportion of ecological environment degradation was 15.4%, and such areas were mainly distributed in some mine areas of Hancheng City and the southern Weinan (Weinan Section in North Qinling Mountains). The quality of ecological environment was greatly influenced by the urban planning and construction in the study area. Generally, the ecological condition of Weinan City had been improved, which benefited from the attention and investment of government. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variation Of Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency In Beijing's Suburban Region
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2017
AB  - Suburban ecosystem has multiple functions such as soil conservation and water regulation, which are critical for the welfare of human beings in the city. Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem function that represents the amount of productivity per unit mass of evapotranspiration (ET). Improving WUE of suburban ecosystem is significant to climate regulation by carbon sequestration and water consumption, especially for cities with severe water shortage like Beijing, the capital of China. Based on remote sensing data, this paper examined the spatial and temporal variations in WUE in Beijing's suburban region from 2002 to 2010. The results showed that the average annual WUE was 0.868 g C mm-1 m-2. It has large spatial variation with the minimum of 0.500 g C mm-1 m-2 in the Miyun District. During the study periods, the area with significant increasing trend of WUE was 63.2% of the total suburban region. In terms of ecosystem type, the value of WUE was following the sequence, deciduous coniferous forest (0.921g C mm-1 m-2) > mixed forest (0.887g C mm-1 m-2) > deciduous broadleaf forest (0.884 g C mm-1 m-2) > shrubland (0.860 g C mm-1 m-2) > evergreen coniferous forest (0.836 g C mm-1 m-2) > grassland (0.830 g C mm-1 m-2). As ET was similar among the ecosystems, the difference in WUE was mainly due to the discrepancy of NPP. We found that NPP significantly correlated with the diversity of ecosystem type (represented by Shannon-Wiener index). Our results suggest that ecological engineering construction, scientific ecosystem type selection, ecosystem diversity improvement and drought-resistant species cultivation are conductive to improve ecosystem WUE in Beijing's suburban region. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - From The Urban-Rural Territorialities To The Transformations Of The Landscape: A Case Study In La Requilina Village, The Town Of Usme, South Of The City Of Bogotá (Colombia), 1985 - 2016
JO  - Revista Luna Azul

AB  - The article analyzes how the ecological structure of the landscape is configured from the juxtaposition of rural-urban territorialities that reproduce in the periphery of a city. The study takes as case La Requilina village, located in the town of Usme, south of the city of Bogota (Colombia). The research was carried out through the processing of satellite images and the transformations in the coverage of the soil was examined in three periods of time 1985, 2000 and 2016. The results were corroborated by an in-situ exploration that investigated through interviews, social cartography and participant observation, the changes produced in the landscape as a consequence of the variability of land ownership, sources of employment, productive practices and social relations among its inhabitants. It shows that the fragmentation of the landscape, related to its natural attributes and the production systems of small-scale agriculture, are deeply threatened as a result of access, use, transformation and control of the soil and its natural resources, nowadays highly utilized by the flows of urban industrial capital. Although there are significant transformations, it is concluded that a collective action effort prevails in which the need exists for these places to be valued and protected by the city government as territories susceptible for planning and territorial organization, dependent on the environmental services they provide, their food offerings, the preservation of rural livelihoods, and their extensive connection with the urban environment that surrounds them. © Universidad de Caldas.

TI  - Analyzing The Variations In The Water Surface Area Of Taleqan Dam Of Iran Using Ground-Based And Satellite Observations
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate and long-term series surface water extraction from dams are of great significance for developing the agroecosystem and sustainable management of water resources. By expanding the remote sensing data with an excellent spatial-temporal resolution, it is possible to monitor various hydrological parameters such as dams' water level and surface area. This study provides a quick and robust method for open-surface water detection based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in Taleqan Dam. For this purpose, 90 Sentinel-2 images from September 2015 to November 2019 were used. First, the NDWI index separated water pixels from non-water pixels. Then binary segmentation was conducted to extract water pixels from NDWI images to calculate the water surface area. Comparing two time series of water surface area results obtained from Sentinel-2 images with in-situ data showed RMSE values of 0.43 km(2), a correlation of 93.64\%, and an RRMSE value of 4.09\%. Also, the results showed that the most significant increase in the water surface area with a value of 1.22 km(2) occurred from June 27, 2018, to August 1, 2018, and also the most significant decrease. It also happened with 1.75 km(2) from May 23, 2017, to June 12, 2017. On the other hand, the variations average of the water surface area with a value of -0.03 km(2) shows a slight decrease in the water surface area of Taleqan Dam in the study period.

TI  - Assessment Of Potential Oil Spill Risk Along Vishakhaptnam Coast, India: Integrated Approach For Coastal Management
JO  - Coastal Management: Global Challenges and Innovations
PY  - 2018
AB  - Oil pollution in coastal waters causes severe environmental, ecological, economic, and other consequences. Oil spill environmental sensitivity and risk assessment mapping is to assess the susceptibility of the coastal resources and aid effective decision-making in minimizing the long-term effect. Here, an attempt has been made to develop an Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) for ecologically sensitive resources along the Vishakhapatnam coast, which is known to be a tourist hub and an ecologically important shore along the east coast of India. Oil transport along this coast has dramatically increased over the past 10 years, raising the potential for spills. An oil spill model was used to assess the movement of an accidental spill scenario to identify the potential region that is likely to be affected. Coastal resource maps are prepared using multispectral satellite data and are valued for their sensitivity in making protection a priority in the event of beaching. The coastal resource information integrated with model results shows that major impacts are caused during the southwest monsoon; it is also found to cause more fatal effects on marine pelagic organisms. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

PY  - 2018
AB  - The increasing availability of satellite data is a real value for the enhancement of environmental knowledge and land management. Possibilities to integrate different source of geo-data are growing and methodologies to create thematic database are becoming very sophisticated. Moreover, the access to internet services and, in particular, to web mapping services is well developed and spread either between expert users than the citizens. Web map services, like Google Maps or Open Street Maps, give the access to updated optical imagery or topographic maps but information on land cover/use - are not still provided. Therefore, there are many failings in the general utilization - non-specialized users- and access to those maps. This issue is particularly felt where the digital (web) maps could form the basis for land use management as they are more economic and accessible than the paper maps. These conditions are well known in many African countries where, while the internet access is becoming open to all, the local map agencies and their products are not widespread. © Authors 2018.

TI  - Evaluation Of Two End-Member-Based Models For Regional Land Surface Evapotranspiration Estimation From Modis Data
JO  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
PY  - 2015
AB  - The importance of accurate estimations of regional and global evapotranspiration (ET) has been recognized worldwide in the fields of hydrology, water resource management, meteorology, and global climate change. Given the different structures of the end-member-based surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) and surface temperature vegetation index (T-s-VI) triangle models, which nonetheless use essentially the same definitions of dry and wet pixels, questions arise regarding the nature of the differences between the two models' estimated sensible heat fluxes and latent heat fluxes and what controls the heat flux differences. This study aims to investigate how the SEBAL model and the T-s-VI triangle method differ from each other in the regional evaporative fraction (EF) and ET estimates through analytical deduction and model applications. Because both the SEBAL model and the T-s-VI triangle model are of limited use when deep-layer soil moisture is moderately to significantly stressed, MODIS remote sensing data from 23 clear-sky overpass times between January 2010 and late October 2011, covering a wide range of soil moisture content and fractional vegetation cover conditions, are acquired to assess the two models over a non-water stressed study area on the North China plain. The results show that the SEBAL model is able to produce satisfactory sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (LE) estimates compared with ground-based large aperture scintillometer measurements at the Yucheng station, with small biases of 4.1 W/m(2) and 2.3 W/m(2) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 46.4 W/m(2) and 48.6 W/m(2), respectively. However, the T-s-VI triangle model produces much worse H and LE estimates, with biases of 98.5 W/m(2) and 92.2 W/m(2) and RMSEs of 119.3 W/m(2) and 115.5 W/m(2), respectively. Variations of pixel-by-pixel surface available energy and momentum roughness length over the study area are responsible for the differences of the H and LE estimates between the two models. The SEBAL model produces larger EF and ET for most pixels than the T-s-VI triangle method when the same group of dry and wet pixels is applied, especially for pixels characterized by medium to high vegetation fractions or surface soil moisture contents. The T-s-VI triangle method is more sensitive to the surface temperatures of the dry and wet pixels than the SEBAL model. The findings from this study benefit the proper selection of end-member-based models for regional ET estimation and aid in quantifying the resultant uncertainties in the model-derived surface energy components.

TI  - Establishing Reservoir Surface Area-Storage Capacity Relationship Using Landsat Imagery
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Remote sensing is a powerful tool for tracking surface waterbodies at different scales and spatial and temporal resolutions. The efficient management of water resources, at basin or regional scales, requires the monitoring of water storage in reservoirs. In reservoirs where storage observations text{are} available or a surface water-storage curve exists, storage can be estimated using optical remote sensing. Therefore, this study uses image segmentation to estimate the surface area of three large reservoirs to predict surface water storage volumes. We established a surface area-storage relationship using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), produced from Landsat imagery using the Google Earth engine code editor interface, to estimate surface water storage for the New Melones, Don Pedro and McClure reservoirs located in central California. Observed storage showed a very high correlation (mathrm{R}geq 0.990) with remotely sensed surface area estimates. The results show that the modeled storage values derived from fitted equations of the remote sensing methodology were highly correlated (mathrm{R}geq 0.993, p-value < 0.001) with observed storage data. Monitoring surface water storage using satellite data is thus demonstrated, as is seasonal and interannual variations of storage levels, which are estimated with small errors and high predictive power (mathrm{R}{2}geq 0.987,text{PBIAS}leq+0.6%, text{NSE} geq 0.989). © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Swat Model Calibration And Uncertainty Analysis For Streamflow Prediction In The Kunwari River Basin, India, Using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Kunwari River Basin (KRB) needs effective management of water resources for sustainable agriculture and flood hazard mitigation. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a semi distributed physically based model, was chosen and set up in the KRB for hydrologic modeling. SWAT-CUP (SWAT-Calibration and Uncertainty Programs) was used for model calibration, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, following the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique. The model calibration was performed for the period (1987-1999), with initial 3 years of warm up (1987-89); then, the model was validated for the subsequent 6 years of data (2000-2005). To assess the competence of model calibration and uncertainty, two indices, the p-factor (observations bracketed by the prediction uncertainty) and the r-factor (achievement of small uncertainty band), were taken into account. The results of SWAT simulations indicated that during the calibration the p-factor and the r-factor were reported as 0.82 and 0.76, respectively, while during the validation the p-factor and the r-factor were obtained as 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. After a rigorous calibration and validation, the goodness of fit was further assessed through the use of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) between the observed and the final simulated values. The results indicated that R-2 and NS were 0.77 and 0.74, respectively, during the calibration. The validation also indicated a satisfactory performance with R-2 of 0.71 and NS of 0.69. The results would be useful to the hydrological community, water resources managers involved in agricultural water management and soil conservation, as well as to those involved in mitigating natural hazards such as droughts and floods.

TI  - River Water Balance Accounts For The Murray-Darling Basin To Support Water Assessment Modelling
PY  - 2009
AB  - Monthly water balance accounts (1990-2006) were developed for 145 river reaches within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) as part of the Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields project. They were used to assess how well river hydrology is measured and understood, and to identify the main uncertainties in river modelling. The purpose of accounting was different compared to water accounting systems set up for natural resources management, such as those that will be produced by the Bureau of Meteorology. Many aspects are still relevant however. A brief overview of the methods and data sources is provided, with emphasis on the methods used to combine different data sources in water balance accounts. Some benefits of the approach taken were identified as well as deficiencies requiring improvement. The aggregate water balance accounts are presented for all reaches that could be assessed, which covered most but not all of the MDB's river sections. The components of the water balance for which on-ground hydrometric data are available were compared to those which could be attributed with less direct observations, and apparent gains and losses that could not be attributed, respectively (noting that these will have included both real water and estimation errors in all terms). Approximately 48\% of the overall water balance appeared to be gauged. Another 21\% could be attributed, whilst the remaining 31\% was unattributed. Comparison of the accounted and simulated water balance was not straightforward but provided useful insights into the assumptions made in modelling, and the uncertainty in these assumptions. Some implications for 'formal' water accounting are discussed. Unlike perhaps financial accounting, all numbers in a water account will be indirectly derived using estimation methods, because (1) every hydrological observation is indirect and involves a varying degree of estimation; and (2) not including even more indirect estimation methods (e. g. hydrological models) will produce water accounts that are incomplete and probably not useful. The suggested alternative is to use the full range of observations in a modelling framework that considers the uncertainty in the model as well as in all observations, to maximise both accuracy and precision in the accounts. Water accounts were most uncertain towards the end of inland river systems, particularly where anabranching and wetlands occur alongside irrigated areas: through unregulated or distributed diversions and extractions, losses to floodplains and wetlands, and groundwater recharge. These can all occur within the same reach and at the same time. In addition accurate streamflow gauging can also be challenging in this environment. Satellite observations of land use, evapotranspiration and inundation offer the best opportunity for further reducing uncertainty in these areas. Uncertainty is least in the unregulated, wetter headwaters of most of the regions, where gauging is better and processes better known. A degree of model 'over fitting' was identified; for example, increasing the total water balance volume to accommodate what effectively may well be errors in streamflow gauging. Calibration of hydrological models against all gauging and other data simultaneously in a way that considers the error in observations will help reduce such compensating errors, reduce the unattributed component in water accounts, and provide consistent uncertainty estimates for each term.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Pattern Analysis Of Land Use And Water Yield In Water Source Region Of Middle Route Of South-To-North Water Transfer Project Based On Google Earth Engine
JO  - Water (Switzerland)
PY  - 2022
AB  - The water source area of the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is an important water conservation and ecological protection area in China. Based on remote sensing data, this paper analyzed the evolution process of land use/cover change in water source region in the past 35 years. Then, based on the InVEST model, the spatial-temporal patterns of water yield in the water source region were calculated with land use cover, meteorology and soil data as inputs. The impacts of climate factors such as precipitation and temperature and land use change on water yield were discussed, and the responses of water yield to these two changes were also discussed. The results show that from 1985 to 2020, the average water yield depth in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project increases first and then decreases, from 615 mm in 1985 to 738 mm in 2000, and then decreases to 521 mm in 2020. The spatial heterogeneity of the water-producing capacity is obvious. The high value of the water-producing capacity is concentrated in the Daba Mountain area in the south, while the low values are concentrated in the Hanzhong Basin, Ankang Basin and the eastern plain area. The spatial pattern of water producing depth has no obvious change. The average water yield depth of forest, grassland and shrub in the region was the largest, and forest and cultivated land were the main contributors to the total water yield of the region, providing 82% and 14% of the total water yield in 2020. Precipitation has a significant effect on water yield, while land use/cover change has a small effect on water yield. © 2022 by the authors.

JO  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
PY  - 1999
AB  - In 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) began the development of the Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) and embarked on a journey that would take radio navigation and positioning to what were then unimagined levels of performance. From its inception, GPS was viewed as a revolutionary technology that would enhance the positioning capability of U.S. and allied military forces throughout the world. The DoD has continued to upgrade and improve all of the components of the system to keep pace with technology advances and the requirements of an ever-expanding user community. Today, GPS has evolved far beyond the vision of its original designers, and satellite navigation is now widely recognized as a worldwide information resource for both military and civilian users. The GPS user community includes an increasing number of civil, scientific, and commercial applications, ranging from precision farming to pinpointing disruptions in electric power distribution networks. However this dual military and civil aspect of GPS has posed significant challenges for U.S. Government and DoD policy makers. Since the inception of GPS, the DoD has been confronted with the need to balance a wide range of different and sometimes competing national security civil, foreign policy, commercial, and scientific interests. The challenge has been to exploit the full civil utility of the system without jeopardizing national security interests in the process. This challenge will became even more formidable for military leaders as U.S, and allied forces become increasingly reliant on GPS for all types of military operations, and as the applications of the worldwide civil user community continue to expand.

TI  - Effect Of Urban Green Patterns On Surface Urban Cool Islands And Its Seasonal Variations
JO  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urban green spaces often form urban cool islands (UCIs), which are important for human health and urban sustainability. Previous studies have emphasized the cooling effects of urban green spaces on their surrounding areas at landscape level. Less attention, however, has been directed to effects of urban green space patterns on their own UCIs at patch level. In this study, we focused on the effects of spatial patterns of urban green patches on their own surface UCIs. The urban green spaces of Beijing, China, were extracted from one QuickBird image and were classified as Trees, Shrubs, Grass, Crops, River and Lake. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) were derived from four Landsat images, each in one season. The UCI was represented by the minimum LST of each urban green patch. Results showed spatial patterns of urban green patches had significant effects on their UCIs in four seasons. In detail, the size, edge and connectivity of urban green spaces all affected the UCIs negatively, and the influence was stronger in warm seasons. Shape of urban green space also had effects on UCIs, but the effects were stronger in cool seasons. Great differences were found between predictive values of metrics for different green types. Shape metrics were more important for indicating UCIs of River, Trees and Crops than were patch size and connectivity. However, patch size and connectivity metrics were more effective in determining UCIs of Shrubs, Grass and Lake than were shape metrics. Further, among shape metrics, only shape index was a good indicator of UCIs. The results of this study suggest that a combination of specific urban green types and pattern metrics are a prerequisite for analyzing the influence of urban green patterns on UCIs and for urban green design. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - China is currently in a key period of transformation and upgrading for its industrial infrastructure, and it is important to investigate the quantity, spatial distribution and production status of heat source industries to ensure effective supervision by environmental protection departments and to optimize the layout for regional industrial planning. In this study, based on the 2013-2019 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) I-band 375-m active fire data (VNP14IMG) product, a model combining density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and logistic regression (LR) was adopted to identify industrial heat source objects in China, and the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of industrial objects at different levels were analyzed. The results indicate the following: (1) the VNP14IMG-based DBSCAN-LR identification model feasibly identifies industrial heat sources, and the accuracy of cross-validation is 93\% and that of typical cities reaches as high as 92\%; (2) The number of industrial heat source objects (NIHSO) in China from 2013 to 2019 exhibits a general downward trend, with the NIHSO values from 2013 to 2019 being 2673, 2608, 2374, 2273, 2284, 2317, and 2269, respectively; (3) the spatial pattern of regional industrial development is extremely unbalanced and can be characterized as being "dense in the north and sparse in the south". The industrial focus has shifted southwest, reflecting advances in the central and western regions achieved through industrial transfer; (4) the global spatial autocorrelation of industrial distribution is positive, and the correlation increases over time. The local correlation shows that the geographic concentration characteristics of "high-high" agglomeration in the north and "low-low" agglomeration in the west.

TI  - International Space Station As A Base Camp For Exploration Beyond Low Earth Orbit
JO  - Acta Astronautica
PY  - 2013
AB  - The idea for using the International Space Station (ISS) as a platform for exploration has matured in the past few years and the concept continues to gain momentum. ISS provides a robust infrastructure which can be used to test systems and capabilities needed for missions to the Moon, Mars, asteroids and other potential destinations. International cooperation is a critical enabler and ISS has already demonstrated successful management of a large multi-national technical endeavor. Systems and resources needed for expeditions can be aggregated and thoroughly tested at ISS before departure thus providing wide operational flexibility and the best assurance of mission success. A small part of ISS called an Exploration Platform (ISS-EP) can be placed in cislunar space providing immediate benefits and flexibility for future exploration missions. We will show how ISS and the ISS-EP can be used to reduce risk and improve the operational flexibility for missions beyond low Earth orbit. Life support systems and other technologies developed for ISS can be evolved and adapted to the ISS-EP and other exploration spacecrafts. New technology, such as electric propulsion and advanced life support systems can be tested and proven at ISS as part of an incremental development program. Commercial companies who are introducing transportation and other services will benefit with opportunities to contribute to the mission since ISS will serve as a focal point for the commercialization of low earth orbit services. Finally, we will show how the use of ISS provides immediate benefits to the scientific community because its capabilities are available today and certain critical aspects of exploration missions can be simulated. © 2012 IAA.

TI  - Optimising The Use Of Hyperspectral And Lidar Data For Mapping Reedbed Habitats
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - Reedbeds are important habitats for supporting biodiversity and delivering a range of ecosystem services, yet reedbeds in the UK are under threat from intensified agriculture, changing land use and pollution. To develop appropriate conservation strategies, information on the distribution of reedbeds is required. Field surveys of these wetland environments are difficult, time consuming and expensive to execute for large areas. Remote sensing has the potential to replace or complement such field surveys, yet the specific application to reedbed habitats has not been fully investigated. In the present study, airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery were acquired for two sites in Cumbria, UK. The research aimed to determine the most effective means of analysing hyperspectral data covering the visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions for mapping reedbeds and to investigate the effects of incorporating image textural information and LiDAR-derived measures of canopy structure on the accuracy of reedbed delineation. Due to the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, three image compression algorithms were evaluated: principal component analysis (PCA), spectrally segmented PCA (SSPCA) and minimum noise fraction (MNF). The LiDAR-derived measures tested were the canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and the DSM-derived slope map. The SSPCA-compressed data produced the highest reedbed accuracy and processing efficiency. The optimal SSPCA dataset incorporated 12 PCs comprised of the first 3 PCs derived from each of the spectral segments: visible (392-700. nm), NIR (701-972. nm), SWIR-1 (973-1366. nm) and SWIR-2 (1530-2240. nm). Incorporating image textural measures produced a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when using MNF-compressed data, but had no impact when using the SSPCA-compressed imagery. A significant improvement (+. 11%) in the accuracy of reedbed delineation was achieved when a mask generated by applying a 3. m threshold to the LiDAR-derived CHM was used to filter the reedbed map derived from the optimal SSPCA dataset. This paper demonstrates the value in combining appropriately compressed hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data for the effective mapping of reedbed habitats. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - National Wetland Mapping Using Remote-Sensing-Derived Environmental Variables, Archive Field Data, And Artificial Intelligence
JO  - Heliyon
PY  - 2023
AB  - While wetland ecosystem services are widely recognized, the lack of fine-scale national inventories prevents successful implementation of conservation policies. Wetlands are difficult to map due to their complex fine-grained spatial pattern and fuzzy boundaries. However, the increasing amount of open high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and accurately georeferenced field data archives, as well as progress in artificial intelligence (AI), provide opportunities for fine-scale national wetland mapping. The objective of this study was to map wetlands over mainland France (ca. 550,000 km2) by applying AI to environmental variables derived from remote sensing and archive field data. A random forest model was calibrated using spatial cross-validation according to the precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC) index using ca. 135,000 soil or flora plots from archive databases, as well as 5 m topographical variables derived from an airborne DTM and a geological map. The model was validated using an experimentally designed sampling strategy with ca. 3000 plots collected during a ground survey in 2021 along non-wetland/wetland transects. Map accuracy was then compared to those of nine existing wetland maps with global, European, or national coverage. The model-derived suitability map (PR-AUC 0.76) highlights the gradual boundaries and fine-grained pattern of wetlands. The binary map is significantly more accurate (F1-score 0.75, overall accuracy 0.67) than existing wetland maps. The approach and end-results are of important value for spatial planning and environmental management since the high-resolution suitability and binary maps enable more targeted conservation measures to support biodiversity conservation, water resources maintenance, and carbon storage. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Assessing Multiple Years' Spatial Variability Of Crop Yields Using Satellite Vegetation Indices
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Assessing crop yield trends over years is a key step in site specific management, in view of improving the economic and environmental profile of agriculture. This study was conducted in a 11.07 ha area under Mediterranean climate in Northern Italy to evaluate the spatial variability and the relationships between six remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and grain yield (GY) in five consecutive years. A total of 25 satellite (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) images were downloaded during crop growth to obtain the following VIs: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Simple Ratio (SR). The surveyed crops were durum wheat in 2010, sunflower in 2011, bread wheat in 2012 and 2014, and coriander in 2013. Geo-referenced GY and VI data were used to generate spatial trend maps across the experimental field through geostatistical analysis. Crop stages featuring the best correlations between VIs and GY at the same spatial resolution (30 m) were acknowledged as the best periods for GY prediction. Based on this, 2-4 VIs were selected each year, totalling 15 VIs in the five years with r values with GY between 0.729{*}{*} and 0.935{*}{*}. SR and NDVI were most frequently chosen (six and four times, respectively) across stages from mid vegetative to mid reproductive growth. Conversely, SAVI never had correlations high enough to be selected. Correspondence analysis between remote VIs and GY based on quantile ranking in the 126 (30 m size) pixels exhibited a final agreement between 64\% and 86\%. Therefore, Landsat imagery with its spatial and temporal resolution proved a good potential for estimating final GY over different crops in a rotation, at a relatively small field scale.

TI  - Can Training Data Counteract Topographic Effects In Supervised Image Classification? A Sensitivity Analysis In The Cantabrian Mountains (Spain)
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Supervised classification converts digital data of satellite imagery into categorical land-cover classes suitable for end users. Far away from being an easy process, many factors such as landscape heterogeneity and topography cause radiometric exchange among classes that needs to be filtered out prior quantitative applications. To address this problem, specific processing methods of image correction allow normalizing surface reflectance of different land-cover types across topographic gradients. However, differences in spectral responses of sunny and shady slopes cannot be related solely to topography, since they could represent a mixture of plant species or functional types on the ground. In these cases, topographic correction may represent an unfounded aggressive modification of original reflectance values that contributes to the ongoing controversy about the adequacy of its application before image classification. An easy alternative to overcome this problem may consist in carrying out an extensive sampling of training data across topographic gradients. This will provide a full description of the spatial (and spectral) variability of the informational classes sought, which is a prior requirement of image classifiers. To evaluate whether a comprehensive sampling of training data can counteract topographic effects in the classification of medium resolution satellite imagery, we evaluated four methodological options: (1) the collection of reference points across all landscape heterogeneity, (2) different sampling schemes of training data, (3) the application, or not, of topographic correction, and (4) the use of different classification algorithms. Results demonstrated that normalizing spectral responses should be applied as a processing step for image classification in rugged terrains, mainly when reference data are not representative of all environmental variability and we do not explore different decision-making for selecting only optimal results. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Dynamic Ensemble Models To Predict Distributions And Anthropogenic Risk Exposure For Highly Mobile Species
JO  - Diversity and Distributions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Aim: Advances in ecological and environmental modelling offer new opportunities for estimating dynamic habitat suitability for highly mobile species and supporting management strategies at relevant spatiotemporal scales. We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict daily, year-round habitat suitability for a migratory species, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), and demonstrate an application for evaluating the spatiotemporal dynamics of their exposure to ship strike risk. Location: The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and the Southern California Bight (SCB), USA. Methods: We integrated a long-term (1994–2008) satellite tracking dataset on 104 blue whales with data-assimilative ocean model output to assess year-round habitat suitability. We evaluated the relative utility of ensembling multiple model types compared to using single models, and selected and validated candidate models using multiple cross-validation metrics and independent observer data. We quantified the spatial and temporal distribution of exposure to ship strike risk within shipping lanes in the SCB. Results: Multi-model ensembles outperformed single-model approaches. The final ensemble model had high predictive skill (AUC = 0.95), resulting in daily, year-round predictions of blue whale habitat suitability in the CCE that accurately captured migratory behaviour. Risk exposure in shipping lanes was highly variable within and among years as a function of environmental conditions (e.g., marine heatwave). Main conclusions: Daily information on three-dimensional oceanic habitats was used to model the daily distribution of a highly migratory species with high predictive power and indicated that management strategies could benefit by incorporating dynamic environmental information. This approach is readily transferable to other species. Dynamic, high-resolution species distribution models are valuable tools for assessing risk exposure and targeting management needs. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Site-Specific Scaling Of Remote Sensing-Based Estimates Of Woody Cover And Aboveground Biomass For Mapping Long-Term Tropical Dry Forest Degradation Status
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - Remote sensing-based approaches are important for evaluating ecosystem degradation and the efficient planning of ecosystem restoration efforts. However, the large majority of remote sensing-based degradation assessments are trend-based, implying that they can only detect degradation that occurred after medium or high-resolution satellite imagery became available. This makes them less suitable to map long-term degradation in ecosystems that have been under high human pressure since before. The main goal of this study was to develop a robust operational approach to map forest degradation status in heterogeneous landscapes with a long-standing degradation history to inform the planning of restoration interventions. We hereby use the tropical dry forests of Lambayeque, Peru, as a case study. Instead of using a trend-based assessment, we evaluated forest degradation status by comparing current woody cover (WC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates obtained from remote sensing imagery with benchmark values consisting of the 95th percentile WC and AGB values inside environmentally homogenous land capability classes. Using boosted regression tree models and a combination of optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data of different seasons, we mapped WC and AGB, using training data obtained through very high-resolution imagery and field measurements. Further, we aimed at assessing (i) whether the inclusion of Sentinel-1 data improves mapping accuracy in comparison to using only Sentinel-2 data, and (ii) whether the use of multi-seasonal data improves accuracy in comparison to single-season data. Models combining multi-seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data resulted in the most accurate WC predictions (mean absolute error (MAE): 16%; MAE normalized by dividing by the inter-quartile range of training data: 26%) and AGB predictions (MAE: 28.6 t/ha; normalized MAE: 65%), but differences in predictive accuracy with single season models or models using only Sentinel-2 data were small. The most accurate models estimated an average WC of 41% and an average AGB of 23.4 t/ha. Average WC and AGB reduction due to degradation was 35% and 36%, respectively, indicating that these forests are highly degraded. The site-specific scaling of WC and AGB allows to efficiently estimate forest degradation status irrespective of the time when this degradation occurred, and to express degradation status against site-specific benchmarks. On the condition that there are still some areas that are sufficiently undegraded to be used as a benchmark, the approach can be used to prioritize forest restoration actions and inform targets for restoration in heterogeneous landscapes suffering the impacts of undocumented long-term degradation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Using Multi-Remote Sensing Data To Assess Phragmites Invasion Of The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge
JO  - WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to develope an integrated image processing method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of Phragmites invasion in the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge on the basis of publically available sources. Design/methodology/approach - This new approach integrates the standard time-series analysis of Landsat images with USDA National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery and USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (DOQQ) datasets, which are either classified or manually interpreted with the aid of ground control points. Three different types of spatiotemporal dimensions are designed to test this integrated time-series image analysis method: the selected sites and selected time-points with high spatial resolution and sufficient validation data points, the intermediate time-series with continued yearly images and periodical validation data, and the long time-series with periodical images without enough validation data. The support vector machine (SVM) method was used to classify the Landast TM sequence images to detect the Phragmites invasion. Findings - The habitat map produced by NAIP images and field collection data shows that the total Phragmites area of DRIWR in 2010 is 4221.87 acres without treatment areas and similar with the removed non-vegetation method. It is confirmed that the pre-classification method can obtain more accurate results. Originality value - The test results show that the Landsat-5 data can be used for long-term environmental management and monitoring of Phragmites invasion and can achieve rehabilitation of invasion areas.

TI  - A Macrophysiology Approach To Watershed Science And Management
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Freshwaters are among the most imperiled ecosystems on the planet such that much effort is expended on environmental monitoring to support the management of these systems. Many traditional monitoring efforts focus on abiotic characterization of water quantity or quality and/or indices of biotic integrity that focus on higher scale population or community level metrics such as abundance or diversity. However, these indicators may take time to manifest in degraded systems and delay the identification and restoration of these systems. Physiological indicators manifest rapidly and portend oncoming changes in populations that can hasten restoration and facilitate preventative medicine for degraded habitats. Therefore, assessing freshwater ecosystem integrity using physiological indicators of health is a promising tool to improve freshwater monitoring and restoration. Here, we discuss the value of using comparative, longitudinal physiological data collected at a broad spatial (i.e. watershed) scale (i.e. macrophysiology) as a tool for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health within and among local watersheds to develop timely and effective management plans. There are emerging tools and techniques available for rapid, cost-effective, and non-lethal physiological sampling and we discuss how these can be integrated into management using fish as sentinel indicators in freshwater. Although many examples of this approach are relatively recent, we foresee increasing use of macrophysiology in monitoring, and advocate for the development of more standard tools for consistent and reliable assessment.

TI  - Ammonia Measurements From Space With The Cross-Track Infrared Sounder: Characteristics And Applications
JO  - Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Despite its clear importance, the monitoring of atmospheric ammonia, including its sources, sinks, and links to the greater nitrogen cycle, remains limited. Satellite data are helping to fill the gap in monitoring from sporadic conventional ground- and aircraft-based observations to better inform policymakers and assess the impact of any ammonia-related policies. Presented is a description and survey that demonstrate the capabilities of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) ammonia product for monitoring, air quality forecast model evaluation, dry deposition estimates, and emission estimates from an agricultural hotspot. For model evaluation, while there is a general agreement in the spatial allocation of known major agricultural ammonia hotspots across North America, the satellite observations show some high-latitude regions during peak forest fire activity often have ammonia concentrations approaching those in agricultural hotspots. The CrIS annual ammonia dry depositions in Canada (excluding the territories) and the US have average and annual variability values of <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><math xmlnsCombining double low line"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" idCombining double low line"M1" displayCombining double low line"inline" overflowCombining double low line"scroll" dspmathCombining double low line"mathml"><mrow><mo>ĝ1/4</mo><mn mathvariantCombining double low line"normal">0.8</mn><mo>±</mo><mn mathvariantCombining double low line"normal">0.08</mn></mrow></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svgCombining double low line"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" widthCombining double low line"60pt" heightCombining double low line"10pt" classCombining double low line"svg-formula" dspmathCombining double low line"mathimg" md5hashCombining double low line"b41f2b9e60728f0efe500de0e698b809"><svg:image xmlns:xlinkCombining double low line"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:hrefCombining double low line"acp-20-2277-2020-ie00001.svg" widthCombining double low line"60pt" heightCombining double low line"10pt" srcCombining double low line"acp-20-2277-2020-ie00001.png"/></svg:svg></span></span> and <span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"><math xmlnsCombining double low line"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" idCombining double low line"M2" displayCombining double low line"inline" overflowCombining double low line"scroll" dspmathCombining double low line"mathml"><mrow><mo>ĝ1/4</mo><mn mathvariantCombining double low line"normal">1.23</mn><mo>±</mo><mn mathvariantCombining double low line"normal">0.09</mn></mrow></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svgCombining double low line"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" widthCombining double low line"66pt" heightCombining double low line"10pt" classCombining double low line"svg-formula" dspmathCombining double low line"mathimg" md5hashCombining double low line"80356d531d0fac02abc0cad0b9339e0e"><svg:image xmlns:xlinkCombining double low line"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:hrefCombining double low line"acp-20-2277-2020-ie00002.svg" widthCombining double low line"66pt" heightCombining double low line"10pt" srcCombining double low line"acp-20-2277-2020-ie00002.png"/></svg:svg></span></span>&thinsp;Tg&thinsp;N&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-1</span>, respectively.

TI  - Implementing Isotopic And Remote Sensing Techniques To Identify Inter-Catchment Groundwater Exchanges, In A Geologically Complex Lake Catchment
PY  - 2005
AB  - Identifying groundwater preferential flows, submerged spring discharges and intercatchment groundwater exchanges is important for estimating water budget components and designing integrated water resources management plans in various scales. The study area is Trichonis lake catchment which is located in W. Greece and incorporates a deep and large water body, Trichonis lake that has a tectonic origination and a surface area of 97 Km(2). The hydrogeologic conditions in this particular catchment are complex since highly tectonized limestone formations dominate and present well developed folds, faults and karst phenomena. The broader area of the lake belongs to NATURA 2000 protection Network mainly because of the significant wetlands located around the lake and therefore a thorough hydrologic analysis of the area as well as designing a sustainable water management scheme are essential. Under this framework, satellite images have been utilized to illustrate potential groundwater flows and detailed tectonic surfaces that can be related to groundwater paths. GIS programs have been used to elaborate the satellite data and provide springs location and high soil moisture zones through thermal mapping. Isotopic study of the broader area has been conducted by collecting water samples from specific points of interest, including springs, streams and the lake, on a wide spatial and temporal distribution. The delta O-18 values have been recorded in the water samples and a statistical analysis provided the potential recharge areas' altitudes for each sampling location. The isotopic values have been projected on the geotectonic map of the area and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis occurred in order to develop clusters of the sampling locations that have common recharge areas. This process provided preferential groundwater flow directions which clearly illustrated out-of-the-catchment contribution and this was in agreement with bibliographic references and water balance estimations. The results from this study have been taken into consideration by the local water management authorities and have been used for the designing of the lake's integrated water resources management plan.

TI  - Integrated Remote Sensing For Urban Forest Changes Monitoring
PY  - 2018
AB  - Drivers of global climate change and the increased frequency of extreme climate events may affect urban and periurban forest ecosystems more rapidly than natural forest ecosystems. Multi stressors of urban forest ecosystems include alterations in forest soils and to the diversity and composition of forest ecosystem, as well as higher temperatures during heat waves periods and increasing carbon dioxide content due to high traffic issue. Global conservation targets and management practices of urban forest ecosystems in Romania requires adequate novel monitoring methodology for monitoring the dynamics changing status. Ground-based measurements are valuable tools with limited spatial footprints. Multispectral and multitemporal satellite remote sensing data allow detailed information on forest structure and can deliver ecologically relevant, long-term datasets suitable of vegetation phenology for analyzing changes in periurban and urban forest ecosystem areas, structure and function at temporal and spatial scales relevant to forest dynamics monitoring. The aim of this paper was to evaluate and characterize forest changes for selected test area Cernica -Branesti in Ilfov county located in the Eastern part of Bucharest metropolitan region, Romania, where the climate and anthropogenic stressors endanger natural and economical values of forest environment. Based on time-series Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI/TIRS, MODIS Terra/Aqua and Sentinel 2A satellite data have been investigated urban forest land cover and forest biophysical parameters (LST, NDVI/EVI and LAI) changes over 2000-2016 period of time. Accuracy of image processing results (spectral classification) was confirmed through in-situ spectroradiometrical analysis of reflectance spectra with portable GER 2600 spectroradiometer.

TI  - Canada's Foreign Investment Review Agency And The Direct Investment Process In Canada
JO  - Canadian Public Administration
PY  - 1984
AB  - Abstract: Canada's Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA) has been the focus of continued public policy debate over the years. Supporters have argued that FIRA enhances the economic benefits of inward direct investment, while detractors complain that the agency discourages such investment. The thesis of this paper is that, notwithstanding the heat generated by the debate, relatively little light has been shed on the economic effects of FIRA. This is primarily because participants in the debate have failed to recognize that FIRA'S economic impacts should be examined within a general equilibrium framework. Furthermore, many of the indirect effects of FIRA'S review process are not observable in the simple statistics on acceptance or rejection rates. The purpose of this paper is to identify the important potential direct and indirect effects of FIRA on the Canadian economy, and (through the evaluation of relevant statistical data) to speculate about the relative importance of these effects. Our conclusion is that FIRA has probably imposed net costs on the Canadian economy, although the sources of these costs are subtle and the magnitudes difficult to document. Sommaire: L'Agence d'examen de l'investissement étranger du Canada (AEIE) se trouve au centre d'un débat de politique publique qui se poursuit depuis des années. Ses partisans prétendent que l'AEIE rehausse les avantages économiques de l'investissement direct intésieur, tandis que ses détracteurs accusent l'Agence de décourager un tel investissement. Le prérsent article démontre qu'en dépit de la passion que suscite le débat, le public est assez mal informé sur les effets économiques de l'AEIE. Et ceci provient essentiellement du fait que les participants au débat ne reconnaissent pas que l'impact économique de l'AEIE devrait être examiné dans un cadre dyéquilibre général. De plus, nombreux sont les effets indirects du processus d'examen de l'AEIE que l'on ne peut déceler en analysant de simples statistiques sur les pourcentages d'approbation ou de désapprobation. Cet article a pour but de déterminer les importants effets potentiels, directs et indirects, de l'AEIE sur l'économie canadienne et, grâce à l'évaluation de données statistiques pertinentes, de spéculer sur l'importance relative de ces effets. En conclusion, l'auteur déduit que l'AEIE a sans doute imposéà l'économie canadienne une contrainte qui se chiffre par des coûts nets, bien qu'il soit assez difficile de documenter l'origine et l'ampleur de ces coûts.

TI  - Simplified Approach To Operational Insar Monitoring Of Volcano Deformation In Low- And Middle-Income Countries: Case Study Of Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea
JO  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
PY  - 2019
AB  - The primary goal of operational volcano monitoring is the timely identification of volcanic unrest. This provides critical information to decision makers tasked with mitigating the societal impacts of volcanic eruptions. Volcano deformation is recognized as a key indicator of unrest at many active volcanoes and can be used to provide insight into the depth and geometry of the magma source. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique that has detected deformation at many volcanoes globally, but most often with hindsight. To date, the use of InSAR for operational volcano monitoring has been limited to a few cases and only in high income countries. Yet a vast number of active volcanoes are located in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources for operational monitoring are constrained. In these countries, InSAR could provide deformation monitoring at many active volcanoes, including those that have no existing ground monitoring infrastructure. Several barriers combine to make uptake of InSAR into operational volcano monitoring difficult in most countries, but particularly in resource-constrained environments. To overcome some of these limiting factors, we propose a simplified processing chain to better incorporate InSAR and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data into the decision-making process at volcano observatories. To combine the InSAR and GNSS data we use a joint modelling procedure that infers volume changes of a spherical source beneath the volcano. The benefits of our approach for operational use include that the algorithm is computationally lightweight and can be run quickly on a standard desktop or laptop PC. This enables a volcano observatory to interpret geodetic data in a timely fashion, and use the information as part of frequent reporting procedures. To demonstrate our approach we combine ALOS-PALSAR InSAR data and continuous GNSS data from the Rabaul Caldera, Papua New Guinea between 2007 and 2011. Joint inversion of the two datasets indicates volume loss of similar to 1 x 107 m(3) (deflation) occurring between February 2008 and November 2009, followed by volume gain of similar to 2.5 x 106 m(3) (inflation) until February 2011 in a magma body situated similar to 1.5 km beneath the caldera.

TI  - Applications Of Remote Sensing Retrieval Of Evapotranspiration In Irrigation Water Management: A Review
JO  - Shuili Xuebao/Journal of Hydraulic Engineering
PY  - 2023
AB  - High-efficient usage of irrigation water resources is essential to ensure agricultural production and sustainable utilization of water resources. Climate warming and rapid socio-economic development pose great challenges to the sustainable use of irrigation water resources. Current agricultural production tends to be more intensive, standardized and informationized, resulting in higher requirements for the development of efficient water-saving irrigation and the realization of precision management of irrigation water use. Evapotranspiration can reflect the exchanges of water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere and water consumption by crops, thus playing a key role in irrigation water management. Over the past two decades, with the development of Earth observation technologies, theories and methods of remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration and data fusion are becoming mature, resulting in continuously improving spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy of evapotranspiration estimates. This trend has greatly maximized the application potential of remotely based evapotranspiration in the field of irrigation water resources. First, this review summarizes the advances of remote sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration and data fusion and related widely used datasets. Applications of evapotranspiration in irrigation water use monitoring, irrigation schedule optimization, and evaluation of irrigation benefits are systematically summarized. This review could provide reference for efficient utilization and precise management of agricultural water resources. © 2023 China Water Power Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping Regional Livelihood Benefits From Local Ecosystem Services Assessments In Rural Sahel
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Most current approaches to landscape scale ecosystem service assessments rely on detailed secondary data. This type of data is seldom available in regions with high levels of poverty and strong local dependence on provisioning ecosystem services for livelihoods. We develop a method to extrapolate results from a previously published village scale ecosystem services assessment to a higher administrative level, relevant for land use decision making. The method combines remote sensing (using a hybrid classification method) and interviews with community members. The resulting landscape scale maps show the spatial distribution of five different livelihood benefits (nutritional diversity, income, insurance/saving, material assets and energy, and crops for consumption) that illustrate the strong multi-functionality of the Sahelian landscapes. The maps highlight the importance of a diverse set of sub-units of the landscape in supporting Sahelian livelihoods. We see a large potential in using the resulting type of livelihood benefit maps for guiding future land use decisions in the Sahel.

TI  - Landsat 8 Data To An Invention A Permanent Seasonal Model Of Water Quality Parameters In Tigris River-Iraq
JO  - AIP Conference Proceedings
PY  - 2022
AB  - Empirical models have been developed in this study to predict water quality parameters, with the intention of demonstrating both benefits and the viability of using Landsat 8 spectral images to estimate water quality parameters in one main of the Iraqi Rivers, it is the Tigris River. The study area was along the part of the Tigris River which is located in Baghdad (capital) and Babylon governorate, in the middle part of Iraq. Water quality data archive for the of total dissolved solids (TDS), phosphates (PO4), Sulfate (SO4), and total hardness (TH) of the water Tigris river during four seasons (winter, spring, summer, and autumn) distributed along four years (2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017), was collected from sixteen ground stations along the part of Tigris river. The objective of this study to establish seasonal empirical mathematical models can use them every year during the season time without the need for calibration every time. For this purpose, has been following the different approach when compared with all of the studies which are carried before by collecting data for the same season and for different years. Prior to the establishment of the models, both preprocessing of data as radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to the optical data. Through multiple regression analysis between measured water quality parameters of the ground stations and the reflectance of the pixels corresponding to the sampling stations. Statistical models with determination coefficients between 0.89-0.95 were generated. Results indicate this novelty approach has generated mathematical models for the open time for any year but in the special season. Another indicator that from a small number of measured parameters can generate reliable models to estimate the concentration of TDS, PO4, SO4, and TH. So models generated from Landsat 8 can be used as a tool to facilitate the environmental, economic, and social management of the surface waters bodies like a Tigris river. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

TI  - Satellite And Hybrid Systems For Monitoring, Risk Minimization And Prevention
JO  - 16th International Conference Monitoring of Geological Processes and Ecological Condition of the Environment, Monitoring 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - This paper discusses a concept of a sophisticated hybrid monitoring system, its core application and technological solutions. The operating model of the proposed system comprises such processes as collecting, transmitting, combining and processing data; transferring the aggregated data to consumers for further use. A modular design principle enables optimization of production and operating costs of a data collection system; involvement of multiple channels of information transmission depending on the purposes and nature of the task to be performed. Modern drones and robots with a range of advanced characteristics (e.g., special optics, night vision systems, different sensors, etc.) installed for customized purposes, as well as orbital constellations of nanosatellites, can contribute to the improvement of operations, the quality and accuracy of data and the productivity of the entire hybrid system. In the context of data transmission capabilities via a satellite channel, the Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is discussed. The principle of decentralization implies the establishment of a network of stations and drones interacting with each other without connecting to WiFi or a cellular network. A collaborative calculation feature of the proposed hybrid system enables the detection of dangerous phenomena and improvement of forecast accuracy, which is crucial for preventive measures and disaster management. Based on a cost-benefit analysis and economic, social and environmental implications, the authors consider a public-private partnership within the development of the proposed hybrid system an economically feasible solution. © 2022 EAGE.

TI  - A System-Level Engineering Approach To Define The Social Value Rating Of Earth Remote Sensing Missions Through Sustainable Development Goals
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2020
AB  - In 2015, the UN state members agreed on the “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” document to drive the evolution of humanity in the close future. A great effort has been placed to understand how space missions and their data can support the goals fulfilment, both by private entities and public organisations like the European Space Agency (ESA) or United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). This paper proposes a method to evaluate the level of support that a space missions used for Earth observation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) can provide to each goal, using a set of indices based on missions' and payloads' performance related to Earth Observation (EO) services. Eight Earth observation services have been selected for this study: mapping, disaster monitoring, forestry, agriculture, geology, oceanography, hydrology, meteorology. Each of these services has its own performance requirements and can support many different goals. Using the relationship between mission performance and services together with the original correlation between the services and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDG2030), the final assessment of an Earth Observation mission towards each goal is achieved.

TI  - Modelling Soil Erosion In The Densu River Basin Using Rusle And Gis Tools
JO  - Journal of Environmental Science and Engineering
PY  - 2014
AB  - Soil erosion involves detachment and transport of soil particles from top soil layers, degrading soil quality and reducing the productivity of affected lands. Soil eroded from the upland catchment causes depletion of fertile agricultural land and the resulting sediment deposited at the river networks creates river morphological change and reservoir sedimentation problems. However, land managers and policy makers are more interested in the spatial distribution of soil erosion risk than in absolute values of soil erosion loss. The aim of this paper is to model the spatial distribution of soil erosion in Densu River Basin of Ghana using RUSLE and GIS tools and to use the model to explore the relationship between erosion susceptibility, slope and land use/land cover (LULC) in the Basin. The rainfall map, digital elevation model, soil type map, and land cover map, were input data in the soil erosion model developed. This model was then categorized into four different erosion risk classes. The developed soil erosion map was then overlaid with the slope and LULC maps of the study area to explore their effects on erosion susceptibility of the soil in the Densu River Basin, The Model, predicted 88% of the basin as low erosion risk and 6% as moderate erosion risk, 3% as high erosion risk and 3% as severe risk. The high and severe erosion areas were distributed mainly within the areas of high slope gradient and also sections of the moderate forest LULC class. Also,' the areas within the moderate forest LULC class found to have high erosion risk, had an intersecting high erodibility soil group.

TI  - Gis-Technologies Application For Calculation Of Potential Soil Loss Of Marha River Basin (Republic Of Saha)
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the article the presentation of estimation methods of potential soil loss in the conditions of Siberia with application of geographical information systems is resulted. For the reference area of the Marha river basin, which is a part of the Lena river catchment, there was created a specialized geographic information database of potential soil erosion, with scale of 1: 1,000,000. Digital elevation model "GMTED2010" and the hydroset layer corresponding to the scale of 1: 1,000,000 are taken to calculate the soil loss values. The formation of the geobase data is considered in detail being constructed on the basis of the multiplicative structure which reflects the main parameters of the relief (slope steepness, exposition, slope length, erosion potential of the relief), soil, climatic characteristics and modern types of land cover. At the quantitative level with sufficiently high degree of spatial detail results were obtained for calculating the potential erosion of soils. The average value of potential soil loss in the basin without taking into account the factor of land cover types, was 12.6 t/ha/yr. The calculations carried out, taking into account the types of land cover obtained from remote sensing data from outer space resulted in an appreciable reduction of the soil loss values (0.04 t/ha/yr.). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Disaster Risk Mapping From Aerial Imagery Using Deep Learning Techniques
PY  - 2023
AB  - In regions prone to natural disasters, the buildings must follow specific construction standards to avoid demolition. One of the factors that predict the risk of damage is the roof material. This paper investigates the performance of various deep convolutional neural network architectures to classify buildings based on roof material from aerial drone imagery. We also propose a method that is an ensemble of ResNet, ResNeXt, and EfficientNet variants of convolutional neural networks, which performed the best in our experiments. We obtained a log loss value as low as 0.4373 using the proposed method. Therefore, the proposed method can be used to perform an accurate classification of roof material using aerial drone imagery.

TI  - Anthropogenic Risk Assessment Of Riverine Habitat Using Geospatial Modelling Tools For Conservation And Restoration Planning: A Case Study From A Tropical River Pranhita, India
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2023
AB  - The riverine ecosystem provides multiple benefits to human community and contributes to the sustainable development of the ecoregion. The growing dependency on these ecosystems has largely contributed to aggravating the ecological risks, habitat degradation, and loss of ecosystem services. The present study evaluates the ecological risk emanating from nine anthropogenic stressors including river use, hydro-morphology, catchment pollution, and biological stressor on river Pranhita in Godavari Basin of Peninsular India using InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) Habitat Risk Assessment model. The primary field survey, remote sensing, and secondary data-assisted spatial modelling results revealed low ecological risk (R = 0.65 of 3) in river Pranhita due to anthropogenic activities. Sediment loading, the inflow of nitrogen, and habitat fragmentation were the major stressors with relatively higher risk score (> 1); influence on a sizeable portion of riverine habitat (29-75\% of the total area under high-risk zone) indicates the mounting threat from catchment activities. The low-risk value observed in protected river reaches as compared to unprotected areas is likely to be influenced by the abundant presence of intact riparian vegetation which mitigate the catchment stressors and minimal anthropogenic activity within protected areas. This study demonstrates the application of InVEST HRA model for ecological risk assessment of riverine ecosystems and fish assemblages along with their input data generation framework. This has the potential for prioritization of sensitive habitats based on computed ecological risk and stressor identification based on their exposure and consequences for developing appropriate mitigation measures. This model is spatially explicit and accommodates user-defined criteria for ecosystem-level assessment at a regional and national scale to facilitate the resource managers and policymakers for conservation and restoration planning and implementation of targeted management measures for sustainable development.

TI  - Determining The Optimal Phenological Stage For Predicting Common Dry Bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris) Yield Using Field Spectroscopy
JO  - South African Journal of Plant and Soil
PY  - 2017
AB  - On-farm crop productivity and yield prediction are valuable for, among others, designing food policies, on-farm and after-farm planning and pricing, and marketing. Whereas existing prediction approaches are generally reliable, these require extensive and tedious field surveys and adequate ancillary agrometeorological data. Remote sensing offers great potential for quick and reliable means of predicting crop yield, but it necessitates establishment of optimal phenological and spectral bands. Given the socio-economic value of common dry bean, we sought to determine the potential of multi-temporal ground-based hyperspectral data to predict yield of three cultivars grown under irrigated and rain-fed regimes. Canopy-level hyperspectral data were collected from the Gadra, Ukulinga and Caledon cultivars at distinct phenological stages and sparse partial least squares regression was used for spectral analysis. Results indicated that variation in yield could be explained at specific growth stages under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. With the exception of the Gadra cultivar under irrigation, models developed with data at the flowering and pod development stage were more accurate. These findings highlight the potential of temporal phenological ground-based hyperspectral data in predicting common dry bean yield under different watering regimes. The findings provide an opportunity for large-scale yield prediction using airborne or space-borne hyperspectral sensors. © 2017 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.

TI  - Identifying Suitable Sites Of Shrimp Culture In Southwest Bangladesh Using Gis And Remote Sensing Data
JO  - Coastal Research Library
PY  - 2014
AB  - Over the last decade, southwest coastal region of Bangladesh has gone through a rapid expansion in shrimp farming. Congenial conditions such as availability of coastal land and water, quality soil and water, successful transfer of hatchery technology and increased export demand led to this rapid growth in shrimp culture sector. Non scientific and unplanned development of shrimp culture has been accompanied by many controversies in the society and in other sectors of agriculture, and the sector has itself been affected adversely by environmental problems. Scientific and sustainable development of shrimp culture essentially needs better site selection. This study identified suitable sites of shrimp culture using GIS and remote sensing technology. Satellite imagery and GIS data- water and soil quality, shrimp culture area, method and production, source and seasonal availability of water, drainage system, water logging, disease outbreak, sanitation facility, road communication, electricity supply, land use pattern, land elevation, hazard frequency, fisheries statistics and population census data etc. were collected in site suitability study. Data were collected through in-situ measurement, laboratory analysis, questionnaire survey and secondary information. Satellite data were used in preparing base map of the study area and visual interpretation of the images was performed using the most important diagnostic characteristics. Decision rules for most important criteria of shrimp culture were followed during site suitability analyses. Study finds most suitable sites of shrimp aquaculture covering 9,309.40 ha area in Shyamnagar upazilla, Satkhira district where moderately and less suitable locations were identified as 19,256.92 and 9,103.90 ha respectively. Paikgacha, one of the shrimp culture dominated upazillas of Khulna got an estimated 9,954.20 ha land as most suitable with 8,919.40 and 6,775.80 ha as moderately and less suitable zone respectively. Study results indicate the existence of 6,403.20, 8,616.70 and 8,867.20 ha area as most suitable, moderately suitable and less suitable for shrimp culture industry in another coastal area-Rampal under Bagerhat district. The study will have utility in formulating shrimp culture policy for sustainable development of this promising sector in the country. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Soil Resource Inventory And Land Use Planning For Mandhala Watershed In Shiwalik Hills Of North-West Himalayas Using Remote Sensing And Gis
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Soil Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land resource mapping of Mandhala watershed representing Shiwalik hills of North-West Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh was done using multi-temporal and multi-spectral high resolution Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellite imagery and Survey of India (SOI) toposheets in conjunction with ground checks/field surveys to generate database layers including watershed boundary, drainage network, slope, landforms, land use/land cover, soils, land capability, suitability for major crops, suggested land use, etc. at 1:12,500 scale. About 55% of the watershed is under forests. Agriculture occupies about 12% area while rest is mainly under scrub and grasslands. These soils, still in initial stage of their pedogenic development, possess low productivity owing to inherent limitations related to topography, soil characteristics, erosion and erratic rainfall apart from excessive human interference. A need based resource conservation and land use plan consistent with the problems and potentialities identified in the area, was suggested by integrating different database layers in geographical information system (GIS) environment. The study also demonstrated utility of remote sensing (RS) and GIS techniques in sustainable natural resource development planning. © 2021, Indian journals. All rights reserved.

TI  - Counselling The Prostate Cancer Patient
JO  - European Urology, Supplements
PY  - 2008
AB  - Context: Patient involvement in the medical decision-making process has gained a good deal of importance during the last decades. It has become widely accepted that patient values and preferences should also be considered during treatment selection when reasonable alternatives are available. Objective: This paper discusses the process of shared medical decision making and the importance of informing the patient and improving patient-physician communication concerning prostate cancer (PCa). Evidence acquisition: During a satellite symposium at the European Association of Urology (EAU) 2008 annual meeting, the issue of shared medical decision making in PCa was presented. This paper discusses the most important messages of this presentation, supported by recent findings in the literature. Evidence synthesis: In clinical situations where data do not clearly differentiate the treatment alternatives, patient involvement in the medical decision-making process becomes critical. Therefore, patient-physician communication should be emphasised, and physicians should take the time necessary to inform the patient about potential treatment options and their expected consequences. Increasing a patient's ability to engage physicians in a dialogue and providing patients with balanced information will contribute to a well-considered decision, which in turn can minimise future regret. Misleading information on the Internet and poor literacy skills can hamper the decision-making process. Patients are often dissatisfied with inadequate time spent during physician visits and the not-uncommon perception that treatment choices the physician presents are more restricted than optimal. Conclusions: In current clinical practice, the patient-physician dialogue should be enhanced, and patients' preferences should be taken into consideration in the decision-making process. This will contribute to well-considered treatment decisions and improve patient satisfaction. © 2008 European Association of Urology.

TI  - Sustainable Management And Conservation Of Heritage Assets: A Case Study Of The Lake Eyasi Basin, Northern Tanzania
JO  - AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL REVIEW
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Lake Eyasi Basin in northern Tanzania is among the few key regions in Africa that offer important information about human origins and peopling of the world. Material culture from this region provides significant insight into the origin and development of modern human behavior. It contains dense, stratified, and continuous archaeological records from the Middle Pleistocene to historical periods. The archaeological records of this region offer an opportunity to investigate trends in technological change, past diets, symbolic aspects, and other traits of cognitive thoughts. For a long time, these cultural materials and environmental trajectories were managed through traditionally based non-legislative systems ordered through traditional norms and values. However, such arrangements were interrupted during the colonial and post-colonial periods with emphasis on legislative heritage management systems stressing law enforcement and economic outputs. Strict obedience to heritage law enforcement gradually excluded local communities from mainstream social, economic, and cultural aspects of the archaeological sites in their regions. This paper discusses sustainable solutions and guidelines for managing cultural assets and the surrounding environment through co-management systems. The intention is to develop a highly focused mission for sustainable management and use of cultural assets, reduce vulnerability to climate change, enhance sustainable rural development, and contribute to poverty eradication through tourism. Resume Le Bassin du lac Eyasi au nord de la Tanzanie constitue une des regions africaines notables qui reservent des informations importantes sur les origines des humaines ainsi que le peuplement du monde. La culture materielle exceptionnelle de cette region preserve de maniere significative l'origine et le developpement de comportement humain moderne. Cette culture porte des vestiges archeologiques denses, diversifiees et interrompues, datant depuis le Pleistocene moyen de nos jours. A cet effet, les reserves archeologiques presentes dans cette region creent une occasion inedite pour l'investissement visant la protection contre le changement climatique, la cuisine ancienne, le patrimoine symbolique ainsi que contre les traits relatifs au developpement de la reflexion cognitive. Pendant longtemps, ces materiaux culturels et ces projets environnementaux ont ete proteges grace aux systemes non legislatifs des gestions basees sur les normes et valeurs traditionnelles. Et pourtant, tels plans ont ete interrompus par le droit moderne institue au cours de l'ere coloniale et repris au post colonial qui privilegie le gain economique. Ceux-ci mettent l'accent sur le respect strict des lois. En consequence, ces reglements restreignent la population locale de profiter aux atouts sociaux, economiques et culturelles disponibles dans ces sites archeologiques. Dans le cet article l'auteur presente des solutions durables et propose des lignes directrices pour une gestion des biens culturels et une protection de l'environnement autour a travers la gestion de ces biens de maniere cooperative.

In the low mass limit, valid for super-Earth-class planets with masses of order mp ∼ 10 M, previous work showed that energy optimization leads to nearly equal mass planets, with circular orbits confined to a plane. The present treatment generalizes previous results by including the self-gravity of the planetary bodies. For systems with a sufficiently large total mass mT in planets, the optimized energy state switches over from the case of nearly equal mass planets to a configuration where one planet contains most of the material. This transition occurs for a critical mass threshold of approximately mT mC ∼ 40 M (where the value depends on the semimajor axes of the planetary orbits, the stellar mass, and other system properties). These considerations of energy optimization apply over a wide range of mass scales, from binary stars to planetary systems to the collection of moons orbiting the giant planets in our Solar system. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.

TI  - The Emerging Role Of Satellite Rainfall Data In Improving The Hydro-Political Situation Of Flood Monitoring In The Under-Developed Regions Of The World
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2007
AB  - The systematic decline of in situ networks for hydrologic measurements has been recognized as a crucial limitation to advancing hydrologic monitoring in medium to large basins, especially those that are already sparsely instrumented. As a collective response, sections of the hydrologic community have recently forged partnerships for the development of space-borne missions for cost-effective, yet global, hydrologic measurements by building upon the technological advancements since the last two decades. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art on flood monitoring in medium and large ungauged basins where satellite remote sensing can facilitate development of a cost-effective mechanism. We present our review in the context of the current hydro-political situation of flood monitoring in flood-prone developing nations situated in international river basins (IRBs). Given the large number of such basins and the difficulty in acquisition of multi-faceted geophysical data, we argue that the conventional data-intensive implementation of physically based hydrologic models that are complex and distributed is time-consuming for global assessment of the utility of proposed global satellite hydrologic missions. A more parsimonious approach is justified at the tolerable expense of accuracy before such missions begin operation. Such a parsimonious approach can subsequently motivate the identified international basins to invest greater effort in conventional and detailed hydrologic studies to design a prototype flood forecasting system in an effort to overcome the hydro-political hurdles to flood monitoring. Through a modeling exercise involving an open-book watershed concept, we demonstrate the value of a parsimonious approach in understanding the utility of NASA-derived satellite rainfall products. It is critical now that real-world operational flood forecasting agencies in the under-developed world come forward to collaborate with the research community in order to leverage satellite rainfall data for greater societal benefit for inhabitants in IRBs.

TI  - Does Investing In Renewable Energy Sources Contribute To Growth? A Preliminary Study On Greece's National Energy And Climate Plan
JO  - ENERGIES
PY  - 2021
AB  - As more economies are transitioning away from fossil fuels for their electricity production and towards greener alternatives, many socioeconomic implications of this shift remain actively debated. The present paper attempts to assess the economic impact of investments in renewable energy sources (RESs) for Greece and whether the broader effects of this transition can offset the negative impact that will occur due to the targeted phase-out of lignite plants by 2028, which constitute the predominant power source for Greece. Our methodological approach builds on input-output analysis and the creation of composite RES industries for the estimation of the net effects of a series of monetary shocks that correspond to Greece's phase-out investment plan, utilizing the most recent national input-output tables and satellite structural business statistics. We focus on the structural effects of these shocks on a series of socioeconomic indicators, including GDP, employment, wages, government income (through taxes), and capital formation. The results indicate that even though lignite power production still provides a significant contribution to the Greek economy, investing in renewables presents a significant opportunity for value added and job creation.

TI  - Public Administration And Landowners Facing Real Estate Cadastre Modernization: A Win-Lose Or Win-Win Situation?
JO  - RESOURCES-BASEL
PY  - 2023
AB  - Keeping the real estate cadastre's database up to date is a very important process. The scope of the modernization works includes, among other things, fieldwork and office (chamber) work carried out by surveyors to update information about land and buildings. Therefore, modernization may result in changes to plot areas; changes to the marking of plots and land use (and, consequently, a change in the property tax); and the disclosure or deletion of buildings and premises, as well as changes to their technical data. The research, based on a case study (rural municipality Serniki, Poland), and supported by a literature review, remote sensing, and digital photogrammetry, clearly showed the importance of initiating the cadastre modernization procedure and obtaining funds for this purpose, which will be beneficial for both parties. Landowners will gain by bringing the current image of their real estate closer to the actual state (e.g., by paying taxes for the real utility of the land), while administrative units will become the beneficiaries of higher tax revenues (up to over 500\%). Thus, the analysis carried out on the case study shows positive effects for both parties, and justifies the financial outlay incurred by the administrative units for this process. Moreover, the analysis revealed that, due to the possibility of obtaining funding from other sources, the cost to the public administration may be marginal. Thus, the cadastre modernization procedure should be integrated into regional and national policies.

TI  - Predicting Black Spruce Fuel Characteristics With Airborne Laser Scanning (Als)
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Wildfire decision support systems combine fuel maps with other fire environment variables to predict fire behaviour and guide management actions. Until recently, financial and technological constraints have limited provincial fuel maps to relatively coarse spatial resolutions. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), a remote sensing technology that uses LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), is becoming an increasingly affordable and pragmatic tool for mapping fuels across localised and broad areas. Few studies have used ALS in boreal forest regions to describe structural attributes such as fuel load at a fine resolution (i.e. <100 m(2) cell resolution). We used ALS to predict five forest attributes relevant to fire behaviour in black spruce (Picea mariana) stands in Alberta, Canada: canopy bulk density, canopy fuel load, stem density, canopy height and canopy base height. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression models indicated statistically significant relationships between ALS data and the forest metrics of interest (R-2 >= 0.81 for all metrics except canopy base height which had a R-2 value of 0.63). Performance of the regression models was acceptable and consistent with prior studies when applied to test datasets; however, regression models presented in this study mapped stand attributes at a much finer resolution (40 m(2)).

AB  - The availability of environmental and Earth resources data acquired by satellites can assist all countries to gain a better understanding of how to safeguard their environment as well as ensure a more efficient management and productive harnessing of their natural resources. However, in order for the developing countries to share in the benefits inherent in remote sensing technology and in programmes related to environmental information systems, particularly through their participation in international, regional and national programmes and projects, there must be an adequate and long-term commitment to and an investment in the development of skills and knowledge in the discipline at the local level. This article focuses on the United Nations initiative to establish regional Centres for Space Science and Technology Education which should provide a unique opportunity for the development of such an indigenous capability. These Centres have the potential to contribute significantly to the implementation of the recommendations of the Rio Conference, otherwise known as Agenda 21, and to the successful execution of the programme of activities of the user communities in the developing countries.

TI  - Understanding The Spatiotemporal Development Of Human Settlement In Hurricane-Prone Areas On The Us Atlantic And Gulf Coasts Using Nighttime Remote Sensing
JO  - Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences
PY  - 2019
AB  - Hurricanes, as one of the most devastating natural hazards, have posed a great threat to people in coastal areas. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of human settlement in hurricane-prone areas largely benefits sustainable development. This study uses the nighttime light (NTL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) to examine human settlement development in areas with different levels of hurricane proneness from 1992 to 2013. The DMSP/OLS NTL data from six satellites were intercalibrated and desaturated with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical imagery to derive the Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI), a popular index that quantifies human settlement intensity. The derived VANUI time series was examined with the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen test to identify significant spatiotemporal trends. To link the VANUI product to hurricane impacts, four hurricane-prone zones were extracted to represent different levels of hurricane proneness. Aside from geographic division, a wind-speed-weighted track density function was developed and applied to historical storm tracks which originated in the North Atlantic Basin to better categorize the four levels of hurricane proneness. Spatiotemporal patterns of human settlement in the four zones were finally analyzed. The results clearly exhibit a north-south and inland-coastal discrepancy of human settlement dynamics. This study also reveals that both the zonal extent and zonal increase rate of human settlement positively correlate with hurricane proneness levels. The intensified human settlement in high hurricane-exposure zones deserves further attention for coastal resilience. © Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Eco-Friendly Coffee-Based Colloid For Performance Augmentation Of Solar Stills
JO  - Process Safety and Environmental Protection
PY  - 2020
AB  - Recently, nanofluids have been extensively used in water desalination systems because of their superior photo-thermal properties and heat transfer characteristics. Most of inorganic nanoparticles such as metal, metal oxides and carbon have adverse environmental impacts due to the risk related to their production and disposal processes as well as the toxicity of some types of them. In addition, their high production cost is another issue that motivates researchers to find low cost and eco-friendly alternatives to inorganic nanoparticles. In this study, coffee-based colloid has been proposed as an organic, low cost, and eco-friendly alternative to conventional inorganic-based nanofluids to augment the fresh water productivity of solar stills (SS). The performance of the modified solar still (MSS) has been experimentally investigated and compared with another conventional solar still (CSS) under the same conditions. The daily freshwater productivity obtained from the MSS was 4865.73 ml/m2 which was greater than that of CSS by 35.14 %. Energy and exergy efficiencies of MSS were improved by 35.34 % and 46.44 %, respectively, compared with that of CSS. Finally, the economic evaluation of the MSS is carried out via performing cost analysis. The cost of distilled water per liter produced by the modified solar still is 0.0136 $/l. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

TI  - Evaluating The Utility Of High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Air Pollution Data In Estimating Local Pm<Sub>2.5</Sub> Exposures In California From 2015-2018
JO  - ATMOSPHERE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Air quality management is increasingly focused not only on across-the-board reductions in ambient pollution concentrations but also on identifying and remediating elevated exposures that often occur in traditionally disadvantaged communities. Remote sensing of ambient air pollution using data derived from satellites has the potential to better inform management decisions that address environmental disparities by providing increased spatial coverage, at high-spatial resolutions, compared to air pollution exposure estimates based on ground-based monitors alone. Daily PM2.5 estimates for 2015-2018 were estimated at a 1 km(2) resolution, derived from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm in order to assess the utility of highly refined spatiotemporal air pollution data in 92 California cities and in the 13 communities included in the California Community Air Protection Program. The identification of pollution hot-spots within a city is typically not possible relying solely on the regulatory monitoring networks; however, day-to-day temporal variability was shown to be generally well represented by nearby ground-based monitoring data even in communities with strong spatial gradients in pollutant concentrations. An assessment of within-ZIP Code variability in pollution estimates indicates that high-resolution pollution estimates (i.e., 1 km(2)) are not always needed to identify spatial differences in exposure but become increasingly important for larger geographic areas (approximately 50 km(2)). Taken together, these findings can help inform strategies for use of remote sensing data for air quality management including the screening of locations with air pollution exposures that are not well represented by existing ground-based air pollution monitors.

TI  - Assessing The Impact Of Land Use And Land Cover Dynamics On Water Quality Of Dal Lake, Nw Himalaya, India
JO  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
PY  - 2020
AB  - A dynamic process like land use, if anthropogenically unsustainable, adversely affects the well-being of the land system. Worldwide, water bodies are facing imminent threat due to unsustainable anthropogenic activities. Water quality and ecology are the two characteristics of water bodies, if not preserved, shall have a direct consequence on the well-being of the human systems. Hence it is essential to understand the causes and consequences of the deteriorating water body systems. The condition is particularly grim in Himalayan water body ecosystems, where unplanned and unchecked urbanization has threatened their very existence. In the present study, the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) and its impact on the water quality of Dal Lake in Kashmir Himalaya, India has been assessed. We carried out a detailed study wherein changing LULC is analyzed against the deteriorating trophic status of the Dal Lake using time-series of satellite imagery of the lake's catchment and its water quality data. Results indicated that the water quality of Dal Lake has remarkably deteriorated due to increased nutrient and sediment loads from the catchment, attributed to significant anthropogenic activities in the catchment. Due to unprecedented LULC changes in the catchment, the forest class shows a significantly negative change since the last four decades (1980-2018), corroborating with the ongoing deterioration of physicochemical characteristics of the lake. The analysis shows an increase in all the agents of eutrophication, such as NO3-N, TP, and COD, from 1990 to 2018. The decrease in forest, agriculture, and floating gardens was observed to show a significant negative correlation with the increase in the decadal average values of the COD, NO3-N, and TP for the same corresponding period. Similarly, a positive correlation was found between the increase in built-up, aquatic vegetation, bare surfaces, and these water quality parameters, establishing a strong relationship between the deteriorating condition of the lake and changing LULC. Our findings indicate that changing LULC of the lake's catchment is one of the critical factors that has significantly contributed toward the deteriorating ecology and water quality of the Dal Lake. This study shall contribute toward the development of the robust conservation strategy in order to save this urban lake from its untimely death.

TI  - Meetc2: Ocean Color Atmospheric Corrections In Coastal Complex Waters Using A Bayesian Latent Class Model And Potential For The Incoming Sentinel 3 - Olci Mission
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2016
AB  - From top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations, atmospheric correction for ocean color inversion aims at distinguishing atmosphere and water contributions. From a methodological point of view, our approach relies on a Bayesian inference using Gaussian Mixture Model prior distributions on reference spectra of aerosol and water reflectance. A reference spectrum for the aerosol characterizes the specific signature of the aerosols on the observed aerosol reflectance. A reference spectrum for the water characterizes the specific signature of chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matters and colored dissolved organic matters on the observed sea surface reflectance. In our Bayesian inversion scheme, prior distributions of the marine and aerosol variables are set conditionally to the observed values of covariates, typically acquisition geometry acquisition conditions and pre-estimates of the aerosol and water reflectance in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The numerical inversion exploits a gradient-based optimization from quasi-randomized initializations. We evaluate our estimates of the sea surface reflectance from the MERIS TOA observations. Using the MERMAID radiometric in-situ dataset, we obtain significant improvements in the estimation of the sea surface reflectance, especially for the 412, 442, 490 and 510 nm bands, compared with the standard ESA MEGS algorithm and the a state-of-the-art neural network approach (C2R). The mean gain value on the relative error for the 13 bands between 412 and 885 nm is of 57% compared with MEGS algorithm and 10% compared with the C2R. The water leaving reflectances are used in Ocean Color for the estimation of the chl-a concentration, the colored dissolved organic matters absorption and the suspended particulate matters concentration underlying the potential of such approach to improve the standard level 2 products in coastal areas. We further discuss the potential of MEETC2 for the incoming OLCI/Sentinel 3 mission that will be launched in December 2015. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spatial Distribution Of The Level Of Return Of Extreme Precipitation Events In Northeast Brazil
JO  - International Journal of Climatology
PY  - 2020
AB  - This study aimed to estimate levels of return of extreme daily precipitation events, associating them with natural disasters in Northeast Brazil (NEB), a region characterized by different climatic conditions and low rates of social and economic development. For this, generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) models were adjusted to the daily extreme precipitation data estimated by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 product of the multisatellite precipitation analysis for a period of 16 years (2000–2015). In addition, the estimates of the GPD model were compared using two data sources, TRMM and pluviometer. The investigation showed that the results of the GPD model estimated by means of the extreme data from the rain gauge and the TRMM were statistically the same, with 95% confidence. Thus, using the data referring to the 2,082 grid points of the TRMM, it was possible to map the spatial distribution of the estimates of the levels of return of extreme precipitation to the return periods of 2, 5 and 10 years, per seasonal period. In general, the results indicated that the intensity of expected extreme precipitation depends on the seasonal period and the place of occurrence of precipitation. The eastern NEB stood out as the region where the highest intensities of extreme precipitation are expected. Extreme precipitation values of up to 178 mm are expected in 2 years. The areas where natural disasters occurred in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 are similar to those in which the highest rainfall intensities are expected. The results of this study can allow the evaluation of the spatial distribution of risks related to extreme precipitation events, and therefore, support the planning of regional public policies and environmental management for the prevention of natural disasters in NEB. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society

TI  - Whalewatch: A Dynamic Management Tool For Predicting Blue Whale Density In The California Current
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
PY  - 2017
AB  - 1. Management of highly migratory species is reliant on spatially and temporally explicit information on their distribution and abundance. Satellite telemetry provides time-series data on individual movements. However, these data are underutilized in management applications in part because they provide presence-only information rather than abundance information such as density. 2. Eastern North Pacific blue whales are listed as threatened, and ship strikes have been suggested as a key factor limiting their recovery. Here, we developed a satellite-telemetry-based habitat model in a case-control design for Eastern North Pacific blue whales Balaenoptera musculus that was combined with previously published abundance estimates to predict habitat preference and densities. Further, we operationalize an automated, near-real-time whale density prediction tool based on up-to-date environmental data for use by managers and other stakeholders. 3. A switching state-space movement model was applied to 104 blue whale satellite tracks from 1994 to 2008 to account for errors in the location estimates and provide daily positions (case points). We simulated positions using a correlated random walk model (control points) and sampled the environment at each case and control point. Generalized additive mixed models and boosted regression trees were applied to determine the probability of occurrence based on environmental covariates. Models were used to predict 8-day and monthly resolution, year-round density estimates scaled by population abundance estimates that provide a critical tool for understanding seasonal and interannual changes in habitat use. 4. The telemetry-based habitat model predicted known blue whale hot spots and had seasonal agreement with sightings data, highlighting the skill of the model for predicting blue whale habitat preference and density. We identified high interannual variability in occurrence emphasizing the benefit of dynamic models compared to multiyear averages. 5. Synthesis and applications. This near-real-time tool allows a more accurate examination of the year-round spatio-temporal overlap of blue whales with potentially harmful human activities, such as shipping. This approach should also be applicable to other species for which sufficient telemetry data are available. The dynamic predictive product developed here is an important tool that allows managers to consider finer-scale management areas that are more economically feasible and socially acceptable.

TI  - Predicting The Spatial Distribution Of Soil Mineral Particles Using Oli Sensor In Northwest Of Iran
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Texture is one of the most important soil properties that knowledge of the spatial distribution is essential for land-use planning and other activities related to agriculture and environment protection. So, this study was performed to supply the soil texture spatial distribution using standardized spectral reflectance (ZPC1) index of Landsat 8 satellite images in the northwest of Iran. The soil sampling was performed using a random method in 145 points. Mineral soil particles including clay, silt, and sand were determined, and soil texture was calculated. In this study, Landsat 8 satellite images were used to interpolate the soil texture spatial distribution. In the first step, the principal component analysis (PCA) was obtained. Then, PCA1 was standardized using a z-score (ZPC1), and regression techniques were used to create proper relationships between ZPC1 and the primary soil particles. Then, spatial distribution of soil particles was used to create a spatially distributed map of the soil textural classes. The results showed that the standardization of the first component reduced the standard deviation of PCA1 from 23.6 to 10.8. The results of comparing ZPC1 with soil mineral components showed that with increasing the amounts of soil clay and sand, the ZPC1 value decreases and increases, respectively. The results showed that the ranges of the spatial distribution of clay and sand were similar to the laboratory-measured amounts. The results of texture class prediction using the soil texture triangle showed that the amount of similarity between the measured and predicted classes was 53.79%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - The Incidence Of Chickenpox In The Community
JO  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
PY  - 2001
AB  - Sentinel practice networks have been established in many European countries to monitor disease incidence in the community. To demonstrate the value of sentinel networks an international study on the incidence of chicken pox has been undertaken. Chickenpox was chosen as an acute condition for which incidence data are important to the determination of health policy on vaccine use. The project examined the incidence of chickenpox reported in sentinel networks in England and Wales, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain (two regional networks) in January-June 2000 and the potential underestimate from patients who did not consult. An investigation of secondary household contact cases was undertaken. Reported incidence of chickenpox (all ages) in England and Wales was 25 per 10,000, in the Netherlands 13 per 10,000, in Portugal 21 per 10,000, in Spain Castilla y Leon 27 per 10,000 and in Spain Basque 55 per 10,000. Analysis of secondary contact cases suggested underestimation of incidence between 2.4\% in Spain Castilla y Leon and 32.2\% in The Netherlands. There was a trend towards incidence at an earlier age in England and Wales and in the Netherlands compared with Portugal and Spain. Whilst there was little problem in reliably identifying the number of incident cases in the recording networks and relating the non-consulting contact cases to them, the security of the denominator remains a problem where networks are comprised of differing categories of health care provider. It is essential that numerator and denominator information are made available specifically for each category.

TI  - Cost Of A Recall Of A Single-Center Experience Managing The Riata Defibrillator Lead
JO  - American Journal of Cardiology
PY  - 2015
AB  - Riata and Riata ST defibrillator leads (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, California) were recalled in 2011 due to increased risk of insulation failure leading to externalized cables. Fluoroscopic screening can identify insulation failure, although the relation between mechanical failure and electrical failure is unclear. At the time of the recall, the University of Virginia developed a screening program, including fluoroscopic evaluation, education sessions, device interrogation, and remote monitoring for patients with this defibrillator lead. The aim of this study was to review the outcomes of the screening program, including costs, which were absorbed by our institution. Costs were calculated using Medicare reimbursement estimates. Forty-eight patients participated in the screening program. At initial screening, 31% were found to have evidence of insulation failure but electrical function was normal in all leads. The cost of this program was $35,358.72. The cost per diagnosis of mechanical lead failure was $2,357.25. During 2 years of follow-up, 1 patient experienced Riata lead electrical failure without fluoroscopic evidence of insulation failure. Patients were more likely to have a lead revision if there was evidence of insulation failure. Lead revisions occurred at the time of generator change in 88% of patients with insulation failure but in only 14% of patients with a fluoroscopically normal lead (p = 0.04). The cost of recall-related defibrillator lead revisions was $81,704.55. In conclusion, our Riata screening program added expense without clear benefit to patients. In fact, patients may have been put at more risk by undergoing defibrillator lead revisions based solely on the results of the fluoroscopic screening. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Fishing For Space: Fine-Scale Multi-Sector Maritime Activities Influence Fisher Location Choice
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2015
AB  - The European Union and other states are moving towards Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management to balance food production and security with wider ecosystem concerns. Fishing is only one of several sectors operating within the ocean environment, competing for renewable and non-renewable resources that overlap in a limited space. Other sectors include marine mining, energy generation, recreation, transport and conservation. Trade-offs of these competing sectors are already part of the process but attempts to detail how the seas are being utilised have been primarily based on compilations of data on human activity at large spatial scales. Advances including satellite and shipping automatic tracking enable investigation of factors influencing fishers' choice of fishing grounds at spatial scales relevant to decision-making, including the presence or avoidance of activities by other sectors. We analyse the determinants of English and Welsh scallop-dredging fleet behaviour, including competing sectors, operating in the eastern English Channel. Results indicate aggregate mining activity, maritime traffic, increased fishing costs, and the English inshore 6 and French 12 nautical mile limits negatively impact fishers' likelihood of fishing in otherwise suitable areas. Past success, net-benefits and fishing within the 12 NM predispose fishers to use areas. Systematic conservation planning has yet to be widely applied in marine systems, and the dynamics of spatial overlap of fishing with other activities have not been studied at scales relevant to fisher decision-making. This study demonstrates fisher decision-making is indeed affected by the real-time presence of other sectors in an area, and therefore trade-offs which need to be accounted for in marine planning. As marine resource extraction demands intensify, governments will need to take a more proactive approach to resolving these trade-offs, and studies such as this will be required as the evidential foundation for future seascape planning.

TI  - Prediction Of Extreme Rain In Kototabang Using Himawari-8 Satellite Based On Differences In Cloud Brightness Temperature
JO  - Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment
PY  - 2024
AB  - The accurate prediction of extreme rain events is essential for the management and mitigation of hydrometeorological disasters. The Himawari-8 satellite provides cloud observations that can accurately forecast short-term extreme rain events using the Brightness Temperature (BT) data and Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) method. The statistical evaluation of this method was conducted using optical rain gauge data taken from Kototabang, West Sumatra, Indonesia (100.32° E, 0.20° S) to determine the best threshold for detecting extreme rain. We used three bands, bands 11 (B11), 13 (B13) and 15 (B15) and tested three combinations of BTDs from these bands, namely BTD1 (B11-B13), BTD2 (B13-B15), and BTD3 (BTD1-BTD2). This study emphasizes the importance of parameter selection in extreme rain identification and forecasting using cloud BT and BTD methods. Effective parameter optimization is essential for adapting these approaches to different rainfall intensities, therefore selecting appropriate thresholds is necessary. The research particularly highlights the impact of temperature and rainfall intensity on BT accuracy, with BT excelling at 250 K for light rain but showing reduced accuracy as rainfall intensity increases. BTD1 demonstrates improved accuracy with higher rainfall intensity, especially at a 3 K threshold, allowing for predictions of extreme rain events with a 10–20 min lead time. However, the limitation of this threshold is shown by consistent critical success index (CSI). Therefore, BTD1 with threshold 0 K give better performances with good accuracy, CSI and false alarm ratio (FAR) for various rain intensities. BTD2 shows improved accuracy at lower thresholds with reduced rainfall intensity and at the 3 K threshold, offering potential for extreme rainfall anticipation, but with declining CSI as rainfall intensity rises. The 0 K threshold, despite high probability of detection (POD), yields increased FAR in moderate to severe rainfall scenarios. BTD3 generally exhibits increased accuracy and CSI with rising rainfall intensity, except at the −3 K threshold, with the 0 K threshold standing out as the optimal choice, providing a 10–20 min lead time for intense rain predictions. This study shows that the selection of the appropriate BT and BTD techniques, and parameter values should align with specific rainfall levels and forecasting goals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Examining The Potential Impact Of Land Use/Cover Changes On The Npp Ecosystem Services Of Yan'an Region Of China: A Scenario-Based Analysis
JO  - International Journal of Global Warming
PY  - 2015
AB  - Remote sensing-derived LUC maps for 2009, GIS-based LUC change model, and ecosystem service value of NPP were used to facilitate the analysis. The results forests have significantly higher NPP values than farmlands, whose NPP is approximately equal to that of brushlands. The scenario-based LUC change analysis revealed that if the urban LUC change pattern continues, the total ecosystem service value of NPP will also change, especially if the forest cover is not fully protected and conserved. Our results highlighted that under the great pressure of urbanisation, there is a need to strengthen the proper implementation of policies in order to maintain and improve ecosystem services. Although there are limitations to the estimated ecosystem service value of NPP of Yan'an to be taken into account in future studies, the magnitude of the estimated changes in the LUC is substantial.

TI  - Improving Imbalanced Land Cover Classification With K-Means Smote: Detecting And Oversampling Distinctive Minority Spectral Signatures
JO  - INFORMATION
PY  - 2021
AB  - Land cover maps are a critical tool to support informed policy development, planning, and resource management decisions. With significant upsides, the automatic production of Land Use/Land Cover maps has been a topic of interest for the remote sensing community for several years, but it is still fraught with technical challenges. One such challenge is the imbalanced nature of most remotely sensed data. The asymmetric class distribution impacts negatively the performance of classifiers and adds a new source of error to the production of these maps. In this paper, we address the imbalanced learning problem, by using K-means and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) as an improved oversampling algorithm. K-means SMOTE improves the quality of newly created artificial data by addressing both the between-class imbalance, as traditional oversamplers do, but also the within-class imbalance, avoiding the generation of noisy data while effectively overcoming data imbalance. The performance of K-means SMOTE is compared to three popular oversampling methods (Random Oversampling, SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE) using seven remote sensing benchmark datasets, three classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest Classifier) and three evaluation metrics using a five-fold cross-validation approach with three different initialization seeds. The statistical analysis of the results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the remaining oversamplers producing higher quality land cover classifications. These results suggest that LULC data can benefit significantly from the use of more sophisticated oversamplers as spectral signatures for the same class can vary according to geographical distribution.

TI  - Remote Sensing In Seagrass Ecology: Coupled Dynamics Between Migratory Herbivorous Birds And Intertidal Meadows Observed By Satellite During Four Decades
JO  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
PY  - 2023
AB  - Taking into account trophic relationships in seagrass meadows is crucial to explain and predict seagrass temporal trajectories, as well as for implementing and evaluating seagrass conservation policies. However, this type of interaction has been rarely investigated over the long term and at the scale of the whole seagrass habitat. In this work, reciprocal links between an intertidal seagrass species, Zostera noltei, and a herbivorous bird feeding on this seagrass species, the migratory goose Branta bernicla bernicla, were investigated using an original combination of long-term Earth Observation (EO) and bird census data. Seagrass Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) such as seagrass abundance and phenology were measured from 1985 to 2020 using high-resolution satellite remote sensing over Bourgneuf Bay (France), and cross-analysed with in situ measurements of bird population size during the goose wintering season. Our results showed a mutual relationship between seagrass and Brent geese over the four last decades, suggesting that the relationship between the two species extends beyond a simple grass-herbivore consumptive effect. We provided evidence of two types of interactions: (i) a bottom-up control where the late-summer seagrass abundance drives the wintering population of herbivorous geese and (ii) an indirect top-down effect of Brent goose on seagrass habitat, where seagrass development is positively influenced by the bird population during the previous wintering season. Such a mutualistic relationship has strong implications for biodiversity conservation because protecting one species is beneficial to the other one, as demonstrated here by the positive trajectories observed from 1985 to 2020 in both seagrass and bird populations. Importantly, we also demonstrated here that exploring the synergy between EO and in situ bird data can benefit seagrass ecology and ecosystem management.

TI  - Legal Challenges And Market Rewards To The Use And Acceptance Of Remote Sensing And Digital Information As Evidence
JO  - Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum
PY  - 2002
AB  - Emerging technologies are revolutionizing the collection, organization, application, storage, and distribution of earth science information and enabling more cost-effective decision-making and better environmental protection. Satellite remote sensing and digital systems, including geographic information systems (GIS), provide powerful tools for visualizing and solving complex legal and environmental problems. The use of digital technologies in performing tasks or making decisions that are vulnerable to legal dispute presents significant challenges to the courts in understanding how the information was derived, processed, and presented and in weighing the probative value of the information against its potential to confuse. Despite the tremendous opportunity for technologies to enable more informed, cost- effective decisions, issues of credibility, acceptability, and other evidentiary hurdles are impeding the integration of these technologies into the routine operations performed by public and private environmental stewards. Until scientists and attorneys work together to educate triers of fact to develop protocols for general acceptance, courts will be reluctant to work through the associated complex science and mathematics necessary to assign evidentiary value to the information. Thus, uncertainty about the information's viability in court will stifle the growth of the commercial remote sensing market and delay the development of applications, which will confirm that remote sensing and digital information systems can greatly improve environmental management. This article (1) describes the basic technologies and capabilities of earth science satellites and digital information systems to open readers' minds to possible applications, (2) evaluates evidentiary hurdles to the acceptance of remotely-sensed and other digital information in the courts, (3) presents an analysis of opportunities to integrate these systems in environmental assessment and resource management, and (4) concludes that the removal of evidentiary impediments will improve environmental protection, result in cost- saving or cost-avoidance in decision-making, and accelerate the growth of commercial remote sensing and GIS industries.

TI  - Multi-Structure Joint Decision-Making Approach For Land Use Classification Of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Cnns
JO  - IEEE Access
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land use classification of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images is a challenging and prominent problem in which pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made amazing achievements. However, single-structured pretrained CNNs have limitations to obtain high classification accuracy. Besides, each pretrained CNNs has different classification ability to classify land use. Therefore, taking advantages of different pretrained CNNs is essential for land use classification. In this study, we propose a novel classification approach based on multi-structure joint decision-making strategy and pretrained CNNs. The basic idea is to apply three CNNs to classify land use separately with the final classification results achieved by joint decision-making strategy. The proposed approach comprises of three steps. First, we create a new fully connected layer and Softmax classification layer. We combine them with the convolutional layers of AlexNet, Inception-v3, and ResNet18. AlexNet also includes the first two layers of fully connected layers. Secondly, we train these designed CNNs to converge by momentum-driven stochastic gradient descent. Thirdly, we utilize joint decision-making strategy to obtain the final prediction results by combining the prediction results of these designed CNNs. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the UC Merced land use, AID, NWPU-45, OPTIMAL-31 datasets and further compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other methods. The benefits of the proposed approach are threefold. First, the multi-structure network maximizes different pretrained CNN structures to extract rich convolution features. Secondly, it could remarkably improve the classification accuracy of indistinguishable land use types of the HRRS images. Thirdly, it has great potential on small dataset with more land use types. The proposed CNN based on multi-structure joint decision approach achieves accurate and reliable land use classification with these benefits. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - An Approach Integrating Multi-Source Data With Landtrendr Algorithm For Refining Forest Recovery Detection
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Disturbances to forests are getting worse with climate change and urbanization. Assessing the functionality of forest ecosystems is challenging because it requires not only a large amount of input data but also comprehensive estimation indicator methods. The object of the evaluation index of forest ecosystem restoration relies on the ecosystem function instead of the area. To develop the appropriate index with ecological implications, we built the hybrid assessment approach including ecosystem structure-function-habitat representatives. It was based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) spectral indicator and combined with the local forest management inventory (LFMI), Landsat, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The results of the visual interpretation of Google Earth’s historical imagery showed that the total accuracy of the hybrid approach was 0.94. The output of the hybrid model increased as the biodiversity index value increased. Furthermore, to solve the multi-source data availability problem, the random forest model (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.14) with 0.77 total accuracy was built to generate an annual recovery index. A random forest model based on tree age is provided to simplify the hybrid approach while extending the results on time series. The recovery index obtained by the random forest model could facilitate monitoring the forest recovery rate of cold spots. The regional ecological recovery time could be predicted. These two results could provide a scientific basis for forest managers to make more effective forest restoration plans. From the perspective of space, it could ensure that the areas with slow recovery would be allocated enough restoration resources. From the perspective of time, the implementation period of the closed forest policy could also be estimated. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Spatial Filtering And Bayesian Data Fusion For Mapping Soil Properties: A Case Study Combining Legacy And Remotely Sensed Data In Iran
JO  - GEODERMA
PY  - 2019
AB  - In a spatial mapping context, we address in this paper the issue of combining at best soil data coming from legacy soil surveys with soil information that is indirectly obtained from remote sensing (RS). We show first how spatial scale issues need to beproperly addressed for soil mapping in order to increase the predictive performances of spatial prediction models, where the two prediction techniques that are compared here are kriging and random forests (RF). By relying afterwards on a Bayesian data fusion approach, we then emphasize the benefit of combining the output of these two prediction models in order to get a single prediction result that leads to an improved final map. The advocated methodology is illustrated with the mapping of soil saturation percentage (SP) over a 10,480 km(2) area located in Iran, were SP is a key soil parameter for sustainable development and land management. A set of 396 soil profiles were obtained from legacy soil surveys and were used to compute vertically averaged SP values. In parallel, a set of RS covariates were obtained from a 90 meters resolution Landsat image and a digital elevation model. Based on the modeling of the spatialdependence both for soil SP data and for RS covariates, it is shown how the relationship between them is improved by using a filtered kriging technique that allows us to focus on their long range component only. Using these filtered SP value and RS covariates, predictions were obtained separately from kriging and from a RF model at the nodes of a 90 meters resolution grid. Even if the performances of these two models are almost identical with R-2 values equal to 0.66-0.67, it is shown afterwards that a Bayesian data fusion procedure that combines both predictions yields improved performance with a R2 value equal to 0.86. These results clearly emphasize the importance of properly addressing scale issues and the benefit of data fusion inorder to improve the quality of the final map. Though the study was conducted here for SP values, we believe this methodology and these findings are relevant when it comes to handle other soil properties in a spatial mapping context that involves several data sources.

TI  - Optimization Of Management By Analyzing Ecosystem Service Value Variations In Different Watersheds In The Three-River Headwaters Basin
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Variation analysis of ecosystem services (ESs) is an important means of regional watershed management, especially for the ecologically fragile Three-River Headwaters Basin (TRHB), which is an important part of the national ecological security barrier. In this study, meteorological data, remote sensing images and land use data from 2000 to 2020 in the TRHB were collected. Based on the estimation of ecosystem service values (ESVs), the spatial-temporal variations of ESVs in the three watersheds were analyzed via spatial autocorrelation analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and correspondence analysis. The study indicates that for the 20-year changes in the TRHB, the provisioning service (PS) and regulating service (RS) increased in most areas except for a small decrease in the northwest, while the supporting service (SS) value in most areas in the southwest showed a decreasing trend. Through the difference results of different watersheds, it can be seen that the dif-ferences in the PS and RS values among the three watersheds became increasingly more significant with the passage of time. Moreover, a significant correspondence was identified between each watershed and each ESV level, whereby the highest ESV levels (SS-VI, RS-VI, and PS-VI) mainly corresponded to the Yellow River watershed, the high values (SS-V, RS-V, PS-V, SS-IV, RS-IV, and PS-IV) mainly corresponded to the Lancang River watershed, and the low values (SS-I, RS-I, and PS-I) corresponded to the Yangtze River watershed. Our analysis shows the variation characteristics of ESVs to provide a guiding basis for ensuring the precise implementation of the management and protection of watersheds in the TRHB or similar areas.

TI  - Model-Evaluation Tools For Three-Dimensional Cloud Verification Via Spaceborne Active Sensors
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
PY  - 2014
AB  - Clouds pose many operational hazards to the aviation community in terms of ceilings and visibility, turbulence, and aircraft icing. Realistic descriptions of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution and temporal evolution of clouds in numerical weather prediction models used for flight planning and routing are therefore of central importance. The introduction of satellite-based cloud radar (CloudSat) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) sensors to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration A-Train is timely in light of these needs but requires a new paradigm of model-evaluation tools that are capable of exploiting the vertical-profile information. Early results from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Model Evaluation Toolkit (MET), augmented to work with the emergent satellite-based active sensor observations, are presented here. Existing horizontal-plane statistical evaluation techniques have been adapted to operate on observations in the vertical plane and have been extended to 3D object evaluations, leveraging blended datasets from the active and passive A-Train sensors. Case studies of organized synoptic-scale and mesoscale distributed cloud systems are presented to illustrate the multiscale utility of the MET tools. Definition of objects on the basis of radar-reflectivity thresholds was found to be strongly dependent on the model's ability to resolve details of the cloud's internal hydrometeor distribution. Contoured-frequency-by-altitude diagrams provide a useful mechanism for evaluating the simulated and observed 3D distributions for regional domains. The expanded MET provides a new dimension to model evaluation and positions the community to better exploit active-sensor satellite observing systems that are slated for launch in the near future.

TI  - Typological Fragility Curves For Rc Buildings: Influence Of Damage Index And Building Sample Selection
JO  - Engineering Structures
PY  - 2022
AB  - The recent earthquakes occurred in the last years in Italy registered a great number of casualties and large economic losses. In this perspective, the effective seismic risk assessment has become crucial for the Government mitigation policies that have to allocate the limited economic sources for the risk reduction. In this paper, data collected after the 2012 Emilia and the 2009 L'Aquila, Italy, earthquakes were used to derive novel fragility curves for RC frame buildings classes. Compared to previous studies, different aspects affecting the fragility curves parameters were investigated. First of all, data are completed accounting for the presence of undamaged buildings that are generally uninspected after the seismic events, considering alternative criteria to complete the database. Then, the influence of the building damage index definition was considered by selecting four damage indices available in the literature that allow converting the damage data collected with the post-earthquake form into one of the five damage states, according to the European macroseismic scale. Separate sets of fragility curves, as a function of peak ground acceleration, were developed for the building stock of the two regions. The results reveal that the database correction with the uninspected buildings is relevant to avoid the overestimation of the exceedance probability, especially at lower peak ground acceleration values, resulting in less steep curves. Then, the building damage indices accounting for the damage of both structural and non-structural elements led to a higher exceedance probability with respect to damage indices based on damage of only structural elements, especially for the lower damage states. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Applicability Of Spectral Indices In Determination Of Coastal Changes
JO  - Sains Malaysiana
PY  - 2023
AB  - Coast is essential in providing wide range of ecosystem services. Shorelines change dynamically, and analysing shoreline changes can be conducted with Remote sensing and GIS technologies. This study aims to measure applicability of spectral indices of Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to distinguish land cover classes and determine coastline changes on west coast of Johor between 2000 and 2020. This study analysed satellite image data obtained from Landsat 7 ETM+ (2000) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2020) using ERDAS and ArcGIS software. Spectral index images were generated for shoreline determination through OTSU classification. Image overlays are created to determine shoreline changes. The use of spectral indices showed that the three spectral indexes could effectively distinguish water and land along west coast of Johor. MNDWI had an overall accuracy of 99.00% (2000) and 97.50% (2020) and highest Kappa value for both Landsat satellite images, 0.98 (2000) and 0.95 (2020). The NDVI and SAVI indices have the same accuracy of 95.00% (2000) and 96.50% (2020) and Kappa value of 0.90 (2000) and 0.93 (2020). The west coast of Johor has experienced a reduction of 583.48 hectares of coastline and accretion of 846.85 hectares. Higher reduction was observed along Batu Pahat and Pontian coasts, while the shoreline on the north shore of Pontian showed a very high amount of accretion. This study can benefit stakeholders by giving the status of the latest coastline changes in implementing effective coastal development and management measures. © 2023 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 1995
AB  - 'Ultrawideband (μHz-PHz) Interferometric Sensing and Imaging Polarimetry' has become an indispensable tool in wide area environmental surveillance of the terrestial and planetary covers. It allows dynamic optimal image feature extraction of significant characteristics of desirable target and/or target sections with simultaneous suppression of undesirable background clutter/speckle at hitherto unknown clarity and of never achieved quality. Ultrawideband may be adopted to the detection, recognition, and identification (DRI) of any stationary, moving, or vibrating target versus arbitrary stationary, dynamically changing or moving geophysical environments. A comprehensive overview is presented on how these modern high resolution/precision complete polarimetric coregistered signature sensing and interferometric POL-SAR imaging techniques, complemented by full integration of novel navigational electronic tools, such as DGPS, will advance electromagnetic vector wave sensing and imaging towards limits of physical realizability. Various examples utilizing NASA-JPL/AIR-SAR, NAWC/P3-POL-SAR, DLR-OPH/DO-POL-SAR airborne, ERS-1, JERS-1 satellite and SIR-C/X-SAR shuttle imaging data sets dealing with the recent Mississippi-Missouri/USA 1993 and Werra/FRG floods and various earthquake surface deformation events will be presented for demonstrating the utility of WISIP.

TI  - Using U-Net-Like Deep Convolutional Neural Networks For Precise Tree Recognition In Very High Resolution Rgb (Red, Green, Blue) Satellite Images
JO  - Forests
PY  - 2021
AB  - Very high resolution satellite imageries provide an excellent foundation for precise mapping of plant communities and even single plants. We aim to perform individual tree recognition on the basis of very high resolution RGB (red, green, blue) satellite images using deep learning approaches for northern temperate mixed forests in the Primorsky Region of the Russian Far East. We used a pansharpened satellite RGB image by GeoEye-1 with a spatial resolution of 0.46 m/pixel, obtained in late April 2019. We parametrized the standard U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained it in manually delineated satellite images to solve the satellite image segmentation problem. For comparison purposes, we also applied standard pixel-based classification algorithms, such as random forest, k-nearest neighbor classifier, naive Bayes classifier, and quadratic discrimination. Pattern-specific features based on grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) were computed to improve the recognition ability of standard machine learning methods. The U-Net-like CNN allowed us to obtain precise recognition of Mongolian poplar (Populus suaveolens Fisch. ex Loudon s.l.) and evergreen coniferous trees (Abies holophylla Maxim., Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc.). We were able to distinguish species belonging to either poplar or coniferous groups but were unable to separate species within the same group (i.e. A. holophylla and P. koraiensis were not distinguishable). The accuracy of recognition was estimated by several metrics and exceeded values obtained for standard machine learning approaches. In contrast to pixel-based recognition algorithms, the U-Net-like CNN does not lead to an increase in false-positive decisions when facing green-colored objects that are similar to trees. By means of U-Net-like CNN, we obtained a mean accuracy score of up to 0.96 in our computational experiments. The U-Net-like CNN recognizes tree crowns not as a set of pixels with known RGB intensities but as spatial objects with a specific geometry and pattern. This CNN’s specific feature excludes misclassifications related to objects of similar colors as objects of interest. We highlight that utilization of satellite images obtained within the suitable phenological season is of high importance for successful tree recognition. The suitability of the phenological season is conceptualized as a group of conditions providing highlighting objects of interest over other components of vegetation cover. In our case, the use of satellite images captured in mid-spring allowed us to recognize evergreen fir and pine trees as the first class of objects (“conifers”) and poplars as the second class, which were in a leafless state among other deciduous tree species. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Using Landsat 8 Imagery In Detecting Cork Oak (<I>Quercus Suber</I> L.) Woodlands: A Case Study In Calabria (Italy)
JO  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, cork oak (Quercus suber L) woodlands are characteristic and widespread forestry ecosystems. Though presenting significant economic potential as a renewable resource, they are not adequately valorised, in spite of a growing market demand for cork and cork-based products, which are appreciated, today, for their use in sustainable building. In this respect, cork meets the needs of the building industry in responding to the growing demand for quality products, which are eco-and energy-friendly and hygienically safe. Moreover, European cultural and biodiversity value has been attributed to cork oak woodlands and their most significant examples have been included in the Natura 2000 framework. So far. in some countries like Italy. the territorial distribution and characterisation of cork oak woodlands have not been adequately investigated. This study provides a method for mapping the actual presence of cork oak woodlands and for assessing their potential distribution. Special attention was given to the characterisation of cork oak spectral signature. To this end, Landsat 8 satellite images, digital photointerpretation and in situ surveys were implemented. The work carried out allows assessing the effectiveness of GIS and remote sensing techniques coupled with ancillary data and tools, and their applicability for the development of a comprehensive mapping and monitoring system of cork oak woodlands in Mediterranean ecosystems. Such techniques are vital to develop a detailed management strategy and to assist restoration activities and the economic assessment of semi-natural habitats. A case study, carried out in two different locations in Calabria (Italy), is provided.

TI  - How Community Forest Management Performs When Redd Plus Payments Fail
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
PY  - 2022
AB  - The reduced emissions in deforestation and degradation (REDD+) initiative uses payments for ecosystem services as incentives for developing countries to manage and protect their forests. REDD+ initiatives also prioritize social (and environmental) co-benefits aimed at improving the livelihoods of communities that are dependent on forests. Despite the incorporation of co-benefits into REDD+ goals, carbon sequestration remains the primary metric for which countries can receive payments from REDD+, but after more than 10 years of REDD+, many site-specific programs have failed to complete the carbon verification process. Here, we examine whether the REDD+ social co-benefits alone are sufficient to have slowed deforestation in the absence of carbon payments on Pemba, Tanzania. Using satellite imagery (Landsat archive), we quantified forest cover change for the period before (2001-2010) and after (2010-2018) the launch in 2010-2011 of Pemba island's REDD+ readiness project. We then compared rates of forest cover change between shehia (administrative units) that were part of REDD+ readiness intervention and those that were not, adjusting for confounding variables and the non-random selection of REDD+ shehia with a statistical matching procedure. Despite considerable variation in forest outcomes among shehia, the associated co-benefits with the Pemba REDD+ project had no discernible effect on forest cover change. Likewise, we did not detect an effect of socioecological covariates on forest cover change across all shehia, though island-wide human population growth since 2012 may have played a role. These findings are unsurprising given the failure to secure carbon payments on Pemba and indicate that co-benefits alone are insufficient to reduce deforestation. We conclude that better oversight of all-involved parties is needed to ensure that REDD+ interventions satisfactorily conclude the process of securing a mechanism for carbon payments, if slowing deforestation is to be achieved.

TI  - A Cloud-Enabled Regional Climate Model Evaluation System
JO  - Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering
PY  - 2011
AB  - The climate research community is increasingly interested in utilizing direct, observational measurements to validate model output in an effort to tune those models to better approximate our planet's dynamic climate. The current emphasis on performing these comparisons at regional, as opposed to global, scales presents challenges both scientific and technical, since regional ecosystems are highly heterogeneous and the available data is not readily consumed on a regional basis. If provided with a common approach for efficiently accessing and utilizing the existing observational datasets, climate researchers have the potential to effect lasting societal, economic and political benefits. A key challenge, however, is that model-to-observational comparison requires massive quantities of data and significant computational capabilities. Further complicating matters is the fact that, currently, observational data and model outputs exist in a variety of data formats, utilize varying degrees of specificity and resolution, and reside in disparate, highly heterogeneous data systems. In this paper we present a software architectural approach that leverages the advantages of cloud computing and modern open-source software technologies to address the regional climate modeling problem. Our system, dubbed RCMES, is highly scalable and elastic, allows for both local and distributed management of the satellite observations and generated model outputs, and delivers this information to climate researchers in a way that is easily integrated into existing climate simulations and statistical tools. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - A brief presentation of performed works on the EU project OBSERVE Strengthening and development of Earth observation activities for the environment in the Balkan area has been presented. The theme of the project (ENV. 2010.4.1.4-1) is Identification and Networking of EO activities in the Balkan area (observe-fp7. eu). The goal of the project, in which 15 institutions from 13 countries have been involved, is to collect and compile all the necessary information for delivering an integrated analysis on the current status of EO activities and networks in the Balkan area, regarding environmental monitoring, the potential benefit from the full exploitation of an integrated capacity development strategy and the prospect of creating a relevant permanent EO community in the broader area. The objective of the project is also to raise awareness and establish firm links with the regional decision making bodies on the importance of a mutual and enhanced EO application network on environmental monitoring according, to the GEO principles. Apart from the creation of stakeholder's database containing basic data on the identified stakeholders in each country, 276 of them registered in 11 countries (31 in Croatia), the Roadmap and Strategy plan, for strengthening EO capacity in the Balkans with the purpose of environmental monitoring has been developed. Also, a number of studies have been carried out: (a) National Thematic Reports on EO Capacities, (b) Spatial Information System, (c) Establishment of common standards and requirements for EO data management etc. It is concluded that the Balkan countries do not have a coherent and continuous approach towards the challenge of implementating due integrated EO applications in environmental monitoring and management.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated With Failing Pretransmission Assessment Surveys (Pre-Tas) In Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programs: Results Of A Multi-Country Analysis
JO  - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases
PY  - 2020
AB  - Achieving elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem requires a minimum of five effective rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) and demonstrating low prevalence in subsequent assessments. The first assessments recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) are sentinel and spot-check sites—referred to as pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS)—in each implementation unit after MDA. If pre-TAS shows that prevalence in each site has been lowered to less than 1% microfilaremia or less than 2% antigenemia, the implementation unit conducts a TAS to determine whether MDA can be stopped. Failure to pass pre-TAS means that further rounds of MDA are required. This study aims to understand factors influencing pre-TAS results using existing programmatic data from 554 implementation units, of which 74 (13%) failed, in 13 countries. Secondary data analysis was completed using existing data from Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Haiti, Indonesia, Mali, Nepal, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda. Additional covariate data were obtained from spatial raster data sets. Bivariate analysis and multilinear regression were performed to establish potential relationships between variables and the pre-TAS result. Higher baseline prevalence and lower elevation were significant in the regression model. Variables statistically significantly associated with failure (p-value 0.05) in the bivariate analyses included baseline prevalence at or above 5% or 10%, use of Filariasis Test Strips (FTS), primary vector of Culex, treatment with diethylcarbamazine-albendazole, higher elevation, higher population density, higher enhanced vegetation index (EVI), higher annual rainfall, and 6 or more rounds of MDA. This paper reports for the first time factors associated with pre-TAS results from a multi-country analysis. This information can help countries more effectively forecast program activities, such as the potential need for more rounds of MDA, and prioritize resources to ensure adequate coverage of all persons in areas at highest risk of failing pre-TAS. © 2020, Public Library of Science.

TI  - Assessing Impact Of Economic Activities On Urban Air Quality In India Bynightlight And Atmospheric Measurement Datasets
JO  - 37th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2016
PY  - 2016
AB  - Understanding causal relationship between economic activities and emissions is important for framing successful environmental policies. However temporally and spatially continuous 'air quality' data is required to get a detailed trend information for urban regions. Using nightlight data, which correlate well with economic activities, and air quality species data observed from satellite, the authors have previously devised a scheme for classifying regions. In this research the classification scheme is applied on a time series data to draw inferences about transition in regional air quality due to human activities. Based on inferences from classification trends, relationship between various economic activities (such as construction, manufacturing, vehicle population etc.) and air quality species is explored and checked for causality using Granger's test. The objective is to identify which industries correlate well with air quality species and can also be statistically identified as a cause.The air quality species considered are ANG (angstrom exponent), AOD (aerosol optical depth), NO2, SO2 Nightlight time series data is obtained by intra-calibrating DN values from multiple-year DMSP-OLS sensors and inter-calibrating it with radiance values from VIIRS-DNB sensor. The industries that are expected to result in nighttime lights and urban air pollution are then checked for causality with air quality species using Granger causation test.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis Of Wetlands Based On Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics Using Remote Sensing And Gis In Sindh, Pakistan
JO  - Science Progress
PY  - 2021
AB  - In this study, the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change has been observed in wetlands comprises of Manchar Lake, Keenjhar Lake, and Chotiari Reservoir in Pakistan over the last four decades from 1972 to 2020. Each wetland has been categorized into four LULC classes; water, natural vegetation, agriculture land, and dry land. Multitemporal Landsat satellite data including; Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used for LULC changes evaluation. The Supervised Maximum-likelihood classifier method is used to acquire satellite imagery for detecting the LULC changes during the whole study period. Soil adjusted vegetation index technique (SAVI) was also used to reduce the effects of soil brightness values for estimating the actual vegetation cover of each study site. Results have shown the significant impact of human activities on freshwater resources by changing the natural ecosystem of wetlands. Change detection analysis showed that the impacts on the land cover affect the landscape of the study area by about 40% from 1972 to 2020. The vegetation cover of Manchar Lake and Keenjhar Lake has been decreased by 6,337.17 and 558.18 ha, respectively. SAVI analysis showed that soil profile is continuously degrading which vigorously affects vegetation cover within the study area. The overall classification accuracy and Kappa statistics showed an accuracy of >90% for all LULC mapping studies. This work demonstrates the LULC changes as a critical monitoring basis for ongoing analyses of changes in land management to enable decision-makers to establish strategies for effectively using land resources. © The Author(s) 2021.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Real time air pollution monitoring is vital in densely populated areas to assess the micro level air pollution. Monitoring the air quality can be useful for providing accurate information to the public and to help policy decision makers to take actions that can improve the quality of air. Monitoring of the pollutants using Internet of Things (IoT) is a cost effective solution. This has the capability to provide high spatial and temporal air pollutants levels depending on the density of the IoT network. In this paper, we present an end to end prototype solution for monitoring of air pollutants. low cost LoraWAN CO2, CO and PM2.5 sensors are used in this prototype application. We also implemented a real time monitoring system using web dashboards with the capability to perform real time analysis using open source software elasticsearch and kibana. A prototype web dashboard showing the real time values of the sensor values along with temperature and humidity values is also developed. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Identifying Suitable Locations For Mangrove Plantation Using Geospatial Information System And Remote Sensing
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2023
AB  - Mangroves provide numerous environmental benefits, such as carbon sequestration, water purification, climate change mitigation, and flood and Tsunami impact reduction. Despite these unique advantages, mangroves are threatened by the combined adverse impacts of human activities and climate change. Therefore, it is essential to implement reasonable practices to avoid further degradation of mangroves and provide efficient workflows to increase their extent. Accordingly, better plantation policies are principally required for their conservation and rehabilitation. In this study, we desired to detect suitable locations for mangrove plantation in coastal areas of Hormozgan Province, Iran. We considered a relatively new Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique to combine ten criteria derived from remote sensing in a GIS environment. The Best Worst Method (BWM), as an MDCM technique, was implemented to determine the relative importance of each criterion. Afterward, all criteria were aggregated using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method to produce a mangrove plantation suitability map. Statistical measures, including Overall Accuracy (OA = 95%), Kappa Coefficient (KC = 87.9%), and Area Under Curve (AUC = 98.79%), indicated the high applicability of the implemented method for mangrove plantation site allocation. The produced map could give managers a profound insight into finding optimal spots to plant mangroves. © Author(s) 2023. CC BY 4.0 License.

TI  - Effect Of Landscape Pattern And Spatial Configuration Of Vegetation Patches On Urban Warming And Cooling In Harare Metropolitan City, Zimbabwe
JO  - GIScience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - The spatial configuration of vegetation patches in the landscape has implications for the provision of ecosystem services, human adaptation to climate change, enhancement, or mitigation of urban heat island. Until recently, the effect of spatial configuration of vegetation to enhance or mitigate urban heat island has received little consideration in urban thermal assessments. This study examines the impact of spatial configuration of vegetation patches on urban thermal warming and cooling in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe. The study used Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat and Sentinel 2 data acquired between 1994 and 2017 to derive detailed information on vegetation patches, landscape metrics, and land surface temperature LST(°C). The spatial configuration of urban vegetation patterns was analyzed using landscape metrics in Fragstats program. Getis Ord Gi* as a Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) was used to characterize the spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. Results of the Getis Ord Gi* showed that clustered vegetation lowers surface temperatures more effectively than dispersed and fragmented patterns of vegetation. The size, density, shape complexity, and cohesion of vegetation patches conferred different levels of cooling but Patch Cohesion Index had the strongest negative relationship with LST(°C) at three spatial resolutions of 10 m (Sentinel 2), 15 m (ASTER) and 30 m (Landsat 8). The Spatial Lag Regression model performed better than the Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis in exploring the relationship between LST(°C) and landscape metrics. Specifically, the Spatial Lag Regression model showed higher R2 values and log likelihood, lower Schwarz criteria, and Akaike information criterion, and reduced spatial autocorrelations. The overall information provides important insights into the provision of larger, connected, and less fragmented urban vegetation patches to derive maximum and higher cooling effects which is critical for urban planning and design approaches for mitigating increasing surface temperatures in cities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Not All Space Debris Is Junk – A Comprehensive Management Strategy For Culturally Significant Spacecraft
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2017
AB  - Space heritage relates to the human exploration of space in the 20th and 21st centuries. It consists of objects and places on the surface of the Earth, in Earth orbit, on other planetary bodies and throughout the solar system. It represents a distinct social and technological phase in human evolution. By far the largest off-earth component of this heritage resides in Earth orbit. Since the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, Earth orbit has become filled with debris – over 23 000 pieces 10 cm and larger, and millions of fragments below this size. The proliferation of space junk has the potential to affect satellite services that the people of Earth rely on to deliver telecommunications, Earth observation, navigation, timing and more. It is widely recognised that some form of active debris removal is needed to secure access to space for the future. However, some of this debris has historic and heritage value. Numerous defunct satellites in Earth orbit have cultural significance for populations of Earth for their historic, aesthetic, scientific and social values as defined by the internationally recognised guidelines of the Burra Charter (2013). Such satellites include Vanguard 1, the oldest human object in space, Telstar 1, the first active telecommunications satellite, and Syncom 3, the first geostationary satellite. For these satellites, protection in situ is an appropriate management strategy if the collision risk is low. A process to protect culturally significant space objects could include an assessment of the nature of the resource, formal and informal heritage lists, an International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) technical committee, and an environmental impact framework. This paper elaborates on mechanisms and concepts necessary for ensuring that some culturally significant spacecraft survive into the future. While heritage is often perceived as a constraint to development, I argues that it can be regarded as an opportunity in Earth orbit with which to test the principles needed in space environmental management and to promote inclusiveness as recommended by the Vienna Declaration (1999). It’s no longer enough to treat space junk as isolated individual units. Viewed as part of an archaeological ‘assemblage’ or cultural ‘spacescape’ which spans variable gravity contexts, culturally significant space artefacts enable end-users on Earth to feel connected to space as the common heritage of humanity.

TI  - Incorporation Of Satellite Remote Sensing Pan-Sharpened Imagery Into Digital Soil Prediction And Mapping Models To Characterize Soil Property Variability In Small Agricultural Fields
JO  - ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Soil prediction models based on spectral indices from some multispectral images are too coarse to characterize spatial pattern of soil properties in small and heterogeneous agricultural lands. Image pan-sharpening has seldom been utilized in Digital Soil Mapping research before. This research aimed to analyze the effects of pan-sharpened (PAN) remote sensing spectral indices on soil prediction models in smallholder farm settings. This research fused the panchromatic band and multispectral (MS) bands of WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and Landsat 8 images in a village in Southern India by Brovey, Gram-Schmidt and Intensity-Hue-Saturation methods. Random Forest was utilized to develop soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil exchangeable potassium (Kex) prediction models by incorporating multiple spectral indices from the PAN and MS images. Overall, our results showed that PAN remote sensing spectral indices have similar spectral characteristics with soil TN and Kex as MS remote sensing spectral indices. There is no soil prediction model incorporating the specific type of pan-sharpened spectral indices always had the strongest prediction capability of soil TN and Kex. The incorporation of pan-sharpened remote sensing spectral data not only increased the spatial resolution of the soil prediction maps, but also enhanced the prediction accuracy of soil prediction models. Small farms with limited footprint, fragmented ownership and diverse crop cycle should benefit greatly from the pan-sharpened high spatial resolution imagery for soil property mapping. Our results show that multiple high and medium resolution images can be used to map soil properties suggesting the possibility of an improvement in the maps’ update frequency. Additionally, the results should benefit the large agricultural community through the reduction of routine soil sampling cost and improved prediction accuracy. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

TI  - Strategies For Monitoring And Managing Mass Populations Of Toxic Cyanobacteria In Recreational Waters: A Multi-Interdisciplinary Approach
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
PY  - 2009
AB  - Mass populations of toxin-producing cyanobacteria commonly develop in fresh-, brackish- and marine waters and effective strategies for monitoring and managing cyanobacterial health risks are required to safeguard animal and human health. A multi-interdisciplinary study, including two UK freshwaters with a history of toxic cyanobacterial blooms, was undertaken to explore different approaches for the identification, monitoring and management of potentially-toxic cyanobacteria and their associated risks. The results demonstrate that (i) cyanobacterial bloom occurrence can be predicted at a local-and national-scale using process-based and statistical models; (ii) cyanobacterial concentration and distribution in waterbodies can be monitored using remote sensing, but minimum detection limits need to be evaluated; (iii) cyanotoxins may be transferred to spray-irrigated root crops; and (iv) attitudes and perceptions towards risks influence the public's preferences and willingness-to-pay for cyanobacterial health risk reductions in recreational waters.

TI  - Geolocation Errors And Correction Of Fy-3b Microwave Radiation Imager Measurements
JO  - Yaogan Xuebao/Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2016
AB  - The geolocation accuracy of meteorological satellites is a key factor in remote-sensing applications. The microwave radiation imager (MWRI) onboard the FengYun (FY)-3B satellite provides measurements of the Earth's atmosphere and surface at 10.65 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, and 89.0 GHz with dual polarization. Although FY-3 MWRI data have been widely distributed to the user community, their geolocation accuracy must be corrected to render the MWRI data useful for quantitative remote sensing. To improve the geolocation accuracy of FY-3B MWRI measurements, a method based on the brightness temperature difference between the ascending and descending orbits is used in the conical scanning MWRI at the 89 GHz channel and called Node Differential Method (NDM). The core principle of the geolocation error correction algorithm is minimizing the number of pixels along the coastlines, where the node difference in brightness temperature is greater than the threshold (20 K) and the distance from the coastlines near the Mediterranean Sea is less than 100 km. In this study, a satellite attitude model (satellite coordinate system) is established based on the vectors of the satellite position and velocity to estimate the satellite attitude angles, and a nonlinear optimization algorithm is used to minimize the objective function. This algorithm can avoid the effect of the tuning order of pitch, roll, and yaw in the traditional method. The satellite attitude offset (i.e., pitch, roll, and yaw) can be derived and further utilized to adjust the satellite attitude. After the satellite attitude angle correction, the geolocation errors in the MWRI at the89 GHz channel are corrected. Results show that the FY-3B MWRI at the 89 GHz channel has the mean offset of the satellite attitude, with the pitch, roll, and yaw angles from January to September of 2015 being -0.220°, 0.068°, and 0.062°, respectively. The mean geolocation error in the along-track direction is approximately 3-4 km, and that in the cross-track direction is less than 1 km at 89 GHz. The geolocation errors are stable during this period. They exist in the Mediterranean Sea, Australia, Red Sea, and Southeast of South America in the MWRI L1 data. The geolocation errors are detected from the high absolute values of brightness temperature difference between the ascending and descending orbits near the coastal regions and from the maps of brightness temperature compared with the coastlines. After geolocation error correction, the MWRI geolocation accuracy is improved at the 89 GHz channel. In this study, the geolocation error correction algorithm is applied to the selected coastal regions from the middle and high latitudes of the north and south hemispheres of Earth. This algorithm can be extended to global measurement correction. The attitudes normally explain the status and stability of the satellite. Although the geolocation error can be corrected by adjusting satellite attitude offset, other factors, such as sensor mounting, uncertainty in the ephemeris data, or timing error, must be considered in future studies to improve geolocation accuracy. © 2016, Science Press.

TI  - A Comprehensive Drought Monitoring Method Integrating Multi-Source Data
JO  - PEERJ
PY  - 2022
AB  - Droughts are the most expensive natural disasters on the planet. As a result of climate change and human activities, the incidence and impact of drought have grown in China. Timely and effective monitoring of drought is crucial for water resource management, drought mitigation, and national food security. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive drought index (YCDI) suitable for the Yellow River Basin using principal component analysis and the entropy weight-AHP method, which integrated a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and standardized water storage index (SWSI). SWSI is calculated by the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), which can more comprehensively reflect the impact of surface water resources on drought (as compared with soil moisture-based indexes). The study results showed that: (1) compared with single drought index, YCDI has stronger ability to monitor drought process. In terms of time scale and drought degree, the monitoring results based on YCDI were similar with data presented in the China Flood and Drought Bulletin and Meteorological Drought Yearbook, reaching similar to 87\% and similar to 69\%, respectively. The correlation between drought intensity and crop harvest area was 0.56. (2) By the combined analysis of the Mann-Kendall test and Moving T test, it was found that the abrupt change of YCDI index at the time of 2009, mainly due to the precipitation in 2009 reached the lowest value in the past 30 years in northern China and extreme high temperature weather. (3) The YCDI of Henan and Shandong provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the basin decreased more significantly, with the maximum value reaching 0.097/yr, while the index in the upper reaches showed an increasing trend with the maximum rate of 0.096/yr. (4) The frequency of mild drought, moderate drought, severe drought and extreme drought in the Yellow River basin during the study period was 15.84\%, 12.52\%, 4.03\% and 0.97\%, respectively. Among them, the highest frequency of droughts occurred in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia and central Shaanxi provinces. Drought causation in the Yellow River basin is more influenced by human activities than climate change in the middle and lower reaches, while climate change is the main factor in the upper reaches. Overall, YCDI is a reliable indicator for monitoring the spatial and temporal evolution of drought in the Yellow River basin, and it can be used for monitoring soil moisture changes and vegetation dynamics, which can provide scientific guidance for regional drought governance.

TI  - Faa International Workshops On Commercial Space Transportation
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2017
AB  - With the emergence of suborbital space transportation, an increase in demand to launch small satellites, and renewed overall interest in the commercial space sector, regulations from the United States Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST) are viewed by other countries as a model to adopt. The FAA has authorized over 310 licensed and permit commercial launches since 1989. As part of international cooperation, the FAA has invited government representatives from several countries to attend specialized regulatory workshops in Washington, DC. Workshops are typically one to two days of detailed briefings by FAA/AST that describe how FAA safety regulations work along with the law and philosophies behind them, and overall give visiting governments the opportunity to ask questions and learn from FAA experience. Each workshop is tailored to individual needs of the visiting government. Many countries are trying to attract suborbital Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs) and develop a launch site ("spaceport"). Other countries are interested in how the FAA regulates Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs) or want to compare FAA regulations to ongoing privatization efforts. Several countries are developing new legislation for commercial space transportation. A typical workshop covers a variety of FAA regulatory topics such as: RLV licensing and experimental permits, system safety, risk analysis, environmental compliance, inspection, liability and financial responsibility, safety approvals, launch site licensing, human space flight recommended practices, mishaps, and air and space integration. Since 2009, FAA has conducted workshops for seven different countries and one for the European Aviation Safety Agency. The FAA is promoting its regulations for international adoption with a major goal of interoperability. Under U.S. law, any U.S. launch or reentry operated by a U.S. company outside the United States has to be licensed by the FAA. This paper will describe FAA workshops, FAA international outreach activity, and benefits from workshops as countries evaluate future interoperability in commercial space transportation.

TI  - Microscale Spatial Distribution And Health Assessment Of Pm<Sub>2.5</Sub>-Bound Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (Pahs) At Nine Communities In Xi'an, China
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
PY  - 2016
AB  - Spatial variability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was investigated in Xi'an, China, in summer of 2013. Sixteen priority PAHs were quantified in 24-h integrated air samples collected simultaneously at nine urban and suburban communities. The total quantified PAHs mass concentrations ranged from 32.4 to 104.7 ng m(-3), with an average value of 57.1 +/- 23.0 ng m(-3). PAHs were observed higher concentrations at suburban communities (average: 86.3 ng m(-3)) than at urban ones (average: 48.8 ng m(-3)) due to a better enforcement of the pollution control policies at the urban scale, and meanwhile the disorganized management of motor vehicles and massive building constructions in the suburbs. Elevated PAH levels were observed in the industrialized regions (west and northwest of Xi'an) from Kriging interpolation analysis. Satellite-based visual interpretations of land use were also applied for the supporting the spatial distribution of PAHs among the communities. The average benzo{[}a]pyrene-equivalent toxicity (Sigma{[}BaP](eq)) at the nine communities was 6.9 +/- 2.2 ng m(-3) during the sampling period, showing a generally similar spatial distribution to PAHs levels. On average, the excess inhalation lifetime cancer risk derived from Sigma{[}BaP](eq) indicated that eight persons per million of community residents would develop cancer due to PM2.5-bound PAHs exposure in Xi'an. The great in-city spatial variability of PAHs confirmed the importance of multiple points sampling to conduct exposure health risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landscape Fires Disproportionally Affect High Conservation Value Temperate Peatlands, Meadows, And Deciduous Forests, But Only Under Low Moisture Conditions
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Landscape fires are a natural component of the Earth System. However, they are of growing global concern due to cli-mate change exacerbating their multiple impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, carbon storage, human health, econo-mies, and wider society. Temperate regions are predicted to be at greatest risk of increasing fire activity due to climate change, where fires can seriously impact important ecosystems for biodiversity and carbon storage, such as peatlands and forests. There is insufficient literature on the background prevalence, distribution, and drivers of fires in these regions, especially within Europe, to assess and mitigate their risks. Using a global database of fire patches based on the MODIS FireCCI51 product, we address this knowledge gap by quantifying the current prevalence and size of fires in Polesia, a 150,000 km2 area comprising a mosaic of peatland, forest, and agricultural habitats in north-ern Ukraine and southern Belarus. Between 2001 and 2019, fires burned 31,062 km2 of land, and were most frequent in spring and autumn. Although most fires started in agricultural land, fires disproportionately affected natural and semi-natural land cover types, particularly in protected areas. Over one fifth of protected land burned. Coniferous for-ests were the most common land cover type in protected areas, but fires mostly occurred in meadows, open peatlands (especially fen and transition mires), and native deciduous forests. These land cover types were highly susceptible to fires under low soil moisture conditions, but the risk of fire was low under average or higher soil moisture conditions. Restoring and maintaining natural hydrological regimes could be an effective nature-based solution to increase the re-silience of fire-vulnerable ecosystems and support global biodiversity and carbon storage commitments under the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change and Convention on Biological Diversity.

TI  - Reframing Agrarian Citizenship: Land, Life And Power In Brazil
JO  - Journal of Rural Studies
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper investigates the changing relationship between land, citizenship, and power in Brazil, where land-related policies have historically served to situate political and economic rights in the hands of an elite land-owning minority. In response, contemporary grassroots movements in Brazil, including the Landless Rural Workers Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, or MST) advocate the substantive transformation of what I develop here as a new form of "agrarian citizenship", in which political participation, local food production, and environmental stewardship redefine the ongoing constitution of the relationship between land, state, and rural society. Based on extensive interviews, participant observation and document analysis from 2004-2006, this ethnographic study examines the contours of how changing notions of agrarian citizenship are negotiated among members of a growing body of social groups demanding land redistribution and reasserting agrarian culture in Brazil. By developing and enacting new forms of political participation that involve the transformation of personal and collective values and practices, rural activists such as the MST envision the redistribution of land as a material right, but also view the transformation of the land-society relation as an equally public responsibility. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Marine And Coastal Sensitivity Mapping For Oil Spill Preparedness And Response
JO  - Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE European HSE Conference and Exhibition 2013: Health, Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility in the Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Industry
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper summarises the approaches used for desk-based sensitivity mapping and the alignment with international best practice guidelines. The primary focus is on available data sources for developing a robust baseline database and how these can be made accessible through interactive Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools. The conclusions focus on the benefits of sharing information and key lessons learned for developing these collaboration tools. Based on the most recent IMO/IPIECA sensitivity mapping guidelines this paper outlines a staged approach to sensitivity assessment. Initial desk-based mapping and sensitivity classification draws on existing data sources and remote sensing interpretation, which subsequently informs more detailed field surveys. This approach enables rapid assessment of potentially sensitive locations to provide an immediate overview of risks, ahead of targeted field assessments to fill data gaps in support of the contingency planning process. A key tool for successfully implementing these projects has been the use of GIS. In addition to providing the analytic tools and central data and document repository, web-based GIS viewers provide instant access to project data and metadata from any location. Web editing tools enable planners and response personnel to plot and share proposed locations for response resources (e.g. staging areas) during the response planning stage. This approach dramatically reduces reliance on traditional paper mapping during planning stages while still allowing responders to produce field maps for working in a response situation. In the wake of the Deep-water Horizon incident many oil and gas operators are re-examining their risk exposure with regard to potential accidental oil spill incidents. In many instances this now includes consideration of larger potential impact zones resulting from a worst case oil spill scenario. Key to successful planning is understanding where the potential sensitive coastal and offshore environmental and socio-economic resources are, and communicating these effectively to incident management specialists, regulatory agencies and other stakeholders.

JO  - Acta Theriologica Sinica
PY  - 2011
AB  - Among the order Carnivora, the giant panda [Ailuropoda melarwleuca) is one of the most attractive animals, possessing high value for scientific research and being a symbol of worldwide nature conservation. In early 1980s, the Chinese government, cooperating with the WWF in initiated a research project on wild giant pandas in Wolong Nature Reserve. Since then, extensive research activities have been conducted in different mountain ranges inhabited by the animal. The application of new techniques such as 3S (GIS, RS, GPS) and molecular markers in the ecological study of the giant panda has greatly improved our understanding of its ecology. To date, a huge body of knowledge and information has been accumulated, potentially helpful for developing adaptive conservation strategies. In this paper, we summarize research findings and progress in understanding the ecology of wild giant pandas during the past 30 years on various aspects, including habitat ecology, feeding ecology, reproductive ecology, behavioral ecology, molecular ecology, population ecology and community ecology. Meanwhile, given the demands of research and management, future research directions are suggested.

TI  - European And International Policy Drivers In Water Scenarios For Copernicus Exploitation
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2022
AB  - Hydrology-related activities are provided by all six Copernicus Services. However, the European Commission discovered that this method makes it difficult to gain a full picture of the global water cycle. As a result, the consortium 'Water Scenarios for Copernicus Exploitation' (Water-ForCE) proposed creating a Roadmap for Copernicus water services. The Roadmap will provide a user- and stakeholder-driven concept for water services by examining the growing demands, as well as the possibilities given by existing and anticipated capabilities. To understand this, the project assesses whether existing services can satisfy current policy objectives. As a result, the paper identifies the indicators contained in policy and law for monitoring, reporting, and assessing the adoption of Earth Observation (EO) services, as well as the barriers to their implementation. The paper examines policies from two perspectives: first, from the perspective of space policy and how it drives Copernicus implementation in public domains such as water; and second, from the perspective of specific documentation from the water, agriculture, and environmental sectors to see how they can drive Copernicus uptake for monitoring efficient water use, its quality and quantity. The research looks into European Union (EU) laws as well as international treaties, United Nations instruments, and World Bank strategies. The paper concludes that water concerns are well represented in EU policy in general, although EO data as a tool of monitoring is included in just a few water-related policy instruments. Simultaneously, in other sectors that are inextricably intertwined with water consumption, new EU rules are being designed to take into account the availability of satellite imagery, which considerably adds to monitoring efforts. Notably, present water instruments supporting the use of space technology are mainly non-binding and do not necessitate government compliance. As a result, a new approach is required, as it is currently difficult for diverse user communities to identify relevant Copernicus services to effectively use them for socio-economic benefits. Therefore, it is advised to specify in further regulations the outcomes that must be accomplished while leaving states free to decide how to incorporate these objectives into national laws. This will not stifle innovation by prescribing stringent monitoring systems, but will instead outline the intended results. Copyright © 2022 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

PY  - 2018
AB  - Floods have always posed great threat to human settlements, and their monitoring has always been a very important step in the understanding, managing and predicting similar, future events, in order to mitigate flood risk and the concrete impact it has on communities and the environment. Modern techniques of analysing flood extent include remote sensing, by extracting flood limits from satellite imagery, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which are used in tandem, to generate cartographic material, depicting areas suffering from flood damage. Unfortunately, the results are not always precise, and can induce significant errors, due to which, the results are questionable and cannot be efficiently included in management plans, by authorities. The current study addresses the validation process of digitally generated GIS layers, based on statistical data derived from hydrological field recordings, with satellite images that reveal the proper flood extents, from the same time period, as the case study flash flood. The emphasis was put on comparing absolute and relative accuracy values, in order to validate several results, such as digital, HEC-RAS generated water levels (based on statistical analysis) with recorded water levels; 5% recurrence interval flood extents of HEC-RAS model, correlated withreal-world flood extent, and through satellite imagery. © 2018, Scibulcom Ltd.

TI  - Atmospheric Effects On Long Stand-Off Hsi Applications
PY  - 2016
AB  - Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is finding utility in many new areas, such as environmental and agricultural monitoring, medicine and food technology, industrial inspection, land management, and defense usage, due to its ability to simultaneously collect both spatial and spectral information. Within the tropical environment the utility of HSI has been demonstrated through various rain forest and coastal environmental programs. System performance for all HSI systems is influenced by many factors, including environmental conditions, operational usage, internal system composition and the processing chain. Truly optimizing this performance requires an understanding of the operational conditions under which each system will perform. One of the key factors affecting system performance, especially at long stand-off ranges, is the atmospheric effects. This paper presents analytical results demonstrating the effects of atmospheric conditions on long stand-off airborne HSI systems based on a Raytheon developed performance model for estimating System performance. This end-to-end System Performance Model is especially designed for long stand-off airborne detection with large off-nadir viewing angles. It takes into account most of the components within the entire imaging chain. The model divides the end-to-end imaging chain into three parts: the environmental component, the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and the imaging system effects. The environmental component includes solar illumination, reflectance of materials on the ground, scattering, and atmospheric transmittance. The system component includes the effects of system noise and throughput. The CONOPS accounts for the various operating conditions best suited for long stand-off detection. The analytical results presented in this paper provide details on the influence of the atmospheric conditions, including tropical conditions, on NESR and SNR performance in a Spot Mode CONOPS for a HSI system based on the end-to-end System Performance Model. These results are based on continued work developed from the "Long stand-off Performance Modelling of HSI Airborne Imaging Systems".

JO  - Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association
PY  - 1998
AB  - A satellite endoscopy service was formally established in late January 1997 in one peripheral hospital, a second service commencing in April 1997, and a third in December 1997. More than 500 patients underwent gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures at these satellite services during 1997. The feedback received to date indicates that the establishment of this service is supported by patients and the peripheral hospitals. It is expected that this project will achieve all its stated objectives. In addition, the implementation of this service will assist in improved waiting list management at Royal Perth Hospital. The satellite endoscopy service is a unique development in Western Australia and has demonstrated definite benefits to patients in less than six months of operation.

TI  - Surface Water Deficiency Zoning Of China Based On Surface Water Deficit Index (Swdi)
JO  - WATER RESOURCES
PY  - 2014
AB  - China's economic and social development is severely restricted by regional water deficiency, and the determination of water deficiency level in different regions is an important basis of water resource management. In this study, we zoned 32 provinces of China into five surface water deficiency levels based on surface water deficit index derived from the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-2C images. The result shows that China is facing serious water shortage crisis with only 15.44\% of total area without water deficiency, which is located in the south and southeast coast. More than 60\% of total area of China suffered from severe or extremely water deficiency, which are mainly distributed in western and northern regions. Jingjinji area (namely Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province), which is a special region with high amount of gross domestic product and relative abundant water resources, is suffering from severe water deficiency. It revealed that water resources were interacted with regional development and water management should consider local conditions. To Jingjinji area, water management should focus on adjustment of industrial structure, urban expansion control and scientific water resources allocation. In general, the surface water deficit index based water deficiency zoning will be of significant value to be applied in water resources management at regional scales.

TI  - Pointnet++ Transfer Learning For Tree Extraction From Mobile Lidar Point Clouds
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2023
AB  - Trees are an essential part of the natural and urban environment due to providing crucial benefits such as increasing air quality and wildlife habitats. Therefore, various remote sensing and photogrammetry technologies, including Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS), have been recently introduced for precise 3D tree mapping and modeling. The MLS provides densely 3D LiDAR point clouds from the surrounding, which results in measuring applicable information of trees like stem diameter or elevation. In this paper, a transfer learning procedure on the PointNet++ has been proposed for tree extraction. Initially, two steps of converting the MLS point clouds into same-length smaller sections and eliminating ground points have been conducted to overcome the massive volume of MLS data. The algorithm was tested on four LiDAR datasets ranging from challengeable urban environments containing multiple objects like tall buildings to railway surroundings. F1-Score accuracy was gained at around 93% and 98%, which showed the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Noticeably, the algorithms also measured geometrical information of extracted trees such as 2D coordinate space, height, stem diameter, and 3D boundary tree locations. © Author(s) 2023.

TI  - Novel Deep Learning Framework For Imputing Holes In Orthorectified Vhr Images
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2023
AB  - Many downstream applications, such as agricultural monitoring, damage assessments, and urban planning, have benefited from remote sensing imagery. Ortho image generation from very high-resolution images has unpleasant side effects in places of building occlusions leaving holes in the orthorectified images. As a result, blank pixels caused by orthorectification must be filled in prior to downstream tasks such as machine learning. In this paper, we present a new deep learning architecture based on Wide Activation Super Resolution (WDSR) network combined with an Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) based style transfer for imputing holes (missing pixels) in orthorectified images. To test and validate the performance of imputation algorithms, we developed a new multi-resolution benchmark dataset consisting of WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 images. Our experiments show that the WDSR framework outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods and the Ordinary Kriging method. Our proposed method has improved the mean squared error (MSE) by at least 12.54% in comparison to existing SOTA methods. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing For Assessing The Spatiotemporal Changes Of The Ecological State Of The Agricultural Lands In Armenia
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2023
AB  - Proper management and monitoring of the ecological condition of natural feeders are crucial for both the economy and natural environments. Armenia is no exception, and addressing this issue requires comprehensive studies combining traditional methods with remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing in agriculture utilizes various sensors and technologies to collect data about crops, soil conditions, and agricultural parameters from a distance. This study focuses on the utilization of remote sensing, including satellite imagery, to assess the ecological state of grasslands and pastures in the Syunik administrative district of Armenia. Over a 22-year period (2000-2021), the study utilized Landsat series (5,7,8) multispectral optical images processed through Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of vegetation health. The results reveal favorable trends in vegetation health across the study regions, as indicated by consistently positive Z-values in the Seasonal Mann-Kendall test. While no significant trends were observed in some areas, others showed improvements in biomass conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the resilience and health of grasslands and pastures in the Sisian and Goris regions, offering a basis for targeted interventions and strategies to preserve these ecosystems for future generations. © Author(s) 2023.

TI  - User's Cognitive-Behavior-Based Preference Access Under Disease-Specific Online Medical Inquiry Text Mining
JO  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Substantial real cases can be formed from disease-specific online medical inquiry texts. Therefore, user preferences can constitute potentially rich commercial medical value and provide decision support for medical service recommendations. It is necessary to mine user preferences in disease-specific online medical inquiry texts. However, user preferences will change with cognitive behavior decisions in the context of disease-specific inquiry texts. More importantly, the context of disease-specific online inquiry texts in which user preferences are located will affect users' cognitive behavior decisions in real time. However, the existing preference access methods have relatively low precision since they fail to consider the inherent connection between different users' cognitive behaviors in various contexts and their preferences. We expanded the contextual perception preference model to propose a cognitive-behavior-based method to assess user preference. The contextual information (in online medical inquiry texts on various disease topics) and the impacts of user and text attributes on their cognitive behaviors were abstracted into concept models (including level, usefulness, risk, and effectiveness cognition) to obtain the mutual influences and adjusted relationships. Moreover, more accurate user cognition references were obtained within the multidimensional text space and multidimensional disease space. Based on a large-volume real-world dataset, our experiments revealed the AP@R as the evaluation standard. The method proposed in this article, compared with the contextual perception and ELPCAP algorithms, significantly improves the precision of preference prediction after the addition of cognitive behaviors, suggesting that the method can effectively mine the user cognitive behavior-preference relationships.

TI  - Talking Space: The European Commission's Changing Frames In Defining Galileo
JO  - SPACE POLICY
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper traces the way in which the European Commission has framed and reframed the issue of EU satellite navigation over 20 years. It investigates how the EU's agenda-setter has 'talked about' space policy, with a particular focus on Galileo, and how its own institutional discourse - as revealed in its communications throughout the agenda-setting stage of Galileo's 'definition' phase - evolved in the 1990s through the use of 'frame sets'. In so doing, it illustrates the ways in which, over time, the EU's executive has 'projected' the issue of independent satellite navigation capabilities as being politically and economically desirable for Europe, and has sought to persuade decision makers of its cross-policy relevance and potential economic, social and security benefits. The article deconstructs official documents and engages in a close-up analysis of policy formulation, to identify nascent, evolving and mature frames in the definition of Galileo.

TI  - Rs-Gis Based Fuzzy Evaluation Of Landscape Visual Sensitivity Of Three Gorges Of Yangtze River
JO  - Tongji Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Tongji University
PY  - 2008
AB  - Based on Landsat ETM+ and SPOT image taken in 2002, other chart or text information and field investigation, spatial attribute database for landscape evaluation indices in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River (Chongqing Areas) of China is established with geographical information system (GIS) technique. The evaluation model of the landscape visual sensitivity of the valley is defined on the basis of fuzzy mathematics theory, the degrees of membership of each single index are obtained using map algebra of GIS, and fuzzy relationship matrix is set up for each grid as well. The weight value distribution set of evaluation indices is established by means of Delphi investigation procedure. In order to get a combined index representing the degree of membership of the various factors for each grid, weight-operation is conducted on each index of the specific sensitive level with GIS grid calculator, and then the landscape visual sensitivity is determined for each grid following the maximum principle. The results show that landscape visual sensitivity can be classified into four levels in Three Gorges of the Yangtze River (Chongqing Areas), of which the first-sensitivity-level (the highest sensitive) area accounts for 2.38% in the region; the landscape visual sensitivity is strongly related to the horizontal distance form a viewer; and generally, the well-known landscapes have higher landscape visual sensitivity. Finally, this paper presents some strategies and measures for landscape protection, conservation management, and planning and design.

TI  - Temporal And Spatial Variations Of Mangroves And Their Driving Factors In Southeast Asia
JO  - Tropical Geography
PY  - 2023
AB  - Mangroves are woody wetland communities that grow in the intertidal zones of tropical and subtropical coasts and are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. Mangroves provide important support for coastal ecological and environmental protection, social development, and economic progress. Those found in Southeast Asia are a key portion of global mangroves. The study of spatiotemporal changes of mangrove forests and their driving factors in Southeast Asia can provide a theoretical basis and supportive evidence for the scientific protection and effective management of mangrove ecosystems. Based on the cloud computing platform of the Google Earth Engine, Landsat satellite data, and mangrove distribution data sets, combined with the Theil-Sen median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test methods, this study analyzed the spatial variation trend of mangroves in Southeast Asia from 1990 to 2020. A factor detector and an interaction detector in the geographic detector method were used to quantitatively analyze the driving factors. First, the results showed that, from 1990 to 2020, the overall mangrove area in Southeast Asia showed a downward trend, with an area reduction of 1,467,883.1 hm2 and an annual average loss rate of 1.1%. According to the statistics of the mangrove area change rate based on cellular network data, the total loss of mangrove area was as high as 40.11%. Of the total mangrove area, the regions with a change rate between -99% and -50% accounted for 28.57%, regions with a change rate between -49% and -5% accounted for 8.79%, and regions with a change rate between -4% and -1% accounted for only 13.95%. Regions with a change rate between 1% and 99% accounted for 8.18%. Only 0.4% of the mangrove area remained unchanged. The regions with increased mangrove area were primarily distributed in the Philippines, western and eastern Indonesia, and northern Vietnam. Second, the improvement and degradation of mangroves in Southeast Asia showed a concomitant distribution from 1990 to 2020. The degradation area of mangroves (79.25%) was much larger than the improvement area (20.32%) in Southeast Asia. Specifically, the significantly degraded areas accounted for 31.58%, the slightly degraded areas accounted for 47.67%, the significantly improved areas accounted for 4.75%, the slightly improved areas accounted for 15.57%, and only 0.42% of the area remained stable. Finally, the increase in aquaculture pond area was the main driving factor for mangrove area decline, with q values above 30%. Additionally, the shortest distance of mangroves from roads and population changes also had significant effects on the decline of mangrove area. The average annual temperature, precipitation, and topography had a relatively low degree of influence on mangrove changes. The results of the interaction detector indicated that all factors showed interaction enhancement, and the interaction between the culture tank and other factors was significantly stronger than that between other factors. The single factors with relatively weak driving force, such as average annual rainfall, temperature, and topography, had a significantly stronger influence on the interaction with other factors and showed a nonlinear enhancement effect. © 2023 TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY.

TI  - Analysis Of Spatial-Temporal Changes In Landscape Fragmentation In The Ningxia Yellow River Valley
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2016
AB  - Landscape fragmentation is the result of the transformation of large habitat patches into smaller and more isolated fragments. Fragmentation greatly affects the structure and function of the landscape ecosystem. It is necessary to quantify the degree of landscape fragmentation to optimize regional development planning and decision-making in an ecological manner. Effective mesh size (meff), which is based on the probability that two points chosen randomly in a region are connected (i.e., located in the same patch), can be used to quantify landscape fragmentation. The Ningxia Yellow River Valley, located in arid and semi-arid regions, accounts for most of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and its fragmentation may have great significance to the eco-environmental safety of Northwest China. We investigated landscape fragmentation based on Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques using meff and multi-temporal land use data. Quantitative analysis revealed that the degree of landscape fragmentation of the entire Ningxia Yellow River Valley was higher in 2010 than in 1985, corresponding to a decline in the meff from 6326.62 km2in 1985 to 2974.32 km2 in 2010. The meff of seven sub-basins in the Ningxia Yellow River Valley indicated that the Huangzuo area had the highest degree of fragmentation in both 1985 and 2010. Furthermore, the degree of landscape fragmentation in all sub-basins increased from 1985 to 2010, except in the Yellow River Water Irrigation Area. The expansion of the built-up areas and farmland in the Yellow River Water Irrigation Area simplified the landscape in contrast with the more complex landscapes in other sub-basins. Based on the semi-variable function and moving window method, the characteristic scale for analyzing landscape fragmentation heterogeneity in the Ningxia Yellow River Valley was 4500 m. The spatial heterogeneity of landscape fragmentation indicated that the area with high fragmentation values was larger than the area with low fragmentation values both in 1985 and 2010. The area with high landscape fragmentation values was mostly distributed in the south and mid-east of the Ningxia Yellow River Valley. The spatial variation of highly fragmented areas was higher in scope and degree in 2010 than in 1985, and spatial heterogeneity exhibited a similar change. In terms of elevation, landscape fragmentation below 2400 m was greater than that of areas higher than 2400 m above sea level. Moreover, the degree of landscape fragmentation decreased with increase in elevation above 2400 m. In addition, landscape fragmentation heterogeneity was related to anthropogenic disturbance—the zone 1000—1500 m away from buildings had the highest degree of fragmentation. The change in landscape fragmentation from 1985 to 2010 was mostly affected by human activities. The results provide valuable guidance for further studies on landscape pattern optimization and efficient management of land use in Northwest China. © 2016. Shengtai Xuebao Acta Ecologica Sinica.

TI  - Tadpoles Assay: Its Application To A Water Toxicity Assessment Of A Polluted Urban River
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2001
AB  - The acute toxicity assay with premetamorphic tadpoles of Bufo arenarum as sentinel organism was applied to evaluate the quality of two water samples taken from three sites of the Reconquista River, an urban watercourse which is recipient of both untreated industrial effluents and domestic wastes. The results of the 96 hr bioassays were compared with the physicochemical parameters determined in the samples. Mortality rates in each sample were compared using the Bonferroni's test and a stepwise regression analysis of mortality and physicochemical parameters was done. In this way, it was possible to build up consistent descriptive models which showed that pH, Cl-, Cd2+ and Cu2+ concentrations in the river water were significant independent variables and might explain, under the experimental conditions, the recorded toxicity effects of the tested samples. Because of its simplicity, low cost and reliability it was suggested the tadpoles bioassay be included in the set of tests used in integrated program of freshwater pollution.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Nitrogen Dioxide (No2) From Sentinel-5p Imageries Using Google Earth Engine Changes During The Covid-19 Social Restriction Policy In Jakarta
JO  - Natural Hazards Research
PY  - 2023
AB  - The number of cases due to COVID-19 is increasing, especially in Jakarta, requiring the government to establish a policy of social restrictions. The policy impacting the mobility of people using motor vehicles becomes limited, affecting air quality such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). NO2 concentrations can be determined using the Sentinel-5P satellite using Google Earth Engine. This study analyzed NO2 changes and people's mobility in residential and workplace categories through google mobility data in Jakarta spatially and temporally for January 2020 to December 2021. The Pearson's correlation (R) between NO2 from Sentinel-5P imageries and air quality monitoring stations was 0.426–0.736, indicating a moderate to strong correlation with a p-value <0.05. The decrease in NO2 occurred at the beginning of the Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) from April 2020 to May 2020 and the Implementation of Restrictions on Social Activities (PPKM) policy from July 2021 to August 2021; it was −11.381 ​μmol/m2 and -23.195 ​μmol/m2, with very low and low mobility in the residential and workplace categories. The area that experienced a change in NO2 increase of 1 ​μmol/m2, the highest occurred from May 2021 to June 2021 ​at 641.571 ​km2. Meanwhile, from November 2020 to December 2020, no area experienced an increase of 1 ​μmol/m2. We discovered that there were a number of anomalies when people's mobility in the residential and workplace category was very high, NO2 actually decreased. This anomaly shows that the decrease in NO2 is influenced by decreased mobility and other factors such as precipitation. © 2023 National Institute of Natural Hazards, Ministry of Emergency Management of China

TI  - Did It Increase Energy Consumption? A Difference-In-Differences Evaluation Of A Rural Electrification Policy In Gujarat, India Using Night-Time Lights Data
JO  - Energy Policy
PY  - 2023
AB  - Electricity access is an important issue and building capacity for it requires drawing relevant lessons from past policies. In this study, we evaluate the effect of the Jyotigram Yojana, or the lighted village scheme, a supply-side policy intervention during 2003–08 to increase rural electricity access in Gujarat, India. We hypothesize that policy implementation is associated with increased electricity consumption. To test this hypothesis, we exploit variation in the timing of policy implementation at the village level, and use a generalized difference-in-differences strategy for identification. Further, we use night-time luminosity measured through remote sensing as a proxy for electricity consumption, and control for weather, village fixed effect, year fixed effect, and village or administrative block specific time trend. We find that while the overall effect of the policy on night-time luminosity was not statistically significant, the effects were likely heterogeneous, with the night-time luminosity increasing in some districts after policy implementation and decreasing in others. We conclude that the policy might have had a re-distributive effect on electricity access or consumption and recommend adopting a more holistic approach – incorporating both supply-side and demand-side measures – to increase electricity access. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Accurate estimation of daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) concentration is a prerequisite to address environmental public health issues, and satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been widely used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using statistical-based or machine learning-based models. However, statistical-based models oversimplify the AOD-PM2.5 relationships, whereas complex machine learning technologies ignore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the predictors and demonstrate shortage in interpretation. Besides, large AOD data gaps resulting in PM2.5 estimation biases have been seldom imputed in previous studies, especially at national scales. To fill the above research gaps, this study attempts to present a feasible methodology to estimate daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 concentrations in China. The AOD data gaps across China were first imputed via a random forest (RF) model. Then, an interpretable self-adaptive deep neural network (SADNN) model, incorporating AOD, meteorological and other auxiliary predictors, was developed to estimate daily spatially-continuous PM2.5 concentrations from 2017 to 2018. Five-fold sample (site)-based cross-validation results showed a high accuracy of the SADNN model, with coefficient of determination and root mean square error values equal to 0.86 (0.84) and 13.07 (14.30) μg/m3, respectively, outperforming the standard DNN and the RF model. Furthermore, the SADNN model identified the spatiotemporal patterns of predictor importance, and demonstrated that the boundary layer height, elevation and AOD were the most important predictors both spatially and temporally. And the predictor importance in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was different from that in the rest of China. These results enhance our understanding of AOD-PM2.5 relationships and elucidate the estimated PM2.5 datasets with complete coverage are applicable for related air pollution studies and epidemiological cohort studies. Moreover, considering the effective nonlinear model capability and interpretability, the SADNN model is beneficial for not only PM2.5 estimation but also other earth data and scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution And The Influencing Factors Of Pm2.5 In China Between 2000 And 2011
JO  - Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica
PY  - 2017
AB  - High concentration of PM2.5 has been universally considered as a main cause for haze formation. Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors of PM2.5 concentration for the purpose of regional air quality control and management. Using PM2.5 data from 2000 to 2011 that is inversed from NASA atmospheric remote sensing images, and employing the methods in geo-statistics, geographic detectors and geo-spatial analysis, this paper reveals the spatio-temporal evolution patterns and driving factors of PM2.5 concentration in China. The main findings are as follows: (1) In general, the average concentration of PM2.5 in China has increased quickly and reached its peak value in the year of 2006; after that, it has been maintained at around 22.47-28.26 μg/m3. (2) PM2.5 is strikingly uneven in China, with a higher concentration in North and East than in South and West, respectively. In particular, the areas with a relatively high concentration of PM2.5 are mainly the four regions including the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, the Lower Yangtze River Delta Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Taklimakan Desert. Among them, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region has the highest concentration of PM2.5. (3) The center of gravity of PM2.5 has shown an overall eastward movement trend, which indicates an increasingly serious haze in eastern China. Particularly, the center of gravity of high-value PM2.5 is kept on moving eastward, while that of the low-value PM2.5 moves westward. (4) The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a significantly positive spatial correlation. The "High-High" PM2.5 agglomeration areas include the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, Fenhe-Weihe River Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Jianghan plain regions. The "Low-Low" PM2.5 agglomeration areas include Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang to the north of the Great Wall, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Taiwan, Hainan and Fujian and other southeast coastal and island areas. (5) Geographic detection analysis indicates that both natural and human factors account for the spatial variations of PM2.5 concentration. In particular, factors such as natural geographical location, population density, automobile quantity, industrial discharge and straw burning are the main driving forces of PM2.5 concentration in China. © 2017, Science Press.

TI  - Assessing The Potential Of Rural Settlement Land Consolidation In China: A Method Based On Comprehensive Evaluation Of Restricted Factors
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2018
AB  - Rural settlement land consolidation potential calculation is the basic work of land consolidation. An accurate potential is essential to rural development planners and policy makers as a project target or prediction. The traditional calculation methods include the per capita/household construction land method, idle rural residential land method, and comprehensive evaluation method. Though there have been some improvements, the potential for calculation methods on a national level is still limited. This article illustrates a new method for calculating the consolidation potential of rural settlement land, based on field data and the restructuring restrictions applicable to each rural land parcel in China. The field data was from Shandong Province because it lies within the country's biggest grain-producing area with the largest distribution density of rural settlements. It is an excellent representative sample for rural settlement land consolidation, offering a microcosm of rural development in China. For the study's comprehensive evaluation system, due to the lack of nationwide field survey data, the potential of Shandong Province was chosen as the standard value. We selected indicators concerning land resources, depopulation, transportation accessibility, local economic development, urbanization, and natural conditions to build an evaluation system. We then calculated the potential of each province according to their coefficients and field data from Shandong Province. Every province except Taiwan (for which no data were available) was divided into five zones for rural settlement land consolidation: the most-suitable zone, suitable zone, general zone, restricted zone, and most-restricted zone. The total rate of land consolidation is estimated at 0.24 for 2010 and forecast at 0.33 for 2020, while those years' respective consolidation potentials are 32,777.92 km(2) and 44,707.81 km(2). The rate is the total rural settlement land before land consolidation divided by added cultivated land after consolidation. The higher the rate, more effective the land consolidation is.

TI  - A Joint Industry Programme To Improve Oil Spill Response In The Arctic
JO  - Arctic Technology Conference 2016
PY  - 2016
AB  - Results from hundreds of studies, laboratory and basin experiments and field trials conducted worldwide over the past 50 years, in particular in the United States, Canada and Scandinavia, show that the industry has a wide range of viable technologies, beyond mechanical recovery, for oil spill response in the presence of ice in open water. To continue to build on this existing research and improve the technologies and methodologies for Arctic oil spill response, nine international oil and gas companies (BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni, ExxonMobil, North Caspian Operating Company, Shell, Statoil, and Total) are working collaboratively in the Arctic Oil Spill Response Technology - Joint Industry Programme (JIP). The JIP has brought together the world's foremost experts on oil spill response research, development, and operations from across industry, academia, and independent research centres to undertake the technical work and scientific studies. The core areas of research are: dispersants, environmental effects, trajectory modelling, remote sensing, mechanical recovery, and in situ burning (ISB) in Arctic and ice-prone regions. Significant work is committed to developing a robust information database that will support the use of Net Environmental Benefit Analysis for response decision-making and environmental impact assessments related to the Arctic environment. Phase one of the JIP is complete and seventeen research reports dedicated to literature and state-of-theart reviews are available on the JIP website (www.arcticresponsetechnology.org). This initial phase identified specifically targeted research projects to improve industry capabilities and coordination in the area of Arctic oil spill response. Phase two activities actively underway include dispersant effectiveness testing; modelling the fate of dispersed oil in ice; assessing the environmental effects of an Arctic oil spill; advancing oil spill trajectory modelling capabilities in ice; extending the capability to detect and map oil in darkness, low visibility, in and under ice; and expanding the 'window of opportunity' for ISB response operations. The JIP is committed to sharing information with the public on the progress and results of its projects with the objective of improving Arctic spill response capabilities.

TI  - Hydrochemical Properties Of Groundwater And Land Use And Land Cover Changes Impact On Agricultural Productivity: An Empirical Observation And Integrated Framework Approaches
JO  - Journal of Geochemical Exploration
PY  - 2024
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics of the Bankura district effect groundwater resources and agricultural productivity, particularly the expansion of urban land, discharge of fertiliser mixed water from agriculture and reduction of scrubland. This study investigates the Spatio-temporal relation between groundwater qualities (GWQ), LULC and agricultural productivity of the Bankura district in 2009 and 2020. The twelve standard water qualities parameters; “pH, electrical conductivity (EC), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), iron (Fe3+), bicarbonate (HCO3¯), chloride (Cl−), sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−), and fluoride (F−)” were considered for the study. Landsat-5, 7 and 8 images were classified for 2009 and 2020 to detect LULC dynamics related to GWQ. The results showed that GWQ was depleted in 2020 compared to 2009, with agricultural land suffering from lower GWQ than other land uses. Some of the water quality indices (Mean value of pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NO3−) drastically declined in 2020 compared to 2009. The degree of contamination (CD) analysis showed the above value of zero (>CD) is highly vulnerable for dug well users. The mean nitrate (7.281 to 51.387 mg/l), calcium (38.366 to 58.082 mg/l), chloride (121.861 to 125.981 mg/l), and potassium (15.261 to 18.363 mg/l) concentration levels drastically increase over the agricultural land. To know the relationship between LULC and agriculture productivity, block-wise production and yield analysis of both years have been presented. It was seen that there are low crop and high productivity observed from the 2009 to 2015 block of Bankura. The overall result indicates that human activities are the primary cause of spatial-temporal changes in GWQ and agricultural productivity. The geospatial-based water quality assessment benefited in understanding changes in GWQ and developing appropriate site-specific agricultural and health policies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modelling Crop Growth And Crop Water Relations In South Africa: Past Achievements And Lessons For The Future
JO  - South African Journal of Plant and Soil
PY  - 2010
AB  - Mathematical simulation of crop growth and water relations has become indispensable to agricultural science and practice. A critical assessment of how modelling has contributed to the development of crop science and to the management of crop production and natural resources in South Africa (SA) over the past 25 years could give new perspectives on the benefits derived from modelling, the appropriateness of approaches employed and the best way forward. The initial objectives of the major SA modelling initiatives (ACRU, BEWAB, CANE-GRO, CERES, PUTU, SAPWAT, SWB) dictated the approaches that were followed and determined their impacts. Significant advances were made with regard to improved understanding of crop growth and water use and adapting models for local conditions such as dryland grain crop production under very low rainfall. Modelling provided invaluable support for strategic investigations into the impacts of climate change, land use and water use. Many of the models succeeded in providing much-needed information to improve tactical and operational management of irrigated and dryland agriculture. Some models have been (and are being) used operationally to forecast crop production (maize, wheat and sugar) and to monitor droughts in natural vegetation, adding value to the respective industries. Modelling has formed, in some cases, an integral part of tertiary education in crop science and hydrology. This should be strengthened to build more capacity to address the ever-increasing complexity of challenges in agriculture. The review identified factors that are crucial for modelling to maintain effective impacts on the science and practice of crop production and natural resource use. These were excellent scientific leadership, long term funding, effective collaboration between local and with international groups, expertise on local agronomy and high quality experimental data for model testing and adaptation. Future modelling efforts should explore opportunities to integrate information obtained from technologies such as remote sensing and genomics. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Thermal Environment Change Initiated By Development Of Puxiazhou Wetlands In Fuzhou
JO  - Wetland Science
PY  - 2014
AB  - Urban build-up areas have been overdeveloped with the accelerated urbanization process in China. This has caused significant degradation of regional eco-environment. In order to study the thermal environmental change initiated by the development of Puxiazhou wetlands in Fuzhou, Southeast China, the part of the wetlands was developed to a local exhibitation center, two Landsat TM images in 2006 and 2010 were utilized to perform feature extraction of thermal-related information of the wetlands. The extracted feature information included built-up land, fractional vegetation coverage, wetness, and land surface temperature. The analysis on the changes of the above thermal-related feature information revealed that the development of the wetlands to the exhibition center had caused the reduction of wetness and fractional vegetation coverage by 10.00% and 25.64%, respectively, and the increase in built-up index value by 13.85%. Consequently, the land surface temperature of the wetlands has risen by 48.39%. Obviously, the development of the Puxiazhou wetlands to the exhibition center had resulted in the intensive land use change. The conversion of green and water areas to built-up lands had raised the land surface temperature and thus changed the thermal environment of the wetlands.

TI  - Impacts Of Land Use/Land Cover Change On Wetland Ecosystem Services Of Lake Abaya-Chamo Wetland, Rift Valley Of Ethiopia
JO  - Geology, Ecology, and Landscapes
PY  - 2023
AB  - Wetlands in Ethiopia provide multiple ecosystem services; they are highly affected because of Natural processes, anthropogenic activities, and limited policy attention. It aimed this study at analyzing the ecological benefits and drivers of the degradation of the Abaya-Chamo lake-wetland. A questionnaire survey of 304 Household Heads, focus group Discussion, and Landsat imagery was used. Landsat images from the last 30 years (1990-2019) were also used to identify vegetation indices and turbidity in the study area. Normalized difference vegetation, water, and turbidity indices were used for image interpretation. Mean, it used correlation and regression for data analyses. Abaya-Chamo lake-wetland offers fish, fodder, irrigation, farmland, rainfall, habitat, tourism, aesthetics, recreation, carbon sink, air quality, and climate control services. The area showed siltation-led raising turbidity and a loss of 48.9% of its swamp area from 1990 to 2019. Farm expansion, siltation, invasive plants, open access and overuse of resources, lack of legal framework, and rapid population growth were the main drivers of wetland degradation. Invasive plants result in dwindling aquatic resources, economic and tourism benefits, and changes in local climate, rapidly depleting water and lake-wetland. Thus, the government should formulate a clear policy and legal framework for the sustainable management of wetlands. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Land-Use Effects On Aquatic Macroinvertebrate Diversity In Subtropical Highland Grasslands Streams
JO  - Limnetica
PY  - 2023
AB  - Knowledge of the frequency and occurrence of macroinvertebrates throughout landscapes may clarify the effects of anthropic impacts on aquatic systems and help guide conservation actions for watersheds. We evaluated macroinvertebrate α and β diversity in streams in four different subtropical phytophysiognomies: highland grasslands with arboreal riparian vegetation, highland grasslands without arboreal riparian vegetation, mixed ombrophilous forest and silviculture. We also evaluated how environmental factors influence α diversity. We sampled macroinvertebrate communities (by Surber sampler), litter input (by nets) and physicochemical variables of the water (by multiparameter and chemical analysis) at 10 sites in riparian zones of a highland system. A total of 2124 individuals were sampled representing 41 taxa, with high α and β diversity in mixed ombro-philous forest. The results indicate that environmental heterogeneity increases food resource availability, as well as macroin-vertebrate diversity. Furthermore, the β diversity was found to increase with distance among the unconnected streams. Areas of silviculture had the highest density values among the sampled areas due high organic material stock in the soil. Therefore, higher leaf litter input may decrease the toxicity effect of secondary compounds released by leaf plant decomposition compared to environments with low systemic leaf litter input, such as highland grasslands. The presence of arboreal riparian vegetation drives canopy openness, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and orthophosphate in streams, which control the frequency and occurrence of benthic macroinvertebrates. Homogeneous systems, as naturally observed in highland grasslands, plus high canopy openness decrease macroinvertebrate richness and density. The naturally low richness of highland grasslands, although with endemic species, may be an important guideline for legislation on anthropic impacts, management, and conservation of streams in this specific subtropical zone. © Asociación Ibérica de Limnología, Madrid.

TI  - Exploring The Spatial Interplay Between Built-Up Environments And Surface Urban Heat Island Phenomena In The Main Urban Area Of Shanghai
JO  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
PY  - 2023
AB  - The urban built-up environment, consisting of buildings, roads, and various facilities, plays a crucial role in forming surface urban heat islands (SUHI). This study aims to address this issue by creating a comprehensive indicator system for the urban built-up environment, drawing from previous research. By employing multi-source data and diverse geospatial processing methods, this article examine the influence of 20 environmental factors on the spatial and temporal variability of SUHI in Shanghai during the summer and winter seasons from 2016 to 2020. This article findings reveal four key observations. (1) The average SUHI intensity in Shanghai's main urban area during the summers of 2016-2020 showed an increasing trend, with the heat island's shape and location differing between seasons. (2) The correlation values (R-values) between the built and road environment indicators and SUHI changed with season and year, reflecting the dynamic interplay among urban morphology, weather conditions, and human activities that affect heat generation and dissipation. (3) This article found that the increasing SUHI trend was not solely dependent on changes in individual built-up environment parameters. (4) This article analysis demonstrated that the built environment factor significantly influenced heat island intensity in summer, while the green space environment factor had a substantial impact during winter. In conclusion, the results emphasize the complex relationship between the urban built-up environment and SUHI, highlighting the need to consider various environmental factors when assessing their impact on SUHI formation. This study offers valuable insights to inform the development of effective strategies for mitigating the negative effects of SUHI on urban environments and promoting sustainable urban development.

AB  - While there are a growing number of high-resolution space-based systems for measuring precipitation, instances of the use of these products for surface hydrology are rare. This book, which covers both scientific and practical matters, aims to change that. With contributions from a panel of researchers from a wide range of fields, the chapters focus on evaluating the potential, utility and application of high resolution satellite precipitation products in relation to surface hydrology. Focusing on the way the algorithms for the precipitation products evolved, the accuracy assessment of those products in different regions of the world, and the application of the precipitation products to various decision support systems, the book is at the interface between satellite rainfall and surface hydrologic applications. It dwells on issues that are of concern at hydrologic scales of application. In doing so, it provides very useful information to practitioners, researchers and graduate students who need to explore the latest on satellite precipitation products for various hydrological purposes. Crucially, the book provides examples of real-world applications of satellite rainfall products in operational hydrology and real-time decision-making. This enables readers to understand the potential of satellite rainfall products for practical applications ranging from agricultural/crop monitoring to flood and landslide detection in developing countries.

TI  - Non-Timber Forest Products And Environmental Valuation Of The National Forest Pacotuba, Es
JO  - Revista de Ciencias Agroveterinarias
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the potential for the extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and environmental valuation by the willingness to receive from the residents of the damping zone of the National Forest (FLONA) of Pacotuba, state of Espírito Santo. Forms were applied in a sample of 78 families, in the community of Monte Alegre, located in the damping zone of the FLONA de Pacotuba, for the NTFPs ethnobotanical survey and the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. The mapping use of the soil Pacotuba FLONA and the damping zone were obtained through a Landsat image. The contingent valuation method was used using the forms to estimate the willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover. At FLONA de Pacotuba there is potential to produce NTFPs, with an offer mainly for medicinal and ecological purposes. The use of the soil demonstrates that the FLONA of Pacotuba presents a high percentage of forest cover, however the damping zone is with a high percentage of pasture and use of the soil Anthropic, with the payment for environmental services (PES) an alternative to increase the forest cover in the cushioning zone. The willingness to receive to maintain the forest cover of the owners in the damping zone and in the FLONA was greater than the PES of the state of Espírito Santo, which hinders the adoption of a payment program for environmental services. The PES of Espírito Santo, through the program Reflorestar, associated with the management of NTFPs, mainly medicinal and ecological, would be alternatives for income generation and preservation of the forest cover. © 2019 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

TI  - Digital Mapping Of Soil Organic Carbon Stocks In The Forest Lands Of Dominican Republic
JO  - European Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in lands covered by tropical forests is important to understand the relationship and dynamics of SOC in this type of ecosystem. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to map SOC stocks of topsoil (0–15 cm) in forest lands of the Dominican Republic. The methodology was developed using geospatial datasets available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform combined with a set of 268 soil samples. Twenty environmental covariates were analyzed, including climate, topography, and vegetation. The results indicate that Model A (combining all 20 covariates) was only marginally better than Model B (combining topographic and climatic covariates), and Model C (only combining multispectral remote sensing data derived from Landsat 8 OLI images). Model A and Model B yielded SOC mean values of 110.35 and 110.87 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Model A reported the lowest prediction error and uncertainty with an R2 of 0.83, an RMSE of 35.02 Mg C ha−1. There was a strong dependence of SOC stocks on multispectral remote sensing data. Therefore, multispectral remote sensing proved accurate to map SOC stocks in forest ecosystems in the region. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Developing Shopping And Dining Walking Indices Using Pois And Remote Sensing Data
JO  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Walking is one of the most commonly promoted traveling methods and is garnering increasing attention. Many indices/scores have been developed by scholars to measure the walkability in a local community. However, most existing walking indices/scores involve urban planning-oriented, local service-oriented, regional accessibility-oriented, and physical activity-oriented walkability assessments. Since shopping and dining are two major leisure activities in our daily lives, more attention should be given to the shopping or dining-oriented walking environment. Therefore, we developed two additional walking indices that focus on shopping or dining. The point of interest (POI), vegetation coverage, water coverage, distance to bus/subway station, and land surface temperature were employed to construct walking indices based on 50-m street segments. Then, walking index values were categorized into seven recommendation levels. The field verification illustrates that the proposed walking indices can accurately represent the walking environment for shopping and dining. The results in this study could provide references for citizens seeking to engage in activities of shopping and dining with a good walking environment.

TI  - Modeling Regional Crop Yield And Irrigation Demand Using Smap Type Of Soil Moisture Data
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
PY  - 2015
AB  - Agricultural models, such as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer cropping system model (DSSAT-CSM), have been developed for predicting crop yield at field and regional scales and to provide useful information for water resources management. A potentially valuable input to agricultural models is soil moisture. Presently, no observations of soil moisture exist covering the entire United States at adequate time (daily) and space (similar to 10 km or less) resolutions desired for crop yield assessments. Data products from NASA's upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will fill the gap. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of the SMAP soil moisture data in modeling and forecasting crop yields and irrigation amount. A simple, efficient data assimilation algorithm is presented in which the agricultural crop model DSSAT-CSM is constrained to produce modeled crop yield and irrigation amounts that are consistent with SMAP-type data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating the SMAP data into the agricultural model provides an added benefit of reducing the uncertainty of modeled crop yields when the weather input data to the crop model are subject to large uncertainty.

TI  - Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Uav Itinerary Planning For Remote Sensing Applications In Smart Farming
JO  - Telecom
PY  - 2021
AB  - UAV path planning for remote sensing aims to find the best-fitted routes to complete a data collection mission. UAVs plan the routes and move through them to remotely collect environmental data from particular target zones by using sensory devices such as cameras. Route planning may utilize machine learning techniques to autonomously find/select cost-effective and/or best-fitted routes and achieve optimized results including: minimized data collection delay, reduced UAV power consumption, decreased flight traversed distance and maximized number of collected data samples. This paper utilizes a reinforcement learning technique (location and energy-aware Q-learning) to plan UAV routes for remote sensing in smart farms. Through this, the UAV avoids heuristically or blindly moving throughout a farm, but this takes the benefits of environment exploration–exploitation to explore the farm and find the shortest and most cost-effective paths into target locations with interesting data samples to collect. According to the simulation results, utilizing the Q-learning technique increases data collection robustness and reduces UAV resource consumption (e.g., power), traversed paths, and remote sensing latency as compared to two well-known benchmarks, IEMF and TBID, especially if the target locations are dense and crowded in a farm. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Assessing Multi-Criteria Approaches With Environmental, Economic And Social Attributes, Weights And Procedures: A Case Study In The Pampas, Argentina
JO  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2011
AB  - Soil erosion control is a major issue in agriculture. The no till system of soybean production has been widely adopted; however, soil erosion may increase due to pasture and forestry land convert ion to crop-land in the marginal Pampas, Argentina. The aim of this paper is to assess the conflicts and trade-off among environmental, economic and social interests by using three continuous multi-criteria approaches and a set of different weights. Different land uses, crops, pastures, forestry and soil and water conservation practices at the basin scale in the marginal Pampas were assessed. The basin (423 km(2)) was discretised into 176 sub-basins to focus the management strategy on 5th and 6th order streams. Minimum basic information was obtained using intensive field observations and satellite images. The basin hydrology, soil erosion, sediment delivery and vegetated filter strip models and GIS were used to quantify the technical coefficients. Thirteen decision factors and six criteria (peak run-off, annual erosion. sediment, investment, gross margin and employment) were used in the optimisation trials. Weighted goal programming, lexicographic goal programming. compromise programming and a sensitivity analysis of weights were performed. The results showed a high impact of soil and water management practices on the environmental factors and a strong conflict between environmental and economic interests. The three multi-criteria approaches also showed that it is possible to obtain a good level of goal achievement with different plans. These plans should include: soil conservation practices; crop rotation (of a 2:1 soybean-to-corn ratio); gully and channel erosion control; regulation ponds; and pasture and agro-forestry areas. This goal achievement is mainly limited by public and private investment. Sensitivity analysis of the decision-maker weights shows differences among the values achieved by the criteria and their trade-off. Thus, the weight value of each criterium should be supported by the negotiation-consensus process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Satellite Estimation Of Coastal <I>P</I>Co<Sub>2</Sub> And Air-Sea Flux Of Carbon Dioxide In The Northern Gulf Of Mexico
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Satellite approaches for estimation of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and air-sea flux of CO2 in coastal regions offer the potential to reduce uncertainties in coastal carbon budgets and improve understanding of spatial and temporal patterns and the factors influencing them. We used satellite-derived products in combination with an extensive data set of ship-based observations to develop an unprecedented multi-year time-series of pCO(2) and air-sea flux of CO2 in the northern Gulf of Mexico for the period 2006-2010. A regression tree algorithm was used to relate satellite-derived products for chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and dissolved and detrital organic matter to ship observations of pCO(2). The resulting relationship had an r(2) of 0.827 and a prediction error of 31.7 mu atm pCO(2) (root mean-squared error of the relationship was 28.8 mu atm). Using a wind speed and gas exchange relationship along with satellite winds, estimates of air-sea flux of CO2 were derived yielding an average annual flux over the period 2006-2010 of -0.8 to -1.5 (annual mean = -1.1 +/- 0.3) mol C m(-2) y(-1), where the negative value indicates net ocean uptake. The estimated total annual CO2 flux for the study region was -4.3 + 1.1 Tg C y(-1) Relationships of satellite-derived pCO(2) with salinity were consistent with shipboard observations and exhibited a concave relationship with low values at mid- and low salinities attributed to strong biological drawdown of CO2 in the high productivity river-mixing zone. The time-series of satellite-derived pCO(2) was characterized by a seasonal pattern with values lower during winter and spring, low to intermediate values during fall, and higher and more variable values during summer. These findings were similar to simulations from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. A seasonal pattern was also evident in the air-sea flux of CO2 with generally more negative fluxes (i.e., ocean uptake) during winter and spring, and positive fluxes during summer months with fall being a period of transition. Interannual variations in annual means of both air-sea flux of CO2 and DIN loading were significant, with higher DIN loading coinciding in some cases with more negative air-sea flux of CO2 (i.e., net ocean uptake). Spatial patterns of pCO(2) reflected regional environmental forcing including effects of river discharge, wind forcing, and shelf-slope circulation. Our study also illustrates the utility of satellite extrapolation for highlighting areas that may contribute significantly to regional signals and for guiding prioritization of locations for acquiring further observations. The approach should be readily applicable to other regions given adequate availability of in situ observations for algorithm development.

TI  - Effect Of Airborne Particulate Matter Of 2.5 μm Or Less On Preterm Birth: A National Birth Cohort Study In China
JO  - Environment International
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Most evidences regarding ambient PM2.5 or PM10 (particulate matter of median aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm or ≤10 μm) and preterm birth (PTB) come from western countries which has relatively low PM pollution exposure, and the results are still inconsistent. This study aims to examine whether exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 or PM10 was associated with PTB (<37 weeks) and near term birth (37–38 weeks). Method: We established a birth cohort with 1,280,524 singleton pregnancies who delivered from Dec 1st, 2013 to Nov 30th, 2014 and matched their home address to PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations which were predicted with machine learning methods based satellite remote sensing, meteorological and land use information. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the associations between PTB and exposure of PM2.5 or PM10, after controlling for individual level covariates. Results: Exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB and near term birth [e.g., Hazard ratios: 1.09 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.10), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.08), 1.01 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.02), and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.10) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester and over the entire pregnancy, respectively]. The effects appeared to be stronger among women who come from rural areas, worked as farmers, were overweight before conception, whose mate was smoking during pregnancy, and conceived in autumn. Conclusion: This study provides clear evidence that exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB and near term birth. Public policies regarding improvement of air quality would produce great health benefit by reducing the burden of preterm birth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ecological And Economic Analysis Of Seaweed Marine Culture: Case Study South Konawe Regency
JO  - 34th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2013, ACRS 2013
PY  - 2013
AB  - One of the potential coastal areas for seaweed marine culture development in Southeast Sulawesi is South Konawe Regency, " minapolitan regency". Seaweed is one of the commercial marine culture commodities of people in the coastal areas. Seaweed marine culture is growing rapidly in South Konawe Regency, because the technology is relatively simple and easily adapted and able to improve the welfare by fishermen. In an effort to support the development of seaweed marine culture in South Konawe, it is necessary to investigate the suitability of water for the seaweed marine culture. The method used are geographic information systems method and economic analysis. The results showed that the coastal waters of South Konawe were 10,751 ha classified as suitable, 25, 611 ha classified as conditional suitable, and 70, 736 ha classified as unsuitable. The economic analysis shows that seaweed marine culture should be developed with benefit cost ratio of 1.77 and a payback period of 0.37 years. Net Present Value indicates that over 5 years the marine culture of seaweed was every extensive for 0.5 hectare can get a profit of Rp 43,669,328 for the present value.

TI  - A Comparative Evaluation Of Video Remote Sensing And Field Survey For Revegetation Monitoring Of A Pipeline Route
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 1998
AB  - At present, restoration monitoring of pipeline routes is based mainly on field sampling. The 'integrated mapping' approach has received only limited attention from the field ecologist. The reason for this could be the largely undemonstrated value of video for the field ecologist as a monitoring tool for a corridor target, the complexity of analysing the video and the lack of research on comparative evaluation of video surveys with the field approach. An exhaustive and realistic comparison of the two techniques was conducted, based on time-lapse video data and field survey data. Both techniques have been investigated for a variety of aspects: synoptic information, ground detail and information adequacy for customer requirement. The video imagery was able to isolate the major plant communities of a narrow pipeline corridor with reliable spatial precision. Although field surveys have already gained worldwide recognition by plant ecologists as a typical method of pipeline corridor monitoring, this approach did not provide a level of information that is either scientifically reliable or economically feasible in terms of corridor site management (e.g. remedial field works). In conclusion, it is suggested that an integrated mapping approach, using aerial video in combination with supplementary ground data, can meet the requirements for monitoring revegetation of a pipeline route.

TI  - Estimate Soil Organic Matter From Remote Sensing Data By Using Statistical Predictive Models
PY  - 2022
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is essential in terms of soil fertility and conservation, and it has an impact on soil physical and biological activity. It is necessary to track the status of SOM and its dynamics frequently. This task is expensive and time-consuming if only a chemical analysis is used. This study was carried out in Sidi Bennour, situated in Morocco's Doukkala irrigated area. Satellite data may offer an alternative and provide low-cost filling for this void. A special value was shown by predicting the SOM using statistical models and satellite images. This study aims to compare SOM predictions using four different models and RapidEye images. The selected models are multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision trees (DT), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The obtained results indicate that the ANN provides the best fitted model compared to other models with R-2 = 0.482 in training and R-2 = 0.472 in the test. The ANN model provided the lowest RMSE (0.251) and MAE (0.185). The MLR reveals nearly the same results except that it gives a larger difference between training and test than ANN, with R-2 = 0.455 in training and 0.481 in the test. MLR provided the same RMSE (0.251) as the ANN and an approximate MAE of 0.185.

TI  - Evaluating Performance Of Community-Based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-Sensing Technologies To Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management
JO  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
PY  - 2023
AB  - An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77\% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50\% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.

TI  - Integrating Coarse-Resolution Images And Agricultural Statistics To Generate Sub-Pixel Crop Type Maps And Reconciled Area Estimates
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Reliable crop type maps are vital for agricultural monitoring, ensuring food security, and environmental sustainability assessments. Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellite-derived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The sub-pixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Applications involving remotely-sensed images arouse the interest of a large user community. The paper focuses on the fusion of multisensor images available from satellite onboard sensors and in particular on image processing. The physico-diversity of image dimensions allows combination as an aid to extracting relevant information. Such dimensions as spatial, spectral, temporal, angular or polarimetric can be cleverly merged. Data assimilation models corresponding to either a confrontation model or an incorporation model are described within three architectures: centralised, de-centralised and mixed. The quality of the result depends on the assessment of several sources of error. Synergism as a function of data interaction and errors management is discussed within these architectures. Certain image dimensions requisite to improve data fusion techniques are nowadays taken into account as from the conception of a sensor programme. In conclusion, the fusion of data as an aid to define new value-added products is presented, which allows us to consider this technique as being one of the future trends in remote sensing.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis Of Temporal Changes In Urban Land Use Resorting To Advanced Remote Sensing And Gis In Karaj, Iran And Luxor, Egypt
JO  - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)
PY  - 2019
AB  - As many developing countries, Iranian and Egyptian cities are growing in population and physically expanding at a high rate. The uncontrolled scattered construction causes loss of orchards, agricultural lands as well as spatial chaos, traffic congestion and increasing costs of municipal services. As a consequence, this also induces a loss of identity and social characteristics of neighborhoods, poor quality of life and degradation of natural landscapes, etc. To face with these issues, it is important to quantify trend and the rate of land cover conversion in order to support plan for a rational land use policy. The main purpose of this research is to set up low cost and reliable tools useful for the monitoring of the urban growth. In this paper, multi-temporal satellite data (Landsat TM 1984, Landsat TM 1998 and L8 2016) have been analyzed for investigating and assessing the effects of the urban expansion in Karaj (Iran) and Luxor (Egypt). According to the results obtained from change detection analysis, both of the investigated sites clearly exhibit an increasing trend in urban expansion much more evident in the case of Luxor than Karaj area. The integration between remote sensing and GIS and the joint use of analytical methods for quantitative-qualitative assessment enable the identification of changes and the mapping of new planned and unplanned urban construction. The availability of timely information free available from NASA web site and the data processing herein adopted provide useful information for supporting planning and sustainable developing policies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Development And Evaluation Of Hybrid Deep Learning Long Short-Term Memory Network Model For Pan Evaporation Estimation Trained With Satellite And Ground-Based Data
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evaporation, as a core process within the global hydrological cycle, requires reliable methods to monitor its variation, for decision-making in agriculture, irrigation systems and dam operations, also in other areas of hydrology and water resource management. Accurate monitoring of pan evaporation (E-p) is one the most popular approaches to understand the evaporative process. This work aims to construct a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive model that is coupled with Neighbourhood Component Analysis for feature selection to predict E-P in drought-prone regions in Queensland, Australia (Amberley, Gatton, Oakey, \& Townsville). Utilizing the daily-scale dataset {[}31 August 2002 to 22 September 2020], the performance of the proposed deep learning (DL) hybrid model, denoted as NCA-LSTM, is compared with competitive benchmark models, i.e., standalone LSTM, other types of DL, single hidden layer neuronal architecture and decision tree-based method. The testing results reveal the lowest Relative Root Mean Square Error ( <= 20\%), Absolute Percentage Bias ( <= 14.5\%) and the highest Kling-Gupta Efficiency ( >= 87\%) attained by the NCA-LSTM hybrid model (relative to benchmark models) tested for Amberley, Gatton, and Oakey sites. In respect to the predictive efficiency, the proposed NCA-LSTM hybrid model, improved with feature selection, outperforms all benchmark models, indicating its future utility in the prediction of daily E-p. In practical sense, the predictive model developed for E-p estimation provides an accurate estimation of evaporative water loss in hydrological cycle and therefore, can be implemented in areas of irrigation management, planning of irrigation-based agriculture, and mitigation of financial losses to agricultural and related sectors where, regular monitoring and forecasting of water resources are a vital part of sustainable livelihood and business.

Thus, it is urgently needed in a wide variety of environmental processes such as hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and ecology. Microwave remote sensing has the potential to provide near real-time soil moisture estimates on large spatial scales according to the distinctive contrast between dielectric properties of water and dry soils. Thus, many space-borne microwave sensors have been launched for retrieving soil moisture. Especially, SMOS and SMAP at L-band frequency (1.4 GHz) supply an unprecedented opportunity for retrieving surface soil moisture due to their deeper penetration than instruments at other bands. However, these satellite soil moisture products need bias correction before application such as data assimilation. Two common correction methods require reliable land surface soil moisture simulations. However, the quality of these simulations relies heavily on model parameters, such as soil porosity and texture, which are almost unavailable in remote regions such as the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, a dual-cycle assimilation algorithm is taken to make on-line bias correction when assimilating SMAP soil moisture products. During the assimilation, a linear bias correction scheme is regarded as the observation operator to link the simulated soil moisture values and the satellite retrievals. In the inner cycle, a sequentially based assimilation algorithm is run with both model parameters and bias correction coefficients, which are provided by the outer cycle. At the same time, both the analyzed soil moisture and the innovation are reserved at each analysis moment. In the outer cycle, the innovation time series kept by the inner cycle are fed into a likelihood function to adjust the values of both model parameters and correction coefficients through an optimization algorithm. A series of numerical experiments are designed and conducted, indicating that the soil moisture estimates by the presented algorithm are superior to those with the existing bias correction schemes.

TI  - Small Low-Cost Launch Vehicles: Engineering And Business Broad Analysis
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2013
AB  - The number of small satellites to be launched is increasing year after year and, due to the conditions (i.e. schedule, cost, orbit) under which those satellites have to be launched, the necessity of a specific launch service is today more obvious than ever. For this reason several companies and organizations have started to propose and develop different launch systems in order to fulfil the launch necessities of that specific market. One of those requirements is the price, which has to be low enough to be attractive in front of other market competitors, and secure the required flight rates to be a sustainable business. Until now most of the existing launch systems have been designed mainly from the performance point of view, being the cost a secondary parameter. However, many launch system concepts have been proposed aiming to be the lowest cost solution for this particular market: modular rockets, air launch systems, Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO), reusable systems, etc. This paper analyses the space launch systems from the engineering and the economical point of view in order to determine which are the concepts and solutions most likely to be the optimal ones for a small satellite launch service. A broad study is presented; several launch systems concepts are proposed, studied, and compared between them in order to identify which are the elements of low-cost launch system. Additionally, the subject is analysed from the business side so as to recognize how the economic parameters can affect the launch service. Finally, it has been found that the optimal low-cost solution for a specific launch service for small satellites will be affected by several factors (i.e. experience of the team, political interferences, company's background, etc.). However the space launch systems concepts expected to be the most cost-effective solutions are the ones based on simple propulsion systems, equal staging and maintaining the number of elements in the minimum required.

TI  - Global Path Planning Of Unmanned Vehicle Based On Fusion Of A* Algorithm And Voronoi Field
JO  - Journal of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles
PY  - 2022
AB  - Purpose: Since many global path planning algorithms cannot achieve the planned path with both safety and economy, this study aims to propose a path planning method for unmanned vehicles with a controllable distance from obstacles. Design/methodology/approach: First, combining satellite image and the Voronoi field algorithm (VFA) generates rasterized environmental information and establishes navigation area boundary. Second, establishing a hazard function associated with navigation area boundary improves the evaluation function of the A* algorithm and uses the improved A* algorithm for global path planning. Finally, to reduce the number of redundant nodes in the planned path and smooth the path, node optimization and gradient descent method (GDM) are used. Then, a continuous smooth path that meets the actual navigation requirements of unmanned vehicle is obtained. Findings: The simulation experiment proved that the proposed global path planning method can realize the control of the distance between the planned path and the obstacle by setting different navigation area boundaries. The node reduction rate is between 33.52% and 73.15%, and the smoothness meets the navigation requirements. This method is reasonable and effective in the global path planning process of unmanned vehicle and can provide reference to unmanned vehicles’ autonomous obstacle avoidance decision-making. Originality/value: This study establishes navigation area boundary for the environment based on the VFA and uses the improved A* algorithm to generate a navigation path that takes into account both safety and economy. This study also proposes a method to solve the redundancy of grid environment path nodes and large-angle steering and to smooth the path to improve the applicability of the proposed global path planning method. The proposed global path planning method solves the requirements of path safety and smoothness. © 2022, Jiansen Zhao, Xin Ma, Bing Yang, Yanjun Chen, Zhenzhen Zhou and Pangyi Xiao.

TI  - Estimation Of Groundwater Volumes Pumped For Irrigation (Haouz Plain, Marrakesh, Morocco). Comparison Of A Statistical And Remote Sensing Methods
JO  - Revue des Sciences de l'Eau
PY  - 2009
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is one of the main components of, the economic development of the Haouz Plain, along with tourism and craft industry. It represents more than 85% of water consumption in the Tensift catchment. The dry climate, as well the as recurrent periods of drought during the past ten years, have led to an increase in the use of surface and ground waters, used mainly for irrigation. The main objective of this study was to determine the volume of groundwater pumped for irrigation. We created a land use map through the supervised classification of three Landsat images obtained on three different dates. This map enabled us to locate the Various irrigated crops and to calculate their total water needs from the consumption values for each crop, using the FAO method. By comparing the volumes of surface water allocated by ORMVAH (Office Régionale de Mise en Valeur Agricole du Haouz) with the crop requirements, we could estimate the average volume of water pumped for irrigation to be 481 Mm3•yr-1. The values ranged between 271 and 691 Mm3•yr-1 due to uncertainties in the estimation of crop water consumption. In addition, the graphic interpolation between the actual volume of water extracted, as determined by field investigations in 1986 and 1971, and the pumping flow allowed by the local water authority in the Haouz Plain, gave an estimated value of approximately 495 Mm3•yr-1.

TI  - Dairy Farming In The Eastern Himalayan Foothills: Perspectives From The Lower Dibang Valley, India
JO  - Environmental Change in the Himalayan Region: Twelve Case Studies
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dairying in the far-flung rural areas of Arunachal Pradesh in the Eastern Himalayas forms an important source of livelihood. The Himalayan foothill region of Lower Dibang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh, India is dotted with dairy farming units, locally known as Khutti (cowsheds). The semi-pastoral traditional practice of dairying among the Nepali community has its own economic, geographical and social ramifications. The khuttis or the goths (dairy units) move from one place to another depending on fodder availability and seasonality. This chapter seeks to identify the cost and production, price and profitability of dairying livelihood; the status of livelihood of the dairy farming households and its relationship with the changing climatic conditions in the study area. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the study. Primary data was collected with the help of structured survey schedule. A handheld geographical positioning system (GPS) device was used to derive accurate longitudinal and latitudinal positions of the dairy farms and other features. Topographic maps and satellite imageries were used for the construction of maps. A simple cost-benefit analysis was carried out to assess the cost and profitability of the dairy units. Generally the households manage to stay marginally above the poverty level, with the standards of living being generally low. Buffaloes tended to provide better returns from dairying than cows. The markedly traditional mode of dairying has aided the gradual improvement of the livelihood of the dairying community although their tenuous existence could be undermined by climate change in the coming years.

TI  - Method Of Cultivated Land Landscape Ecological Security Evaluation And Its Application
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ecological security is very important for regional development and society stability, and it has become a hot topic currently. The concept of ecological security can be understood from two aspects, namely the broader sense and the narrower sense. In a broader sense, ecological security includes natural, economic, and social ecological security, while in a narrow sense, it means the security of natural and half natural ecological system, including ecological system and environment security. As special public resources, the quantity and quality of cultivated land are closely related to national food security and social stability, and has great significance in the maintenance of national security. In this study, taking the cultivated land in eastern low hills and coastal region of Qinhuangdao, China as the research area, a cultivated land landscape ecological security evaluation model was built based on the principles of landscape ecology and ecological security. The model contained five landscape pattern indexes including fragmentation, isolation, fractal dimension and shape factor, which could reflect production efficiency, stability and resilience of cultivated land. With three TM(ETM+) remote sensing images in 1990, 2000, and 2010 as well as GIS techniques, the landscape ecological security of cultivated land in the research area was comprehensively evaluated based on each town unit, and the evolution of landscape ecological security pattern and gravity center was analyzed using center of gravity method. At last, the driving factors of landscape ecological security evolution were discussed. The results showed that the landscape ecological security of cultivated land in the research area had been declining all the time with the value decreasing from 0.63 in 1993 to 0.5 in 2000. The fragmentation of cultivated land in low mountainous and hilly areas was more serious, so its landscape ecological security was lower than coastal area. The landscape ecological security was divided into three levels according to Natural Break grading result of three years includingIlevel when ecological security was equal or less than 0.3, IIlevel when ecological security was greater than 0.3 and equal or less than 0.65, and III level when ecological security was equal or greater than 0.65. In addition, this study demonstrated that the pattern of landscape ecological security changed obviously. From 1993 to 2000, the I level area had no noticeable change, but the II and III level area were converted to each another. From 2000 to 2010, theIand IIlevel area were expanded, which were converted from the III level area. In the past 20 years, the gravity center of landscape ecological security of cultivated land had transferred to the adjacent regions of Qinhuangdao city. It indicated that the landscape ecological security of coastal area had been increased obviously. The reduction of rainfall and runoff, with the rapid increase in economy and population, and governmental policy decision all had a profound effect on the landscape ecological security variation of cultivated land. This study applied landscape pattern index to describe the landscape structure of cultivated land in ecological security study. The studies on ecological security evaluation of cultivated land are conductive to protection of fragile ecological environment and local sustainable development of cultivated land resources.

TI  - Utilization Of Global Precipitation Datasets In Data Limited Regions: A Case Study Of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania
JO  - ATMOSPHERE
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study explored the potential for bias correction of global precipitation datasets (GPD) to support streamflow simulation for water resource management in data limited regions. Two catchments, 580 km(2) and 2530 km(2), in the Kilombero Valley of central Tanzania were considered as case studies to explore three GPD bias correction methods: quantile mapping (QM), daily percentages (DP) and a model based (ModB) bias correction. The GPDs considered included two satellite rainfall products, three reanalysis products and three interpolated observed data products. The rainfall-runoff model HBV was used to simulate streamflow in the two catchments using (1) observed rain gauge data; (2) the original GPDs and (3) the bias-corrected GPDs as input. Results showed that applying QM to bias correction based on limited observed data tends to aggravate streamflow simulations relative to not bias correcting GPDs. This is likely due to a potential lack of representativeness of a single rain gauge observation at the scale of a hydrological catchment for these catchments. The results also indicate that there may be potential benefits in combining streamflow and rain gauge data to bias correct GPDs during the model calibration process within a hydrological modeling framework.

TI  - Monitoring Structural Breaks In Vegetation Dynamics Of The Nature Reserve Königsbrücker Heide
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2017
AB  - Nowadays remote sensing is a well-established method and technique of providing data. The current development shows the availability of systems with very high geometric resolution for the monitoring of vegetation. At the same time, however, the value of temporally high-resolution data is underestimated, particularly in applications focusing on the detection of short-term changes. These can be natural processes like natural disasters as well as changes caused by anthropogenic interventions. These include economic activities such as forestry, agriculture or mining but also processes which are intended to convert previously used areas into natural or near-natural surfaces. The Konigsbrucker Heide is a former military training site located about 30 km north of the Saxon state capitol Dresden. After the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in 1992 and after nearly 100 years of military use this site was declared as nature reserve in 1996. The management of the whole protection area is implemented in three different management zone. Based on MODIS-NDVI time series between 2000 and 2016 different developments are apparent in the nature development zone and the zone of controlled succession. Nevertheless, the analyses also show that short-term changes, so called breaks in the vegetation development cannot be described using linear trend models. The complete understanding of vegetation trends is only given if discontinuities in vegetation development are considered. Structural breaks in the NDVI time series can be found simultaneously in the whole study area. Hence it can be assumed that these breaks have a more natural character, caused for example by climatic conditions like temperature or precipitation. Otherwise, especially in the zone of controlled succession structural breaks can be detected which cannot be traced back to natural conditions. Final analyses of the spatial distribution of breakpoints as well as their frequency depending on the respective protection zone allow a detailed view to vegetation development in the Konigsbrucker Heide. © 2017 SPIE.

JO  - Agricultural Water Management
PY  - 1988
AB  - The Istra peninsula in situated in the extreme north-west of Yugslavia, covering an area of 3100 km2 with about 200 000 inhabitants. The western coastal belt and the Mirna and Raša valleys are extensive plains with terra rossa and alluvial soils of a thick topsoil cover. This is suitable for high-yield crop development, particularly orchards and vegetables, and has been the target of investigations and planning. Although the area benefits from relatively high rainfall, unfavourable orographic and geologic conditions prevent most of this water being stored as a supplementary water source. For this reason, a lack of water for all needs has been felt for a long time. This is the reason why comprehensive investigations covering both undergound water development and collecting of surface water by storage-basin construction were undertaken some years ago. The most serious limitation for intensive agricultural development is the deficit of water in the vegetation season which ranges from between 300 and 400 mm a year. Together with the proposed plan for long-term water supply for irrigation, a significant change in the traditional cropping pattern has been considered. The hydrotechnical solution consists of constructing a dozen storage reservoirs which will meet the region's need for water up to the year 2015. Also, it is programmed that the planned water-resources systems will meet the water needs for all users (population, tourism, industry and agriculture) over the following 50-year period. Owing to the fact that underground water resources have already been exhausted, future demands are primarily met using surface water by constructing appropriate storage basins. © 1988.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) modified by the use of tangential, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histologic specimens is advantageous in treating selected skin neoplasms. OBJECTIVE. To review the use of our experience with a modification of MMS to treat lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), lentigo maligna (LM) and other melanoma in situ (MIS) lesions, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), and angiosarcoma. METHODS. Our experience utilizing a modification of MMS in the treatment of 77 patients with LM or other MIS, 23 patients with LMM, 11 patients with DFSP, 1 patient with AFX, and 1 patient with angiosarcoma was reviewed. Length of follow-up and rate of recurrence were examined. A literature review of this pertinent modification of the Mohs technique was performed. RESULTS. One hundred fourteen patients underwent MMS for melanocytic (LM, MIS, LMM), spindle cell (DFSP, AFX), and vascular malignant neoplasms. One patient developed locally recurrent LM and one patient with LMM developed satellite metastasis. Regional lymph node metastasis occurred in one patient with LMM and in a patient with angiosarcoma. CONCLUSION. The use of Mohs micrographic surgery in conjunction with rush formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tangential histologic sections provides the accuracy and tissue conservation of the Mohs procedure while ensuring more confident interpretation of histology in cases of lentigo maligna, lentigo maligna melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atypical fibroxanthoma, and angiosarcoma.

TI  - Era5-Land: A State-Of-The-Art Global Reanalysis Dataset For Land Applications
JO  - Earth System Science Data
PY  - 2021
AB  - Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9ĝ€¯km compared to 31ĝ€¯km (ERA5) or 80ĝ€¯km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management. The full ERA5-Land hourly and monthly averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

AB  - Brazil's Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (Landless Workers' Movement-MST) is one of the most combative popular forces in contemporary Latin America. It emerged in 1979 with its first land occupation in Encruzilhada Natalino, Rio Grande do Sul. Supported by church organizations such as the grassroot communities and the Comissão Pastoral da Terra (Pastoral Land Commission-CPT) and by the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers' party-PT), among others, the movement spread all over the country as land reform was included in the political agenda during the redemocratization days of the mid-1980s.1 In the 1990s, it became an important mass organization. The MST's rural settlements are characterized by cooperative relations, collective planning, and self-management. Solidarity, social justice, and autonomy are its fundamental ethical values. It has established a monthly newspaper to communicate its ideas, an educational system based on the "work-and-study" method, and an intense process of political-ideological formation through study groups on radical theory. Within these groups is emerging a newly developed consciousness of the necessity for social ownership of the means of production. Their leaders appear in the media and negotiate with the government, and their actions have consolidated an alliance with workers' trade unions and urban movements.

TI  - Quantifying Urban Forest Structure With Open-Access Remote Sensing Data Sets
JO  - Urban Forestry and Urban Greening
PY  - 2020
AB  - Future cities are set to face ever increasing population and climate pressures, ecosystem services offered by urban forests have been recognised as providing significant mitigation for these pressures. Therefore, the ability to accurately quantify the extent and structure of urban forests, across large and highly dynamic cities, is vital for determining the value of services provided and to assess the effectiveness of policy to promote these important assets. Current inventory methods used in urban forestry are mostly reliant on plot networks measuring a range of structural and demographic metrics; however, limited sampling (spatially and temporally) cannot fully capture the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the urban matrix. The rapid increase in the availability of open-access remote sensing data and processing tools offers an opportunity for monitoring and assessment of urban forest structure that is synoptic and at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we present a framework to estimate urban forest structure that uses open-access data and software, is robust to differences in data sources, is reproducible and is transferable between cities. The workflow is demonstrated by estimating three metrics of 3D forest structure (canopy cover, canopy height and tree density) across the Greater London area (1577 km2). Random Forest was trained with open-access airborne LiDAR or iTree Eco inventory data, with predictor variables derived from Sentinel 2, climatic and topography data sets. Output were maps of forest structure at 100 m and 20 m resolution. Results indicate that forest structure can be accurately estimated across large urban areas; Greater London has a mean canopy cover of ∼16.5% (RMSE 11-17%), mean canopy height of 8.1–15.0 m (RMSE 4.9–6.2 m) m and is home to ∼4.6 M large trees (projected crown area >10 m2). Transferability to other cities is demonstrated using the UK city of Southampton, where estimates were generated from local and Greater London training data sets indicating application beyond geographic domains is feasible. The methods presented here can augment existing inventory practices and give city planners, urban forest managers and greenspace advocates across the globe tools to generate consistent and timely information to help assess and value urban forests. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

The objective of this study was to help farmers optimize top dress N application by adopting the use of within‐field reference N strips. We developed an assisting app on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to map the spatial variability of four different vegetation indices (VIs) in each field by calculating the mean VI, masking extreme values (three standard deviations, 3σ) of each field, and presenting the anomaly as a deviation of ±σ and ±2σ or deviation of percentage. VIs based on red‐edge bands (REIP, NDRE, ICCI) were very useful for the detection of wheat above ground N uptake and in‐field anomalies. VENμS high temporal and spatial resolutions provide advantages over Sentinel‐2 in monitoring agricultural fields during the growing season, representing the within‐field variations and for decision making, but the spatial coverage and accessibility of Senti-nel‐2 data are much better. Sentinel‐2 data is already available on the GEE platform and was found to be of much help for the farmers in optimizing topdressing N application to wheat, applying it only where it will increase grain yield and/or grain quality. Therefore, the GEE anomaly app can be used for top‐N dressing application decisions. Nevertheless, there are some issues that must be tested, and more research is required. To conclude, satellite images can be used in the GEE platform for anomaly detection, rendering results within a few seconds. The ability to use L1 VENμS or Sen-tinel‐2 data without atmospheric correction through GEE opens the opportunity to use these data for several applications by farmers and others. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Integrated Use Of Gis, Remote Sensing And Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis To Assess Ecological Land Suitability In Multi-Functional Forestry
JO  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
PY  - 2016
AB  - The Zagros forests are a treasure of valuable oak forests, but they have been severely degraded from long-term misuse. Geographic information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) have been increasingly used to improve the management of vulnerable ecosystems to prevent further degradation and increase the sustainability of land use. This study presents a methodology to assess land suitability using remote sensing (RS) to obtain wall-to-wall data for the calculations, GIS to analyze the data, and MCDA to rank alternative land uses. The criteria and subcriteria affecting the suitability of land for different uses were identified and weighted using an analytic hierarchy process. Variables used as subcriteria were assessed using satellite data and other sources of information such as existing maps and field surveys. Numerical values for the subcriteria were classified, and each class was given a priority rating according to expert judgments. Based on the ratings and weights of the subcriteria, a priority map was created for each land use using the weighted linear combination method. The priority maps for different land uses were overlaid to obtain a preliminary land use map, which often indicated several simultaneous land uses for the same location. The preliminary map was further edited by removing unrealistic, mutually exclusive land-use combinations. The study tested and demonstrated the potential of integrating RS, GIS and MCDA techniques for solving complicated land allocation problems in forested regions using a scientifically sound and practical approach for efficient and sustainable allocation of forest-land for different uses.

PY  - 2015
AB  - Earthquake Data Enhanced Cyber-Infrastructure for Disaster Evaluation and Response (E-DECIDER) is a NASA-funded project developing new capabilities for decision making utilizing remote sensing data and modeling software to provide decision support for earthquake disaster management and response. E-DECIDER incorporates the earthquake forecasting methodology and geophysical modeling tools developed through NASA's QuakeSim project. Remote sensing and geodetic data, in conjunction with modeling and forecasting tools allows us to provide both long-term planning information for disaster management decision makers as well as short-term information following earthquake events (i.e. identifying areas where the greatest deformation and damage has occurred and emergency services may need to be focused). This in turn is delivered through standards-compliant web services for desktop and hand-held devices.

TI  - Performance Model Incorporating Weather-Related Constraints For Fields Of Unattended Ground Sensors
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 1999
AB  - Tactical sensing on the battlefield involves real-time information processing of acoustic, seismic, electromagnetic, and environmental sensor data to obtain and exploit an automated situational awareness. The value-added of tactical sensing is to give the war-fighter real-time situational information without requiring human interpretation of the underlying scientific data. For example, acoustic, seismic, and magnetic signatures of a ground vehicle can be used in a pattern recognition algorithm to identify a tank, truck, or TEL, but all the war-fighter wants to know is how many of each vehicle type are present and which way are they going. However, the confidences of this automated information processing are dependent on environmental conditions and background interference. A key feature of tactical ground sensing is the ability to integrate objective statistical confidences into the process to intelligently suppress false alarms, thus allowing the war-fighter to concentrate on war fighting. This paper presents how the situation confidence metric is generated starting with the sensor SNR going all the way through to the target classification and track confidences. This technique also allows modeling of ground sensor performance in hypothetical environments such as bad weather.

TI  - The Association Between Charlson Comorbidity Index And Mortality In Acute Coronary Syndrome–The Maddec Study
JO  - Scandinavian Cardiovascular Journal
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with high mortality. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was designed over 30 years ago to measure the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on long-term survival of the patient. We wanted to re-evaluate the performance of CCI and its components in modern setting. Design. This is a retrospective study of 1576 consecutive patients undergoing invasive evaluation and treated for ACS in single tertiary center between 2015–2016. Mortality was analyzed in timeframes of 1, 6 and 24 months. CCI-scores were retrieved from written medical records and complimented with data from electronic sources. The performance of CCI and its components was compared to the GRACE-score measuring patients’ status upon hospital admission. Results. Population mean age at baseline was 69.3 (SD 11.8) years and 69.1% of the patients were male (n = 1089). Most of the components of CCI associated significantly with mortality at all timeframes despite adjusting for age but only diabetes and congestive heart failure associated with mortality at all time points after adjusting for GRACE-score. CCI associated with mortality [GRACE adjusted HR-values of single unit increase of CCI after 1, 6 and 24-month follow-up: 1.12(95% CI:1.00–1.25), 1.17(1.07–1.29) and 1.24(1.16–1.33)]. CCI performed modestly with its AUC-values ranging between 0.755 and 0.784, with prognostic performance increasing with longer follow-up. Adding components of CCI did not significantly improve risk prediction over GRACE-score. Conclusions. In conclusion, CCI or its individual components measuring the impact of comorbidities on overall mortality does not provide any significant value compared to GRACE–score during up to 2 years of follow-up. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Bean yield in Brazil is considered low, around 820 kg ha-1, reaching values above 3000 kg ha-1, there are several environmental factors which may limit the performance of this culture, especially those related to the soil. The present work aimed to evaluate soil compactions in bean culture of different soil management systems, by means of digital images. This study took place at the Federal University of Viçosa, randomized block design with six replications was used and four treatments, (direct planting, conventional preparation, minimum plantation using grade crusher-leveler and minimum plantation using scarificator), were evaluated. The spectral responses using the vegetation indexes (NDVI, RS, GNDVI, VARI, WDRVI and SAVI) were evaluated, calculated from digital numbers of the images and the values were estimated from the reflectance. For obtainning the images, a platform containing two digital cameras, one sensitive in the region of visible (RGB) and another sensitive to the region of proximal infrared were used, this platform was attached to a helium-inflatable balloon. The vegetation indexes obtained from the values of digital numbers of images were only able to defer treatments 70 days after plantation. However, indexes obtained from the reflectance, deferred treatments at 34 and 70 days after planting.

TI  - The Impact Of Protected Area Governance And Management Capacity On Ecosystem Function In Central America
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a prominent approach to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. A critical question for safeguarding these resources is how PA governance processes and management structures influence their effectiveness. We conduct an impact evaluation of 12 PAs in three Central American countries to assess how processes in management restrictions, management capacity, and decentralization affect the annual change in the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI varies with greenness that relates to plant production, biomass, and important ecosystem functions related to biodiversity and ecosystem services such as water quality and carbon storage. Any loss of vegetation cover in the form of deforestation or degradation would show up as a decrease in NDVI values over time and gains in vegetation cover and regeneration as an increase in NDVI values. Management restriction categories are based on international classifications of strict versus multiple-use PAs, and capacity and decentralization categories are based on key informant interviews of PA managers. We use matching to create a counterfactual of non-protected observations and a matching estimator and regression to estimate treatment effects of each sub-sample. On average, strict and multiple-use PAs have a significant and positive effect on NDVI compared to non-protected land uses. Both high and low decentralized PAs also positively affect NDVI. High capacity PAs have a positive and significant effect on NDVI, while low capacity PAs have a negative effect on NDVI. Our findings advance knowledge on how governance and management influence PA effectiveness and suggest that capacity may be more important than governance type or management restrictions in maintaining and enhancing NDVI. This paper also provides a guide for future studies to incorporate measures of PA governance and management into impact evaluations.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Natura 2000, an EU-wide network of nature protection areas, has as main objective the achievement or maintenance of a favorable conservation status of habitats protected by the EU Habitats directives. Within this framework, this study examines a strategy to characterize the status of heathland vegetation from airborne hyperspectral AHS data in the Kalmthoutse Heide, Flanders, Belgium. A hierarchical classification scheme was set-up with the highest detail focusing on vegetation structural elements that determine the conservation status of the habitat. Although conventional classification algorithms performed very well (accuracies > 90%) in discriminating broad land cover classes and habitat types (level 1 to 3), they failed in accurately distinguishing different heather age classes which are an important indicator for the structural quality of the heathland habitat (level 4). Since all heather life stages have their specific structural characteristics, a subpixel unmixing approach succeeded by a decision tree classification was implemented to map variations in heathland morphology and as such enhance the ecological value of information derived from remote sensing data. ©2010 IEEE.

PY  - 2021
AB  - The joint development by Belarus and China of the Great Stone Industrial Park (GSIP) is designed to establish a high-tech industrial zone and an eco-friendly satellite city of Minsk as a key node on the Eurasian Land Bridge linking China with the Eurasian Economic Union and the European Union. The development and organization of the GSIP are explained in the light of a coupling of the strategic goals of the two countries in the context of a new Chinese model of external engagement called an emergent geo-political economic culture. These goals include Belarus' desire to reduce its dependence on Russian gas and oil, upgrade and diversify its economy, strengthen its integration with Eurasia and find new partners, by attracting Chinese and other foreign direct investment in the context of China's Going Out and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). An analysis of the roles of national leaders Aliaksandr Lukashenka and Xi Jinping and of different stakeholders in the predominantly top-down design, development and governance of the park reveals the way in which a BRI cooperation platform permits the coupling of Chinese and Belarusian interests and strategies in ways through which each side expects to benefit.

TI  - Groundwater Prospecting Using A Multi-Technique Framework In The Lower Casas Grandes Basin, Chihuahua, México
JO  - Water (Switzerland)
PY  - 2023
AB  - Groundwater is a strategic resource for economic development, social justice, environmental sustainability, and water governance. The lower Casas Grandes River Basin, located in the state of Chihuahua, México, is in a semi-arid region with increasing groundwater demand and regional challenges such as drought and depletion of aquifers. Even though there is official information about the availability of groundwater, a comprehensive aquifer characterization requiring an interdisciplinary investigation using a diverse suite of tools and multiple data sources has yet to be carried out. This study presents a multi-technique framework to evaluate potential sites to drill for groundwater resources and reduce the risk of unsuccessful drilling. The main components of the methodology include wellhead leveling correction with a differential global positioning survey to define piezometric levels, principal component analysis using LANDSAT-8 images, application of geospatial tools, geophysics analysis using time domain electromagnetic surveys (TDES) and vertical electric soundings (VES), and structural geohydrology to define aquifer characteristics. The results showed that using the proposed framework steps improved the possibility of identifying subsurface layers with lower resistivity values that could be related to groundwater. Low resistivity values (35 Ohm-m) were found at depths from 50 to 85 m at sites where the regional static water level reached a depth of 245 m, indicating the potential location of a shallow groundwater resource at a site where the intersection of a fracture trace was identified. This procedure can be used in other regions in the world where limited information is available for groundwater exploration, thus reducing the risk of drilling dry wells in complex hydrogeological environments. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Forest Fire Susceptibility And Risk Mapping Using Remote Sensing And Geographical Information Systems (Gis)
JO  - Disaster Prevention and Management: An International Journal
PY  - 2007
AB  - Purpose - In a tropical country like Malaysia, forest fire is a very common natural and man-made disaster that prevails in the whole South East Asian region throughout the year. Recently, the haze problem in Malaysia has created a lot of awareness among the government and eco-tourism sectors. Therefore, detection of the hotspot is very important to delineate the forest fire susceptibility mapping. In this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) have been used to evaluate forest fire susceptibility at Sungai Karang and Raja Muda Musa Forest Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia. Frequency ratio model has been applied for the delineation of forest fire mapping for the study area. Design/methodology/approach - Forest fire locations were identified in the study area from historical hotspots data from year 2000 to 2005 using AVHRR NOAA 12 and NOAA 16 satellite images. Various other supported data such as soil map, topographic data, and agro climate were collected and created using GIS. These data were constructed into a spatial database using GIS. The factors that influence fire occurrence, such as fuel type and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), were extracted from classified Landsat-7 ETM imagery. Slope and aspect of topography were calculated from topographic database. Soil type was extracted from soil database and dry month code from agroclimate data. Forest fire susceptibility was analyzed using the forest fire occurrence factors by likelihood ratio method. Findings - A new statistical method has been applied for the forest fire susceptibility mapping. The results of the analysis were verified using forest fire location data with the help of a newly written programming code. The validation results show satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on forest fire location. The GIS was used to analyze the vast amount efficiently, and statistical programs were used to maintain the specificity and accuracy. The result can be used for early warning, fire suppression resources planning and allocation. Originality/value - All data used in this study are original. The forest fire susceptibility mapping has been done in this study area for the first time. A new program has been coded to cross-verify the susceptibility map. The results were also verified with field data and other supporting weather data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Construction Of An Ecological Network Based On An Integrated Approach And Circuit Theory: A Case Study Of Panzhou In Guizhou Province
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Protecting ecological security has become the backbone of social and economic development since declines in ecological quality due to an increase in human dominance over the natural environment. The establishment of ecological networks is an effective, comprehensive spatial regulation means to ensure regional ecological security. Panzhou city, as a case study, is a typical karst county and has been confronted with the pressure of ecological degradation in recent decades. In this study, an integrated approach combining ecological quality (EQ), ecosystem function importance (EFI), and morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was developed to determine the ecological sources. Ecological corridors, ecological pinch areas, and ecological barriers were extracted using circuit theory to identify the restored and conserved priority areas of ecological security patterns. The results showed that (1) the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and EFI exhibited typical geographical distributions, with the highest values concentrated in the northern and southern parts of the study area and the lowest values scattered in the middle part; (2) 26 patches with forestland, grassland, and waterbodies as the main land cover types were selected as the ecological sources; (3) 63 ecological corridors, composed of 45 key ecological corridors and 18 inactive ecological corridors, were extracted, accounting for 203.12 km and 163.31 km, respectively; (4) 82.76 km(2) of pinch areas and 320.29 km(2) of barriers were identified, both of which were distributed on key ecological corridors and played different roles in ecological security; and (5) 4 types of ecological security zones were established according to ecological sources, corridors, pinch areas, and barriers. This integrated approach provides a scientific method for the identification and implementation of ecological networks that can contribute to protecting regional ecological security. Our findings can serve as applicable and reasonable guidance to land administrators and policy-makers for adopting suitable territorial spatial planning, urban planning, green cities, etc.

JO  - Battelle Information
PY  - 1974
AB  - In October, 1972, the Gesellschaft fur Weltraumforschung (Society for Space Research) in West Germany commissioned Messerschmitt Bolkow Blohm to conduct an investigation on the benefits of remote sensing from space. The results of the economic part of the study (benefits and users), which was carried out by Batelle Frankfurt, are outlined in this article. The evaluation, which is based on a summary of information gathered in interviews with users, is intended to provide an initial indication of the importance of the various benefits. The most important applications of remote sensing in the different user groups include: agriculture, forestry, fishery, regional planning, air pollution control, and water pollution control. It is shown that the relative importance of remote sensing in West Germany and in other European countries differs considerably from that in the U.S. Those differences between vast, sparsely populated countries like the U.S. and densely populated countries of a small area like those of Europe clearly show that it is not legitimate to apply the results of cost benefit analyses and the implications for research activities in the U.S. directly to conditions in Western European countries. The study also shows that for some applications remote sensing methods are definitely superior to conventional methods used in West Germany. Therefore, it is desirable to amplify its results by more detailed studies. In particular, a detailed monetary evaluation of all benefits should be made. Only then could the economic benefit of remote sensing programs be compared with that of other research schemes.

The results and conclusions of the Exxon/General Electric satellite experiment are presented and how they relate to the new system. A comparison is made between the existing MF/HF long range terrestrial radio system and the MARISAT service with respect to cost, available modes, radio coverage, message delay and transmission speed. The drawbacks of both systems are also highlighted with possible solutions to alleviate them. Exxon's test and evaluation plans for MARISAT are indicated in addition to teletype, voice and user population estimates. Future concepts and uses of Maritime Satellites are discussed and how it can impact shipping functions. It is concluded here that the new capability has the potential to provide substantial economic and safety benefits as well as enhancing effective ship management.

TI  - Drought Impact Assessment Based On Principal Component Analysis And Copula Function
JO  - Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery
PY  - 2016
AB  - Drought is one of the most important agricultural disasters in the Guanzhong Plain, China. Assessing the influence of the droughts in the plain accurately can provide reference for drought mitigation and maintaining stable crop yields. Based on remotely sensed vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which was calculated at ten-day intervals for monitoring droughts in the years of 2008-2013 in the plain, the Copula function method was used to assess the effect of drought at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yields. The mutually independent principal factors were extracted from the VTCIs at the main growth stages of winter wheat by using principal component analysis (PCA), overcoming difficulty of parameter estimation for multivariate Copula, and then incorporated into the Copula function to establish a PCA-Copula method. The comprehensive values of VTCIs at the main growth stages were determined by the PCA-Copula method, and then linear regression model between the comprehensive VTCIs and wheat yields was established to assess the effect of drought on the yields. The results showed that the linear correlation coefficient between the wheat yields and comprehensive VTCIs was at the extremely significant level (P<0.001). Compared with the linear regression model based on the entropy value method, the determination coefficient of the model with the PCA-Copula method reached 0.49 from 0.39, which indicated that the fitting degree of the model was improved, and the root mean square error and average relative error between the estimated and measured yields reduced by 30.2 kg/hm2 and 0.66%, respectively. These results indicated that the PCA-Copula method was a better approach for accessing the impact of droughts at the main growth stages of winter wheat on the yield. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

TI  - Using Critical Realism And Reflexivity To Explain Broadband Non-Adoption In Rural Australia
JO  - Australasian Journal of Information Systems
PY  - 2017
AB  - Australia is conducting a substantial nationwide provision of broadband. It is primarily a fixed line network but includes wireless and satellite networks in more remote areas. The rollout is under the control of the NBN Co, whose goal is ensuring access to fast broadband for all Australians. The NBN Co has recently recognized the importance of adoption by including premises activated as a KPI alongside service provision. Coverage and adoption reflect the two faces of the NBN rollout - as a technical program and as a social program. Adoption will be the ultimate measure of the success of the NBN as a social program. Ubiquitous Internet adoption across all sectors is necessary to maximize the promised benefits. The adoption of broadband is an important first step in achieving this. International experience suggests that broadband adoption is plateauing and this has prompted our proposal that there needs to be focus on non-adoption rather than adoption. We suggest that it is important to be able to explain the mechanisms by which individuals respond to the promise of the Internet. Only by so doing can we address issues. We contend that there needs to be more focus on those disenchanted or disinterested "non-users" who are never likely to adopt without specific targeted strategies. We argue for a critical realist perspective, more particularly reflexivity, to better represent the adoption context and to provide a grounding for explanations of the causes behind the decision not to adopt. We also propose possible common-sense strategies to reverse non-adoption. © 2017 Dobson & Jackson.

TI  - The Role Of Tree Landscape To Reduce Effects Of Urban Heat Islands: A Study In Two Brazilian Cities
JO  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
PY  - 2023
AB  - The growth of large cities has, in its relationship with the natural environment, caused environmental impacts that have severely transformed the local climate and influenced human well-being. The purpose of this research was to examine the variation of temperature using remote sensing, seeking to identify urban heat islands and the spatial distribution of the green infrastructure, focusing on urban trees. Curitiba was selected for this study, because the city received in 1990 the United Nations Environment Program award and is considered the "Ecological Capital" of Brazil. On the other hand, Sao Paulo was selected, because it is the largest city in South America. Landsat satellite images on vegetation coverage and urban thermic comfort index methods were used to track the hotter regions and greenery all over the cities. The benefits of urban trees were also estimated by i-Tree Canopy with regard to improve air quality. Besides protected areas, mainly where there are urban fragments of forest, some high-income neighborhoods are benefited by the green cover. The results highlighted that both cities, Curitiba and Sao Paulo, require effective governance practices to produce patterns of environmental justice, implementing green spaces in a balanced way for the population.

PY  - 2016
AB  - This study describes the development of a semi-automatic object-based image analysis approach for the detection and quantification of deforestation in Zalingei, Darfur, in consequence of the increasing concentration of refugees or internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region. The classification workflow is based on a multi-scale approach, ranging from the analysis of high resolution SPOT-4 to very high resolution IKONOS and QuickBird satellite imagery between 2003 and 2008. The overall accuracy rates for the classification of the SPOT 4 data ranged from 92% up to 95%, while those for the QuickBird and IKONOS classification have shown values of 88 and 87%, respectively. The resulting trends in woody vegetation cover were compared with the development of the local population and the variability of precipitation. The results show that the strong increase in human population in the Zalingei IDP camps can be associated with considerable decrease in woody vegetation in the camp vicinity. © 2015, © 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - Genus-Level Mapping Of Invasive Floating Aquatic Vegetation Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Remote Sensing
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Invasive floating aquatic vegetation negatively impacts wetland ecosystems and mapping this vegetation through space and time can aid in designing and assessing effective control strategies. Current remote sensing methods for mapping floating aquatic vegetation at the genus level relies on airborne imaging spectroscopy, resulting in temporal gaps because routine hyperspectral satellite coverage is not yet available. Here we achieved genus level and species level discrimination between two invasive aquatic vegetation species using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite data and machine-learning classifiers in summer and fall. The species of concern were water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and water primrose (Ludwigia spp.). Our classifiers also identified submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation at the community level. Random forest models using Sentinel-2 data achieved an average overall accuracy of 90\%, and class accuracies of 79-91\% and 85-95\% for water hyacinth and water primrose, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has mapped water primrose to the genus level using satellite remote sensing. Sentinel-2 derived maps compared well to those derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy and we also identified misclassifications that can be attributed to the coarser Sentinel-2 spectral and spatial resolutions. Our results demonstrate that the intra-annual temporal gaps between airborne imaging spectroscopy observations can be supplemented with Sentinel-2 satellite data and thus, rapidly growing/expanding vegetation can be tracked in real time. Such improvements have potential management benefits by improving the understanding of the phenology, spread, competitive advantages, and vulnerabilities of these aquatic plants.

TI  - Influence Of Land Use Change On Ecosystem Service Value Based On Gee In The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region From 1998 To 2018
JO  - Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - In sustainable development assessment of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the ability to dynamically estimate the value of ecosystem services is of great significance. This study considers the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as the research area, based on the google earth engine (GEE); the classification and decision tree (CART) classification algorithm was adopted to supervise and classify the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Operational Land Imager (TM/OLI) images in the study area in 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018, and land use types in these five periods were obtained. Quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes of land use in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 1998 to 2018 was carried out. Then, the ecosystem service value (ESV) equivalent estimation method was used to quantitatively estimate the ESV in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and combine it with a 15 km×15 km scale grid to detect its temporal and spatial dynamics. The main results were as follows. ① From 1998 to 2018, the area of construction land (increased by 16.67%) and grassland (reduced by 13.73%) in the six land use types in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was the largest, and the change in the proportion of water bodies (0.2%) was the smallest. ② The total value of ESV in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region experienced a short-term increase from 1998 to 2003 (an increase of 91.97×108 yuan), and continued to decrease from 2003 to 2018 (a decrease of 239.07×108 yuan), mainly related to the expansion of construction land area in the other three time periods excluding 1998 and 2003. Among the six land use types, the forest provides the highest value of ecosystem services, and the construction land and unused land provide the lowest value of ecosystem services. ③ The ESV time-space analysis based on the 15 km×15 km scale grid showed that the ESV medium area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region gradually decreased from 1998 to 2018, the ESV lower area and the higher area gradually increased, and the ESV lower-area growth rate was higher than for the higher area. ④ The revised value of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (sensitivity coefficient range 0- 0.83) has good significance and reliability. In future economic development, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region should rationally optimize the land use pattern and strengthen the protection of forest land, grassland, water bodies and cultivated land. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Analysing Hiker Movement Patterns Using Gps Data: Implications For Park Management
JO  - Computers, Environment and Urban Systems
PY  - 2014
AB  - In natural areas, park management organisations need to cater for economic, environmental, recreation and social demands and values. However, multifunctional land use also creates conflicts. Increased numbers of people using an area could exceed its ecological carrying capacity. The recreational quality of areas could be negatively impacted by conflicts in recreational behaviour. Therefore, park managers require spatio-temporal data on visitor flows, but there appears to be a shortage of suitable visitor data. If there are data available, these often do not deliver the information required by managers and there is little guidance on appropriate monitoring variables. This paper therefore combines user movement analysis with environmental and ecological factors for natural resource management. Through a case study we describe the entire working process from field data acquisition to usable park management information. GPS and itinerary data from 138 visitors to the Drents-Friese Wold National Park (the Netherlands) were collected to estimate visitor densities and distribution patterns within the park. Data acquisition is efficient in the working process, but careful error handling is a time consuming but necessary part of it. We introduce the definition of 'hard' and 'soft' errors to make spatial analysis more flexible. We show that walking speed, trip time and spatial distributions varied between park visitor groups. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis showed that factors such as the presence of marked trails, distance to facilities but not land use (such as forest or arable land) explained visitor distributions. Patterns differ between respondent groups based on group size and composition, which is also true for itinerary variables such as walking speed and trip time. The combination of high resolution location data with itinerary information from respondents provides a good impression of the different walking preferences of different respondent groups. We conclude therefore that combining GPS data with itinerary information is a useful tool in profiling different natural park visitors. This is useful information for park managers in steering tourists and in catering for different visitor demands in natural parks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Substantial investment from both the private and public sectors will be needed to achieve the ambitious Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2), which focuses on ending poverty and achieving zero hunger. To harness the private sector, high quality, transparent metrics are needed to ensure that every dollar spent reaches the most marginalized segments of a community while still helping institutions achieve their goals. Satellite-derived Earth observations will be instrumental in accelerating these investments and targeting them to the regions with the greatest need. This article proposes two quantitative metrics that could be used to evaluate the impact of private sector activities on SDG2: measuring increases in yield over baseline and ensuring input availability and affordability in all markets.

TI  - Spatial Partitioning And Temporal Evolution Of Australia's Total Water Storage Under Extreme Hydroclimatic Impacts
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2016
AB  - Australia experienced one of the worst droughts in history during the early 21st-century (termed the 'big dry'), exerting negative impacts on food production and water supply, with increased forest die-back and bushfires across large areas. Following the 'big dry', one of the largest La Nina events in the past century, in conjunction with an extreme positive excursion of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), resulted in dramatic increased precipitation from 2010 to 2011 (termed the 'big wet'), causing widespread flooding and a recorded sea level drop. Despite these extreme hydroclimatic impacts, the spatial partitioning and temporal evolution of total water storage across Australia remains unknown. In this study we investigated the spatial-temporal impacts of the recent 'big dry' and 'big wet' events on Australia's water storage dynamics using the total water storage anomaly (TWSA) data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Results showed widespread, continental-scale decreases in TWS during the 'big dry', resulting in a net loss of 3.89 +/- 0.47 cm (299 km(3)) total water, while the 'big wet' induced a sharp increase in TWS, equivalent to 11.68 +/- 0.52 cm (898 km(3)) of water, or three times the total water loss during the 'big dry'. We found highly variable continental patterns in water resources, involving differences in the direction, magnitude, and duration of TWS responses to drought and wet periods. These responses clustered into three distinct geographic zones that correlated well with the influences from multiple large-scale climate modes. Specifically, a persistent increasing trend in TWS was recorded over northern and northeastern Australia, where the climate is strongly influenced by El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). By contrast, western Australia, a region predominantly controlled by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), exhibited a continuous decline in TWS during the 'big dry' and only a subtle increase during the 'big wet', indicating a weak recovery of water storage. Southeastern Australia, influenced by combined ENSO, IOD and SAM interactions, exhibited a pronounced TWS drying trend during the 'big dry' followed by rapid TWS increases during the 'big wet', with complete water storage recoveries. A spatial intensification of the water cycle was further identified, with a wetting trend over wetter regions (northern and northeastern Australia) and a drying trend over drier regions (western Australia). Our results highlight the value of GRACE derived TWSA as an important indicator of hydrological system performance for improved water impact assessments and management of water resources across space and time.

TI  - Use Of Remote Sensing In Zoning's Studies For Terroir And Precision Viticulture: Implementation In Do Ca Rioja (Spain)
PY  - 2016
AB  - There are two principal ways of plot/exploitation management: Traditional or Conventional Managing (MC) and Precision viticulture (VP). Even though the technological requirements from these systems are different, in both cases, the Zoning or Variability Map for the Terroir (MVT) is required. MVT is a detailed mapping of the plot and enables to know the delineation and characterization of several sectors which make up its variability. The VP manages independently and optimized each of these sectors, allowing, among other things, optimizing the plantation's layout, rootstocks' selection, tillage, cover crop management, fertilization and maintenance programs, adjustment of water needs, diagnosis and pests and diseases management, monitoring of ripening, the harvest timing, etc. and all so in a localized manner according to the characteristics of each sector. Direct Method (MD) is the natural way to get the MVT. The map made from Direct Method defines and characterizes the different sectors indeed, and also provides some information about the terroir characteristics, which allow diagnosing the causes of heterogeneity and thus, handle them properly. Maps obtained by remote sensing from Spectral High Resolution Imaging (IEAR) provide relevant information, they are very affordable, and with an easy accuracy limits and they are obtained quicker than those made from MD. However, this kind of maps split the areas whose differentiation is due to the plant response in a specific situation that may be caused by a nearly endless options, and therefore, they vary with them. These maps are unable to discriminate sectors by the properties according to environmental factors (climate, lithology, geomorphology, soil) that affect the terroir variability, forbidding any direct action on them. Doing a MVT performed through a MD is expensive on large scales (very detailed studies) due to the gap about adequate perform delineations (net fixed error is related to sides length). However, IEAR technology provides a map which is obtained allowing to buffer this problem and also, reducing the costs. Both in maps obtained from MD or IEAR, the sampling quality is a key point. Both density of observations and the number of properties involved in the study determine its utility and the relative directives, when is possible under an international procedure (such as, OIV), must be a quality guarantee. In fact, both methodologies (MD and IEAR) are complementary for doing the MVT and, once the map (done through MD) is available, the right interpretations of the IEAR maps are possible, whether annual, seasonal, depending on the phenological status or any other circumstance that may affect the variability (pests, stress,...). MVT obtained like that, allows to the viticulturist address the most ambitious goal: the product optimization and homogenization. Specifically, in a short or medium term and by the management carried out with the VP's performance on the terroir's properties in different sectors of the parcel/plot, resulting in the highest uniformity as possible, and also, in the product. In this work, we worked on terroir's variability and the vineyard management systems (MC and VP), highlighting the relevance of mapping, the need for MVT and its complementary performance related to the MD, and the use of remote sensing systems (IEAR) as another discriminative method.

TI  - Delineating Mixed Urban "Jobs-Housing" Patterns At A Fine Scale By Using High Spatial Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery
JO  - COMPLEXITY
PY  - 2020
AB  - The spatial distribution pattern of jobs and housing plays a vital role in urban planning and traffic construction. However, obtaining the jobs-housing distribution at a fine scale (e.g., the perspective of individual jobs-housing attribute) presents difficulties due to a lack of social media data and useful models. With user data acquired from a location-based service provider in China, this study employs a deep bag-of-features network (BagNet) to classify remote-sensing (RS) images into various jobs-housing types. Considering Wuhan, one of the fastest developing cities in China, as a case study area, three jobs-housing types (i.e., only working, only living, and both working and living) at the land-parcel level are obtained. We demonstrate that the multiscale random sampling method can reduce the influence of image noise, increase the utilization of training data, and reduce network overfitting. By altering the network structure and the training strategy, BagNet achieved excellent fitting accuracy for identifying each jobs-housing type (overall accuracy > 0.84 and kappa > 0.8). For the first time, we demonstrate that urban socioeconomic characteristics can be obtained from high-resolution RS images using deep learning techniques. Additionally, we conclude that the total level of mixing within Wuhan is not high at present; however, Wuhan is continuously improving the mixture of jobs and housing. This study has reference value for extracting urban socioeconomic characteristics from RS images and could be used in urban planning as well as government management.

TI  - Matching Traffic Demand In Geo Multibeam Satellites: The Joint Use Of Dynamic Beamforming And Precoding Under Practical Constraints
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting
PY  - 2022
AB  - To adjust for the non-uniform spatiotemporal nature of traffic patterns, next-generation high throughput satellite (HTS) systems can benefit from recent technological advancements in the space-segment in order to dynamically design traffic-adaptive beam layout plans (ABLPs). In this work, we propose a framework for dynamic beamforming (DBF) optimization and adaptation in dynamic environments. Given realistic traffic patterns and a limited power budget, we propose a feasible DBF operation for a geostationary multibeam HTS network. The goal is to minimize the mismatch between the traffic demand and the offered capacity under practical constraints. These constraints are dictated by the traffic-aware design requirements, the on-board antenna system limitations, and the signaling considerations in the K-band. Noting that the ABLP is agnostic about the inherent inter-beam interference (IBI), we construct an interference simulation environment using irregularly shaped beams for a large-scale multibeam HTS system. To cope with IBI, the combination of on-board DBF and on-ground precoding is considered. For precoded and non-precoded HTS configurations, the proposed design shows better traffic-matching capabilities in comparison to a regular beam layout plan. Lastly, we provide trade-off analyses between system-level key performance indicators for different realistic non-uniform traffic patterns. © 1963-12012 IEEE.

TI  - Sbas-Insar-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Along The North Lancang River, Tibetan Plateau
JO  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landslides pose huge challenges to the economic activities in mountainous areas at present, while large numbers of landslide disasters have developed in the Hengduan Mountains area in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. Accurate landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) serves as a critical measure to predict the serious risks that may be encountered in engineering activities. However, previous landslide susceptibility assessment can only play a limited role in the real-time analysis of current activities of slopes. In this study, the deformation rates of the slopes along the Lancang River were determined using the SBAS-InSAR technique. Meanwhile, the landslide susceptibility along the north Lancang River was assessed using the frequency ratio (FR), random forest and FR-RF models, and the precision of the assessment results was verified according to receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs). Finally, a refined landslide susceptibility map was developed by integrating the deformation rates and landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) using a contingency matrix. As indicated by the deformation rates calculated using the SBAS-InSAR technique according to ascending and descending data show that the RADARSAT-2 descending data yielded more precise deformation results. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of the three assessment models were 0.866, 0.897, and 0.916, respectively, indicating that the assessment results obtained with the FR-RF model are the most precise. In the upgraded landslide susceptibility map, the areas with high and very high landslide susceptibility increased by 2.97\%. Meanwhile, a total of 563,430 grid cells showed an increase in landslide susceptibility, accounting for 11.15\% of all the grid cells. Most especially, the Xueru and Ritong areas exhibited a significant increase in landslide susceptibility, and it has been verified by remote sensing images and field surveys that both areas are subject to landslide risks. Therefore, the upgraded landslide susceptibility map has a better prediction performance and can provide valuable support for the decision making in the construction of major engineering facilities and the prevention and remediation of landslides.

JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Liger Leadership Academy (LLA) is a Cambodian educational institution whose education model is based on a comprehensive, internationally competitive, and innovative STEM curriculum. In August 2018, the Academy formed a group of highly motivated and capable Cambodian scholars, ages 15 to 17 years old, to develop the first Cambodian 1U CubeSat. The project represents the first step undertaken by Cambodia toward sustainable space activities. The CubeSat is used as an educational tool to enable participants to practically understand the intricacies of space environment, systems engineering, project management, and more, by mixing various engineering and scientific disciplines. The CubeSat's main missions are an amateur digipeater and Earth photography. The digipeater mission familiarizes LLA scholars with communication and instills the value of amateur radio operations. LLA scholars use the Earth photography mission to familiarize themselves with programming and the science behind Earth remote sensing. One of LLA's goals is to create collaborative outreach programs with other schools and individuals throughout Cambodia to raise STEM awareness and promote education using engaging projects. The two missions are key to supporting these two goals. As of February 2019, LLA procured fundamental equipment to establish their preliminary ground station and successfully started understanding the basics of communication and satellite operations by tracking NOAA imaging satellites. The next step is to develop a comprehensive tutorial on satellite communication to be distributed throughout Cambodia for the promotion of project-based educational activities. This paper reports the efforts undertaken by LLA and its partners toward the execution of its CubeSat project design, development, and operations. The paper also presents the impact of space engineering-based capacity building and its contribution toward the execution of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in terms of education, gender equality, and inequality reduction in Cambodia.

TI  - Landscape Pattern And Ecosystem Service Value Changes: Implications For Environmental Sustainability Planning For The Rapidly Urbanizing Summer Capital Of The Philippines
JO  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
PY  - 2013
AB  - This study analyzes the dynamics of the socio-ecological system of Baguio City, the summer capital of the Philippines, in order to derive meaningful information for use in planning its sustainable development. Remote sensing data and geographic information systems techniques, in conjunction with spatial metrics and socio-economic information, were used to facilitate the analysis. The spatial and socio-economic components of Baguio's rapid urbanization over the past 21 years (1988-2009) were the major factors that contributed to dramatic changes in the setting's natural landscape, as indicated by an almost threefold increase in its built-up area, at the expense of other land-use/land-cover classes. Its rapid growth has seen the city's population exceed its designed ceiling of 25,000 people by a factor of at least twelve. Such landscape changes and population growth have resulted in a substantial decrease in the overall annual ecosystem service value (ESV) of Baguio of approximately 60\%. The human-to-ESV ratio in the city has also decreased over this same period, from 1:31 (US\$/year) in 1988 to just 1:7 in 2009. Although Baguio has enjoyed economic, political and social prominence for more than a century, its rapid population growth and urban expansion are now exerting pressure on its natural landscape, jeopardizing the environmental sustainability of this highly valued hill station. This study offers important insights to all, but especially those in fast-urbanizing regions, as Baguio's case offers learning experience valuable for achieving more successful landscape and urban planning.

TI  - Climate-Change-Driven Deterioration Of The Condition Of Floodplain Forest And The Future For The Avifauna
JO  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
PY  - 2014
AB  - AimWe used models of remotely sensed estimates of forest-stand condition (degree of die-back) with models of avian responses to stand condition to determine how the avifauna responded to a 13-year drought, and how the avifauna might respond to a predicted much warmer and drier climate in the next 60 years. LocationFloodplain forests of the southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. MethodsWe selected 45 2-ha locations that spanned the full range of stand condition and conducted bird surveys and rapid assessments of breeding, which involved repeated measurements over the breeding season. These values were modelled as functions of stand condition and several other on-site predictors. We made hindcast estimates of the proportions of forest in different stand-condition classes. We developed a trajectory of change in these proportions under the regionally downscaled estimates of climate change under the A1F1 IPCC emission scenario, which were linked with patterns of change in drier, hotter extant forests. The hindcast and projected values were coupled with the results of the statistical models for the avifauna to provide future projections for the avifauna. ResultsThree avifaunal variables (measures of abundance, effective species richness and total breeding score summed for all species) were strongly related to stand condition. Hindcast estimates based on the assumption of original good condition suggested that the response variables had declined by >25\% since 1750. Projected declines in the response variables from 2009 to 2070 were >29\%, while differences between 1750 and 2070 were >58\%. ConclusionsStand condition strongly influences birds, so that reliable estimates of avifaunal change can be made by using remotely sensed estimates of stand condition. Given probable changes in forest condition under climate change, we project that the prospects for these avifauna are dire under the A1F1 or more extreme emission scenarios.

TI  - Top-Down And Bottom-Up Inventory Approach For Above Ground Forest Biomass And Carbon Monitoring In Redd Framework Using Multi-Resolution Satellite Data
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2013
AB  - This study deals with the future scope of REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ regimes for measuring and monitoring the current state and dynamics of carbon stocks over time with integrated geospatial and field-based biomass inventory approach. Multi-temporal and multi-resolution geospatial synergic approach incorporating satellite sensors from moderate to high resolution with stratified random sampling design is used. The inventory process involves a continuous forest inventory to facilitate the quantification of possible CO2 reductions over time using statistical up-scaling procedures on various levels. The combined approach was applied on a regional scale taking Himachal Pradesh (India), as a case study, with a hierarchy of forest strata representing the forest structure found in India. Biophysical modeling implemented revealed power regression model as the best fit (R 2 = 0.82) to model the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and biomass which was further implemented to calculate multi-temporal above ground biomass and carbon sequestration. The calculated value of net carbon sequestered by the forests totaled to 11.52 million tons (Mt) over the period of 20 years at the rate of 0.58 Mt per year since 1990 while CO2 equivalent reduced from the environment by the forests under study during 20 years comes to 42.26 Mt in the study area. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The study was conducted on a test plot located in the Yasnogorodsky district of the Tula Region; With a camera with fisheye lens photographs were taken at different points of the plot, each point with a geographical reference. Subsequently, the possible relationship between the information extracted from the classification of the photographs using the CAN-EYE software (LAI, percentage of vegetation) and the vegetation indices (Ratio, NDVI, SAVI and EVI) calculated with spectral values obtained from the different channels of Sentinel-2 (B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8a) were evaluated. Finally, best regression models obtained for each phase of the winter wheat development were used to create the maps of LAI and percentage of vegetation. According to our results, Sentinel-2 can be successfully used to map LAI in the studied region at the shooting stage of winter wheat development with accuracy of 85 %. At other stages and for percentage of vegetation the accuracy of the models was below 50 %. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

TI  - Early Warning Of Oil Spills Based On On-Board Imagery Pre-Processing Algorithm
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2019
AB  - Marine and coastal ecosystems fragility is often threatened by oil spills from offshore fields, super-tankers or accidents. Unfortunately, existing ground technologies do not provide a quick response to these events that, without contingency planning, could easily turn into environmental catastrophes. Thanks to the advent of the so-called New Space, even more companies are able to deliver public and private users global monitoring services relying on their own space infrastructures for Earth Observation based on cost-effective nano-satellites. This is the case of ICEYE, who is building a constellation of SAR satellites to support a service level where any location on Earth can be reliably imaged every 1-3 hours, initially launching a constellation of 18 SAR satellites by the end of 2020. The extensive use of high performances off-the-shelf components enhanced small satellites capabilities paving the way for new mission concepts. In this context, it is introduced an on-board SAR image pre-processing algorithm for oil spills detection. In case of SAR imagery, the basic methodology could be summarized in four main steps: isolation of dark signatures; feature extraction; feature test against pre- defined or statistical values and finally, probabilities for each candidate spot are computed to determine whether it is an oil spill or a look-alike phenomenon. Results of a Software-In-the-Loop test campaign will be presented to demonstrate the on-board implementation capability of the algorithm. The proposed on-board image pre-processing algorithm represents a new approach to Earth Observation data exploitation: it quickly provides essential information, while streamlining data transfer. Due to the high revisit time, LEO small satellites will be able to detect potential oil spills rapidly, therefore, enabling a service of early warnings issue. In conclusion, New Space companies will be able to tackle environmental issues while sustainably addressing customer needs. Copyright © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

TI  - Evaluation Of Remote Sensing Ecological Index Based On Soil And Water Conservation On The Effectiveness Of Management Of Abandoned Mine Landscaping Transformation
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
PY  - 2022
AB  - Abandoned mines are typical areas of soil erosion. Landscape transformation of abandoned mines is an important means to balance the dual objectives of regional ecological restoration and industrial heritage protection, but the secondary development and construction process of mining relics require long-term monitoring with objective scientific indicators and effective assessment of their management effectiveness. This paper takes Tongluo Mountain Mining Park in Chongqing as an example and uses a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on Landsat-8 image data to assess the spatial and temporal differences in the dynamic changes in the ecological and environmental quality of tertiary relic reserves with different degrees of development and protection in the park. Results showed that: (1) The effect of vegetation cover, which can significantly improve soil and water conservation capacity. (2) The RSEI is applicable to the evaluation of the effectiveness of ecological management of mines with a large amount of bare soil areas. (3) The mean value of the RSEI in the region as a whole increased by 0.090, and the mean values of the RSEI in the primary, secondary and tertiary relic reserves increased by 0.121, 0.112 and 0.006, respectively. (4) The increase in the RSEI in the study area is mainly related to the significant decrease in the dryness index (NDBSI) and the increase in the humidity index (WET). The remote sensing ecological index can objectively reflect the difference in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the ecological environment in tertiary relic protection, and this study provides a theoretical reference for the ecological assessment of secondary development-based management under difficult site conditions.

TI  - A Secure And Fair Negotiation Protocol In Highly Complex Utility Space Based On Cone-Constraints
JO  - Proceedings - 2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology, IAT 2009
PY  - 2009
AB  - Multiple issue negotiation represents an important field of study. Our work focuses on negotiations with multiple interdependent issues in which agent utility functions are highly nonlinear. This paper presents the following three novel points on multiple interdependent issues negotiations. First, we define a utility function based on "cone-constraints". This utility function is more realistic than existing works and configures the risk attitudes to the cone-constraint. If the utility function has cone-constraint features, the utility space becomes extremely nonlinear, making it very difficult to find the optimal agreement point. Second, we propose the concept of approximated fairness and the proximity to the Nash bargaining solution. Fairness represents how fairly the agreement divides the total utility per agent. The proximity to the Nash bargaining solution represents how close a contract is to the Nash bargaining solution. Third, we propose a Secure & Fair Mediator Protocol (SFMP) with approximated fairness. SFMP can completely conceal the agent's private information and reach an agreement considering the fairness, the Nash bargaining solution, and social welfare. We demonstrate that SFMP is better for Nash contract and social welfare than existing work in highly nonlinear utility space. Moreover, we demonstrate that SFMP with a genetic algorithm (GA) is superior for finding multiple Pareto-optimal agreement points in a very highly complex negotiation compared with a search algorithm to find a contract that directly maximizes Nash products. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - We propose novel strategies for primate experimentation that are ethically valuable and pragmatically useful for cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychiatric research. Specifically, we propose Natural Laboratory Complex or Natural Labs, which are a combination of indoor-outdoor structures for studying free moving and socially housed primates in natural or naturalistic environment. We contend that Natural Labs are pivotal to improve primate welfare, and at the same time to implement longitudinal and socio-ecological studies of primate brain and behavior. Currently emerging advanced technologies and social systems (including recent COVID-19 induced “remote” infrastructures) can speed-up cognitive neuroscience approaches in freely behaving animals. Experimental approaches in natural(istic) settings are not in competition with conventional approaches of laboratory investigations, and could establish several benefits at the ethical, experimental, and economic levels.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges today, is the need to feed a growing population. Considering climate change and the effect it may have on agriculture systems, the sustainable intensification of food production is a necessity. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to address the issues related to the large-scale stressors that can present a barrier to the current efforts for sustainable intensification of food production in Qatar. It relies on remote sensing imagery as the primary dataset owing to the ability of the satellite sensors to cheaply gather data with good areal coverage and spatial resolution, and with added benefit of repeated surveys from the satellite overpasses over a given area. The steps of the proposed methodology developed in this research include: (a) image processing for training and prediction using neural networks; (b) extraction of atmospheric and surface features that can directly affect greenhouse operations, e.g. those related to land and water resources, and energy requirements; (c) formulation of a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) framework using surrogate modelling for the maximization of the crop productivity objective; (d) development of GIS database augmented with recommender systems. The results obtained so far are promising, with root mean squared percentage error of 11.93 for the crop water demand prediction, and it is envisaged that the proposed development of a smart geospatial framework with predictive capabilities, EWF optimization, and augmented GIS will facilitate for informed policy development aimed at the success of the food security programs in Qatar. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects Of Grazing Exclusion On Spring And Autumn Pastures In Arid Regions Of China: Insights From Field Surveys And Landsat Images
JO  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - Overgrazing has caused serious grassland degradation, and grazing exclusion (GE) has been considered an effective and economic approach for restoring vegetation and soils in degraded grassland. In this study, we evaluated the ecosystem restoration of two types of degraded spring and autumn pasture in arid regions of northwest China, based on field surveys (community structure characteristics, soil C and N) and Landsat images (greenness and wetness). In temperate typical steppe (TS), our findings indicated that GE significantly increased plant height, coverage, biomass, soil C and N, as well as greenness and wetness values from Landsat images, however GE decreased plant density and species diversity. Restoration on greenness and wetness peaked in the fourth and fifth years, respectively, following GE. The restoration of greenness and wetness showed bimodal curves during growing season. In temperate desert (TD), results revealed that community structure characteristics, greenness, and wetness improved after GE, and the restoration of greenness and wetness increased with duration of GE. Soil C and N however, did not recover significantly after six years of GE. The restoration of greenness and wetness remained stable during growing-season months. Our findings suggest that longer GE might be considered in the restoration of TD, whereas short-term (not more than 4-5 years) GE, reduction in the livestock load or mowing regularly may be more appropriate for TS. Decision to adopt measures of GE and the duration of GE should be reasonably determined according to the specific grassland type. This research can provide guidance for the restoration of degraded grassland ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions all over the world.

TI  - Comparison Of The Efficiency And Cost Of West Nile Virus Surveillance Methods In California
JO  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
PY  - 2015
AB  - Surveillance systems for West Nile virus (WNV) combine several methods to determine the location and timing of viral amplification. The value of each surveillance method must be measured against its efficiency and costs to optimize integrated vector management and suppress WNV transmission to the human population. Here we extend previous comparisons of WNV surveillance methods by equitably comparing the most common methods after standardization on the basis of spatial sampling density and costs, and by estimating optimal levels of sampling effort for mosquito traps and sentinel chicken flocks. In general, testing for evidence of viral RNA in mosquitoes and public-reported dead birds resulted in detection of WNV approximately 2-5 weeks earlier than serological monitoring of sentinel chickens at equal spatial sampling density. For a fixed cost, testing of dead birds reported by the public was found to be the most cost effective of the methods, yielding the highest number of positive results per \$1000. Increased spatial density of mosquito trapping was associated with more precise estimates of WNV infection prevalence in mosquitoes. Our findings also suggested that the most common chicken flock size of 10 birds could be reduced to six to seven without substantial reductions in timeliness or sensitivity. We conclude that a surveillance system that uses the testing of dead birds reported by the public complemented by strategically timed mosquito and chicken sampling as agency resources allow would detect viral activity efficiently in terms of effort and costs, so long as susceptible bird species that experience a high mortality rate from infection with WNV, such as corvids, are present in the area.

TI  - An Ecological Land Classification Approach To Modeling The Production Of Forest Biomass
JO  - FORESTRY CHRONICLE
PY  - 2011
AB  - Forest site classification is a prerequisite to successful integrated forest resources planning and management. Traditionally, site classification has emphasized a phytocentric approach, with tools such as the site index having a rich and long history in forest site evaluation. The concept of site index was primarily devised to assess site productivity of an even-aged, single-species stand. Site index has been the primary method of forest site evaluation in support of management for traditional forest products. However, this method of site classification has been criticized as the needs, perspectives and social values of the public regarding forest management have changed the emphasis from timber production to multiple-value forestry practices. There are alternative approaches to forest site classification that have the potential to meet the growing demands placed on forest information for inventory and modeling purposes. Ecological Land Classification (ELC), is a phytogeocentric approach that stratifies the landscape into ecologically meaningful units (ecosites) based on substrate characteristics, moisture regime and canopy composition. This approach offers a more holistic view of site productivity evaluation; however, until recently it has been difficult to acquire data to support widespread mapping of ecosites. Remote sensing technology along with predictive modeling and interpretive mapping techniques make the application of an ecosite-based approach at the forest landscape level possible. As forest management moves towards the consideration of a broader set of resources (e.g., woody biomass), there is an opportunity to develop new tools for linking forest productivity to the sustainable production of forest bioproducts with forest ecosites as a solid foundation for segmenting the landscape.

We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While “Remote Sensing” is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords “sustainable development” and “remote sensing” have been growing steadily since 1975, “natural resource modeling” and “machine learning” have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use. These advancements benefit society by increasing access to essential resources in a fair manner, and they have positive impacts on both the public and private sectors, enabling evidence-based policymaking and responsible resource extraction. Collaboration and investment in these technologies are crucial for achieving sustainable development and preserving natural resources for future generations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - What Happened In Finland To Increase Home Hemodialysis?
JO  - Hemodialysis International
PY  - 2008
AB  - Finland is geographically a rather large country with a relatively sparse population (5.3 million). Home hemodialysis (HHD) was started in Helsinki 40 years ago and in the early years it was only used in selected patients. However, by the late 1980s HHD almost disappeared owing to the advent of CAPD and new HD centers. Towards the end of the 1990s, it became evident that PD had limitations and new ways had to be found to individualize HD, improve the outcome, increase capacity, and limit the growth of costs of HD. After careful planning, HHD was reinstituted at the Helsinki University Hospital in 1998 and since then the program has grown steadily. By December 31, 2007, altogether 163 patients had started at home. This has required changes in the predialysis program where the "home first" policy was adopted. Other important features include close cooperation with other nephrological centers as well as centralized HHD training that also supports more remote hospitals. Since then this therapy has been started in several other academic and in some smaller hospitals, and at the end of last year about 4%5 of all Finnish dialysis patients (n=1.600) were on HHD (prevalence 11.8/million). In the Helsinki metropolitan area this treatment is the most economical modality (estimated annual global costs €37.000), comparable to self-care satellite HD and CAPD. A successful HHD program requires a well-organized predialysis program, a highly motivated multidisciplinary team, and well-developed training networks. © Journal compilation © 2008 International Society for Hemodialysis.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Remotely Sensed Forest Loss Data In The Cordillera Administrative Region, Philippines
JO  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) in the Philippines is among the last forest frontiers in the country and is also home to 13 major watersheds in Northern Luzon that supply irrigation and hydroelectricity to other regions. However, it is faced with the deterioration of the quality of its watersheds due to forest loss driven mainly by agricultural expansion and illegal logging. Thus, this study was conducted to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of forest loss that could serve as a basis for policy decisions. Also, this paper determined the strength of relationships using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between forest loss and seven independent variables, which includes forest cover, agricultural areas, built-up, road network, and socio-economic data. This study utilized the Hansen Global Forest Change (HGFC), a Landsat-derived dataset from 2001 to 2019. Results revealed that 70,925 hectares (ha) of forest loss were detected with an annual deforestation rate of 3,744 ha/year across the region. Based on the validation, the accuracy of the HGFC data is 72\%, but great caution should be observed when using the data with less than 0.2 ha due to very low accuracy. On a region-wide analysis, only the forest cover had a strong association with the forest loss with a computed r-value of 0.78. Conversely, on a provincial level, the explanatory variables had a strong to moderately strong correlation with deforestation. Hence, immediate, science-based, and sustained regional and multi-stakeholder efforts are necessary to conserve and protect the remaining forest cover in the region.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability In White Shark (Carcharodon Carcharias) Movement Ecology During Residency And Migration Phases In The Western North Atlantic
JO  - Frontiers in Marine Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding how mobile, marine predators use three-dimensional space over time is central to inform management and conservation actions. Combining tracking technologies can yield powerful datasets over multiple spatio-temporal scales to provide critical information for these purposes. For the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), detailed movement and migration information over ontogeny, including inter- and intra-annual variation in timing of movement phases, is largely unknown in the western North Atlantic (WNA), a relatively understudied area for this species. To address this need, we tracked 48 large juvenile to adult white sharks between 2012 and 2020, using a combination of satellite-linked and acoustic telemetry. Overall, WNA white sharks showed repeatable and predictable patterns in horizontal movements, although there was variation in these movements related to sex and size. While most sharks undertook an annual migratory cycle with the majority of time spent over the continental shelf, some individuals, particularly adult females, made extensive forays into the open ocean as far east as beyond the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Moreover, increased off-shelf use occurred with body size even though migration and residency phases were conserved. Summer residency areas included coastal Massachusetts and portions of Atlantic Canada, with individuals showing fidelity to specific regions over multiple years. An autumn/winter migration occurred with sharks moving rapidly south to overwintering residency areas in the southeastern United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, where they remained until the following spring/summer. While broad residency and migration periods were consistent, migratory timing varied among years and among individuals within years. White sharks monitored with pop-up satellite-linked archival tags made extensive use of the water column (0–872 m) and experienced a broad range of temperatures (−0.9 – 30.5°C), with evidence for differential vertical use based on migration and residency phases. Overall, results show dynamic inter- and intra-annual three-dimensional patterns of movements conserved within discrete phases. These results demonstrate the value of using multiple tag types to track long-term movements of large mobile species. Our findings expand knowledge of the movements and migration of the WNA white shark population and comprise critically important information to inform sound management strategies for the species.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring Of Surface Water Area During 1989–2019 In The Hetao Plain Using Landsat Data In Google Earth Engine
JO  - Water (Switzerland)
PY  - 2020
AB  - The spatio-temporal change of the surface water is very important to agricultural, economic, and social development in the Hetao Plain, as well as the structure and function of the ecosystem. To understand the long-term changes of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain, we used all available Landsat images (7534 scenes) and adopted the modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map the open-surface water from 1989 to 2019 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. We further analyzed precipitation, temperature, and irrigated area, revealing the impact of climate change and human activities on long-term surface water changes. The results show the following. (1) In the last 31 years, the maximum, seasonal, and annual average water body area values in the Hetao Plain have exhibited a downward trend. Meanwhile, the number of maximum, seasonal, and permanent water bodies displayed a significant upward trend. (2) The variation of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain is mainly affected by the maximum water body area, while the variation of the water body number is mainly affected by the number of minimum water bodies. (3) Precipitation has statistically significant positive effects on the water body area and water body number, which has statistically significant negative effects with temperature and irrigation. The findings of this study can be used to help the policy-makers and farmers understand changing water resources and its driving mechanism and provide a reference for water resources management, agricultural irrigation, and ecological protection. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Considering The Fate Of Electronic Tags: Interactions With Stakeholders And User Responsibility When Encountering Tagged Aquatic Animals
JO  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2014
AB  - 1. The use of electronic tagging (e.g. acoustic, archival and satellite telemetry) to study the behavior and ecology of aquatic animals has increased dramatically over the past decade. As scientists continue to use these tools, it is inevitable that other researchers and the public at-large will encounter animals carrying such tags with increasing frequency. If the animals appear burdened or injured by the tag (e.g. showing signs of trauma), or if the tag is functionally impaired (e.g. cracked or severely biofouled), these encounters have the potential to generate conflict with various wildlife stakeholders (e.g. tourists/operators, divers, fishers, hunters) that can negatively affect research efforts and undermine conservation work. Yet, these encounters also present an unparalleled opportunity to advance the field of biotelemetry by improving animal welfare, tagging technology and practices, while also gaining the trust and support of wildlife stakeholders. Therefore, as scientists, it is important to consider the fate of our electronic tags. Here we consider tagged animals as encountered by different user groups and discuss the potential steps and recommendations that scientists can take to improve tagging techniques and animal welfare as a result. We also discuss interactions with stakeholders and the manifold benefits if such interactions are taken into account and embraced. We examine the situation where a researcher encounters, and is able and trained to handle a previously tagged animal equipped with a functionally impaired tag and/or the animal is exhibiting signs of burden due to the tag. We generate a decision tree for scientists faced with such a scenario and discuss the best course of action, whereas such a situation was relatively unlikely in the past, but is now a reality in all aquatic animal tagging studies. The framework in which these issues are discussed is novel and failure to address them can significantly impede advances in the development and use of biotelemetry and even one's ability to conduct research. It is our hope that our essay stimulates further discourse, debate, technological improvements and consideration of the fate of electronic tagging.

TI  - Harnessing Systems Engineering Methodology In Using Earth Science Research Data For Real Applications
PY  - 2004
AB  - For the last three decades, Earth science remote sensing technologies have been providing an enormous amount of useful data and information serving to broaden our understanding of the home planet as a system. NASA's Earth science program has deployed about 18 complex satellites and is in the process of defining and launching multiple observing systems in this decade. At the same time, the European Community and many other countries such as Russia, France, India, Japan, and China have also significantly, contributed to Earth science research. To date, the majority of such efforts have concentrated on expanding our scientific understanding of the multiple nonlinear and chaotic processes of Earth's behavior. In recent years legislators and stakeholders have put serious pressure on the science community to devote more attention to making use of scientific results for societal benefit. For instance, there are a number of areas such as energy forecasting, aviation safety, agricultural efficiency, disaster management, air quality and public health that can directly take advantage of Earth science results to analyze and predict large scale problems and conditions. This is becoming even more important now that we live in a global economy interconnected via the internet and transportation systems; regional environmental conditions can have far reaching impact across continental boundaries. These factors dictate requirements for global data that can help us assess and control the devastating problems of famine, water resources, wildfires, human health and more. To do this requires a serious, organized, and systematic approach that transfers fundamental research products to the applied sciences domain. This paper presents a systems engineering and management process that can effectively make such transfer of data to the user community. Examples are presented on how the above decision making framework can help in solving critical problems such as the spread of vector borne diseases, forecasts of harmful algal blooms as well as forest fires and wildfires, and the intercontinental transport of dust storms and pollution.

TI  - Profiling Information Needs And Behaviour Of Syrian Refugees Displaced To Egypt: An Exploratory Study
JO  - Information and Learning Science
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the information needs and information-seeking behaviour of Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data in the form of three focus groups were collected from 37 Syrian refugees who have displaced to Egypt and are concentrated mainly in Greater Cairo. In-depth interviews were conducted in September 2016. Findings: Data collected about the demography of Syrian refugees revealed that they tend to be men, slightly more than half, mostly with no formal education, with an average age in the mid-30’s, labelled as low-income persons and mostly single. Findings also showed that much of the information needed by Syrian refugees was described as realistic and real, but some was less clearly defined. All Syrian refugees’ information needs are strongly linked to their daily tasks. The majority of Syrian refugees reported that their priority information need was to be aware of the situation in their home country, followed by issues related to their states of the diaspora that they are passing through, such as services provided to their children, shelter and aid in general, as well as rights and obligations related to their refugee status. They also showed that they need information to help get the right or any appropriate work in the host country (Egypt). The study showed that many Syrian refugees were seeking information that meets their basic daily needs. It also showed that the information-seeking behaviour profile of a very large number of Syrian refugees was to prefer informal sources to formal sources to meet everyday problems, as well as troubles challenged by them. A very large number of Syrian refugees revealed that the verbal communication with friends and families were identified as the most popular informal sources of information sought. The study revealed that most of the Syrian refugees were able to use a variety of technologies for the purpose of communication with others, especially mobile phones, being the most key communication devices followed by almost all of them. The use of assisting technologies and devices, such as the computer and the internet and its vast applications proved to be meaningful by Syrian refugees. Other assisting technologies are also heavily used by Syrian refugees, particularly social media, including social networking sites and many other mobile applications. In addition, Syrian refugees have also relied on other technologies and tools to meet their information needs, including television and satellite channels, especially Arabic, which are widely distributed in the Arab environment. Because of some difficulties related to education and awareness, a number of Syrian refugees were not using any type of library. Syrian refugees have met several problems and challenges in accessing information. Such problem may make it difficult to find basic services, make informed decisions and stay in communication with families. Such problems have also a significant impact on their seeking and using information. Finding appropriate work to get money to secure housing, psychological burdens suffered concerning the image of being refugees, emotional distress, lack of accessing some basic services such as education and transportation, lack of financial resources, lack of time, lack of motivation and cultural and social barriers, were significant to Syrian refugees when seeking information. In spite of these challenges and problems met by Syrian refugees, a good number of them wished to improve their image as refugees and to improve their disastrous situation. Based on the review of the existing literature, as well as the findings of this study, further research is needed to understand information needs and information dissemination among Syrian refugees fled to Egypt and how they perceive, select, use, access and evaluate sources of information. Proper strategies should be designed towards the use of traditional and commonly used information dissemination channels among these refugees, such as cultural performances nd group discussions. Research is also needed on the impact of illiteracy on the use of information by this category of information users. Owing to the fragile role played by different types of libraries in meeting the information needs of refugees, further research is seriously needed in this regard. In addition, appropriate services should be provided to refugees. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt. It does not cover any other refugees inside or outside Egypt, although they significantly exist in Egypt, such as Palestinians, Sudanese, Iraqis, Yemenis, Africans and many other nationals. Any conclusions resulting from this study are limited to only Syrian refugees hosted by Egypt. Practical implications: This study tries to investigate the Syrian refugees’ information needs and behaviours in terms of their thoughts, motivations, attitudes, preferences and challenges met by them in their search of information. It tries to look at the factors and characteristics that affect this search. Any results from this study may generate interest and create awareness of the information needs of refugees among advocates who are interested in such groups of information users. Originality/value: This study attempted to identify a significant gap in identifying the information needs and information-seeking behaviour of Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt. It is the first study of its type to address, in a systematic way, this disadvantaged group resettled and hosted by Egypt. Syrian refugees displaced to Egypt have become a matter of major concern that should be addressed and met by serious academic researchers, as well as by official authorities. The literature on the topic of this research revealed that further research is still needed to be undertaken on such group of information users, as there is a very limited research conducted on this topic in developing and Arab countries, including Egypt, particularly among academic library and information professionals. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Quantifying And Modelling Decay In Forecast Proficiency Indicates The Limits Of Transferability In Land-Cover Classification
JO  - Methods in Ecology and Evolution
PY  - 2018
AB  - The ability to provide reliable projections for the current and future distribution of land-cover is fundamental if we wish to protect and manage our diminishing natural resources. Two inter-related revolutions make map productions feasible at unprecedented resolutions—the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data and the development of machine-learning algorithms. However, ground-truthed data needed for training models is in most cases spatially and temporally clustered. Therefore, map production requires extrapolation of models from one place to another and the uncertainty cost of such extrapolation is rarely explored. In other words, the focus has mainly been on projections, and less on quantifying their reliability. Using the concept of “forecast horizon”, we suggest that the predictability of land-cover classification models should be quantitatively explored as a continuum against distances measured along multiple dimensions—space, time, environmental and spectral. Focusing on ten agricultural sites from England and using models specifically designed to predict multivariate decay-curves, we ask: how does a model's predictive performance decay with distance? More specifically, we explored if we could predict the proficiency (kappa statistics) of a model trained in one site when making predictions in another site based on the spatial, temporal, spectral and environmental distances between sites. We found that model proficiency decays with distance between sites in each dimension. More importantly, we found for the first time, that it is possible to predict the performance a model transferred to or from a novel site will have, based on its distances from known sites. The spectral distance variables were the most important when predicting model transferability. Exploring model transferability as a continuum may have multiple usages including predicting uncertainty values in space and time, prioritisation of strategies for ground-truth data collection, and optimising model characteristics for defined tasks. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Ecosystem Classification And Inventory Maps As Surrogates For Ground Beetle Assemblages In Boreal Forest
JO  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
PY  - 2012
AB  - We compare performance of ecosystem classification maps and provincial forest inventory data derived from air photography in reflecting ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) biodiversity patterns that are related to the forest canopy mosaic. Our biodiversity surrogacy model based on remotely sensed tree canopy cover is validated against field-collected ground data. We used a systematic sampling grid of 198 sites, covering 84 km(2) of boreal mixedwood forest in northwestern Alberta, Canada. For every site, we determined tree basal area, characterized the ground beetle assemblage and obtained corresponding provincial forest inventory and ecosystem classification information. We used variation partitioning, ordination and misclassification matrices to compare beetle biodiversity patterns explained by alternative databases and to determine model biases originating from air photo-interpretation. Ecosystem classification data performed better than canopy cover derived from forest inventory maps in describing ground beetle biodiversity patterns. The biodiversity surrogacy models based on provincial forest inventory maps and field survey generally detected similar patterns but inaccuracies in air photo-interpretation of relative canopy cover led to differences between the two models. Compared to field survey data, air photo-interpretation tended to confuse two Picea species and two Populus species present and homogenize stand mixtures. This generated divergence in models of ecological association used to predict the relationship between ground beetle assemblages and tree canopy cover. Combination of relative canopy cover from provincial inventory with other geo-referenced land variables to produce the ecosystem classification maps improved biodiversity predictive power. The association observed between uncommon surrogates and uncommon ground beetle species emphasizes the benefits of detecting these surrogates as a part of landscape management. In order to complement conservation efforts established in protected areas, accurate, high resolution, wide ranging and spatially explicit knowledge of landscapes under management is primordial in order to apply effective biodiversity conservation strategies at the stand level as required in the extensively harvested portion of the boreal forest. In development of these strategies, an in-depth understanding of vegetation is key.

TI  - Assessment Of Human Impacts On Vegetation In Built-Up Areas In China Based On Avhrr, Modis And Dmspols Nighttime Light Data, 1992-2010
JO  - Chinese Geographical Science
PY  - 2014
AB  - Since the reform and opening-up program started in 1978, the level of urbanization has increased rapidly in China. Rapid urban expansion and restructuring have had significant impacts on the ecological environment especially within built-up areas. In this study, ArcGIS 10, ENVI 4.5, and Visual FoxPro 6.0 were used to analyze the human impacts on vegetation in the built-up areas of 656 Chinese cities from 1992 to 2010. Firstly, an existing algorithm was refined to extract the boundaries of the built-up areas based on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSPOLS) nighttime light data. This improved algorithm has the advantages of high accuracy and speed. Secondly, a mathematical model (Human impacts (HI)) was constructed to measure the impacts of human factors on vegetation during rapid urbanization based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. HI values greater than zero indicate relatively beneficial effects while values less than zero indicate proportionally adverse effects. The results were analyzed from four aspects: The size of cities (metropolises, large cities, medium-sized cities, and small cities), large regions (the eastern, central, western, and northeastern China), administrative divisions of China (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities) and vegetation zones (humid and semi-humid forest zone, semi-arid steppe zone, and arid desert zone). Finally, we discussed how human factors impacted on vegetation changes in the built-up areas. We found that urban planning policies and developmental stages impacted on vegetation changes in the built-up areas. The negative human impacts followed an inverted' U' shape, first rising and the falling with increase of urban scales. China's national policies, social and economic development affected vegetation changes in the built-up areas. The findings can provide a scientific basis for municipal planning departments, a decision-making reference for government, and scientific guidance for sustainable development in China. © 2014 Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Gis-Based Spatial Prediction Of Recreational Trail Susceptibility In Protected Area Of Sikkim Himalaya Using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree And Random Forest Model
JO  - Ecological Informatics
PY  - 2021
AB  - Trails have high conservation value which provides access to the protected area. But expansion of recreational activities along the trail has notably disturbed its environmental quality. The rapid increase of recreational activities along trails of Sikkim Himalayan region has become a major environmental concern. Therefore, modelling and mapping of sensitive trails are essential aspects for decision makers. The present study integrates RS-GIS with different machine learning algorithms to prepare trail susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, the study compares the predictive performance of logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) model for trail susceptibility mapping. Here we have considered seventeen trail susceptibility conditioning factors as model input. Thereafter, the dataset was randomly divided into two parts: training dataset (70%) and validation dataset (30%). Multicollinearity analysis carried using variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) to reduce model biasness. Thereafter, trail susceptibility map prepared using LR, DT and RF models. Finally, Receiver operating curve (ROC)- area under curve (AUC) method, statistical overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa index were used to measure the predictive performance of the models. The study concluded that LR (AUC-0.948, OA-94.8% and Kappa Index- 0.897) gives better performance in overall accuracy assessment as compared to DT (AUC- 0.931, OA- 93% and Kappa Index- 0.862) and RF (AUC- 0.914, OA- 91.3% and Kappa Index- 0.828) model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Digital Database On Shrimp Farming In Coastal Watershed Of Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu
JO  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES
PY  - 2017
AB  - Brackishwater shrimp farming is essentially a coastal farming activity, making use of the marginal land and water resources resulting in economic benefits, providing livelihood option for the coastal poor and contributing to the national GDP. Getting successful crop by the farmers is indeed a great accomplishment since the disease threat always hovers around shrimp culture. This warrants the adoption of better management practices starting from the pond construction till the harvest of the shrimp with a collective action among the shrimp farmers in a cluster of farms with respect to stocking, adoption of biosecurity measures, disease management and discharge of treated water. For practically enforcing this through farmers' associations, development of spatial database is a prerequisite and it is a relatively easy task in this age of information revolution. With this background, a digital information system has been built using ArcGIS 10.0 for the shrimp farms in the coastal watershed of Cuddalore District in Tamil Nadu primarily to aid farmers. The developed spatial database contains information about all the shrimp farms in Cuddalore District and it has been digitised from GeoEye with the cadastral map in the scale of 1: 5000. A total of 4 km(2) of shrimp farm area with 351 individual ponds spread over six clusters of farms has been digitised with their survey number. Field surveys were conducted to verify the satellite data. Details of the farms'were collected using a structured questionnaire and have been incorporated in the database. Using this database both spatial and statistical information can be analysed and managed for querying, decision making and resource management. This digital information will also be handy for the policymakers for licensing the farm, monitoring growth and to enforce environmental guidelines.

TI  - The Value Of Geriatric Care Enhancement Training For Direct Service Workers
JO  - GERONTOLOGY \& GERIATRICS EDUCATION
PY  - 2007
AB  - This study reports on the evaluation of a skills-enhancement training series for direct service providers in home care that was part of a federally funded state-level initiative to improve employee recruitment and retention. The gerontological training curriculum included content to improve problem-solving, communication, and stress management skills in order to increase professionalism and self-efficacy. While the first year of training utilized a network of "real-time" compressed video-teleconferencing broadcast to satellite sites statewide, these broadcasts were videotaped and accompanied by trained moderator-led scripted case study discussions at each of the sites during the second year. As the training series progressed, there was a linear increase in the likelihood that training would change the way participants performed their jobs in the future. Importantly, the training was more highly rated by the participants who had a greater commitment to pursuing their care work with geriatric clients. The merit of the program and implications of the results for the issue of employee retention are discussed. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Numerical Modeling Of The Responses Of Soil Temperature And Soil Moisture To Climate Change Over The Tibetan Plateau, 1961–2010
JO  - International Journal of Climatology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Changes in soil temperature (ST) and soil moisture (SM) are essential for climate change and ecosystem assessments. Previous investigations on the ST and SM on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are mainly based on the situ observation and the satellite products. In this study, the improved Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), with proper parameter optimization and surface datasets update, is used to estimate the response of ST and SM in the TP to climate change in the long-term time series from 1961 to 2010. After validating the reasonability of the simulated results using the observations, the spatial distribution of changes in ST and SM in annual and seasonal time series since 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, are investigated respectively and the changes of precipitation (Pr) and surface evaporation (Ev) are also analysed to understand the cause of changes objectively. As a whole, the soil was warming and wetting at the maximum value of 0.31°C/decade and 0.77%/decade since the 1960s. However, the warming process in soil mainly occurred in the 1980s while the wetting tendency is detected since the 1990s extensively. Except for the influence of air warming, the enhanced Pr and Ev might also be indispensable factors that caused the intensive wetting process but damped warming process in soil. Summer is the favourable season for the thermal and hydraulic variation since the 1980s. There exists the striking warmer and drier trend in the eastern TP since 1980s while the colder and wetter condition in the western TP since the 1990s. The magnitude of variation in soil is magnified from 1990s under the continuing impact of climate change. © 2021 Royal Meteorological Society

TI  - Improved K-Nn Mapping Of Forest Attributes In Northern Canada Using Spaceborne L-Band Sar, Multispectral And Lidar Data
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Satellite forest inventories are the only feasible way to map Canada’s vast, remote forest regions, such as those in the Northwest Territories (NWT). A method used to create such inventories is the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm, which spatially extends information from forest inventory (FI) plots to the entire forest land base using wall-to-wall features typically derived from Landsat data. However, the benefits of integrating L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, strongly correlated to forest biomass, have not been assessed for Canadian northern boreal forests. Here we describe an optimized multivariate k-NN implementation of a 151,700 km2 area in southern NWT that included ca. 2007 Landsat and dual-polarized Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data on board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Five forest attributes were mapped at 30 m cells: stand height, crown closure, stand/total volume and above-ground biomass (AGB). We assessed accuracy gains compared to Landsat-based maps. To circumvent the scarcity of FI plots, we used 3600 footprints from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) as surrogate FI plots, where forest attributes were estimated using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) metrics as predictors. After optimization, k-NN predicted forest attribute values for each pixel as the average of the 4 nearest (k = 4) surrogate FI plots within the Euclidian space of 9 best features (selected among 6 PALSAR, 10 Landsat, and 6 environmental features). Accuracy comparisons were based on 31 National Forest Inventory ground plots and over 1 million airborne LiDAR plots. Maps that included PALSAR HV backscatter resulted in forest attribute predictions with higher goodness of fit (adj. R2), lower percent mean error (ME%), and percent root mean square error (RMSE%), and lower underestimation for larger attribute values. Predictions were most accurate for conifer stand height (RMSE% = 32.1%, adj. R2 = 0.58) and AGB (RMSE% = 47.8%, adj. R2 = 0.74), which is much more abundant in the area than mixedwood or broadleaf. Our study demonstrates that optimizing k-NN parameters and feature space, including PALSAR, Landsat, and environmental variables, is a viable approach for inventory mapping of the northern boreal forest regions of Canada. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A Denoising–Classification–Retracking Method To Improve Spaceborne Estimates Of The Water Level–Surface–Volume Relation Over The Urmia Lake In Iran
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Decreasing the volume of the Urmia Lake, as the largest inland water body in Iran, is one of the current environmental and water resource management concerns. This study obtains a reliable spaceborne water level (WL)–area–volume relationship for the Urmia Lake using terrestrial, aerial and satellite-based data. The aim of this study is to improve Urmia Lake’s WL derived from satellite altimetry and, consequently, to more accurately estimate the volume of the lake for the last decade. To this end, improved WL is obtained from the Satellite with Argos and Altika (SARAL/AltiKa) and Jason-2 altimetry missions by performing a post-processing method. The post-processing method includes a denoising, a classification and appropriate retracking algorithms. The results are validated against in situ gauge data and also compared with results from Prototype Innovant de Système de Traitement pour les Applications Côtières et l’Hydrologie (PISTACH) and Prototype on AltiKa for Coastal, Hydrology and Ice (PEACHI) products. The Denoising–Classification–Retracking (DCR) method improves the root mean square error (RMSE) of WL with respect to those of PISTACH and PEACHI by 54% and 24%, respectively. The surface area of the lake is determined from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images based on calculating normalized difference water index (NDWI). The results are validated against the surface area obtained from aerial photogrammetry and Cartosat high resolution image. Moreover, based on bathymetric map a Look-up table including surface area and volume of the lake at specific levels are formed. The obtained surface area is then compared with the values of the Look-up table. The normalized root mean square error between surface extent obtained from proposed method and corresponding values is about 11%. The estimated lake’s volume is compared with the level-volume curve from the bathymetric data. The result showed the RMSE of this comparison is about 0.12 km3. Our validated results show that the lake has lost 75% of its volume from late 2008 to early 2016 but continued with an increase in its volume in May 2017 twice as much as in early 2016. Our results support urgent or long-term restoration plan of Lake Urmia and highlight the important role of spaceborne sensors for hydrological applications. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Water Quality Monitoring Over Finger Lakes Region Using Sentinel-2 Imagery On Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform
JO  - ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2021
AB  - Surface water quality is degrading continuously both due to natural and anthropogenic causes. There are several indicators of water quality, among which sediment loading is mainly determined by turbidity. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is one indirect measure of sediments present in water. This study focuses on detecting and monitoring sediments through NDWI over the Finger Lakes region, New York. Time series analysis is performed using Sentinel 2 imagery on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Finger Lakes region holds high socio-economic value because of tourism, water-based recreation, industry, and agriculture sector. The deteriorating water quality within the Finger Lake region has been reported based on ground sampling techniques. This study takes advantage of a cloud computing platform and medium resolution atmospherically corrected satellite imagery to detect and analyse water quality through sediment detection. In addition, precipitation data is used to understand the underlying cause of sediment increase. The results demonstrate the amount of sediments is greater in the early spring and summer months compared to other seasons. This can be due to the agricultural runoff from the nearing areas as a result of high precipitation. The results confirm the necessity for monitoring the quality of these lakes and understanding the underlying causes, which are beneficial for all the stakeholders to devise appropriate policies and strategies for timely preservation of the water quality. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

TI  - Functionalization Of Remote Sensing And On-Site Data For Simulating Surface Water Dissolved Oxygen: Development Of Hybrid Tree-Based Artificial Intelligence Models
JO  - Marine Pollution Bulletin
PY  - 2021
AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important indicator of river health for environmental engineers and ecological scientists to understand the state of river health. This study aims to evaluate the reliability of four feature selector algorithms i.e., Boruta, genetic algorithm (GA), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to select the best suited predictor of the applied water quality (WQ) parameters; and compare four tree-based predictive models, namely, random forest (RF), conditional random forests (cForest), RANdom forest GEneRator (Ranger), and XGBoost to predict the changes of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Klang River, Malaysia. The total features including 15 WQ parameters from monitoring site data and 7 hydrological components from remote sensing data. All predictive models performed well as per the features selected by the algorithms XGBoost and MARS in terms applied statistical evaluators. Besides, the best performance noted in case of XGBoost predictive model among all applied predictive models when the feature selected by MARS and XGBoost algorithms, with the coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively, nonetheless the marginal performance came up by Boruta-XGBoost model on in this scenario. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Determining Spatio-Temporal Variations Of Ecological Water Consumption By Natural Oases For Sustainable Water Resources Allocation In A Hyper-Arid Endorheic Basin
JO  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
PY  - 2018
AB  - Natural oases, including desert riparian vegetation and terminal lakes, play an important role in maintaining the stability and development of endorheic river systems in arid areas. Determining the ecological water consumption (EWC) of natural oases is a critical task for achieving sustainable ecosystem restoration and services in endorheic basins. In this study, the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation, evaporation of water area, and seepage in lakes and rivers were considered in the EWC. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model was combined with Landsat-8 images and eddy covariance flux measurements to calculate the daily EWC of natural oases in the lower Heihe River Basin (northwest China) during 2014 and 2015. The spatio-temporal variations of EWC were investigated in detail. The SEBS model could satisfactorily simulate the evapotranspiration (ET) of forest, shrub, mixed forest and water body with R-2 value greater than 0.84 and RMSE value less than 0.9 mm/day. The total EWC in 2014 and 2015 was 6.59 x 10(8 )m(3) and 7.65 x 10(8) m(3) , respectively, and the EWC of the Ejina Oasis accounted for approximately 50\% of total value in the study area. The cumulative EWC increased gradually with the distance away from the riverbank as an exponential function and reached the plateau at certain distance. The monthly variation of EWC followed a unimodal curve with the peak in June and July, accounting for 42.16\% and 36.28\% of annual EWC in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The water balance analysis indicated that the river flow was not sufficient to provide the EWC of natural oases and water requirements of agriculture and social economy, and additional 1.23 x 10(8 )m(3) and 2.09 x 10(8) m(3) of groundwater needed to be exploited in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Several strategies for sustainable water resources allocation and ecosystem management in the study area were provided. Overall, this study provides an integrated approach with combinations of multiple techniques and high-resolution data for EWC calculation, which is useful for water footprint analysis and water resources management on the basin scale in arid areas.

TI  - Integration Of Multi-Mission Satellite Data, Weather And Ice Information For Arctic Operations
JO  - OTC Arctic Technology Conference 2018
PY  - 2018
AB  - The benefits of using satellite imagery in arctic maritime operations are well known. Synthetic Aperture Radar and optical imagery from polar orbiting satellites can provide valuable information about sea ice and presence of icebergs both on a local and regional scale. The sea ice information extracted from satellite imagery is used together with weather data for vessel navigation in or near the ice or for increased safety and reduced risk during critical operations. Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) has ordering, downlink and processing capabilities for all the commercial and free SAR satellites in orbit today. SAR satellite imagery from these sources can, in addition to be used for detection and monitoring of sea ice, also be used for large scale environmental monitoring (oil spill detection) and increased maritime domain awareness (vessel detection). StormGeo is a leading weather risk provider for operations in Arctic, and has a strong focus on delivering weather decision support to marine operations. For the end-user performing ice analysis, satellite imagery can be used in addition to information such as local weather forecasts and ice information extracted from external sources. For efficient ordering of satellite imagery in ice management operations, it is important that the end-user have access to satellite tasking information such as potential temporal and spatial coverage, tasking deadlines and order status. In addition, the end-user must be able to access the relevant data as fast as possible after satellite acquisition. KSAT and StormGeo have in cooperation with Viking Supply Ships developed an end-to-end service integrating relevant ice-information and interfaces for satellite ordering, imagery access and weather information. The service is accessed through the StormGeo GUI, "Vortex," which serves as a robust and powerful tool for information access and ice management analysis. The service development has been done in the MULDIARCOS (Multi-mission Data and Information Services for Arctic Operations) project, which has been partly funded by ESA under the Integrated Application Promotion program.

JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
PY  - 2019
AB  - Cellular automata have been successfully applied to simulate the propagation of wildfires with the aim of assisting fire managers in defining fire suppression tactics and in planning fire risk management policies. We present a cellular automaton designed to simulate a severe wildfire episode that took place in Algarve (southern Portugal) in July 2012. During the episode almost 25 000 ha burned and there was an explosive stage between 25 and 33 h after the onset. Results obtained show that the explosive stage is adequately modeled when introducing a wind propagation rule in which fire is allowed to spread to nonadjacent cells depending on wind speed. When this rule is introduced, deviations in modeled time of burning (from estimated time based on hot spots detected from satellite) have a root-mean-square difference of 7.1 for a simulation period of 46 h (i.e., less than 20 \%). The simulated pattern of probabilities of burning as estimated from an ensemble of 100 simulations shows a marked decrease out of the limits of the observed scar, indicating that the model represents an added value to help decide locations of where to allocate resources for fire fighting.

PY  - 2018
AB  - In order for the Indian government to maximize Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), the Brahmaputra River has played an important role in the undertaking of the Pilot Basin Study (PBS) due to the Brahmaputra River's annual regional flooding. The selected Kulsi Rivera part of Brahmaputra sub-basinexperienced severe floods in 2007 and 2008. In this study, the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) hydrological model was used to simulate the recent historical flood in order to understand and improve the integrated flood risk management plan. The ultimate objective was to evaluate the sensitivity of hydrologic simulation using different Digital Elevation Model (DEM) resources, coupled with DEM smoothing techniques, with a particular focus on the comparison of river discharge and flood inundation extent. As a result, the sensitivity analysis showed that, among the input parameters, the RRI model is highly sensitive to Manning's roughness coefficient values for flood plains, followed by the source of the DEM, and then soil depth. After optimizing its parameters, the simulated inundation extent showed that the smoothing filter was more influential than its simulated discharge at the outlet. Finally, the calibrated and validated RRI model simulations agreed well with the observed discharge and the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-detected flood extents.

TI  - Near-Real-Time Forest Fires Monitoring System: Case Study With A Manned Aerial Vehicle Within The Osiris Project
JO  - WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment
PY  - 2008
AB  - Within the framework of the European-funded OSIRIS Integrated Project (FP6-IST-2005-2.5.12 ICT for Environmental Risk Management) a high spatial resolution video sensor (with thermal capabilities) on a manned helicopter platform will be plugged-in the OSIRIS architecture to monitor forest fires in the South of France. The OSIRIS project "Open architecture for Smart and Interoperable networks in Risk Management based on In-situ Sensors" aims at enhancing the overall efficiency of the in-situ processing chain by connecting the in-situ sensors via an intelligent and versatile network infrastructure that will enable end-users to access multi-domain sensors information. During the forest fires live demonstration the video frames acquired from a helicopter platform will be down-linked in real-time to the mobile Ground Control Station (GCS) for visual inspection by the end-users and for limited processing at the μ-PAF (μ-Processing and Archiving Facility). By means of a satellite link the compressed data is transferred to the Central Data Processing Center (CDPC) located at the premises of VITO in Mol (Belgium) for processing to e.g. composite images. The near-real-time, geo-referenced composite images can be used by the enduser as map of the surveyed area. The CDPC is connected to the OSIRIS architecture. Processing of data or access to archived data in the CDPC can be requested via the OSIRIS architecture. During the forest fire live demonstration planned in spring 2009 the merit of the OSIRIS concept will be evaluated against cheaper and more efficient decision-making.

TI  - Dynamic Process Simulation Promotes Energy Efficient Ship Design
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2016
AB  - Energy efficiency has become increasingly important to ship owners and builders, due to fuel costs and tightening environmental regulations, but also due to public opinion and expectation for green technology. Improved energy efficiency and significant savings are achievable by increasing waste heat utilization. A probable side effect of commissioning new technology is increased system complexity. This makes it more difficult to make design decisions between alternative technologies; also, the operation of the system needs more attention. Dynamic system level simulation has been used for energy systems analysis already for decades in onshore energy industry; now it is increasingly applied in marine engineering. In this study a commercial simulator Apros was used to model and simulate energy systems of a cruise ferry Viking Grace, which features novel energy saving solutions, such as a waste heat accumulator system and cooling options by liquefied natural gas (LNG) vaporizing, and by seawater. Dynamic models of these systems were developed and validated against available measurement data. The study showed that modelling and dynamic system level simulation can provide substantial benefits in the design of energy efficient ship in new buildings, and in existing ships. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Whether high-speed railway (HSR) can drive regional economic growth (REG) along the route is controversial, and the effectiveness of HSR connecting less developed and developed regions especially need to be further tested. The Guangdong-Guangxi-Guizhou High-Speed Railway (GGGHSR) has connected the most developed eastern region and the less developed western region in China, and it's a typical object to study the impact of HSR on less developed areas. This paper uses NPP-VIIRS remote sensing data from the period 2012-2017 to represent the level of regional economic growth along the route, and uses the PSM-DID method to analyze the impact of HSR in a quantitative way. The results show the following: Firstly, opening of the GGGHSR has led to an increase in light value along the route, but not produced a significant "corridor effect" along the route, with no significant REG in all counties along the route; Secondly, the effectiveness of the GGGHSR have spatial differences along the route, with a greater effect on less developed areas and areas far away from regional center city; Thirdly, the effectiveness of HSR driving less developed areas is mainly through "investment effect" and "industrial structure effect" these two mechanisms. The contribution of this study lies in the use of objective light data to study the relationship between HSR and REG, and select this typical GGGHSR project proving the driving role of HSR in the economic growth of less developed areas.

TI  - Simulating Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of Sichuan Grassland Net Primary Productivity Using The Casa Model And In Situ Observations
JO  - SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
PY  - 2014
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator for grassland resource management and sustainable development. In this paper, the NPP of Sichuan grasslands was estimated by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. The results were validated with in situ data. The overall precision reached 70\%; alpine meadow had the highest precision at greater than 75\%, among the three types of grasslands validated. The spatial and temporal variations of Sichuan grasslands were analyzed. The absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR), light use efficiency (epsilon), and NPP of Sichuan grasslands peaked in August, which was a vigorous growth period during 2011. High values of APAR existed in the southwest regions in altitudes from 2000m to 4000 m. Light use efficiency (epsilon) varied in the different types of grasslands. The Sichuan grassland NPP was mainly distributed in the region of 3000-5000m altitude. The NPP of alpine meadow accounted for 50\% of the total NPP of Sichuan grasslands.

TI  - Seasonal Variations Of Urban Surface Net Radiation And Its Relationship To Land Cover Pattern
JO  - Journal of Geo-Information Science
PY  - 2018
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to land cover pattern changes which alter the surface net radiation and eventually influence surface energy balance. This process has been accompanied by a series of ecological and environmental problems, one of which is the urban heat island effect. Therefore, research on the seasonal variations of urban surface net radiation and its relationship to land cover pattern can provide important insights for exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. Taking Xiamen city as a study area, this research retrieved surface net radiation using Landsat-5 TM remote sensing images and meteorological data of the four seasons. Then the seasonal variation characteristics of surface net radiation were further analyzed. Landscape metrics were used to characterize and describe the spatial composition and allocation of land cover pattern. The correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, stepwise regression analysis and variance partitioning were applied to explore the relationship between surface net radiation and land cover pattern from multi- seasonal perspective. The results suggest that: (1) the highest mean value of surface net radiation was found in summer, followed by spring, fall and winter. Surface net radiation is higher for the land cover types of water and forestland, while lower for built-up land and bare land. (2) The spatial allocation of land cover pattern has no significant influence on surface net radiation. (3) The spatial composition of land cover pattern shows significant influence on surface net radiation. The proportions of bare land and the proportion of forest land are effective and important factors which affect the changes of surface net radiation all the year round. And the proportion of forest land is the most important and continuously effective factor which affects and explains the cross- seasonal differences of surface net radiation. This research expands our scientific understanding of the effects of land cover pattern on surface net radiation. And it is helpful in exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. In addition, it may provide theoretical hints and realistic guidance for urban planning and sustainable development. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Development Of A Linear-Nonlinear Hybrid Special Model To Predict Monthly Runoff In A Catchment Area And Evaluate Its Performance With Novel Machine Learning Methods
JO  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate forecasting of runoff as an important hydrological variable is a key task for water resources planning and management. Given the importance of this variable, in the current study, a multivariate linear stochastic model (MLSM) is combined with a multilayer nonlinear machine learning model (MNMLM) to generate a hybrid model for the spatial and temporal simulation of runoff in the Quebec basin, Canada. Monthly hydrological data from 2001 to 2013, including precipitation and runoff data from nine stations and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extraction of MODIS data, are applied as input to the proposed hybrid model. At the first step of the hybrid modeling, data normality and stationary were examined by performing various tests. In the second step, MLSM was developed by defining four different scenarios and as a result 15 sub-scenarios. The first and second scenarios were developed based on one exogenous variable (precipitation or NDVI). In contrast, the second and third scenarios were developed based on two additional variables. In the first and third scenarios, the data are modeled without preprocessing. In the second and fourth scenarios, a preprocessing step is performed on the data. Then, in the third step, various combinations based on different time delays from runoff data were applied for developing nonlinear model. The comparisons are made between observed and simulated time series at various stations and based on the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The efficiency of the proposed hybrid model is compared with a novel machine learning model that was introduced in 2021 by Sultani et al., and it was also compared with the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear models. In most stations, delays (t-1) and (t-24) are identified as the most effective delays in hybrid and nonlinear modeling of runoff. Also, in most stations, the use of climatic parameters and physiographic factors as exogenous variables along with runoff data improves the results compared to the use of one variable. Results showed that at all stations, proposed hybrid model generally leads to more accurate estimates of runoff compared with various linear and nonlinear models. More accurate estimates of peak runoff values at all stations were another excellence of proposed hybrid model than other models.

TI  - Rangeland Vegetation Dynamics In The Altai Mountain Region Of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan And China: Effects Of Climate, Topography, And Socio-Political Context For Livestock Herding Practices
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Discriminating between climate- and human-induced variation in rangeland quality poses a major challenge for developing policy to sustain herder livelihoods and alleviate herder poverty. We contrasted changes in rangeland vegetation cover across a region-the Altai Mountains of central Asia (China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia)-that juxtaposes strongly contrasting social, political and economic conditions across a community of herders of shared cultural background (all of Kazakh origin). Our analysis focused on a satellite-derived vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor during the period 1982-2013, which included the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990 and heralded a transition away from pervasive state control on herding practices in many parts of the region. Grassland cover increased with decreasing elevation and increasing precipitation. Grassland also decreased under increased livestock density but was largely unresponsive to the dramatic changes that occurred in the sociopolitical context for grazing practices. Average NDVI values and duration of growing season were greater after the Soviet Union's collapse across the region, trends that precipitation and temperature data indicate were most likely driven by a changing climate. We conclude that rangeland policy development to assure sustainability of herder livelihoods in the Altai Mountain region should focus on climate change adaptation measures rather than modifying herders' grazing practices.

TI  - Surface Energy Fluxes Estimation Over The South Asia Subcontinent Through Assimilating Modis/Terra Satellite Data With <I>In Situ</I> Observations And Gldas Product By Sebs Model
JO  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2014
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important to water resource management in the South Asia subcontinent, and remote sensing method is a good choice to get surface energy fluxes for ET estimation. However, the accuracy of regional atmospheric parameters plays a vital role especially for South Asia with few meteorological stations available. In this study, to seek a practical way to derive surface energy fluxes for ET estimation, we compare the performances of three methods based on SEBS model using different meteorological data sources (meteorological stations, GLDAS product and the combination of in situ observation, and satellite retrieval). The spatial distribution and value reasonability analysis of the estimates indicate that the three methods cannot provide reliable estimates because of the constraint of station number and GLDAS product accuracy. Correlation analysis finds that there is a good agreement between GLDAS air temperature product and in situ observations with the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.4 for 5 days in 2008. According to the relationship, an integration method is proposed by recalibrating GLDAS air temperature with in situ observations with other atmospheric parameters supplied by GLDAS product, and the average values of the estimated LE calculated at 100 NDVI intervals are well correlated with NDVI with R-2 more than 0.695. The LE values are also within a reasonable value range with the maximum about 700 W/m(2) occurred at the full vegetation cover condition. The results indicate that the integration method is a practical way of obtaining surface energy fluxes and ET estimation for South Asia.

TI  - Modelling Leaf Chlorophyll Content In Coffee (Coffea Arabica) Plantations Using Sentinel 2 Msi Data
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2018
AB  - Coffee leaf chlorophyll (Chl) is an important proxy for coffee plant photosynthetic rates, nitrogen content, leaf health and yield potential. Whereas the recently launched Sentinel 2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data has great potential for plant condition assessment, the value of its spectral settings at variable spatial resolutions in relation to crop canopy cover on Chl content prediction remains largely unexplored. In this study, we apply an empirical model to estimate coffee leaf Chl with Sentinel 2 MSI data. Results showed that coffee biophysical parameters (height and canopy cover) are significantly influenced by stand age while plant water concentration and total Chl are age invariant. Results further showed that the best modelling results (R2=0.69, RMSE=64.4) were achieved when all the bands at 10m spatial resolution with all data were used. We concluded that Sentinel 2 MSI is a valuable dataset for predicting coffee leaf Chl, however, based on our findings, we suggest that finer spatial resolutions of 10m on mature coffee stands should be adopted for better prediction results. . © 2018 IEEE

AB  - The SPOT IMAGE company, created in 1982, is the first company in the world specifically established to distribute, on a commercial basis, satellite remote sensing data. The economical approach is: an open-sky policy, on a non-discriminatory basis. The distribution to clients is either direct, either through a commercial network and two subsidiaries (SICORP, SIS), or through regional Direct receiving Stations. The products and services are: Data, Programming of the satellite, Consultancy and Project management, regional and direct reception of data. Since February 1986, date of the launching of SPOT 1, the SPOT IMAGE turnover has been multiplied by four. The means are detailed in terms of human power and equipment, Research and Development and technical studies. The SPOT system specificities lead to a new approach of the market, and to new types of clients. New markets because of the SPOT ground resolution, stereo capability and rapidity of acquisition. New clients because increasingly not part of the scientific remote sensing community, because of the possibility to programme the satellite for their specific uses, because of increasing operational remote sensing projects. The marketing analysis is done permanently at SPOT IMAGE, and leads to the implementation of new services, to develop our relationship with local Direct Receiving Stations and with value-added companies. The future is prepared through studies on the SPOT 4 satellite (to be launched in 1995-96), on the digital Quick-Looks, and new products.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing To Estimate Scales Of Spatial Heterogeneity To Analyze Evapotranspiration Modeling In A Natural Ecosystem
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Understanding the spatial variability in highly heterogeneous natural environments such as savannas and river corridors is an important issue in characterizing and modeling energy fluxes, particularly for evapotranspiration (ET) estimates. Currently, remote-sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models are applied widely and routinely in agricultural settings to obtain ET information on an operational basis for use in water resources management. However, the application of these models in natural environments is challenging due to spatial heterogeneity in vegetation cover and complexity in the number of vegetation species existing within a biome. In this research effort, small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) data were used to study the influence of land surface spatial heterogeneity on the modeling of ET using the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model. The study area is the San Rafael River corridor in Utah, which is a part of the Upper Colorado River Basin that is characterized by arid conditions and variations in soil moisture status and the type and height of vegetation. First, a spatial variability analysis was performed using a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to identify a representative spatial resolution/model grid size for adequately solving energy balance components to derive ET. The results indicated a maximum wavelet energy between 6.4 m and 12.8 m for the river corridor area, while the non-river corridor area, which is characterized by different surface types and random vegetation, does not show a peak value. Next, to evaluate the effect of spatial resolution on latent heat flux (LE) estimation using the TSEB model, spatial scales of 6 m and 15 m instead of 6.4 m and 12.8 m, respectively, were used to simplify the derivation of model inputs. The results indicated small differences in the LE values between 6 m and 15 m resolutions, with a slight decrease in detail at 15 m due to losses in spatial variability. Lastly, the instantaneous (hourly) LE was extrapolated/upscaled to daily ET values using the incoming solar radiation (R-s) method. The results indicated that willow and cottonwood have the highest ET rates, followed by grass/shrubs and treated tamarisk. Although most of the treated tamarisk vegetation is in dead/dry condition, the green vegetation growing underneath resulted in a magnitude value of ET.

TI  - Landslide Detection In Central America Using The Differential Bare Soil Index
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2021
AB  - The increasing availability of EO data from the Copernicus program through its Sentinel satellites of the medium spatial and spectral resolution has generated new applications for risk management and disaster management. The recent growth in the intensity and number of hurricanes and earthquakes has demanded an increase in the monitoring of landslides. It is necessary to monitor large areas at a detailed level, which has previously been unsatisfactory due to its reliance on the interpretation of aerial photographs and the cost of high-resolution images. Using the differential Bare Soil Index for optical imagery interpretation in combination with cloud-computing in Google Earth Engine is a novel approach. Applying this method on a recent landslide event in Oaxaca in Mexico around 62% of the landslides were detected automatically, however, there is a big potential for improvement. Including NDVI values and considering images with a higher spatial resolution could contribute to the enhancement of landslide detection, as the majority of missed events have a size smaller than half a pixel. Landslide detection in Google Earth Engine has become a promising approach for big data processing and landslide inventory creation. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

TI  - Quantum-Compatible Variational Segmentation For Image-To-Image Wildfire Detection Using Satellite Data
PY  - 2022
AB  - Wildfire occurrences have been increasing for the past decade, leaving devastating traces across the world. In the recent efforts, remote sensing and airborne missions have been utilized to better understand and manage wildfires. This has resulted in an exponential increase in volume of remote sensing data, which has pushed the need for intelligent automation of data extraction for wildfire studies. Machine learning offers accurate automation in detecting such natural anomalies and enable decision-makers to take actions in a timely manner. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms, namely probabilistic generative methods, allow researchers and decision-makers to step beyond detection and study "what-if" scenarios for wildfire occurrences. Additionally, they offer better imitations to the stochastic behavior of nature, and wildfire events. However, optimizing the performance of these probabilistic generative models is a computationally expensive process, specially using digital computers. On the other hand, quantum computers have recently shown a promise to reduce computationally costly training of such models and provide performance improvements. There is a body of research investigating the potential for improved machine learning methods in which key operations are performed on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose a probabilistic image-to-image segmentation approach combining a very well-known segmentation method, U-NET, with a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to not only detect wildfires but also describe the stochasticity of the phenomenon and be capable of running "what-if" scenarios. Our proposed model is compatible with training on quantum computers, which results in a quantum-assisted image-to-image segmentation approach and can be used to benchmark the potential benefit of quantum computing over the classical one.

TI  - Assessment Of Surface Hydrological Connectivity In An Ungauged Multi-Lake System With A Combined Approach Using Geostatistics And Spaceborne Sar Observations
JO  - WATER
PY  - 2020
AB  - Connectivity metrics for surface water are important for predicting floods and droughts, and improving water management for human use and ecological integrity at the landscape scale. The integrated use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and geostatistics approach can be useful for developing and quantifying these metrics and their changes, including geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), surface water extent (SWE), and connection frequency. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis based on 52 wet and dry binary state (i.e., water and non-water) rasters derived from Sentinel-1 A/B GRD products acquired from 2015 to 2019 for China's Momoge National Nature Reserve to investigate applicability and dynamics of the hydrologic connectivity metrics in an ungauged (i.e., data such as flow and water level are scarce) multi-lake system. We found: (1) generally, the change of GCF in North-South and Northeast-Southwest directions was greater than that in the West-East and Northwest-Southeast directions; (2) MDC had a threshold effect, generally at most 25 km along the W-E, NW-SE and NE-SW directions, and at most 45 km along the N-S direction; (3) the flow paths between lakes are diverse, including channelized flow, diffusive overbank flow, over-road flow and "fill-and-merge"; (4) generally, the values of the three surface hydrological connectivity indicators (i.e., the MDC, the SWE, and the conneciton frequency) all increased from May to August, and decreased from August to October; (5) generally, the closer the distance between the lakes, the greater the connection frequency, but it is also affected by the dam and road barrier. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the geostatistical method combining Sentinel-1 SAR image analysis in quantifying surface hydrological connectivity in an ungagged area. This approach should be applicable for other geographical regions, in order help resource managers and policymakers identify changes in surface hydrological connectivity, as well as address potential impacts of these changes on water resources for human use and/or ecological integrity at the landscape level.

TI  - Use Of Hazard And Vulnerability Maps For Landslide Planning Scenarios: A Case Study Of The Nilgiris, India
JO  - Natural Hazards
PY  - 2015
AB  - Even small number of built-up areas experienced landslide problems; however, the loss could rise when the built-up areas develop in and on the unstable slopes. Landslide hazard information serves one of the many components in an integrated development planning study. A study on spatial vulnerability assessment is carried out for the part of Nilgiris district in the Western Ghats of India with the help of remote sensing and geographical information system to make use of landslide planning scenario. A spatial database is created for past landslide histories in the study area. The critical facilities, transportation and lifeline utilities, which include tourist spots, banks, ATMs, educational institutions, hospitals, bus stops, railway stations, that are potential threat under the very high to severe landslide hazard areas were identified. These are the elements at risk during landslides. From the study, it has been found that the eastern part of the study area is more prone to landslides. The past landslide inventories very clearly reveal that most of the landslides are triggered by the intense rainfall, human and cultural activities. Out of 36 utilities in the study area, about 65 % critical facilities and 36 % of transportation and lifeline utilities are vulnerable to severe landslide threat. The output of the present study can be used as first-hand information for the decision makers and planners and also helpful for the further developmental activities in the landslide-prone areas of the Nilgiris district of India. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Spatial Modeling Of Landscape Values: Discovering The Boundaries Of Conflicts And Identifying Mutual Benefits As A Basis For Land Management
JO  - Society and Natural Resources
PY  - 2021
AB  - Conflicting interests amongst different stakeholder groups regarding land use challenge the protection of natural values in socio-ecological systems (SES). In this paper we show, based on a case study of Israel’s Makhteshim Country National Park, how mapping the different interests and analyzing the data with a GIS system allows us to locate significant conflict points between groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 individuals from three major stakeholder groups in the region: semi-nomadic Bedouins, nature reserve rangers, and tourist operators. The qualitative findings were then mapped by a GIS platform. The mapping indicated that the stakeholder groups’ land-use is distributed in a manner that makes conflict unavoidable, but relatively limited to only certain specific areas. Moreover, in some areas, the three groups share similar or complementary values, reaping mutual benefits from shared use. We conclude that GIS mapping can serve as a powerful tool for conflict management in complex SES. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - The Potential Of Cwsi Based On Thermal Imagery For In-Season Irrigation Management In Potato Fields
JO  - Precision Agriculture 2013 - Papers Presented at the 9th European Conference on Precision Agriculture, ECPA 2013
PY  - 2013
AB  - Potato yield and quality are highly dependent on an adequate supply of water. Thermal Infrared (TIR) imagery data can be used for calculating the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), which may be used as a means for managing the dynamic demands of water in potato fields during the growth season. Field experiments were conducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012 in commercial potato fields (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Desiree; drip irrigation) at Kibbutz Ruhama, Israel (31.38° N, 34.59° E). Two scenarios of water deficit were tested, a short term water deficit, induced by suppressing irrigation for a number of days before field campaign, and a long term cumulative water deficit induced by reduced seasonal application. TIR and RGB images were used for delineation of canopy temperature and calculation of CWSI throughout the season. Plant water status was evaluated by measuring leaf stomatal conductance (SC). Data from 2011 showed that there is a statistically significant effect (α = 0.05) of the cumulative irrigation treatments on tuber yield, and that tuber yield is highly correlated with CWSI ((0.62≤R2≤0.93). These findings may imply the potential of using CWSI values as a threshold for managing irrigation, and will be further examined with data from the 2012 spring season.

TI  - Identification And Mapping Of Algerian Island Vegetation Using High-Resolution Images (Pléiades And Spot 6/7) And Random Forest Modeling
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2021
AB  - Despite their proximity to the coast, few studies have focused on identifying and mapping the vegetation of Algerian islands and islets. To fill this lacuna, our work, using satellite images and machine learning methods, is mainly aimed at identifying and mapping the main vegetation groups on a few islands, while evaluating the effectiveness of the random forest classifier, which is effectively used in the study of the vegetation of large areas. However, despite the high heterogeneity of their vegetation cover, the use of very high-resolution images (Pléaides and SPOT 6/7), through the fusion bands and derived bands (NDVI), has allowed the elaboration of a fairly precise vegetation map that can be used for the preparation of management and protection plans for these habitats. Our methodological approach revealed very satisfactory results, having allowed the identification of the plant communities inventoried in the field, while showing high accuracy values, ranging from 0.642 for the halophilic group of Asteriscus to 1 for the endemic Chasmophyte group of the Habibas archipelago (Pléiades images). The groups identified from SPOT 6/7 images show accuracy values between 0.67 for the Mediterranean cliff formations on Garlic Islet and 1 for the two formations (shrubby and herbaceous) of the Skikda islands. Our methodological approach, and notwithstanding the great heterogeneity and the very small surface areas of our islands and islets, has led to very satisfactory results, reflected with good overall accuracy and kappa index values (for Pléiades: overall accuracy > 92% and kappa index > 0.90; for SPOT 6/7: overall accuracy > 83% and kappa index > 0.80). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Detecting Urban Landscape Factors Controlling Seasonal Land Surface Temperature: From The Perspective Of Urban Function Zones
JO  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding the impact on the thermal effect by urbanization is of great significance for urban thermal regulation and is essential for determining the relationship between the urban heat island (UHI) effect and the complexities of urban function and landscape structure. For this purpose, we conducted case research in the metropolitan region of Beijing, China, and nearly 5000 urban blocks assigned different urban function zones (UFZs) were identified as the basic spatial analysis units. The seasonal land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from remote sensing data was used to represent the UHI characteristics of the study area, and the surface biophysical parameters, building forms, and filtered landscape pattern metrics were selected as the urban landscape factors. Then, the effects of urban function and landscape structure on the UHI effect were examined based on the optimal results of the ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models. The results indicated that (1) Significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the LST was found in the study area, and there was an obvious temperature gradient with “working–living–resting” UFZs. (2) All types of urban landscape factors showed a significant contribution to the seasonal LST, in the order of surface biophysical factors > building forms > landscape factors; however, their contributions varied in different seasons. (3) The major contributing factors showed a certain difference due to the variation of urban function and landscape complexity. This study expands the understanding on the complex relationship among urban landscape, function, and thermal environment, which could benefit urban landscape planning for UHI alleviation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The Influence Of Increasing Population Size And Vegetation Productivity On Elephant Distribution In The Kruger National Park
JO  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
PY  - 2009
AB  - Decisions to reduce the impacts of large herbivores on biodiversity in protected areas are often based on controlling their numbers. However, numbers per se may not be the foremost consideration when managing impacts. This is because density-related changes in distribution can also affect habitat utilization and hence, impact. In this study we tested whether changes in the distribution of African elephants are associated with increasing population size. We used spatially explicit count data collected during the dry seasons from 1998 to 2004 in South Africa's Kruger National Park. We did this at five spatial scales and in landscapes defined by vegetation, geology, climate and soils. We then investigated whether observed distributions and grid-cell-specific densities were associated with the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a measure of productivity and therefore food resource availability at the landscape scale. Consistent with density mediated changes, we found that elephant grid-cell occupancy increased with population size, while grid-cell-specific density became less variable. In addition, the combined distribution of bull groups and breeding herds became less clumped with increasing population size. We further found that within landscapes elephants were present on grid-cells with higher NDVI values, but that the influence of NDVI during the dry season on densities among landscapes may be weak. These results suggest that NDVI was more indicative of structural habitat choices such as woody vegetation than food availability per se. Our study highlights the need to consider factors other than population size alone when formulating management decisions to reduce large herbivore impacts on biodiversity in protected areas.

TI  - Rapid Structure Detection In Support Of Disaster Response : A Case Study Of The 2018 Kilauea Volcano Eruption
PY  - 2020
AB  - Disaster response requires timely damage assessment to prioritize rescue and restoration resources. However, providing critical and actionable knowledge after a natural disaster can be challenging due to the scale and the type of damages. This paper describes how remote sensing and machine learning techniques can be used to support rapid structure detection in the wake of a disaster. We use high resolution satellite imagery to identify structures on Hawaii's Big Island to support the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response efforts during the 2018 Kilauea lava flow incident. This framework specifically showcases the generalizability of CNN models with no need to collect additional training samples to quickly map structures in pre- and post-event imagery and provide timely information to assist government agencies evaluating the extent and potential loss of disaster. With this case study, we further point out future directions to benefit similar larger scale efforts based on the lessons learned.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Until recently, Northern China was one of the most SO2 polluted regions in the world. The lack of long-term and spatially resolved surface SO2 data hinders retrospective evaluation of relevant environmental policies and human health effects. This study aims to derive the spatiotemporal distribution of surface SO2 across Northern China during 2005–2019. As “concept drift” causes substantial estimation bias in back-extrapolation, we propose a new approach named the robust back-extrapolation via data augmentation approach (RBE-DA) to model the long-term surface SO2. The results show that the population-weighted regional SO2 ([SO2]pw) increased from 2005 to 2007 and decreased steadily afterwards. The [SO2]pw decreased by 80.4% from 74.2 ± 28.4 μg/m3 in 2007 to 14.6 ± 4.8 μg/m3 in 2019. The predicted spatial distributions for each year show that the SO2 pollution was severe (more than 20 μg/m3) in most areas of Northern China until 2017. By using model interpretation methods, we visually reveal the mechanism of estimation bias in the back-extrapolation. Specifically, the training data is severely imbalanced with respect to the satellite-retrieved SO2 column densities (i.e., it is short on high-value samples), so the benchmark model is unable to extrapolate the effects of this important predictor. This study provides long-term surface SO2 data for post hoc evaluation and human exposure assessment in Northern China, while demonstrating that the interpretable machine learning approach is critical for model diagnostics and refinement. Leveraging satellite retrievals, the RBE-DA approach can be applied worldwide to back-extrapolate various measures of air quality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modelling Biomass Of Mountainous Grasslands By Including A Species Composition Map
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2017
AB  - High mountain grasslands offer multiple goods and services to society but are severely threatened by improper land use practices such as abandonment or rapid intensification. In order to reduce abandonment and strengthen the common extensive agricultural practice a sustainable land use management of high mountain grasslands is needed. A spatially detailed yield assessment helps to identify possible meadows or, on the contrary, areas with a low carrying capacity in a region, making it easier to manage these sites. Such assessments are rarely available for remote and inaccessible areas. Remotely sensed vegetation indices are able to provide valuable information on grassland properties. These indices tend, however, to saturate for high biomass. This affects their applicability to assessments of high-yield grasslands. The main aim of this study was to model a spatially explicit grassland yield map and to test whether saturation issues can be tackled by consideration of plant species composition in the modelling process. The high mountain grassland of the subalpine belt (1800 – 2500 m a.s.l.) in the Kazbegi region, Greater Caucasus, Georgia, was chosen as test site for its strong species composition and yield gradients. We first modelled the species composition of the grassland described as metrically scaled gradients in the form of ordination axes by random forest regression. We then derived vegetation indices from Rapid Eye imagery, and topographic variables from a digital elevation model, which we used together with the multispectral bands as predictive variables. For comparison, we performed two yield models, one excluding the species composition maps and one including the species composition map as predictors. Moreover, we performed a third individual model, with species composition as predictors and a split dataset, to produce the final yield map. Three main grassland types were found in the vegetation analysis: Hordeum violaceum-meadows, Gentianella caucasea-grassland and Astragalus captiosus-grassland. The three random forest regression models for the ordination axes explained 64%, 33% and 46% of the variance in species composition. Independent validation of modelled ordination scores against a validation data set resulted in an R2 of 0.64, 0.32 and 0.46 for the first, second and third axes, respectively. The model based on species composition resulted in a R2 = 0.55, whereas the benchmark model showed weaker relationships between yield and the multispectral reflectance, vegetation indices, and topographical parameters (R2 = 0.42). The final random forest yield model used to derive the yield map resulted in 62% variance explained and an R2 = 0.64 between predicted and observed biomass. The results further indicate that high yields are generally difficult to predict with both models. The benefit of including a species composition map as a predictor variable for grassland yield lies in the preservation of ecologically meaningful features, especially the occurrence of high yielding vegetation type of Hordeum violaceum meadows is depicted accurately in the map. Even though we used a gradient based design, sharp boundaries or immediate changes in productivity were visible, especially in small structures such as arable fields or roads (Fig. 6b), making it a valuable tool for sustainable land use management. The saturation effect however, was mitigated by using species composition as predictor variables but is still present at high yields. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Optimization Of Inverter Loading Ratio For Grid Connected Photovoltaic Systems
JO  - SOLAR ENERGY
PY  - 2019
AB  - This study is aimed at performing and analyzing the inverter sizing optimization process for large-scale grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV). The local solar resource was evaluated and compared to the available satellite data. Analyses of the solar irradiance distribution and its potential effects on inverter sizing were performed. The performance of five different, commercially-available PV module technologies was also evaluated by means of remote data analysis of irradiation and temperature, as well as electrical parameters. This was performed using the metrics of energy yield and performance ratio (PR) for PV systems. A methodology was developed for estimating the optimal inverter sizing in the region considering overload losses and economic aspects, aiming at the optimization and cost reduction of PV-generated electricity. Considering the five technologies, the mean yield was 150 kWh/kWp on a monthly basis. The annual PR ranged from 77\% to 85\% depending on technology. The local solar resource, measured during three years, was compared to five distinct satellite-derived solar databases. Cloud enhancement and cloud edge effects were observed through the monthly solar irradiation distribution over the three years of measurements. Around 28\% of the incident annual irradiation was at irradiance levels at or above 1000 W/m(2). The methodology developed for the optimal inverter loading ratio (ILR) was applied over one full year of solar generation data for the five technologies. It was observed that for inverter loading ratios commonly used on utility-scale PV power plants (around 120\%), the overload losses varied from 0.3\% to 2.4\%, depending on technology. The optimal ILR for the more traditional crystalline Si PV technology was estimated to be 126\%.

TI  - An Assessment Of Earthquake-Induced Landslides Distribution In Nepal Using Open-Source Applications On Sentinel-1 Tops Sar Imagery
JO  - International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics
PY  - 2023
AB  - The effects of landslide disasters are extremely severe, resulting in significant economic damage and a high number of fatalities on a global scale. In the event of a disaster of this magnitude, a swift and reliable disaster information is crucial. This is usually very tasking activities and expensive using proprietary application and data. This study therefore demonstrates the usability of opensource application and free satellite data on an assessment of earthquake induced landslide using data and applications sourced from European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Open Access Hub. A Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique, which is more advanced earthquake assessment tool was used to obtain morphological changes via-a-vis the vertical displacement produced during Gorkha earthquake of April 25, 2015, in Nepal. In the study, a single interferogram of the two repeat pass SAR data for a DInSAR process was applied over an area of 128 km2. A pair of SAR image with a temporal baseline of 144 days and perpendicular baseline of 122.51 meters were used. Three landslide locations were evaluated. The vertical displacements using DInSAR ranges from -0.23 (moving away from satellite) to 0.24 m (movement towards satellite). The simulated morphological values compared well with obtained google earth images captured at during the period of the disaster event. © 2023 WITPress. All rights reserved.

TI  - Scuba Divers Above The Waterline: Using Participatory Mapping Of Coral Reef Conditions To Inform Reef Management
JO  - MARINE POLICY
PY  - 2017
AB  - Coral reefs provide important ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation, and cultural benefits through recreation and tourism. However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef "experts" in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention.

TI  - Reducing Multipath Effect Of Low-Cost Gnss Receivers For Monitoring By Considering Temporal Correlations
JO  - Journal of Applied Geodesy
PY  - 2020
AB  - The investigations on low-cost single frequency GNSS receivers at the Institute of Engineering Geodesy (IIGS) show that u-blox GNSS receivers combined with low-cost antennas and self-constructed L1-optimized choke rings can reach an accuracy which almost meets the requirements of geodetic applications (see Zhang and Schwieger [25]). However, the quality (accuracy and reliability) of low-cost GNSS receiver data should still be improved, particularly in environments with obstructions. The multipath effects are a major error source for the short baselines. The ground plate or the choke ring ground plane can reduce the multipath signals from the horizontal reflector (e. g. ground). However, the shieldings cannot reduce the multipath signals from the vertical reflectors (e. g. walls). Because multipath effects are spatially and temporally correlated, an algorithm is developed for reducing the multipath effect by considering the spatial correlations of the adjoined stations (see Zhang and Schwieger [24]). In this paper, an algorithm based on the temporal correlations will be introduced. The developed algorithm is based on the periodic behavior of the estimated coordinates and not on carrier phase raw data, which is easy to use. Because, for the users, coordinates are more accessible than the raw data. The multipath effect can cause periodic oscillations but the periods change over time. Besides this, the multipath effect's influence on the coordinates is a mixture of different multipath signals from different satellites and different reflectors. These two properties will be used to reduce the multipath effect. The algorithm runs in two steps and iteratively. Test measurements were carried out in a multipath intensive environment; the accuracies of the measurements are improved by about 50 % and the results can be delivered in near-real-time (in ca. 30 minutes), therefore the algorithm is suitable for structural health monitoring applications. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

TI  - An Optimized Random Forest Model And Its Generalization Ability In Landslide Susceptibility Mapping: Application In Two Areas Of Three Gorges Reservoir, China
JO  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
PY  - 2020
AB  - Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images, and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County, indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve efficiency in practice.

TI  - Making The Most Of Aquatic Animal Tracking: A Review Of Complementary Methods To Bolster Acoustic Telemetry
JO  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
PY  - 2023
AB  - Tracking the movements of aquatic animals is a primary means of understanding movement ecology and interactions with human activities such as fisheries. Despite the diverse spatiotemporal scales that various underwater tracking tools (e.g., acoustic, satellite, PIT, radio, archival telemetry) enable, there are still limitations associated with their application and ability to address diverse research questions. In many cases, supplementary methods are used to complement tracking approaches either to overcome such limitations or to optimize the data that can be collected in a study. In this review, we synthesize relevant literature between 2010 and 2019 to evaluate the different types of complementary methods used with one of the main approaches for tracking fishes-acoustic telemetry. We categorize broad and specific methods used, as well as the outcome or objectives targeted for each method. In addition to summarizing the use of complementary methods and their outcomes, we discuss how they supplement acoustic telemetry and other tracking approaches. Our review shows that using additional methods to support telemetry data helps expand the breadth of research questions that can be addressed regarding the complex and assorted factors influencing movement patterns. Doing so enables greater value in movement ecology research and adjacent fields such as population dynamics, physiology, trophic ecology, reproduction, and health and survival, to underpin management decisions. This review serves as a primer and guide for bolstering data collection and multidisciplinary research within the growing field of movement ecology.

TI  - Feasible Connectivity Solutions Of Plc For Rural And Remote Areas
PY  - 2008
AB  - Power line communication (PLC) is considered an attractive broadband delivery system because it can reach more homes than coaxial cable systems or telephone lines. In markets not served by DSL or cable, PLC can provides a cost-effective connectivity solution. Also known as "third wire" technology, PLC offer applications to rural and remote area in attractive modes like: i) high speed backbone over medium voltage power lines; if) last mile access network through residential power distribution; iii) last inch access to distribute data communication inside home. Considering the fact that network deployment costs can be reduced if signals are transmitted in an existing infrastructure, current status of PLC must be evaluated as an option to ICT efforts in rural and remote areas. This research targets to study the available technical benefits of PLC to rural applications as a backhaul, last Mile or hybrid solution. Integration with current alternative technologies such as wireless and satellite communications can define an optimal solution according to individual community needs. Recommendations focused on municipalities or cooperatives are also discussed. Results indicate that PLC does not appear to represent a major disruptive technology in competitive markets, but very suitable for non supplied rural areas and should be considered strategically and technically for future policy decisions.

TI  - China's Role In The Development Of A New Connectivity Paradigm In The North
PY  - 2019
AB  - During recent years, growing exploration of natural resources and development of transport routes have reemerged the Arctic as a scene for political and economic collaboration between Nordic and non-regional states. When China announced its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), most of the attention focused on the joint building of transportation infrastructure across the Eurasian landmass (Silk Road Economic Belt) and the Indian Ocean (Maritime Silk Road). With the release of the Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the BRI, China incorporated the Arctic shipping lanes into the BRI transport network. However, an extension of the economic corridors to the Arctic is viable only in case of development of satellite trade, production, and research opportunities along the potential transport routes. In the Arctic, such opportunities exist but are limited due to the underdeveloped infrastructure, lack of reliable technologies, and severe climate conditions. In this study, the author discusses the critical points in the implementation of China's paradigm of collaboration and connectivity in the Arctic, as well as focus on the promotion of bilateral win-to-win investment and trade projects with the countries along the potential Arctic Blue Economic Corridor (ABEC). It is concluded that the ABEC may be efficiently incorporated into the BRI network, and European countries may receive substantial benefits from involvement in China's northern initiatives. The author emphasizes specific technological and economic challenges which have to be considered and met before a sustainable connectivity between Europe and Asia is established in the North.

TI  - Integrated Seawater Intrusion And Groundwater Quality Assessment Of A Coastal Aquifer: Galdit, Geospatial And Analytical Approaches
JO  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
PY  - 2022
AB  - The pressure and dependence on coastal aquifers are on the rise in many parts of the globe. These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast’s coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches—GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQISWI, total hardness, water quality index (WQI)—and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQISWI classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand’s TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29%, 59%, and 12% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQISWI analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32%. Total hardness values indicate that 67% of the aquifer’s coverage falls under the “moderately hard” category. The geodatabase creation introduced in the study provides a template for similar studies and a baseline for future WQI and water quality monitoring. However, temporal studies on chronological timescales are recommended for sustainable management of the aquifer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Hurricane-Faster R-Cnn-Js: Hurricane Detection With Faster R-Cnn Using Artificial Jellyfish Search (Js) Optimizer
JO  - Multimedia Tools and Applications
PY  - 2022
AB  - A hurricane is a type of storm called tropical cyclone (TC) and is likely to lead to severe storms and heavy rains. An early detection of hurricanes using satellite images can alarm people about upcoming disasters and thus minimize any casualties and material losses. Faster R-CNN is one of the most popular and recent object detection approaches. In the present study, AlexNet hyperparameters, which is a CNN model used as a feature extractor in Faster R-CNN, were optimized using artificial Jellyfish Search (JS), which is a recent algorithm, in order to propose a Faster R-CNN with a higher performance. The proposed approach is called Hurricane-Faster R-CNN-JS, since it is used as an early hurricane detection approach on satellite images before these hurricanes reach the land. The results of the present study demonstrated that hyperparameter optimization increased the detection performance of the proposed approach by 10% compared to AlexNet without optimized hyperparameters. As feature extractors of Faster R-CNN, the present study benefited from various architectures such as MobileNet-V2, GoogLeNet, AlexNet, ResNet 18, ResNet 50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 without any optimized hyperparameters to compare them with the proposed approach. It was observed that Average Precision (AP) of Hurricane-Faster R-CNN-JS was 97.39%, which was a remarkably higher AP level compared to other approaches. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Fuzzy Object-Based Image Analysis Methods Using Sentinel-2a And Landsat-8 Data To Map And Characterize Soil Surface Residue
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Soil degradation, defined as the lowering and loss of soil functions, is becoming a serious problem worldwide and threatens agricultural production and terrestrial ecosystems. The surface residue of crops is one of the most effective erosion control measures and it increases the soil moisture content. In some areas of the world, the management of soil surface residue (SSR) is crucial for increasing soil fertility, maintaining high soil carbon levels, and reducing the degradation of soil due to rain and wind erosion. Standard methods of measuring the residue cover are time and labor intensive, but remote sensing can support the monitoring of conservation tillage practices applied to large fields. We investigated the potential of per-pixel and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for detecting and estimating the coverage of SSRs after tillage and planting practices for agricultural research fields in Iran using tillage indices for Landsat-8 and novel indices for Sentinel-2A. For validation, SSR was measured in the field through line transects at the beginning of the agricultural season (prior to autumn crop planting). Per-pixel approaches for Landsat-8 satellite images using normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and simple tillage index (STI) yielded coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.727 and 0.722, respectively. We developed comparable novel indices for Sentinel-2A satellite data that yielded R-2 values of 0.760 and 0.759 for NDTI and STI, respectively, which means that the Sentinel data better matched the ground truth data. We tested several OBIA methods and achieved very high overall accuracies of up to 0.948 for Sentinel-2A and 0.891 for Landsat-8 with a membership function method. The OBIA methods clearly outperformed per-pixel approaches in estimating SSR and bear the potential to substitute or complement ground-based techniques.

TI  - Prediction Of Attenuation Using Visibility Variations And Other Meteorological Parameters In George, Western Cape, South Africa
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - In this work, the impact of selected atmospheric parameters on attenuation of terrestrial and satellite signals over George, Western Cape in South Africa for the purpose of planning reliable and resilient free space optical communication links has been presented. The meteorological parameters data (visibility, temperature, rainfall rate, relative humidity, pressure, wind speed and wind direction) were obtained for ten years (2010 - 2019) from the South African Weather Service (SAWS). Total attenuation for the studied location was calculated from attenuation due to aerosol scattering, attenuation due to rain and attenuation due to scintillation. Three different wavelengths namely: 850 nm, 1200 nm and 1500 nm within the optical windows were used in calculating the wavelength dependent functions (attenuation due to aerosol scattering and attenuation due to scintillation). The result shows that attenuation due to rain was observed to account for 58% of the total attenuation and it is wavelength independent. Attenuation due to rain based on subtropics model was found to be about half of the calculated value based on temperate model. Further result shows total attenuation for worst visibility period (summer) throughout the year in the studied location is 7.7 dB/km (aerosol scattering: 0.53dB/km; rain: 4.5 dB/km and scintillation: 2.7 dB/km) at 850 nm. Overall results will be applicable in the area of the design and implementation of a reliable free space optical (FSO) links in the studied location. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Justification For Site-Specific Weed Management Based On Ecology And Economics
JO  - WEED SCIENCE
PY  - 2005
AB  - One of the primary benefits of site-specific agricultural technologies is the potential to reduce the use of polluting inputs, thereby minimizing ecological damage. Weeds are often found in patches, so site-specific (field scale) management offers a straightforward opportunity to minimize ecological effects related to wasteful broadcast use of herbicides. Beyond possible efficiencies related to accurate targeting, site-specific technologies, through a process of parameterizing management decision models for each field, may improve ecological understanding of weed populations and thus encourage ecologically based management. This hypothesis was assessed with a simple model that combined economic injury level prediction with a single parameter (growing season precipitation) to represent environmental variability. Model simulations of crop yield in response to weed density at a virtual farm and six surrounding regional experiment stations suggested that localized (on-farm field) parameter estimation may help to circumvent the variability associated with damage function extrapolation from small-plot experiments at experiment stations and thereby improve predictive accuracy for site-specific weed management (SSWM) strategies. Thus, remote sensing and SSWM technologies may allow producers to reduce the risk associated with the reduced use of purchased inputs and greater reliance on natural weed population-regulating mechanisms. Effective ecologically based weed management may be dependent on local parameterization of models.

TI  - Post-Burning Responses By Vegetation On Blanket Bog Peatland Sites On A Scottish Grouse Moor
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Burning of ericaceous vegetation on moorland in the United Kingdom is a routine part of management for red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) but its contribution to peatland degradation and loss of key ecosystem services is widely debated. Studies in the North Pennines, northern England, have shown that regular fires at approximately ten-year intervals can benefit Sphagnum mosses and cotton grass (Eriophorum) cover at the expense of ling heather (Calluna vulgaris). We repeated an assessment from a Pennine study of post-burning vegetation succession at a moor in south-west Scotland also managed for grouse. Here, GPS-mapped fires from 2009 to 14 were visited in 2019 to measure the vegetation response and compare it with unburned control plots. Heather cover, vegetation height and biomass increased linearly over time since burning, whereas cotton grass decreased during the first eight years. Sphagnum cover in plots burnt eight to ten years earlier averaged five times higher than that in the no-burn control plots and was positively correlated with peat depth. These results support earlier studies in northern England, showing that prescribed burning at regular intervals can increase Sphagnum cover by reducing heather cover and canopy vegetation biomass. We discuss the repercussions of this for management of blanket peat habitat, including reducing wildfire risk across UK moorlands.

TI  - Identification Of Spatial Ecological Sensitivity In Banyumas Region
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecological sensitivity can explain spatial ecological conditions that have the potential to face disturbances and stresses. Spatial ecological sensivity assessment helps to understand the relationship between ecological component in specific spatial scale. The level of ecological sensitivity depends on spatial regional characteristics. Banyumas regency are the area with Slamet mountainous-type National Parks, which is a priority area for conservation and relatively sensitive to various disturbances. Eruption hazard zone, elevation, slope, distance from main river, vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and built-up densitiy are components that considered in ecological sensitivity assessments. This research aims to assess the level of spatial ecological sensitivity based on ecological sensitivity index (ESI) for areas with vulnerability to volcanic eruptions. The mathematical measurement model of the ESI system is combined with geographic information system (GIS) technology to generate location attributes. Spatial data is obtained through remote sensing digital image processing that highlight synoptic aspects in understanding region heterogeneity. Each parameters have different influence on ecological sensitivity levels, that are represented by the priority weight determined by analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques. There are four classes of ecological sensitivity in Banyumas: very low (51.3 km(2)), low (900.6 km(2)), moderate (325.6 km(2)), and high sensitivity (108.97 km(2)). The distribution pattern of ESI values shows that poor sensitivity conditions are surrounded by areas with improved sensitivity due to the spatial distribution of slope and elevation conditions. The ESI spatial pattern can be used as a reference for policy making to maintain regional functions.

JO  - ATMOSPHERE-KOREA
PY  - 2018
AB  - Benefits of the next generation geostationary meteorological satellite observation (e.g., GEO-KOMPSAT-2A) are qualitatively and comprehensively described and discussed. Main beneficial phenomena for application can be listed as tropical cyclones (typhoon), high impact weather (heavy rainfall, lightning, and hail), ocean, air pollution (particulate matter), forest fire, fog, aircraft icing, volcanic eruption, and space weather. The next generation satellites with highly enhanced spatial and temporal resolution images, expanding channels, and basic and additional products are expected to create the new valuable benefits, including the contribution to the reduction of socioeconomic losses due to weather-related disasters. In particular, the new satellite observations are readily applicable to early warning and very-short time forecast application of hazardous weather phenomena, global climate change monitoring and adaptation, improvement of numerical weather forecast skill, and technical improvement of space weather monitoring and forecast. Several policy plans for expanding the application of the next generation satellite data are suggested.

TI  - Smos-Next: A New Concept For Soil Moisture Retrieval From Passive Interferometric Observations
PY  - 2013
AB  - Present soil moisture and ocean salinity maps retrieved by remote sensing are characterized by a coarse spatial resolution. Hydrological, meteorological and climatological applications would benefit greatly from a better spatial resolution. Owing to the dimensions of the satellite structure and to the degradation of the instrument's radiometric sensitivity, such improvement cannot be achieved with classical interferometry. Then, in order to achieve this goal an original concept for passive interferometric measurements is described. This concept should allow to achieve a much finer spatial resolution, which can be further improved with the application of disaggregation methods. The results will then allow the integration of global soil moisture maps into hydrological models, a better management of water resources at small scales and an improvement in spatial precision for various applications. https://www.edp-open.org/images/stories/books/fulldl/eas\_59/eas59\_pp20 3-212.pdf

PY  - 2018
AB  - Sea turtles are migratory species that occupy several marine and coastal habitats along their different life stages. The study of the spatial and temporal distribution of these vertebrates has been revolutionized with technological advances such as satellite telemetry, which in the last two decades has substantially increased its implementation. This technology attends the need of knowing and locating their critical habitats (such as inter-nesting, migrating, feeding and mating) as well as know their migratory movements for the understanding of their biology and protection through the deployment of satellite transmitters on sea turtle individuals. Because the cost of a satellite transmitter is high, its effective deployment on a sea turtle in a quickly, safely, and firmly way is of vital interest to the researcher to ensure that the transmitter persists for an extended time maximizing the information contribution and benefit the research. In this context, the objective of this contribution is to describe and document experiences applying standardized and verified methodological steps for deploying satellite transmitters on hard shell marine turtles. This contribution represents a documented and step-by-step viable description on the path to have clear and versatile basis as reference for the satellite transmitter deployments.

TI  - Assessing The Influence Of Tourism-Driven Activities On Environmental Variables On Hainan Island, China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Tourism is a primary socio-economic factor on many coastal islands. Tourism contributes to the livelihoods of the residents, but also influences natural resources and energy consumption and can become a significant driver of land conversion and environmental change. Understanding the influence of tourist-related activities is vital for sustainable tourism development. We chose Hainan Island in South China as a research area to study the influence of tourist-driven activities on environmental variables (as Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and related ecosystem variables) during the period of 2000 to 2019. In Hainan, the local economy relies heavily on tourism, with an ever-growing influx of tourists each year. We categorised location-based points of interest (POIs) into two classes, non-tourism sites and tourism-related sites, and utilised satellite data from the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We analysed the LST variations, NDVI changes and the land use/land cover (LULC) changes and compared the relative difference in LST and NDVI between the tourism-related sites and non-tourism-related sites. The main findings of this study were: (1) The median LST in the tourism-related sites was relatively higher (1.3) than the LST in the non-tourism-related sites for the 20 years. Moreover, every annual mean LST of tourism-related sites was higher than the LST values in non-tourism-related sites, with an average difference of 1.2 degrees C for the 20 years and a maximum difference of 1.7 degrees C. We found higher annual LST anomalies for tourist-related sites compared to non-tourism sites after 2010, which indicated the likely positive differences in LST above the average LST during 20 years for tourism-related sites when compared against the non-tourism related sites, thus highlighting the potential influence of tourism activities on LST. (2) The annual mean NDVI value for tourism-related sites was significantly lower than for non-tourism places every year, with an average NDVI difference of 0.26 between the two sites. (3) The land cover changed significantly: croplands and forests reduced by 3.5\% and 2.8\% respectively, while the areas covered by orchards and urban areas increased by 2\% and 72.3\% respectively. These results indicate the influence of the tourism-driven activities includes the relatively high LST, vegetation degradation and land-use conversion particular to urban cover type. The outcome of this work provides a method that combines cloud-based satellite-derived data with location-based POIs data for quantifying the long-term influence of tourism-related activities on sensitive coastal ecosystems. It contributes to designing evidence-driven management plans and policies for the sustainable tourism development in coastal areas.

TI  - Landscape Properties Affect Biodiversity Response To Retention Approaches In Forestry
JO  - Journal of Applied Ecology
PY  - 2017
AB  - Retention forestry, in which trees and tree patches are set aside at harvest to promote biodiversity, has been proven to have positive effects on biodiversity at the stand-level across different taxa. However, the effectiveness of retention approaches with regard to landscape composition remains unexplored. We linked the effect sizes from two meta-analyses (31 case studies and 1050 comparisons from boreal and temperate regions), which quantified the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation as a result of retention practices, with the stand property of retention level (the percentage of trees retained after logging) and with Landsat-retrieved landscape data on forest cover and spatial configurations at three spatial scales (1, 3, and 5 km radii). We found that, in addition to the fundamental importance of tree retention as a local-scale implementation for conservation, landscape properties were important in models to predict biodiversity responses. The effect sizes for species richness decreased with increasing patch contiguity within the landscapes at all spatial scales. Similar results were observed for abundance responses at the largest spatial scale. These results suggest that biodiversity responses to tree retention may be weaker in less fragmented landscapes, which is in agreement with theoretical and empirical findings from agricultural landscapes (‘the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis’). The benefits of retention levels within a stand (percentage of trees retained) varied amongst species with different habitat requirements (forest-dependent, open habitat, and generalist species). Whilst this stand-level property was often an important determinant of biodiversity responses, models that included landscape properties as explanatory variables always performed better than those that were only based on the retention levels for all species groups. Thus, within-stand habitat conditions and landscape configurations likely have synergetic influences on biodiversity responses. Synthesis and applications. In addition to the importance of stand-level properties, such as the action of retention harvesting itself and the number of trees retained, conditions in the surrounding landscape can simultaneously affect biodiversity in stands that are managed under retention forestry. Our study suggests that retention patches are particularly important in moderately fragmented landscapes. Retention practices could be less important in previously unlogged and less fragmented landscapes, where setting aside large reserves is a conservation priority. For highly fragmented landscapes, different actions of forest restoration, which are not limited to set-aside actions during logging, would be important. Our study emphasizes that carefully planned conservation schemes with a large-scale perspective, as well as local-scale actions, such as retention forestry, are critical for effective forest management and conservation planning. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Up-Scaling Fuel Hazard Metrics Derived From Terrestrial Laser Scanning Using A Machine Learning Model
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - The characterisation of fuel distribution across heterogeneous landscapes is important for wildfire mitigation, validating fuel models, and evaluating fuel treatment outcomes. However, efficient fuel mapping at a landscape scale is challenging. Fuel hazard metrics were obtained using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and the current operational approach (visual fuel assessment) for seven sites across south-eastern Australia. These point-based metrics were then up-scaled to a continuous fuel map, an area relevant to fire management using random forest modelling, with predictor variables derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Sentinel 2A images, and climate and soil data. The model trained and validated with TLS observations (R-2 = 0.51 for near-surface fuel cover and 0.31 for elevated fuel cover) was found to have higher predictive power than the model trained with visual fuel assessments (R-2 = -0.1 for the cover of both fuel layers). Models for height derived from TLS observations exhibited low-to-moderate performance for the near-surface (R-2 = 0.23) and canopy layers (R-2 = 0.25). The results from this study provide practical guidance for the selection of training data sources and can be utilised by fire managers to accurately generate fuel maps across an area relevant to operational fire management decisions.

TI  - The Economic Benefits Of Rainwater-Runoff Reduction By Urban Green Spaces: A Case Study In Beijing, China
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urbanization involves the replacement of vegetated surfaces with impervious built surfaces, and it often results in an increase in the rate and volume of rainwater surface runoff. Urban green spaces play a positive role in rainwater-runoff reduction. However, few studies have explored the benefits of rainwater-runoff reduction by urban green spaces. Based on inventory data of urban green spaces in Beijing, the paper evaluated the economic benefits of rainwater-runoff reduction by urban green spaces, using the rainwater-runoff-coefficient method as well as the economic valuation methods. The results showed that, 2494 cubic meters of potential runoff was reduced per hectare of green area and a total volume of 154 million cubic meters rainwater was stored in these urban green spaces, which almost corresponds to the annual water needs of the urban ecological landscape in Beijing. The total economic benefit was 1.34 billion RMB in 2009 (RMB: Chinese currency, US$1 = RMB6.83), which is equivalent to three-quarters of the maintenance cost of Beijing's green spaces; the value of rainwater-runoff reduction was 21.77 thousand RMB per hectare. In addition, the benefits in different districts and counties were ranked in the same order as urban green areas, and the average benefits per hectare of green space showed different trends, which may be related to the impervious surface index in different regions. This research will contribute to an understanding of the role that Beijing's green spaces play in rainwater regulation and in the creation and scientific management of urban green spaces. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Space Education And Awareness In South Africa-Programmes, Initiatives, Achievements, Challenges & Issues
JO  - 15th International Conference on Space Operations, 2018
PY  - 2018
AB  - South Africa’s involvement in the Space Science started at the dawn of the “Space Age”. Before this, South Africa had been involved in Astronomy since 1820, when the first permanent astronomical observatory (and scientific institution) in the southern hemisphere was completed at the Cape of Good Hope. Despite this rich history, South Africa has unfortunately, for various reasons, not been able to fully exploit the benefits of space technology and its applications to meet the challenges-it faces. One reason in particular is lack of awareness and understanding by planners, decision-makers and users about the potential benefits of space technology in planning and implementation of socio-economic development plans. In recent years, South Africa has made the development and cultivation of a domestic space industry a priority, citing the critical roles that space science, technology and innovation play in economic growth and socio-economic development. However, to ensure a long-term viable space programme and a growing space industry, it is imperative that South Africa builds the necessary capacity to support such an industry-hence the need to create awareness and an appreciation for STEM-based careers at all levels of society which, for our school-going population, is likely to translate into an increase in the uptake and appreciation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In South Africa, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) plays a leading role in the implementation of space science and technology activities. Current space-related projects include the Satellite Build Programme; Operation Phakisa and the CubeSats Development Programme. There are also a number of local programmes and initiatives to promote space education and awareness. These are initiated, supported and implemented by various organizations, from the DST and its agencies through to the private sector and industry, as well as non-governmental and nonprofit organizations. With regard to reaching out to schools, the DST conducts Space Weeks and other science festivals, as well as numerous initiatives by the local Radio Amateurs Clubs working with schools on High Altitute Ballooning projects. Nonetheless, it has been noted that although there is much effort and resources expended on STEM awareness, there is notable lack of its intended impact. The role of educators/teaching staff will therefore be addressed focusing on their contribution to the goals of such STEM programmes. This paper discusses the various Space-based STEM programmes that have been put in place to promote space education awareness and the contribution made by various role playes. Furthermore, this paper will showcase a concept for a new approach to Space Awareness activities, and its potential to drive STEM awareness programmes in the country. Lastly, this paper aims to recognize the achievements of South Africa in promoting space education and awareness in the country and the related issues and impediments to pursue these programs. The paper also emphasizes the importance of introducing space education programs in schools not only for the children but for the teachers in particular. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

TI  - On The Potential Of Surfers To Monitor Environmental Indicators In The Coastal Zone
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2015
AB  - The social and economic benefits of the coastal zone make it one of the most treasured environments on our planet. Yet it is vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Coastal management aims to mitigate these pressures while augmenting the socio-economic benefits the coastal region has to offer. However, coastal management is challenged by inadequate sampling of key environmental indicators, partly due to issues relating to cost of data collection. Here, we investigate the use of recreational surfers as platforms to improve sampling coverage of environmental indicators in the coastal zone. We equipped a recreational surfer, based in the south west United Kingdom (UK), with a temperature sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) device that they used when surfing for a period of one year (85 surfing sessions). The temperature sensor was used to derive estimates of sea-surface temperature (SST), an important environmental indicator, and the GPS device used to provide sample location and to extract information on surfer performance. SST data acquired by the surfer were compared with data from an oceanographic station in the south west UK and with satellite observations. Our results demonstrate: (i) high-quality SST data can be acquired by surfers using low cost sensors; and (ii) GPS data can provide information on surfing performance that may help motivate data collection by surfers. Using recent estimates of the UK surfing population, and frequency of surfer participation, we speculate around 40 million measurements on environmental indicators per year could be acquired at the UK coastline by surfers. This quantity of data is likely to enhance coastal monitoring and aid UK coastal management. Considering surfing is a world-wide sport, our results have global implications and the approach could be expanded to other popular marine recreational activities for coastal monitoring of environmental indicators.

TI  - Exploring The Spatial Patterns Of Vegetation Fragmentation Using Local Spatial Autocorrelation Indices
JO  - Journal of Applied Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of urban vegetation obtained from discrete land cover classes is sensitive to classification errors and can result in a substantial loss of information, due to the degradation of continuous quantitative information. Although there is an increasing ecological need to use continuous methods to understand spatial heterogeneity and vegetation fragmentation, they remain unexplored. Since local indicators of spatial association (LISA) can capture important spatial patterns of clustering and dispersion at a local scale, it can capture important ecological patterns and process of vegetation fragmentation. This work examines the utility of LISA which allows exploration of local patterns in spatial data in identifying high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) spatial clusters of vegetation patches and fragmentation patterns in Harare metropolitan city in Zimbabwe. The LISA indices of Getis-Ord Gi∗ and local Moran's I are computed both on continuous normalized difference vegetation index and discrete land cover data of vegetation and nonvegetation of Sentinel 2016 and 2018. Local spatial clustering patterns are identified with Z-score values that indicate the significance of each statistic. High positive Z-scores are located in the large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation. Negative Z-scores are located in more dispersed and highly fragmented vegetation. The results suggest that there is a strong tendency for large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation patches to be spatially clustered and for small, isolated and sparse vegetation patches to be dispersed. The highly fragmented vegetation patches are located in the heavily urbanized part of the city. Overall, findings of this study underscore the relevance of the spatially explicit method of LISA as a valuable source of spatial information for the assessment of local spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. This can be used to develop policies that support effective conservation and restoration strategies. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Trajectories Of Deforestation, Coffee Expansion And Displacement Of Shifting Cultivation In The Central Highlands Of Vietnam
JO  - Global Environmental Change
PY  - 2013
AB  - Production of commodities for global markets is an increasingly important factor of tropical deforestation, taking over smallholders subsistence farming. Measures to reduce deforestation and convert shifting cultivation systems towards permanent crops have recently been strengthened in several countries. But these changes have variable environmental and social impacts, including on ethnic minorities. In Vietnam, although a forest transition - i.e. shift from shrinking to expanding forest cover - occurred at the national scale, deforestation fronts and agricultural colonization for commodity crops - a.o. coffee - still dominated the Central Highlands plateaus. Previous studies suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were on the one hand the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households - the majority ethnic group in Vietnam - and on the other hand the corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000-2010. Land use changes were linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached -0.31%y-1 of the total area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and other perennial crops over agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants, pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late 2000s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net losses of natural forest. Implications for policies that may affect deforestation are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - How To Manage Complexity And Quality In Space Applications
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2012
AB  - Products in space business are characterized by high complexity, on-the-edge technologies and strict dependability requirements within a tight cost and schedule frame. Experience from past programs shows that schedule delays and cost increase did only to a small extent result out of lack of technical capabilities, but mainly due to late identification of critical issues and under-estimation of program surveillance. The latter may occur both on customer and supplier side. The paper presents an approach to handle complexity in such programs which proved to be successful within the German SAR-Lupe Program and is currently implemented in the Kazakhstan Space Program. For the AIT Center, which is currently being procured within the Kazakhstan Space Program, a project surveillance organization based on ECSS standards has been established at the procurement organization. Within this surveillance organization, all ECSS branches such as Project Management, Product Assurance and System Engineering are represented and have been trained to control all supplier activities. On the one hand, this approach enables the procurement organization - which also contains future AIT Center operators and managers - to gain more knowledge out of the design, manufacturing and installation activities. On the other hand, supplier independent project surveillance does help the supplier to identify discrepancies and risks early in the schedule, minimizing discrepancies at the end of the project. Objective of the presentation is to sensitize the community for the necessity and the benefits of a vital program, quality and system engineering management culture for a successful space program. Specific focus will be set on the Requirement Traceability and Verification Control approach of the procurement organization, as well as on the Observation Process as formal operative communication process between procurement organization and supplier. Besides operation of a recognized space test center, IABG has a long heritage in space quality management and program support, e.g. in the design and implementation of the national SAR-Lupe earth observation program or in its role as German national surveillance organization (NSO) for ARIANE and VEGA launcher manufacturing.

TI  - Study On The Compactness Assessment Model Of Urban Spatial Form
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2011
AB  - The dramatic changes of China's urban spatial form have brought many problems in economic, social and urban construction. These changes also put the urban environment under enormous pressure, which was so fragile that forced urban sustainable development into serious challenge. To understand the progress and mechanism of urban landscape pattern changes, building appropriate quantitative assessment model for urban spatial form is significance for not only promoting China's sustainable urban development, but also achieving the goal of rational use and protection of regional eco- environment, which were the urgent needs of urban development in China. Based on Thinh et al. 's urban compactness degree derived from the law of universal gravitation, we built a new quantitative model, the Normalized Compactness Index (NCI), to assess urban spatial form, in which the round-shape city was supposed to achieve the highest compact degree giving the same urban size. NCI was obtained by dividing Thinh et al. 's original compactness by the maximum compactness that was defined for a round-shape city, which served as a standard unit of measurement to standardized the calculation results and eliminate the impact of urban size on compactness, and thus facilitated comparative analysis between different cities or the same city among different periods. We selected two periods (2002 and 2007) for empirical analysis in Xiamen City, using Landsat ETM + and Landsat TM remote sensing images as data sources. The whole area of city was divided into construction land and non-construction land. Construction land included building (residential, commercial, service and public facilitiy), mining, traffic and other land use types; non-construction land contained water body, wetland, woodland, farmland, bare land, etc. The results showed that: on the one hand, all of Xiamen's compact degrees of urban construction land in different spatial scalesincreased from 2002 to 2007; on the other hand, with the spatial scale increased, the values of NCI in two periods showed similar trend which was quick down first and slow steady followed. Therefore, we recommend that the model-scale analysis was necessary when using NCI for the comparative analysis between different cities or different periods in the same city. The significance of building compact city was reflected in relieving resource scarcity (such as land and energy), and overall sustainable development demands in China. The lower city's compact degree, the more fragmentized the urban space layout is, the higher costs and lower efficiency of population movements, economic activities and social intercourses within the city. However, more "round-shape" for urban spatial distribution presented urban population, industry, transportation, facilities and capitals are denser, cost is lower and efficiency of traffic and resource use are higher. Meanwhile, compact city could make it more concentrated for industries as well as flows of population, goods and information. Therefore, from macro level, the theory of compact city may guide urban development. NCI provided a new technical indicator for the quantitative assessment of urban spatial form. There is an urgent need to strengthen the empirical study of compact city, plan compact development route, and optimize regional spatial structure according to different geographical characteristics.

TI  - Modeling Crop Yield In West-African Rainfed Agriculture Using Global And Local Spatial Regression
JO  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
PY  - 2013
AB  - Performance of crop yield models is generally evaluated without testing their ability to capture yield spatial variability across a large area. Local soil and environmental conditions or management factors usually cause significant crop yield variability. In West Africa, landscape heterogeneity and data scarcity pose yet additional challenges to crop yield modeling. In this study, conditional autoregression (CAR) and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were used to better understand spatial patterns in sorghum {[}Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], pearl millet {[}Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.], and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields in Burkina Faso. A series of SPOT satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) 1-km(2) 10-d composite images spanning the crop growing season and observations of rainfall, topography, soil properties, and labor availability were used as explanatory variables in the CAR and GWR models. Regression analyses revealed that crop yield was significantly related to rainfall and topography in the semiarid and subhumid agroecological zones of Burkina Faso. Soil properties and labor availability mainly affected sorghum and millet yields in the semiarid zone. By addressing spatial dependency between crop yield observations in the two zones, GWR outperformed CAR models. For CAR models, adjusted R-2 (R-a(2)) values for the sorghum, millet, and cotton yields were 0.76, 0.70, and 0.50, respectively, for the semiarid zone and 0.54, 0.32, and 0.30, respectively, for the subhumid zone. For GWR models, R-a(2) values were 0.85, 0.70, 0.78, respectively, for the semiarid zone and 0.76, 0.67, 0.65, respectively, for the subhumid zone. Thus, despite limited data availability, GWR can be used to model the spatial variability of crop yields across large areas in West Africa.

TI  - Street Tree Health From Space? An Evaluation Using Worldview-3 Data And The Washington Dc Street Tree Spatial Database
JO  - URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Spatially accurate and timely information on tree health is an essential component of maintaining sustainability in a species-rich urban setting. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite images from June 11th, July 30th and August 30th, 2017 to detect field-measured health condition classes of 2308 trees within the District of Columbia Department of Transportation's Street Tree Spatial Database. For each street tree in each image, we measured six vegetation indices (VIs), and find that NDVI1 (defined as the normalized ratio of the red and the first of the near infrared bands) on the July image shows the strongest statistical difference among the VI values of trees classified in the field during 2017 as in good, fair, or poor health condition. This result confirms that high spatial resolution remote sensing images provided the opportunity for a timely tree health assessment at individual tree crown level. Notably, the variability in VI attributable to health condition classes is smaller than the large declines in VIs between the June and August image dates. This greendown phenological pattern occurs similarly for trees in all health condition classes, and is thus an essential consideration when comparing VIs from different years or months for tree health assessment. The tree health condition discrimination was overwhelmed by this greendown phenology and the spectral variability in these species-rich urban settings. Based on these findings, we propose useful strategies of using these high-resolution WV-3 data for street tree health management in other cities.

TI  - Incidence And Etiology Of Clinically-Attended, Antibiotic-Treated Diarrhea Among Children Under Five Years Of Age In Low- And Middle-Income Countries: Evidence From The Global Enteric Multicenter Study
JO  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Diarrhea is a leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income countries. While vaccines may prevent diarrhea infections for which children often receive antibiotics, the contribution of individual enteropathogens to antibiotic use is minimally understood. We used data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) to estimate pathogen-specific incidence of antibiotic-treated diarrhea among children under five years old residing in six countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia before rotavirus vaccine implementation. GEMS was an age-stratified, individually-matched case-control study. Stool specimens were obtained from children presenting to sentinel health clinics with newly-onset, acute diarrhea (including moderate-to-severe and less-severe diarrhea) as well as matched community controls without diarrhea. We used data from conventional and quantitative molecular diagnostic assays applied to stool specimens to estimate the proportion of antibiotic-treated diarrhea cases attributable to each pathogen. Antibiotics were administered or prescribed to 9,606 of 12,109 moderate-to-severe cases and 1,844 of 3,174 less-severe cases. Across all sites, incidence rates of clinically-attended, antibiotic-treated diarrhea were 12.2 (95\% confidence interval: 9.0-17.8), 10.2 (7.4-13.9) and 1.9 (1.3-3.0) episodes per 100 child-years at risk at ages 6 weeks to 11 months, 12-23 months, and 24-59 months, respectively. Based on the recommendation for antibiotic treatment to be reserved for cases with dysentery, we estimated a ratio of 12.6 (8.6-20.8) inappropriately-treated diarrhea cases for each appropriately-treated case. Rotavirus, adenovirus serotypes 40/41,Shigella, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli, andCryptosporidiumwere the leading antibiotic-treated diarrhea etiologies. Rotavirus caused 29.2\% (24.5-35.2\%) of antibiotic-treated cases, including the largest share in both the first and second years of life.Shigellacaused 14.9\% (11.4-18.9\%) of antibiotic-treated cases, and was the leading etiology at ages 24-59 months. Our findings should inform the prioritization of vaccines with the greatest potential to reduce antibiotic exposure among children. Author summary Because diarrhea is the second-leading cause of antibiotic consumption among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), effective vaccines against diarrheal pathogens may have the collateral benefit of reducing antibiotic exposure and resistance selection in these settings. Whereas antibiotic treatment is only recommended for diarrhea cases with blood in the stool (which suggestsShigellaetiology), little is known about real-world diarrhea treatment practices in LMICs. We used data from a study of children experiencing diarrhea and matched, asymptomatic controls residing in LMICs of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa to understand factors leading to antibiotic treatment of diarrhea cases, and the proportion of cases attributable to various enteric pathogens. We identify rotavirus andShigellaas the predominant causes of antibiotic-treated diarrhea at ages 0-23 months and 24-59 months; additional leading causes include adenovirus serotypes 40/41, sapovirus, Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli, andCryptosporidium. We estimate that approximately 12.6 diarrhea cases receive antibiotics inappropriately for each appropriately-treated case in the study settings. Vaccines against prominent enteropathogens may substantially reduce antibiotic consumption among children in LMICs.

AB  - Landscape characteristics and parcel ownership information are often collected on different spatial scales leading to difficulties in implementing land use plans at the parcel level. This study provides a method for aggregating highly resolute landscape planning information to the parcel level. Our parcel prioritization model directly incorporates a Land Trust's conservation goals in the form of a compromise programming model. We then demonstrate the use of our approach for implementation decisions, including parcel selection under a budget constraint and the estimation of a total conservation budget necessary to meet specific conservation goals. We found that these cost constraints significantly alter the composition of the 'best' parcels for conservation and can also provide guidance for implementation. The model's results were integral to a local Land Trust's ability to further define and achieve their goals. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bias Adjustment Of Satellite Rainfall Data Through Gaussian Process Regression (Gpr) Based On Rain Intensity Classification In The Greater Bay Area, China
JO  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Estimating precipitation over large spatial areas remains a challenging problem for hydrologists. Satellite-based remote sensing rainfall products have the advantage of large-scale synchronous coverage, but the reliability of their inversion still needs to be improved. Correcting the bias of satellite-based precipitation estimates (SPEs) is a major challenge in applications such as environmental modeling, hydrology, and water resource management. In this paper, a new bias correction method-a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model method based on rain intensity classification-is proposed to improve the accuracy of a satellite precipitation product-the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run (FR) product-at the daily scale in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. By comparing the effects of the proposed method with those of other existing classical correction methods, namely, quantile mapping (QM), the support vector machine (SVM) approach and direct GPR, it is found that all four methods improve the accuracy of the FR product to varying degrees. GPR based on rain intensity classification has the best effect of FR product improvement, with the CORR increasing from 0.55 to 0.59, the RMSE ranging from 14.37 to 12.79 mm/day, and the BIAS ranging from - 0.14 to 0.03 during the validation period. GPR without rain intensity classification also yields good results, with the QM and SVM methods being the least effective.

TI  - Yield And Leaf Area Index Estimations For Sunflower Plants Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Images
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Vegetation is commonly monitored to improve efficiency of various agricultural practices. Spatial and temporal changes in plant growth and development can be monitored with the aid of remote sensing techniques employing ground, aerial, and satellite platforms. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and multi-spectral cameras developed for UAVs have an important potential for agricultural management activities with high-resolution spatial and temporal images. However, UAV images should be assessed based on ground measurements for using these images as a decision-support tool in agriculture. This study was conducted to estimate sunflower leaf area index (LAI) and yield with the aid of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images generated from raw UAV images. Furthermore, UAV-based NDVI values were compared with NDVI values calculated by using hyper-spectral measurements carried out with a ground-based spectroradiometer. Between July and August of 2017, six flight missions were conducted and spectral measurements were made simultaneously. A significant correlation (R2 = 0.77) was determined between NDVI values that belong to UAV platform and spectroradiometer. Also, regression models developed for sunflower LAI and yield estimation depending UAV-based NDVI have R2 values of 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Evolving Elman Neural Networks Based State-Of-Health Estimation For Satellite Lithium-Ion Batteries
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
PY  - 2023
AB  - With the rapid development of aerospace industry, accurate and timely state-of-health (SOH) estimation by in -orbit measurable parameters is critical for the safe and reliable operation of satellite lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, a novel SOH estimation strategy is proposed based on the k-means clustering analysis (KMCA) and the evolving Elman neural network (EENN) by using the in-orbit discharging voltage data. The time series of equal discharging voltage difference (TSEDVD) is firstly developed as the feature to describe the capacity degradation in each charge-and-discharge cycle. Then, the KMCA is used offline to rank the capacity fading of lithium-ion battery into different health levels by virtue of the TSEDVD feature derived from the historical dataset throughout the battery lifecycle. Furthermore, a set of EENN models are constructed offline corresponding to the health levels and employed in estimating the SOH value online, where the improved evolving algorithm combining the genetic and simulated annealing algorithms is proposed to optimize the initial weights and thresholds in order to get the accurate estimation results. For the in-orbit application, the SOH value can be easily estimated online only via the monitored voltage signal exciting the corresponding EENN. The experimental results using the datasets from the NASA Ames Prognostics Center and the real GEO communication satellite demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. It is feasible for the in-orbit SOH estimation of satellite lithium-ion batteries.

Second, in terms of content typology, satellite information data can be subdivided into monitoring content, urban space monitoring content, and satellite information content. Third, the consumption value of satellite content could be subdivided into informational value, environmental, social and governance (ESG) value, educational value, and content value. In order to expand the global content market, Korea will need to focus on creating an ecosystem for the satellite information industry and discovering differentiated content. It will also need to increase the popularization and accessibility of data to the general public and promote the Korean K-Satellite Information Data Industry ecosystem through government support, policy efforts, and policies such as establishing legal systems, increasing investment, and training human resources.

TI  - Spatial Grain Effects Of Urban Green Space Cover Maps On Assessing Habitat Fragmentation And Connectivity
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2021
AB  - The scientific evaluation of landscape fragmentation and connectivity is important for habitat conservation. It is strongly influenced by the spatial resolution of source maps, particularly in urban environments. However, there is limited comprehensive investigation of the spatial grain effect on urban habitat and few in-depth analysis across different urban gradients. In this paper, we scrutinize the spatial grain effects of urban green space (UGS) cover maps (derived from remote sensing imagery and survey data) with respect to evaluating habitat fragmentation and connectivity, comparing among different urban gradient scenarios (downtown, urban periphery, and suburban area) in Hangzhou, a megacity in China. The fragmentation was detected from three indices, including Entropy, Contagion, and Hypsometry. Then morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was applied for the landscape element identification. The possibility of connectivity (PC) and patch importance (dPC) were proposed for measuring the landscape connectivity based on Cores and Bridges from MSPA results. The results indicate that the farther the location is from downtown, the less sensitive the landscape element proportion to the spatial resolution. Among the three fragmentation indices, the overall hypsometry index has the lowest sensitivity to the spatial resolution, which implies this index's broader application value. Considering connectivity, high spatial resolution maps are appropriate for analyzing highly heterogeneous urban areas, while medium spatial resolution maps are more applicable to urban periphery and suburban area with larger UGS patches and less fragmentation. This study suggests that the spatial resolution of UGS maps substantially influence habitat fragmentation and connectivity, which is critical for decision making in urban planning and management.

TI  - Nasa's Laser Risk Reduction Program: A Risk Reduction Approach For Technology Development
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2010
AB  - The benefits of Earth Science (ES) laser instrumentation have been proven by decades of earth-science observations. Lasers allow remote sensing of earth-system variables such as sea elevation, atmospheric composition, wind profiles, cloud cover, ice mass, and vegetation canopy. Further, orbiting platforms provide a unique vantage point that allows laser measurements on a global scale. NASA implemented the Laser Risk Reduction Program (LRRP) to identify and address capability-gap areas where new devices or processes could yield high-reliability mission-ready parts, and to develop components needed to advance the state-of-the-art of laser-based instrumentation. This paper discusses LRRP's approach and the evolution of the program's developments from inception to their planned infusion into NASA's missions. It is the first part of a three-paper presentation (Program goals and organization; 1μ, developments and results at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC); and 2μ developments and results at Langley Research Center (LaRC)) that summarizes LRRP's goals, formulation approach, management organization, and final results. © 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Advanced Insar For Reservoir Geomechanical Analysis
JO  - EAGE Workshop on Geomechanics in the Oil and Gas Industry
PY  - 2014
AB  - Reservoir monitoring improves our understanding of reservoir behaviour and helps achieve more effective reservoir management and prediction of future performance with obvious economic benefits. It relies on an integrated approach involving both data collection and modelling. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a satellite remote sensing technique that can provide surface deformation data with millimetre precision over large areas. Previous publications have already shown how InSAR can provide data on surface subsidence or uplift due to reservoir compaction/expansion, fault/fractures reactivation and areas of possible well failure. In order to link surface deformation to reservoir parameters, we need to use geomechanics and geophysical inversion methods. The calibration of geomechanical models is probably one of the most important InSAR applications within the oil and gas sector. In this paper some examples of how satellite radar data can be extremely effective in tracking fluid migration, in particular in the Middle East area, where vegetation is scarce and radar signals are not affected by soil moisture effects.

TI  - Evaluating The Influences Of Zoning On Urban Ecological Parameters Using Landsat Etm+ And Ikonos
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2009
AB  - Land structure and amount directly influence urban development, since it is an elementary resource for various activities in urban systems. However, land use zoning in urban system is often conducted from the view of economic and social benefits, not considering ecological benefit. Taking Nanjing city as the study area, the present paper studied land cover constitution of different land use zoning and constructed the quantitative relationship between urban ecological parameters of land surface temperature (LST) and land surface dryness (LSD) and land cover constitution. Land cover information was acquired from IKONOS data based on a decision tree method, LST was retrieved from the thermal band of Landsat ETM+ data using mono-window algorithm, and LSD was calculated from the LST/NDVI space. Analysis results showed that land cover constitutions within different land use zonings have great variations, and the relationships between ecological parameters and land cover constitution also showed a close correlation; the percent vegetated area had strong negative relationship with LST and LSD, while the percent impervious surface showed obvious positive relationship with LST and LSD. These conclusions should be considered in urban ecological environment management. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

TI  - Type 2 Diabetes Patients Benefit From The Comodity12 Mhealth System: Results Of A Randomised Trial
JO  - Journal of Medical Systems
PY  - 2016
AB  - Patient acceptance is one of the major barriers toward widespread use of mHealth systems. The aim of this study was to assess system operability and whole trial feasibility, including patients’ experience with their use of COMMODITY12 mHealth system under. Secondary study aims included assessment of several metabolic parameters as well as patient adherence to the treatment. This was a prospective parallel-arm randomized controlled trial in outpatients diagnosed with DM2, being treated in the primary care settings in Lodz region, Poland, with 6 weeks period of follow-up. Patients opinions were collected with 7-item questionnaire, assessing different aspects of system use, as well as EuroQol-5D-5 L questionnaire, assessing health-related quality of life. Sixty patients (female, 24, male, 36, mean age +/− SD 59.5 +/− 6.8) completed study. All four layers of the COMMODITY12 system proved to work smooth under real-life conditions, without major problems. All dimensions of experience with system use were assessed well, with maximum values for clearness of instructions, and ease of use (4.80, and 4.63, respectively). Health related quality of life, as assessed with cumulative utility measure, improved significantly in COMMODITY12 system users (P < 0.05). mHealth system modestly improved glycaemic and blood pressure control, assuring high level of patient adherence with overall adherence reaching 92.9 %. Study proved that the COMODITY12 system is well accepted by type 2 diabetes patients taking part in clinical trial, leading to several clinical benefits, and improved quality of life. Nevertheless, before future commercialisation of the system, several minor problems identified during the study need to be addressed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Evaluating The Effects Of Limited Irrigation On Crop Water Productivity And Reducing Deep Groundwater Exploitation In The North China Plain Using An Agro-Hydrological Model: I. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis, Calibration And Model Validation
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2019
AB  - The agro-hydrological Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro-hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales. The reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors, as well as parameter calibration and model validation. In this study, we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the North China Plain (NCP). First, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the SWAP-WOFOST model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area. On this basis, the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values for soil water content, soil salt concentration, winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), winter wheat aboveground biomass, winter wheat yield, summer maize LAI, summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14.93\%, 27.20\%, 24.60\%, 25.27\%, 23.12\%, 24.55\%, 21.33\% and 17.94\%, respectively, during the calibration period; and the corresponding NRMSE values were 16.26\%, 29.36\%, 24.20\%, 22.75\%, 21.77\%, 22.03\%, 24.38\% and 18.62\%, respectively, during the validation period. The model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables. Furthermore, a distributed SWAP-WOFOST model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology, soil, crops, land use, water resources and administrative divisions, yielding 2809 simulation units. Finally, the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions. The results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values, and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision. In summary, the distributed SWAP-WOFOST model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region.

TI  - Trophic Status Of A Coastal Lagoon-Marine Harbor System: Potential Outwelling Rates To The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef Southern Region
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Eutrophication is still a serious problem in many coastal areas, including the tropics, where river discharges of nutrients is usually high. The ecological stability and ecosystem services of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS), the world's second-largest coral reef system, suffer a generalized impact by riverine discharge of sediment and organic and inorganic nutrients, which may lead to coastal eutrophication and a coral-macroalgal phase shift. However, few data exist on the MRBS coastal zone status, particularly in Honduras. Here, two in situ sampling campaigns were carried out (May 2017 and January 2018) in the Alvarado Lagoon and Puerto Cortes Bay (Honduras). Measurements included water column nutrients, chlorophyll-a (Chla), particulate organic and inorganic matter and net community metabolism, completed with satellite images analysis. The lagoon and bay environments are ecologically different systems and present different sensitivities to seasonal changes in precipitation as shown by the multivariate analysis. Nonetheless, net community production and respiration rates were neither different spatially, nor seasonally. In addition, both environments were highly eutrophic as shown by the TRIX index. Thus, the Puerto Cortes system represents an important source of dissolved nutrients and particulate matter to the coastal zone. Even though offshore, water quality, based on estimated outwelling rates from the Puerto Cortes system to the coastal waters of the southern MRBS region, improved considerably, concentrations of Chla and nutrients remained higher than those typically measured in non-polluted coral reefs in the Caribbean region and the suggested threshold values. In situ monitoring and assessment of these aspects are crucial to evaluate the ecological functioning of and threats on the MBRS, and elaborate and implement adequate policies for integrated management given its regional and global importance.

TI  - Soil Erodibility Mapping Using The Rusle Model To Prioritize Erosion Control In The Wadi Sahouat Basin, North-West Of Algeria
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Soil losses must be quantified over watersheds in order to set up protection measures against erosion. The main objective of this paper is to quantify and to map soil losses in the Wadi Sahouat basin (2140 km(2)) in the north-west of Algeria, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model assisted by a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing. The Model Builder of the GIS allowed the automation of the different operations for establishing thematic layers of the model parameters: the erosivity factor (R), the erodibility factor (K), the topographic factor (LS), the crop management factor (C), and the conservation support practice factor (P). The average annual soil loss rate in the Wadi Sahouat basin ranges from 0 to 255 t ha(-1) year(-1), maximum values being observed over steep slopes of more than 25\% and between 600 and 1000 m elevations. 3.4\% of the basin is classified as highly susceptible to erosion, 4.9\% with a medium risk, and 91.6\% at a low risk. Google Earth reveals a clear conformity with the degree of zones to erosion sensitivity. Based on the soil loss map, 32 subbasins were classified into three categories by priority of intervention: high, moderate, and low. This priority is available to sustain a management plan against sediment filling of the Ouizert damat the basin outlet. The method enhancing the RUSLE model and confrontation with Google Earth can be easily adapted to other watersheds.

TI  - Monitoring, Analysis And Spatial And Temporal Zoning Of Air Pollution (Carbon Monoxide) Using Sentinel-5 Satellite Data For Health Management In Iran, Located In The Middle East
JO  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
PY  - 2020
AB  - Various natural and anthropogenic factors are effective in causing air pollution. The effects of air pollution are more pronounced on the health of living things, especially on the mental and physical health. Therefore, this issue is important because of the importance of health and well-being. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the spatial and temporal monitoring and analysis of air pollution (carbon monoxide, CO) using satellite and remote sensing data in Iran. To do this, Sentinel-5 satellite data for air pollution (CO) monitoring over a 14-month period (November 2018 to December 2019) and Terra satellite and MODIS satellite data with LST index for monitoring changes of daily and nocturnal temperatures (Kelvin unit) over a 24-month period (January 2018 to December 2019) were used. The results showed that the highest amount of air pollution (CO) was obtained in April 2019 with 0.39 mol/m(2). However, the highest amount of air pollution in spatial monitoring of CO was obtained for Tehran and Guilan provinces with values of 0.51 mol/m(2) and 0.49 mol/m(2) respectively, while the lowest amount of CO was 0.19 mol/m(2) for December 2019. Northwestern Iran, south and west areas of the central part of Ardebil province, south half and eastern part of East Azarbaijan province, Sahand mountain range, and western part of the border section of West Azerbaijan province were exposed to air pollution with average values of 0 to 0.21 mol/m(2). Since the highest amounts of air pollution (CO) occur during the cold months of the year, people who are vulnerable to this phenomenon should travel to the polluted sites with observing hygiene principles.

TI  - Monitoring The Spatial Variation Of Aerosol Optical Depth And Its Correlation With Land Use/Land Cover In Wuhan, China: A Perspective Of Urban Planning
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aerosols significantly affect environmental conditions, air quality, and public health locally, regionally, and globally. Examining the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on aerosol optical depth (AOD) helps to understand how human activities influence air quality and develop suitable solutions. The Landsat 8 image and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products in summer in 2018 were used in LULC classification and AOD retrieval in this study. Spatial statistics and correlation analysis about the relationship between LULC and AOD were performed to examine the impact of LULC on AOD in summer in Wuhan, China. Results indicate that the AOD distribution expressed an obvious "basin effect" in urban development areas: higher AOD values concentrated in water bodies with lower terrain, which were surrounded by the high buildings or mountains with lower AOD values. The AOD values were negatively correlated with the vegetated areas while positively correlated to water bodies and construction lands. The impact of LULC on AOD varied with different contexts in all cases, showing a "context effect". The regression correlations among the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and AOD in given landscape contexts were much stronger than those throughout the whole study area. These findings provide sound evidence for urban planning, land use management and air quality improvement.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach To Increase The Value Of Satellite Data For Pm2.5 Monitoring In China
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Limitations in the current capability of monitoring PM2.5 adversely impact air quality management and health risk assessment of PM2.5 exposure. Commonly, ground-based monitoring networks are established to measure the PM2.5 concentrations in highly populated regions and protected areas such as national parks, yet large gaps exist in spatial coverage. Satellite-derived aerosol optical properties serve to complement the missing spatial information of ground-based monitoring networks. However, satellite remote sensing AODs are hampered under cloudy/hazy conditions or during nighttime. Here we strive to overcome the long-standing restriction that surface PM2.5 cannot be obtained with satellite remote sensing under cloudy/hazy conditions or during nighttime. In this work, we introduce a deep spatiotemporal neural network (ST-NN) and demonstrate that it can artfully fill these observational gaps. We quantified the quantitative impact of input variables on the results using sensitivity and visual analysis of the model. This technique provides ground-level PM2.5 concentrations with a high spatial resolution (0.01°) and 24-h temporal coverage, hour-by-hour, complete coverage. In central and eastern China, the 10-fold cross-validation results show that R2 is between 0.8 and 0.9, and RMSE is between 6 and 26 (µg m−3). The relative error varies in different concentration ranges and is generally less than 20%. Better constrained spatiotemporal distributions of PM2.5 concentrations will contribute to improving health effects studies, atmospheric emission estimates, and air quality predictions. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Estimating Solid Waste Generation And Suitability Analysis Of Landfill Sites Using Regression, Geospatial, And Remote Sensing Techniques In Rangpur, Bangladesh
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has been a growing problem in fast-developing cities. A considerable amount of solid waste is generated daily and disposed anywhere, which creates an unhealthy environment. This study aims to develop a model to determine household solid waste (HSW) generation using multiple linear regression and identify suitable landfill sites to ensure proper MSW disposal in Rangpur City, Bangladesh. Socioeconomic variables data like average monthly income, educational level, family size, age of family head, and average HSW generation per day were collected from 381 respondents through stratified random sampling with a 95\% confidence level. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed using variables like surface water, slope, road network, and land use through GIS and remote sensing to find suitable landfill sites. Results of the model show no multicollinearity as the variance inflation factor was estimated to be less than 2 for each independent variable. Furthermore, the model provides a moderate overall fit because of the coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.661), which denotes the independent variables' predictive capability. The results also demonstrate that family size and education are the most critical variables in predicting waste generation because of the values of coefficients 122.39 and - 184.72, respectively. This study also illustrated suitable landfill sites through MCDA, which can be a useful resource for the city authority to ensure environmental sustainability by implementing effective strategies for proper MSW management.

TI  - Determining Land Use/Land Cover (Lulc) Changes Using Remote Sensing Method In L?Leburgaz And Lulc Change's Impacts On Sdgs
JO  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Urbanization is among the human activities that affect the quality of urban life and sustainable urban development at a global scale. For monitoring human-induced changes in cities, studies on the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) based on a series of satellite images along with geographic information systems (GIS) are widely used. This study aims to evaluate the LULC changes in Luleburgaz between 2001 and 2021. For this purpose, the impacts of urban growth on natural areas and how these areas are handled in the context of sustainable development goals are examined, and the effects of urbanization on land use change are evaluated. The accuracy of the LULC maps was evaluated by means of the general accuracy index and the Kappa index. The overall accuracy rates of the land use maps for 2001, 2010, and 2021 were 96.32\%, 93.66\%, and 95.91\%, respectively, while Kappa values were 0.95, 0.91, 0.94. These results indicate that, due to the effect of rapid urbanization and population growth over the last two decades, the built environment increased by 4.82\% and the agricultural land has decreased by 4.88\%. This result is a testament to the upward trend in the built environment at the expense of depleting a significant amount of agricultural land. The findings of the study provide useful data that can aid authorities in making conscious decisions to achieve sustainable urban planning and to improve environmental conditions.

TI  - From Blurred To Sharp: Setting The Standards For More Pragmatic Land Use Planning At The Local Level In Lao Pdr
PY  - 2011
AB  - For the last two decades, since the Rio Conference on Environment and Development, land-use planning (LUP) has been carrying the hopes of providing a concrete instrument to translate sustainable development discourses into practice. In the Lao PDR, it is being seen as a way to provide alternatives to swidden agriculture and more recently, as an instrument to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD). However, when assessing the impact of past LUP, many observers have noted the discrepancy between good intentions, as displayed in policy and project documents, and actual implementation due to the limited capacity of local institutions (Lestrelin et al., 2011a). Overcoming such a problem requires an objective analysis of its extent and its potential negative consequences. To avoid blind trust in delusive success stories, evaluation methods assessing the quality of the LUP process (i.e. level of community participation and understanding of LUP activities by local stakeholders) have been designed (Lestrelin et al., 2011b). From the perspective of developing a country-wide monitoring system for participatory land use planning (PLUP), this paper addresses two main research questions: How to assess the quality of a PLUP output, i.e. measuring the gap between principles and practice in PLUP? What can be done to increase the credibility, and therefore the practicality and feasibility, of the proposed land use plans? By analysing land zoning outputs from past and recent PLUP this paper underlines the irrationality of village LUP maps which often appear inconsistent with the principles of land use policies. In general the management of rural landscapes in the uplands of Lao PDR is difficult to grasp due to a tacit agreement between villagers willing to minimize land taxes and district authority lacking proper human and financial resources. Acknowledging the gap between the declared agricultural land from household surveys and what can be observed from satellite or village land use maps, the paper proposes a new approach to increase planning realism while reinforcing local participation in the PLUP process. An innovative participatory platform involving local communities in learning the complexities of LUP through a role-play was proposed by Bourgoin and Castella (2011). The authors argued that a landscape simulation exercise can help disclose the landscape management and livelihood strategies of different stakeholders at different scales. Building on this knowledge, this paper describes a negotiation platform allowing villagers discuss land zoning and management practices. Adaptive and accessible, the method is assisted by a participatory 3D model combined with a village socio-economic and geographic information system providing feedback about cost/benefit associated with each land use plan. Through successive iterations, villagers gradually refine their plans by exploring land use change scenarios. Beside its contribution to enhanced participation in landscape planning, the proposed method, which was successfully tested in six study villages of Viengkham District, can support the introduction of innovative land use systems in the northern uplands of Lao PDR. Furthermore, this instrument can be used to certify land use plans and provide a standard procedure for PLUP implementation.

TI  - Site Identification For Carbon Sequestration In Latin America: A Grid-Based Economic Approach
JO  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
PY  - 2006
AB  - Latin America harbors a large potential for carbon sequestration and biomass production. This paper deals with the estimation of carbon supply curves for afforestation and reforestation and its implicit carbon sequestration in wood products. The methodology presented aims at determining sequestration costs for individual geographical entities, based on unit-specific land use and ecosystem information, and economic data. This approach allows us to supplement local statistics that are typically scarce and unreliable in developing countries, with independent remotely sensed data in order to have a consistent method that can be applied over a large region. The results are mapped, which allows in-depth appraisal of results in an interactive mode and quick identification of least-cost carbon sequestration sites. The model is dynamic to support decision making at various stages in the Kyoto process. After model calibration and sensitivity analysis, we conducted scenario analysis. For a carbon price scenario of \$20/tC, we find that the cumulative carbon sequestration by 2012 and 2020 is about 125 MtC and 337 MtC, respectively. The net benefit by 2020 could amount up to US\$ 2.3 billion using less than 4\% of the area suitable for afforestation and reforestation in the next 20 years. Our long-term estimates of the cumulative sequestration potential for 100 years imply that tree planting could compensate for more than 7 years of current CO2 emissions of the region's energy sector at low costs.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Based Monitoring System For Discrimination Between Climate And Human-Induced Vegetation Change In Central Asia
JO  - MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
PY  - 2008
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of taking into account precipitation and the vegetation response to it when trying to analyse changes of vegetation cover in drylands with high inter-annual rainfall variability. Design/methodology/approach - Linear regression models were used to determine trends in NDVI and precipitation and their interrelations for each pixel. Trends in NDVI that were entirely supported by precipitation trends were considered to impose climate-induced vegetation change. Trends in NDVI that were not explained by trends in precipitation were considered to mark human-induced vegetation change. Modelling results were validated by test of statistical significance and by comparison with the data from higher resolution satellites and fieldtrips to key test sites. Findings - More than 26 percent of all vegetated area in Central Asia experienced significant changes during 1981-2000. Rainfall has been proved to enforce most of these changes (21 percent of the entire vegetated area). The trends in vegetation activity driven by anthropogenic factor are much scarcer and occupy about 5.75 percent of the studied area. Practical implications - Planners, decision makers and other interest groups can use the findings of the study for assessment and monitoring land performance/land degradation over dry regions. Originality/value - The study demonstrates the importance of taking into account precipitation and the vegetation response to it when trying to analyse changes of vegetation cover in drylands with high inter-annual rainfall variability.

TI  - Influence Of Melioration In Natural Ecological Processes Of A Small River Valley (Poland)
JO  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
PY  - 2016
AB  - On the basis of the topographic maps from 1933, 1951 and 1962 (sc 1:10 000, 1:25 000 and 1:100 000, respectively) and the satellite image from 2014 (sc 1:10 000), we determined changes in the channel of the small Brynica river (Southern Poland) as well as in the land-use pattern along this river valley after its melioration. Terrain regulation and drainage brought about an intensification of the overland runoff, and a decrease in irrigation of the territory. Due to soil overdrying, some tracts of the valley are experiencing a moisture deficiency. Peat drying can lead to negative consequences, because shallow peats mostly occur on the study territory. Disappearance of peaty soils acts to decrease the degree of suitability of the riverside territories for economic purposes as well as their capacity for recovery. The schematic map of vegetation distribution along the river valley prior to and after melioration as compiled from results of field observations displays differences between mosaic quasi-natural vegetation and areas of typical agrocenoses. The preservation of the natural values along the Brynica valley is possible through balanced economic management, while the differentiation of topography contributes to creating favorable conditions for the formation of biodiversity.

TI  - How Well Do Gridded Precipitation And Actual Evapotranspiration Products Represent The Key Water Balance Components In The Nile Basin?
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Study region: Nile Basin, Africa. Study focus: The accurate representation of precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) patterns is crucial for water resources management, yet there remains a high spatial and temporal variability among gridded products, particularly over data-scarce regions. We evaluated the performance of eleven state-of-the-art P products and seven ETa products over the Nile Basin using a four-step procedure: (i) P products were evaluated at the monthly scale through a point-to-pixel approach; (ii) streamflow was modelled using the Random Forest machine learning technique, and simulated for well-performing catchments for 2009-2018 (to correspond with ETa product availability); (iii) ETa products were evaluated at the multiannual scale using the water balance method; and (iv) the ability of the best-performing P and ETa products to represent monthly variations in terrestrial water storage (Delta TWS) was assessed through a comparison with GRACE Level-3 data. New hydrological insights for the region: CHIRPSv2 was the best-performing P product (median monthly KGE' of 0.80) and PMLv2 and WaPORv2.1 the best-performing ETa products over the majority of the evaluated catchments. The application of the water balance using these best-performing products captures the seasonality of Delta TWS well over the White Nile Basin, but overestimates seasonality over the Blue Nile Basin. Our study demonstrates how gridded P and ETa products can be evaluated over extremely data-scarce conditions using an easily transferable methodology.

TI  - Inter-Comparison Of Land Surface Model Soil Moisture Data With Traditional Soil Dryness Indices
PY  - 2015
AB  - Australia has a long history of frequent forest fires, owing to its hot and dry climate. The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI; McArthur, 1967) was introduced in 1958 for operational fire warnings over Australia and is still used operationally, albeit with continuous development. The formulation of FFDI is based on air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and a component representing fuel availability called the Drought Factor (DF). The DF is defined on the assumption that the fuel moisture content (FMC) is affected by both long term and short term drying effects. The short term drying effects are based on the time since recent rain and past 20 days rainfall amount. The long term drying effects are based on either the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI; Keetch and Byram, 1968) or Mount's Soil Dryness Index (MSDI; Mount, 1972). KBDI and MSDI are estimates of the cumulative soil moisture deficit (SMD) and represent the degree of drought in the landscape. Studies show that the occurrence of large destructive fires corresponds to very large SMD values. SMD therefore is a key variable in the FFDI calculations with accurate estimates of soil moisture crucial for effective wildfire management, rating and warning. The KBDI is widely used in the Australian states of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland while MSDI is used in the states of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia (Finkele et al., 2006). KBDI and MSDI are simple water balance models that do not take into account the majority of physical factors which affect soil moisture dynamics such as soil type, vegetation type, terrain or aspect. They over-simplify the evapotranspiration and runoff processes, which are critical in calculating accurate soil moisture states, leading to large errors. Recent progresses in the remote sensing of soil moisture, data assimilation techniques and physically based land surface models has led to the development of new soil moisture products. Two examples of such datasets are the soil moisture analyses produced from the Bureau of Meteorology's operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system and remotely sensed soil wetness measurements from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT; Wagner et al., 2013) instrument. This study undertakes an evaluation of the latter two datasets along with KBDI, MSDI and another simple water balance model called the Antecedent Precipitation Index (API; Crow et al., 2005). In-situ observations of soil moisture from the OzNet hydrological monitoring network (Smith et al., 2012) and Australian national cosmic ray soil moisture monitoring facility (CosmOz; Hawdon et al., 2014) are used to validate the modelled and remotely sensed soil moisture datasets. The verification shows that the NWP soil moisture analyses have greater skill and smaller biases than the KBDI, MSDI and API analyses. This is despite the NWP system having a coarse horizontal resolution and not using observed precipitation. The average temporal correlations between observed CosmOz and modelled soil moisture are 0.81, 0.63, 0.76 and 0.73 for NWP, KBDI, MSDI and API. Verification also shows that the remotely sensed Advanced Scatterometer soil wetness product is of good quality. This study suggests that analyses of soil moisture can be greatly improved by using physically based land surface models, remote sensing measurements and data assimilation.

TI  - Spatialization Model Of Population Based On Dataset Of Land Use And Land Cover Change In China
JO  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
PY  - 2002
AB  - The spatialization of population of counties in China is significant. Firstly, we can gain the estimated values of population density adaptive to different kinds of regions. Secondly, we can integrate effectively population data with other data including natural resources, environment, society and economy, build I km GRIDs of natural resources reserves per person, population density and other economic and environmental data, which are necessary to the national management and macro adjustment and control of natural resources and dynamic monitoring of population. In order to establish population information system serving national decision-making, three steps ought to be followed: 1) establishing complete geographical spatial data foundation infrastructure including the establishment of electric map of residence with high resolution using topographical map with large scale and high resolution satellite remote sensing data, the determination of attribute information of housing and office buildings, and creating complete set of attribute database and rapid data updating; 2) establishing complete census systems including improving the transformation efficiency from census data to digital database and strengthening the link of census database and geographical spatial database, meanwhile, the government should attach great importance to the establishment and integration of population migration database; 3) considering there is no GIS software specially serving the analysis and management of population data, a practical approach is to add special modules to present software system, which works as a bridge actualizing the digitization and spatialization of population geography research.

TI  - Mapping The Occurrence Of Chromolaena Odorata (L.) In Subtropical Forest Gaps Using Environmental And Remote Sensing Data
JO  - Biological Invasions
PY  - 2015
AB  - Globally, subtropical forests are rich in biodiversity. However, the native biodiversity in these forests is threatened by the presence of invasive species such as Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson, which thrives in forest canopy gaps. Our study explored the utility of WorldView-2 data, an 8-band high resolution (2 m) imagery for mapping the probability of C. odorata occurrence (presence/absence) in canopy gaps of a subtropical forest patch, the Dukuduku forest, South Africa. An integrated modelling approach involving the WorldView-2 vegetation indices and ancillary environmental data was also assessed. The results showed a higher performance of the environmental data only model (deviance or D2 = 0.52, p < 0.05, n = 77) when compared to modelling with WorldView-2 vegetation indices such as the enhanced vegetation index, simple ratio indices and red edge normalized difference vegetation index (D2 = 0.30, p < 0.05, n = 77). The integrated model explained the highest presence/absence variance of C. odorata (D2 = 0.71, i.e. 71 %). This model was used to derive a probability map indicating the occurrence of invasive species in forest gaps. A 2 × 2 error matrix table and the receiver operating characteristic curve derived from an independent validation dataset (n = 38) were used to assess the model accuracy. Approximately 87 % of canopy gaps containing C. odorata were correctly predicted at probability threshold of 0.3. The derived probability map of C. odorata occurrence could assist management in prioritizing target areas for eradication of the species. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Oxidative Stress Biomarkers Indicate Sublethal Health Effects In A Sentinel Small Mammal Species, The Deer Mouse (Peromyscus Maniculatus), On Reclaimed Oil Sands Areas
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2016
AB  - Oxidative stress biomarkers can provide highly relevant insights into the physiological state of an organism. We compared endogenous oxidative stress biomarkers (lipid peroxidation and glutathione redox status) in the liver and testes as well as the hepatic antioxidant vitamins A and E in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) collected from a reclaimed mine site on the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (northern Alberta, Canada), with those from a non-industrial reference site within the same natural macroregion. Both glutathione redox and Vitamin A status in the liver as well as glutathione redox status in the testes were disrupted in mice from the reclaimed site, indicating oxidative stress in these organs. Increased oxidative stress in the liver was associated with greater exposure to Co, Se, and Tl and contributed to poorer body condition and lowered testis size in animals from the reclaimed site (data from companion study). These results confirm health effects and biological costs in this native, sentinel small mammal from exposure to pollutants at the reclaimed mine site. This work provides compelling information and insight into the value of oxidative stress biomarkers as physiological tools that can indicate the health status and fitness of local wild animals. In particular, this approach can be used by risk assessors and other stakeholders from the oil sands region in future environmental risk assessments to improve wildlife management and conservation practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Using Aerial Photography To Estimate Riparian Zone Impacts In A Rapidly Developing River Corridor
JO  - Environmental Management
PY  - 2012
AB  - Riparian zones are critical for protecting water quality and wildlife, but are often impacted by human activities. Ongoing threats and uncertainty about the effectiveness of buffer regulations emphasize the importance of monitoring riparian buffers through time. We developed a method to rapidly categorize buffer width and landuse attributes using 2007 leaf-on aerial photography and applied it to a 65 km section of the Toccoa River in north Georgia. We repeated our protocol using 1999 leafoff aerial photographs to assess the utility of our approach for monitoring. Almost half (45%) of the length of the Toccoa River was bordered by buffers less than 50 ft wide in 2007, with agricultural and built-up lands having the smallest buffers. The percentage of river length in each buffer width category changed little between 1999 and 2007, but we did detect a 5% decrease in agricultural land use, a corresponding increase in built-up land use, and an additional 149 buildings within 100 ft of the river. Field verification indicated that our method overestimated buffer widths and forested land use and underestimated built-up land use and the number of buildings within 100 ft of the river. Our methodology can be used to rapidly assess the status of riparian buffers. Including supplemental data (e.g., leaf-off imagery, road layers) will allow detection of the fine-scale impacts underestimated in our study. Our results on the Toccoa River reflect historic impacts, exemptions and variances to regulations, and the ongoing threat of vacation home development. We recommend additional monitoring, improvements in policy, and efforts to increase voluntary protection and restoration of stream buffers. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Application Of An Essential Data Set Based Computer System In Support Of Maternal And Child Care
JO  - International Journal of Bio-Medical Computing
PY  - 1992
AB  - A simple functional application software has been developed to support care providers in information management related to perinatal care activities, family planning encounters and the immunization of infants. This was distributed to some sites and was implemented with no organizational change, though the methods differed. An early assessment of the software after a period of implementation is made based on the observations and experiences reported. This is presented in a framework outlined earlier as the OUST model. The systems objective to enhance the value of information was observed to have been partially achieved. The utility to the users is observed in the ability of the end-users at the sites to identify the local community needs and adopt accordingly suitable strategies. The social impact was seen in the assistance provided by the sentinel action of the system in tracking dropouts from the immunization programme at a site, thereby ensuring quality in care and also economic benefits. From a technical stand-point, the application software was small yet functional and in it were incorporated features that ensured data quality. The application software was designed to generate a unique identity code to assist in follow-up of the target population. Based on the data entered it compiled reports to meet administrative requirements, reports that gave the care providers feedback and lists to coordinate in the follow-up of the target population. The application software is a common data collection tool that can assist in building a data registry for health outcomes research. © 1992.

TI  - The Influence Of Man-Induced Land-Use Change On The Upper Forest Limit In The Romanian Carpathians
JO  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Romanian Carpathians are an important part of Europe's mountain areas, the actual pattern of forest cover reflecting a long history of land-use practices and management. In the present work, we analyse the recent changes (1945-2018) in the upper forest cover along the 37 mountain units using old topographic maps and Sentinel-2A high-resolution satellite images in order to quantify several spatial indicators related to the upper forest cover and upper forest limit changes. In order to understand the regional variation, we have tested the correlations between the location of the upper forest limit, the local topography and the geographical position. Furthermore, with a view to evaluate the upper forest limit change according to its potential climatic limit, the 10 degrees C July isotherm was estimated based on WorldClim climate data. In addition, the situations inside and outside the major protected areas were also analysed and discussed so as to assess the possible regional differences as related to human effects. The results revealed a continued downward shift in the mountain areas located below the 1600 m a.l.s., but significant advancement above these values, indicating regional differences in land-use intensity and land management. This study is aimed to increase further knowledge as to the upper forest limit in the European mountains and to provide a baseline for modelling future potential change according to the environmental and anthropogenic variability in the area.

JO  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
PY  - 2020
AB  - Providing nectar and pollen through the establishment of insectary plants is one approach to conserving natural enemies and enhancing biological control of arthropod pests. Recent studies show that natural enemy performance may be influenced by the diversity of insectary plant species and the resources they provide. We conducted laboratory assays to investigate the influence of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) alone and in a mixture on the performance of the insidious flower bug, Orius insidiosus (Say, 1832). We measured performance as longevity, fecundity and predation of O. insidiosus reared on a laboratory diet of Ephestia kuehniella or its field prey, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner). O. insidiosus survived on average 20-25\% longer and oviposited 67-88\% more eggs when provided with either insectary species compared to a water only control. However, when provided with a biculture of cowpea and buckwheat, O. insidiosus survived 35\% longer and laid 111\% more eggs compared to the water only control, with a strong preference for cowpea as an oviposition host. This study provides novel empirical evidence that cowpea, a plant anecdotally cited for its insectary properties, functions as a preferred oviposition sites compared to buckwheat and laboratory standard green beans. The presence of insectary resources, however, did not significantly influence predation on O. nubilalis sentinel prey by O. insidiosus as we anticipated. These results indicate that the performance of beneficial insects like O. insidious may be differentially influenced by the resources provided by insectary species and should be screened for potential benefits before establishing in field settings. Further implications of plant diversification for conservation biological control are discussed.y

TI  - Can Shallow Groundwater Sustain Small-Scale Irrigated Agriculture In Sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence From N-W Ethiopia
JO  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - We present an evidence-based approach to identify how best to support development of groundwater for small-scale irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources. We demonstrate and test this proposal at a case study site: Dangila woreda in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. This site was selected to allow exploration of a shallow weathered volcanic regolith type aquifer formation which is found to the South of Lake Tana and also exists more extensively across Ethiopia. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in SSA. In comparison with other global regions, the groundwater resources of SSA are among the least understood; borehole records and hydrogeological studies are lacking. Assessments of groundwater resources do exist, but they rely on remotely sensed data combined with modelling at national or regional scale, and they focus on deeper aquifers. There is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments. The case study here presents such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with developing small-scale irrigation utilising shallow groundwater. A multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community-based monitoring, field investigation and existing published data. Water table recovery tests at existing hand dug wells confirm that well yields of 1 l/s are achievable at the end of the wet season when water would be available to support an additional irrigated crop. Hydraulic conductivity estimates ranged from 0.2 to 6.4 m/d in the dry season and from 2.8 to 22.3 m/day in the wet season. Specific yield estimations have a wider range though the mean value of 0.09 is as would be expected. Records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period April 2014 to April 2018 show that all the wells maintained useable water levels beyond the end of the rainy season. An assessment of the hydrology of the Kilti catchment provided insights into groundwater availability within the wider area. The catchment receives about 1600 mm/year of rainfall, of which about 350 mm/year enters the groundwater as recharge, discharging to the river as baseflow with a similar amount of rapid runoff contributing to a total river flow of about 400 mm/year. The lowest value of baseflow is 82\% of the mean baseflow, which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year. We conclude that arguments previously put forward against the promotion of shallow groundwater use for agriculture in SSA appear exaggerated. Our analysis challenges the view that shallow aquifers are unproductive and that irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater-dependent ecosystems. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable, and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. It appears that factors other than the physical availability of groundwater control the 'triggering' of development. Interventions to promote development of groundwater resources should recognise the importance of shallow aquifers.

TI  - Coordinated Exploration Model And Its Application To Coal And Coal-Associated Deposits In Coal Basins Of China
JO  - ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION
PY  - 2021
AB  - China is a top world producer of coal resources with numerous coal-rich basins country-wide that also contain coalbed methane (CBM), an unconventional natural gas resource. Recent exploration of coal and CBM resources has also led to the discovery of rare, precious, and scattered metal minerals, including sandstone-type U and Ga-Ge-Li. High-grade and industrial-value deposits have been discovered in the Ordos, Junggar, and other basins across China during exploration for coal resources. Application of coordinated exploration theories and techniques in multiple energy and coal-associated ore deposits, such as coal and unconventional natural gas in coal, achieves efficient and practical exploration of natural resources. Based on the systematic study of accumulation and occurrence of coal and coal-associated mineral resources in coal basins, the basic idea of coordinated exploration for coal and coal-associated deposits is proposed, and multi-targets and multi-methods based on a coordinated exploration model of coal-associated deposits is developed. Coordinated exploration expands the main exploration objective from coal seams to coal-associated series, extending the exploration target from targeting coal only to coal-associated deposits. Entrance times for exploration are decreased to realize coordinated exploration for coal, unconventional natural gas and syngenetic/associated mineral resources in coal by implementing a 'one-time approach' -one time in and out of a coal seam to minimize disturbance and time needed for extraction. According to the differences of geological background in China's coal basins, four coordinated exploration model types, including co-exploration of coal and coal-associated unconventional natural gas, coal and solid minerals, coal and metal minerals, and coal with water resources are established. Other models discussed include a multi-target coordinated exploration model for the combination of coal, coal-associated gas, solid minerals, and metal minerals accordingly. The exploration techniques of coal and coal-associated resources include regional geological investigation and research and synthetic application of other techniques including seismic surveys, drilling, logging, and geochemical exploration. Particularly, applying the 'multi-purpose drill hole' or reworking coalfield drill holes into parameter wells, adding sample testing and logging wells, determining gas-bearing layers by logging and gas content measurement, jointly measuring multiple logging parameters, sampling, and testing of coal-strata help in the exploration and evaluation of coal resources, coal-associated unconventional natural gas resources, and coal-associated element minerals. Accordingly, a system of integrated Space-Air-Ground exploration techniques for coordinated exploration of coal and coal-associated minerals is established. This includes high-resolution, hyperspectral remote-sensing technique, high-precision geophysical exploration and fast, precise drilling, testing of experimental samples, as well as coordinated exploration and determination methods of multi-target factors, multi-exploration means, multi-parameter configuration and optimization, big data fusions and interpretation techniques. In recent years, the application of this integrated system has brought significant breakthroughs in coal exploration in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other provinces, discovering several large, ten-billion-ton coalfields, such as the Eastern Junggar and Tuha basins, and also in exploration and development of CBM from low-rank coals in Fukang, Xinjiang, discovery the Daying U Deposit in Inner Mongolia, the Junggar Ultralarge Ga Deposit, Lincang, Yunnan, and the Wulantuga, Inner Mongolia, Ge-bearing coal deposits, and the Pingshuo Ultralarge Li-Ge Deposit.

TI  - Morphometric Analysis Of Upper Tons Basin From Northern Foreland Of Peninsular India Using Cartosat Satellite And Gis
JO  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
PY  - 2014
AB  - The morphometric analysis of river basin helps to explore the interrelationship between hydraulic parameters and geomorphologic characteristics. The study has been conducted in the Upper Tons basin of Northern Foreland of Peninsular India. The river basin has been characterized using the topographical maps, CARTOSAT satellite image integrated using the GIS techniques. The drainage density analysis indicates lower values in the north-eastern regions and thus these regions can be categorized as better ground water potential zone. There are in total 10 sub-watersheds which have been delineated; SW-4 has maximum drainage density (4.75), stream frequency (5.61) and drainage texture (26.64) followed by SW-6-10. The prioritized sub-watershed numbers SW-4 and SW-6-10 need conservation practices because of their high erodibility and run-off. SW-1-3 and SW-5 regions have better permeable bed rocks and hence good for water harvesting. The areal parameter indicates elongated shape of basin and moderate to steeper ground slope. The results are supported by extensive field survey. This study can be applied for soil and water management, as well as disaster prevention from similar type of drainage basins.

TI  - Residual Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method For Lithium-Ion Batteries In Satellite With Incomplete Healthy Historical Data
JO  - IEEE ACCESS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Due to the strict requirements of satellite systems, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the key components is very important to the reliability and security of satellite systems. Otherwise, a failure could lead to catastrophic consequences and enormous economic losses. Because of the complex structure of the satellite and its complex space environment, the factors that affect the satellite systems status are numerous. Moreover, as a result of the healthy historical data of key components in satellite are too few, which makes the traditional methods based on analysis model are not suitable for RUL prediction of key components in satellite. In this paper, in order to solve the RUL prediction problem of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in satellite with incomplete healthy historical data, we propose an efficient RUL prediction method for key components of satellite, which is called Residual Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method (RRULPM), based on the study of Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET). The RRULPM is make up of degradation model based on MSET state estimation and criteria of failure based on historical degradation value, which is developed by improving MSET and combining the residuals with life cycle damage (LCD) prediction creatively when lacking healthy historical data. Experimental results demonstrate that the RRULPM is excellent to achieve the RUL prediction problems of LIBs through the actual in orbit telemetry data. Unlike previous RUL prediction methods, RRULPM provides good feasibility and effectiveness. This research can serve as guidance for prognostics and health management (PHM) of key components in satellite.

TI  - Study Of Habitat Quality Assessment Using Geospatial Techniques In Keoladeo National Park, India
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems on the Earth. They are generally considered a transitional state between terrestrial-aquatic habitats and provide numerous vital ecosystem services to mankind. Wetlands are under a tremendous pressure due to growing human interference, urbanization, conventional agriculture, industrial expansions, and overexploitation of ecological services. The Keoladeo National Park (KNP) is a manmade wetland, world heritage site and a designated Ramsar site in India, widely known for its avian biodiversity. Due to insufficient amount of water supply and widespread invasion of Prosopis juliflora, notable spatio-temporal changes are observed in the land cover affecting habitat quality of the park. The present study is designed to highlight the importance of very high-resolution satellite data for characterization of the wetland ecosystem. It assesses the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) and habitat quality, a model built in the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) tool, is utilized to analyze the effect of land cover changes and increase in P. juliflora on habitat quality in the park. The study concludes that drastic changes in LULC and rampant spread of P. juliflora have deteriorated the quality of habitat for bird species. Furthermore, it highlights importance of geospatial tools in mapping, monitoring, and managing wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Linking Urban Sprawl And Surface Urban Heat Island In The Teresina-Timon Conurbation Area In Brazil
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2021
AB  - Negative consequences of urban growing disparities usually lead to impressive levels of segregation, marginalization, and injustices, particularly in the context of climate change. Understanding the relations between urban expansion and social vulnerability has become extremely necessary for municipality management and sustainable urban development. Although the study of urbanization in Latin America (LA) has been well discussed, little attention has been given to how the population is affected by urban expansion-oriented movement after the 2008 economic crisis. Massive investments in infrastructure displaced the population to peripheral zones without adequate urban planning, which reflected in alteration in land use and land cover (LULC), followed by environmental impacts and public health issues caused by thermal discomfort, notably in semiarid regions. This paper aims to evaluate the effects of urban sprawl on the Teresina-Timon conurbation (TTC) area's local population, located in Brazil's northeast. Descriptive metrics (Moran's I statistic and social vulnerability index) and orbital products derived from remote sensing-LULC and Land surface temperature (LST) maps-were applied. The results indicated that the housing program 'My House My Life' (PMCMV) had increased the values of land consumption per capita since 2009 significantly, showing a clear expanding trend. The gradual replacement of green areas by residential settlements resulted in an increased LST. The PMCMV program contributed substantially to a change in land use and land cover, which increased the extent of urbanized areas and changed the local microclimate.

TI  - Self-Supervised Learning For Crop Classification Using Planet Fusion
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2023
AB  - Benefiting from the high cadence and spatial resolution of the new generation of Earth observation satellites, remote sensing technology is allowing us to derive more valuable information for the agricultural sector. Crop classification is one of the fundamental information derivatives from Earth observation data researchers used for food security, crop monitoring, and economic assessment. The robustness of a crop classification model to variations in environmental and management conditions due to time and location is one of the crucial requirements. To achieve this, we developed a novel self-supervised method using the advantage of unlabeled samples and transformer architectures. We used six different areas in Germany and four years to evaluate the robustness of the model. Our experiments showed that self-supervised deep learning methods could provide a significant advantage in handling these variations. In some cases, we observed around 30 percentage points improvements in F1-score performance compared to a Random Forest based model. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

TI  - Sensitivity Of Gis Patterns To Data Resolution: A Case Study Of Forest Fragmentation In New Zealand
JO  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
PY  - 2012
AB  - Spatial pattern plays an influential role in the ecological processes of ecosystems, and landscape pattern metrics computed from remotely sensed data offer a way to quantify the correlation between pattern and process. However, the resolution of geographic data affects the landscape metrics obtained from a GIS, with consequent implications for the interpretation of biological effects studied at landscape scales. Here, we studied the effect of data resolution on estimates of three metrics of forest cover commonly used in the landscape ecology literature: percent forest cover, forest edge density, and mean fractal dimension of forest patches. Estimates of each metric were computed for six landscapes (30 x 30 km) in the North Island of New Zealand at 10 different data resolutions with pixels ranging from 30 to 1000 m. All three metrics exhibited significant changes in value as a result of changing resolution, and the sensitivity of the fragmentation metrics to data resolution was impacted in a non-linear manner by the amount of forest cover in a landscape. In landscapes with low forest cover, changing pixel size altered estimates of percent forest cover by as much as 75\%. Extrapolation to correct for effects of changing resolution and different landscapes seems a likely solution in the case of some, but not all, metrics. The scaling problem hinders efforts to correlate spatial pattern with ecosystem process and the subsequent conclusions concerning biodiversity and conservation policy.

TI  - Logo: An Efficient Local And Global Data Collection Mechanism For Remote Underwater Monitoring
JO  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
PY  - 2022
AB  - The oceans play an important role in our daily life and they form the lungs of our planet. Subsequently, the world ocean provides so many benefits for humans and the planet including oxygen production, climate regulation, transportation, recreation, food, medicine, economic, etc. However, the oceans suffer nowadays from several challenges ranging from pollution to climate change and destruction of underwater habitat. Hence, the use of remote sensing technologies, like sensor networks and IoT, is becoming essential in order to continuously monitor the wide underwater areas and oceans. Unfortunately, the limited battery power constitutes one of the major challenges and limitations of such technologies. In this paper, we propose an efficient LOcal and GlObal data collection mechanism, called LOGO, that aims to conserve the energy in remote sensing applications. LOGO is based on the cluster scheme and works on two network stages: local and global. The local stage is at the sensor node and aims to reduce its data transmission by eliminating on-period and in-period data redundancies. The global stage is at the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) level and aims to minimize the data redundancy among neighboring nodes based on a spatial-temporal node correlation and Kempe's graph techniques. The simulation results on real underwater data confirm that LOGO mechanism is less energy consumption with high data accuracy than the existing techniques.

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration Based On The Satellite-Retrieved Near-Infrared Reflectance Of Vegetation (Nirv) Over Croplands
JO  - GIScience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accurate information on cropland evapotranspiration (ET) can facilitate effective agricultural management. However, the application of existing physical models over broad regions may be impeded due to the need for difficult to acquire information about environmental factors that constrain ET. The recently developed near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), which can reasonably characterize ecosystem photosynthesis without the need for additional environmental information, is potentially useful for estimating cropland ET and reducing the difficulty in ET modeling. As such, we proposed two simply formulated semi-empirical models that utilize NIRv as a major factor constraining cropland ET. The first model, termed Penman–Monteith+ (PM+), computed canopy transpiration using the PM equation along with canopy conductance values estimated from NIRv-derived gross primary productivity (NIRv-GPP) and calculated soil evaporation using an empirical approach. Another model, termed underlying water-use efficiency+ (uWUE+), used the uWUE approach along with the NIRv-GPP to predict ET. We calibrated and validated PM+ and uWUE+ over 32 cropland flux sites and then compared them with six complex models. The better model between PM+ and uWUE+ was applied to estimate regional ET over North China Plain (NCP), where typical C3 and C4 crops were planted during 2010–2018, along with remote sensing and meteorological data. Results indicated that the two new models can reasonably estimate cropland ET. The PM+ model reproduced an eight-day value of ET (denoted as eight-day ET) with R2 = 0.741 and RMSE = 5.638 mm/8d, slightly better than the uWUE+ model (R2 = 0. 674 and RMSE = 6.275 mm/8d) for a cross-site validation over 17 flux sites of the validation dataset. Site-level validation revealed consistently better performance of PM+ compared to uWUE+ over most flux sites. For the comparisons with six existing models, PM+ can perform better than all these models and uWUE+ is better than five of them. Subsequently, the PM+ (uWUE+) model reasonably reproduced eight-day ET over four sites under a dry climate (Arid Index ≤ 0.5) with site-level R2 = 0.691 (0.617) and RMSE = 6.663 (7.906) mm/8d on average, which is better than the six existing models. In addition, the regional mean annual ET varied from 590 mm per year (mm/yr) to 680 mm/yr over NCP with a significant increasing trend of 9.05 mm/yr (p < 0.01), and the ET values in maize growing season were higher than that in wheat growing season. Our results demonstrated that the simply formulated PM+ and uWUE+ models can provide simple and robust approaches to estimate regional and global cropland ET. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Effective Management Of Trans Boundary Landscapes - Geospatial Applications
PY  - 2014
AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity advocates the use of landscape and ecosystem approaches for managing biodiversity, in recognition of the need for increased regional cooperation. In this context, ICIMOD and regional partners have evolved Transboundary Landscape concept to address the issues of conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and systems (e.g., biodiversity, rangelands, farming systems, forests, wetlands, and watersheds, etc.). This concept defines the landscapes by ecosystems rather than political/administrative boundaries. The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is extremely heterogeneous, with complex inter linkages of biomes and habitats as well as strong upstream-downstream linkages related to the provisioning of ecosystem services. Seven such transboundary landscapes, identified across west to east extent of HKH, have been considered for programmatic cooperation, include: Wakhan, Karakoram-Pamir, Kailash, Everest, Kangchenjunga, Brahmaputra-Salween, and Cherrapunjee-Chittagong. The approach is people centered and considers the cultural conservation as an essential first step towards resource conservation efforts in the region. Considering the multi-scale requirements of study, the geospatial technology has been effectively adopted towards: (i) understanding temporal changes in landscapes, (ii) long term ecological and social monitoring, (ii) identifying potential bio corridors, (iii) assessing landscape level vulnerability due to climatic and non-climatic drivers, and (iv) developing local plans on extractions of high value economic species supporting livelihoods, agroforestry system and ecotourism, etc. We present here our recent experiences across different landscapes on assessment of three decadal changes, vegetation type mapping, assessment of socio-ecological drivers, corridor assessment, ecosystem services assessment, models for optimal natural resource use systems and long term socio-ecological monitoring.

TI  - The Making Of Box-Office Collection: Qualitative Insights From Bollywood
JO  - MARKETING INTELLIGENCE \& PLANNING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Purpose This study explores the making of box-office collection using the Indian film industry, Bollywood, as a case. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts in-depth interviews with cinematic experts in the Indian film industry and analyzes the interview transcripts using thematic analysis. Findings This study uncovers several noteworthy findings. First, films that drew both general (MASS audience) and niche (CLASS audience) viewers dominate the box office. Second, viewers prefer to see films that are based on true events, and their engagement will be deeper if the subject of the film resonates with them. Third, stakeholder share is variable and changes over time. Fourth, the marketing budget for a film is typically higher than its production budget, and it is determined by the producer's financial resources. Fifth, the dominance of big over small banner films motivates the latter to pursue online rather than cinematic releases. Finally, Internet access creates value and returns on investment through sales of satellite and musical rights, while strategic promotion and distribution reap maximum benefit for box-office collection. Originality/value Unlike past studies that rely on secondary data, this study uses primary qualitative data to explore the making of box-office collection. This study also focuses on an alternative film industry, Bollywood, as it is a vast context that remains underexplored.

TI  - Inbound Arrivals: Using Weather Surveillance Radar To Quantify The Diurnal Timing Of Spring Trans-Gulf Bird Migration
JO  - ECOGRAPHY
PY  - 2023
AB  - More than two billion birds migrate through the Gulf of Mexico each spring en route to breeding grounds in the USA and Canada. This region has a long history of complex natural and anthropogenic environments as the northern Gulf coast provides the first possible stopover habitats for migrants making nonstop trans-Gulf crossings during spring migration. However, intense anthropogenic activity in the region, which is expanding rapidly at present, makes migrants vulnerable to a multitude of obstacles and increasingly fragments and alters these habitats. Understanding the timing of migrants' overwater arrivals has biological value for expanding our understanding of migration ecology relative to decision-making for nonstop flights, and is imperative for advancing conservation of this critical region through the identification of key times in which to direct conservation actions (e.g. temporary halting of wind turbines, reduction of light pollution). We explored 10 years of weather surveillance radar data from five sites along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to quantify the daily timing and intensity of arriving trans-Gulf migrants. On a daily scale, we found that migrant intensity peaked an average of nine hours after local sunrise, occurring earliest at easternmost sites. On a seasonal level, the greatest number of arrivals occurred between late April and early May, with peak intensity occurring latest at westernmost sites. Overall intensity of migration across all 10 years of data was greatest at the westernmost sites and decreased moving farther to the east. These findings emphasize the differential spatial and temporal patterns of use of the Gulf of Mexico region by migrating birds, information that is essential for improving our understanding of the ecology of trans-Gulf migration and for supporting data-driven approaches to conservation actions for the migratory birds passing through this critical region.

TI  - The Rights Of Foreign Investors Over Land According To Investment Protection Treaties: A View From Latin America
JO  - ACDI Anuario Colombiano de Derecho Internacional
PY  - 2016
AB  - In the last ten years foreign investment in agriculture has increased notably in Latin America. Foreign investors, as much private as state, are interested on agricultural production, either for an expected benefit, or to assure the food supply. This increase in investment can be positive for the countries of the region. Nevertheless, in order to carry out this determination it is necessary to understand, among other things, the legal effects of these investment flows. This work maintains that the property rights acquired by foreign investors over the land and their agricultural undertakings may be different from the rights of national investors. This is because of foreign investment protection treaties. The strengthening of the rights of foreign investors affects the relationship between these investors and the receiving state. This article analyzes the effects of the rights of foreign investors in ration to five categories of state initiatives. Specifically, they are 1) the right to export production or the cost of exportation in the face of commercial and taxation measures; the right to continue a project in the face of changes within the regulatory paradigm; 3) the right to continue a project in the face of political change or new social preferences; 4) the right to receive better compensation in the face of agricultural reforms or programmes of historical reparation; 5) the right to maintain the business plan in the face of a food crisis. © 2016, Universidad del Rosario.

AB  - In recent years a number of space-related Public Private Partnerships (PPP) have been successfully initiated, for example in the field of satellite communication (e.g. Skynet, Alphasat, and Hylas) as well as Earth observation (e.g. TerraSAR-X). These initiatives represent a coordinated public and private European response to the increased market demand and have shown the potential of PPPs for the development of future space-based scrvices. The necessity to continuously interact with the finance community to highlight the benefits and risks associated with the development of space-based application markets, together with the need of assessing new funding schemes, is becoming an important element to link the space sector to economic growth. The estimate of the potential market involving satellite-based services is many times greater than the initial costs associated with the development of the satellite infrastructure. In this context, PPPs and PFIs (Private Finance Initiative) schemes are increasingly used to develop markets and operate space based services, whether for commercial or institutional customers. ESA's Integrated Applications Promotion (IAP) programme is a newly created instrument for developing sustainable space-based services on a regional, European and global scale, in strong cooperation with end-users and relevant stakeholders. The programme aims at bringing space-based solutions to new terrestrial markets, federating new communities of users and optimising the exploitation of space assets. Integrated applications are benefiting European industrial competitiveness, while serving the needs of European societies and global communities. This paper includes the main outcome of an ESPI workshop organised in the frame of ESA's IAP programme, dedicated to how to foster the involvement of new sources of funding for the development of space-based sustainable services. It assesses different funding mechanisms applicable to ESA's IAP programme and seeks to identify a relevant roadmap for optimising the use of financing models for future space-based services. Furthermore, the paper aims at identifying and analysing the relevant economic, financing, and legal factors. Copyright © (2012) by the International Astronautical Federation.

TI  - Multiple Gps Measurements For Digital Elevation Model
JO  - Computers in Agriculture and Natural Resources - Proceedings of the 4th World Congress
PY  - 2006
AB  - Accurate representation of field topography is required for implementation of precision conservation management practices. Topographic data for the development of agricultural field digital elevation models (DEM) can be acquired using GPS-equipped farm vehicles during field operations. Repeated measurements of elevation data from multiple field operations may improve DEM accuracy over time. However, repeated topographic measurements would consequently increase the volume of data required to be stored, processed and manipulated unless the amount of data passed on between measurement intervals is reduced. For farmers to utilize topographic information effectively and efficiently, processes must be developed to analyze and manage topographic data collected during field operations and to generate DEMs with minimal user input and intervention. This paper presents an overview of the processes needed for utilizing multiple sets of topographic measurements acquired during field operations for the development of agriculture field DEMs. The procedures needed for DEM development include data preparation and cleaning, data reduction and geostatistical analysis with interpolation. Preliminary data analysis is conducted to extract useful information from GPS raw data set for preparation and cleaning prior to data combination process. The data combination and estimation technique presented is used to estimate elevation data without requiring new sets of measurements to be stored and reprocessed every time they are acquired. Finally, the elevation values at unmeasured locations can be predicted using geostatistical analysis and kriging interpolation method is used to predict the DEM surface.

TI  - Fire-Induced Carbon Emissions From Tropical Mixed Broad-Leaved Forests Of The Terai–Siwalik Region, Central Nepal
JO  - Journal of Forestry Research
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest fires are one of the major environmental issues globally. In Nepal, substantial amounts of forest biomass and carbon are lost due to fire. Nepal’s high value lowland forests are particularly vulnerable to fire. However, there are limited studies on the estimation of biomass loss and carbon emissions due to fire. Thus, this research addresses the information gap in the tropical mixed broad-leaved forests of Nawalparasi District. The forests were divided into three strata: Lower Tropical Sal Mixed Broad-leaved Forest, Hill Sal Forest and Riverine Forest, and from these four community-managed forests were selected for estimating above ground biomass. Ninety-two sample plots were set out for above ground biomass estimation in burnt and non-burnt areas. Forest fire incidences from 2001 to 2017 were acquired from the MODIS fire data. Forest biomass and carbon emissions were estimated using standard allometric equations. The fuel fraction consumed during the fire was estimated through field surveys during the forest fire season. The results show that every year, over 3158 ha of forests are burnt, resulting in some 1108 tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to approximately 4066 t CO2, 2581 t CO and 1474 t CH4. Among the forests, the Hill Sal Forest was more vulnerable to fire. Forest management strategies, therefore, should include construction of fire lines and conservation ponds along with capacity building and raising awareness among local communities and stakeholders. © 2020, Northeast Forestry University.

TI  - Challenges And Opportunities Of Area-Based Conservation In Reaching Biodiversity And Sustainability Goals
JO  - Biodiversity and Conservation
PY  - 2022
AB  - Area-based conservation is essential to safeguard nature’s diversity. In view of expanding human land use, increasing climate change and unmet conservation targets, area-based conservation requires efficiency and effectiveness more than ever. In this review, I identify and relate pressing challenges to promising opportunities for effective and efficient protected area governance and management, to enhance research, decision-making and capacity building in area-based conservation under uncertain future developments. I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments. Post-2020 international biodiversity and sustainable development goals could be met earlier if protected areas were more effective. I consequently conclude with the need for a global information system that is to support area-based conservation by synthesizing challenges and opportunities for protected area management effectiveness and efficiency at the local to global level. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The world is currently suffering from informational future shock. The author places the SABC against this milieu and discusses the responsibility of the different departments and their contribution to education in South Africa. The unique political and deraographical problems that South Africa has to contend with, result in the integration of television, the computer and telecommunication to bring about the long-term benefits of educational technology. The author postulates certain prerequisites for the optimum educational use of the SABC. Future shock in South Africa is intense: it is, at the same time, a developed and a developing country. This challenge should be met. The SABC will pay attention to a formal 'high school of the air* to serve the unschooled labour force in South Africa. Both non-formal and informal education will be cardinal factors in the educational programme planning of the SABC. This organisation will constantly have to attend to contemporary technological advancement - cable, satellite, etc. - in the design of its educational programming. The SABC accepts this challenge and invites educational institutions in South Africa to make use of its services. © 1984, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

TI  - Quantifying Four Decades Of Changes In Land Use And Land Cover In India’s Kailash Sacred Landscape: Suggested Option For Priority Based Patch Level Future Forest Conservation
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Effective quantification of land cover changes remains a challenge in Himalayan hills and mountains, and has a colossal value addition for natural resource management. Here we present a new robust method for classifying land cover vegetation at physiognomic scale along steep elevational gradients from ~ 200 to ~ 7000 masl in the Kailash Sacred Landscape, Western Himalaya, India along with four decades of land use and land cover changes (1976–2011) using remote sensing techniques coupled with intensive ground surveys. Results show that forest cover loss was minimum ca 7.14% of existing forest in 1976; but, however forest fragmentation is high especially in montane broad-leaved and subtropical needle leaved forests. This change largely impacted the quality of valuable tree species such as Quercus spp. Post 1976, continuous migration forced conversion of high altitude agricultural lands into grasslands and scrublands. Human settlement expansion was high especially in low altitudinal range valleys between 1000 and 2000 masl and has increased 6.76 fold since 1976, leading to high forest fragmentation in spite of reduced agriculture area in the landscape. Our physiognomic level classified land cover map will be a key for forest managers to prioritize conservation zones for protecting this unique forest land. © 2018, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.

TI  - Changes In Croplands As A Result Of Large Scale Mining And The Associated Impact On Food Security Studied Using Time-Series Landsat Images
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2010
AB  - Geographic information systems and satellite remote sensing information are emerging technologies in land-cover change assessment. They now provide an opportunity to gain insights into land-cover change properties through the spatio-temporal data capture over several decades. The time series of Landsat images covering the 1985-2009 period is used here to explore the impacts of surface mining and reclamation, which constitute a dominant force in land-cover changes in the northwestern regions of the Czech Republic. Advanced quantification of the extent of mining activities is important for assessing how these land-cover changes affect ecosystem services such as croplands. The images employed from 1985, 1988, 1990, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 assist in mapping the extent of surface mines and mine reclamation for large surface mines in a few selected areas of interest. The image processing techniques are based on pixel-by-pixel calculation of the vegetation index, such as NDVI. The NDVI values are classified into the defined classes based on CORINE Land Cover 2000 data in a 3280 km(2) strip of Landsat images. This distribution of NDVI values is used to estimate the land-cover classes in the local areas of interest (184 km(2), 368 km(2), 737 km(2), and 1,474 km(2)). Thus, the approximate land-cover stability of the 3,280 km2 strip during the whole 1985-2009 period is used to explore land-cover disturbances in the local areas of surface mines. In the case of NDVI, it also includes variations, presumably caused by seasonal vegetation effects, and local meteorological conditions. However, the main trends related to mining activities during the long-term period can be clearly understood. As a result, other objectives can be explored in the 1985-2009 period, such as cropland changes to other land use classes, changes of cropland patterns, and their impacts on food security. The presented spatio-temporal modeling based on long time series from 12 satellite images provides considerable experience for processing NDVI in the framework of identification of land-cover classes and also, to a certain degree, cropland variability with its impact on food security.

TI  - Water Quality Assessment For Organic Matter Load In Urban Rivers Considering Land Cover Dynamics
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2023
AB  - The strategy of considering a model that is comparable to the Soil Conservation Service Curve–Number (SCS-CN) method that employs land use maps to estimate the effects of land use on the water quality has considerable potential for application. This paper presents the LUPC (Land Use Pollutant Contribution) Model to estimate water pollution from the watershed land use obtained by satellite image classification (Sentinel-2). It defines that each land use produces a specific pollutant load per unit area, called Pollutant Standard Index (PSI), which undergoes degradation and/or retention until it reaches the river. This decay estimate is based on a Kernel Function. Organic matter (OM) was the pollutant chosen for the definition of the LUPC model and fractions of labile and refractory organic matter (LOM, ROM). The model was applied to the Barigüi River basin, and five samples were collected at 12 points along the river. Water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV–Visible absorbance in addition to chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and nitrogen and phosphorus fractions were the reference for modeling purposes. The results indicate that organic loads can be estimated from watershed characteristics, despite influence from seasonal influences captured by the PSI values and the basin shape parameter. Considering its versatile response, the LUPC model can be used for integrated water resources and land use planning and management and be indicator of the potential pollution of rivers by OM. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Small, low cost missions have become highly successful in recent years, with outstanding results and many scientific and commercial uses. The capabilities of small satellites have also seen dramatic improvement, and have matured to the point where such missions offer huge potential within space exploration. In previous centuries, nations and groups participating in exploration have gained significant economic benefits, and leadership and a modest investment in space exploration now can position the UK as a key player in this area. SSTL has been investigating lunar missions since 1996, and have conducted numerous in-house, ESA funded and most recently nationally funded studies for the UK STFC (see footnote). However the prospect of small, affordable spacecraft regularly visiting the Moon and providing useful scientific returns has mostly remained as concept studies to date. This paper focuses on the development and current project status of a low-cost lunar mission. This mission focuses on providing surface assets with communications and navigation infrastructure, but also offers the potential to offer a space science platform (including surface penetrators) for affordable science missions. Additionally it will act as a proving ground for technology essential for the robotic exploration of Mars, de-risking larger programmes such as EXOMars and MSR. Copyright IAF/IAA.

TI  - Characterizing Hydrological Droughts Within Three Watersheds In Yunnan, China From Gnss-Inferred Terrestrial Water Storage Changes Constrained By Grace Data
JO  - Geophysical Journal International
PY  - 2023
AB  - The spatiotemporal evolution of drought is often modulated by climate and watershed characteristics. While numerous drought studies using space geodesy have been conducted in Yunnan, the scarcity and limited sensitivity of observation instruments have hindered the development of watershed-scale drought analyses. This study aims to accurately characterize hydrological droughts within three watersheds in Yunnan from 2011 January to 2021 May by a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) inversion constrained by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data. Initially, we employed Variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis to reconstruct the 3-D crustal deformations at 43 GNSS stations resulting from hydrological loadings. We then computed the time-series of vertical displacements caused by GRACE Mascon water products. Subsequently, utilizing the method of least squares, we derived the scaling factors between the vertical crustal displacements (VCD) obtained from GNSS observations and the synthetic displacements derived from GRACE data. By combing scaling-factor-adjusted VCDs derived from GRACE with the GNSS data, we have obtained accurate estimates of water storage for three Yunnan watersheds. Finally, we identified drought events characterized by abnormal decreases in water storage and used climatological methods to quantitatively describe the severity, extent and recovery of these drought extremes. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of various earth elastic structures on the scaling factors, and demonstrated their advantageous contribution to aligning GNSS and GRACE observations. In conclusion, our study introduces a novel approach to integrate GNSS and GRACE retrievals, allowing for accurate characterization of droughts in data-scarce regions, which cannot be achieved by GNSS or GRACE individually. Moreover, our results underscore the potential benefits of watershed-scale drought monitoring and analysis for effective water resource management. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Monitoring The Spatiotemporal Terrestrial Water Storage Changes In The Yarlung Zangbo River Basin By Applying The P-Lsa And Eof Methods To Grace Data
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Yarlung Zangbo River Basin is a regulator of water vapor changes in China and even Asia. To avoid the shortcomings of traditional water resource monitoring methods, this study used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data to monitor the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) in this river from 2002 to 2015 with the help of the polynomial-least squares approach (P-LSA) and the empirical orthogonal function (EOF). The obtained TWSA was compared with hydrometeorological data from several sources to discuss the applicability, uniqueness and response relationship. The results showed that (1) the combination of P-LSA and EOF had strong applicability to explore the TWSA in the study area, with R-2 = 0.75 and 0.80, respectively, and could indirectly reflect dry and wet conditions in southwestern China. (2) The TWSA revealed significant cyclical and seasonal fluctuations of approximately 12 months and increased from upstream to downstream and from north to south, which was discussed for the first time in the research area. (3) The EOF method can effectively identify the TWSA principal component and structure (EOF1 contribution = 91.08\%) by removing noise and redundancy, which is beneficial for revealing the laws essential for TWSA changes. (4) The TWSA in the studied watershed was unique (i.e., the clearest periodic changes with the best fitting effect (R = 0.90); peak, low and peak-low difference values that were 1.82, 1.19 and 1.52 times larger than those of the 8 other rivers; and the largest downward trend of 4.13 mm.a(-1)). (5) Rainfall was the decisive factor influencing the TWSA, with correlation coefficients (R) >0.60. This study enhances our overall understanding of the TWSA in this plateau watershed and provides a scientific basis for optimal water resource management. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effect Of Oil Palm Sustainability Certification On Deforestation And Fire In Indonesia
JO  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
PY  - 2018
AB  - Many major corporations and countries have made commitments to purchase or produce only "sustainable" palm oil, a commodity responsible for substantial tropical forest loss. Sustainability certification is the tool most used to fulfill these procurement policies, and around 20\% of global palm oil production was certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO) in 2017. However, the effect of certification on deforestation in oil palm plantations remains unclear. Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations (similar to 188,000 km(2)) in Indonesia, the leading producer of palm oil, as well as annual remotely sensed metrics of tree cover loss and fire occurrence, to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire from 2001 to 2015. While forest loss and fire continued after RSPO certification, certified palm oil was associated with reduced deforestation. Certification lowered deforestation by 33\% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6\% y(-1.). Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, by 2015, certified areas held less than 1\% of forests remaining within Indonesian oil palm plantations. Moreover, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Traffic and mobility are essential ingredients of modern society, as they are important prerequisites for economic and social prosperity. Due to opportunities provided by modern technologies, traffic management has become an important component in improving quality and safety, especially in road traffic. The objective of this paper is to present a novel approach to performing data correlation and to extend the developed techniques and processing strategies to satellite COSMO-SkyMed data (CSK®) in the framework of terrestrial Strategic Picture-based applications. By using an integrated system based on satellite, acoustic and GPS data, wide-area images of the entire road network can complement the selectively acquired data. The integration would take benefit of the enhanced imaging capabilities of COSMO-SkyMed and its high revisit rate given by the future constellation configuration, thus leading to fully exploitable in situ/EO integrated products. The preliminary test activity was performed in November 2010: there were promising results from the innovative system based on the heterogeneous data fusion, from Synthetic Aperture Radar to GPS and Acoustic Sensors. © 2011 WIT Press.

TI  - Remarkable Improvement Of Ecosystem Service Values Promoted By Land Use/Land Cover Changes On The Yungui Plateau Of China During 2001–2020
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2022
AB  - Quantitative evaluation of the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) change and ecosystem service values (ESVs) is of great significance for the scientific optimization of land use structure and the formulation of sustainable land use policy, However, the responses of ESVs to LULC changes in fragile ecosystem regions over long time scales and large spatial scopes in the context of ecological restoration measures have seldom been studied. In this study, the Yungui Plateau in China was used as the study region. Based on annual Moderate–Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover datasets (MCD12Q1) from 2001 to 2020, using the equivalent coefficient value of ESVs modified for the specific situation of China, and adopting the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic method and Spearman's rank correlation analysis, the study estimated the values of 11 types of ecosystem services, and analyzed the dynamics of LULC and its impact on ESVs from 2001 to 2020. The results showed that the LULC pattern in the Yungui Plateau changed dramatically in the past two decades, with a significant increase in forestland. The total ESVs improved remarkably from 638.10 billion yuan in 2001 to 746.99 billion yuan in 2020, and was mainly affected by forest restoration and the conversion of grassland to forestland and farmland to grassland. The distribution of ESVs shows obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity; ESV hot spots were mainly distributed in the edge regions, while ESV cold spots were concentrated on the central and eastern of Yungui Plateau, and the decline in total ESVs still existed and displayed an increasing trend caused by farmland expansion and forestland degradation. Thus, we conclude that the LULC changes caused by ecological restoration measures have a significant positive effect on the improvement of the total ESVs in the Yungui Plateau and suggest that declines in ESVs in local areas should be of high concern in future land use planning and management. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - An Assessment Of Catchment Condition In Australia
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2006
AB  - The condition of Australia's water catchments was assessed in a 2 million km2 intensive land-use zone (ILZ) as part of a National Land and Water Resources Audit (the Audit). The assessment used existing biophysical data obtained from satellite imagery, digital elevation models, computed or derived values, surrogates and existing spatial data from state and national databases. The data were used to derive indicators and an index of relative catchment condition for 3718 sub-catchments and 197 basins. The spatial patterns for catchment condition were then mapped across the ILZ. The term indicator is used consistently to mean a single attribute (even if it is derived from several variables), whereas a sub-index or an index is an aggregation of scaled indicator values. An inventory was made of all potentially relevant biophysical measures of the water, land and biota in catchments that existed in archives. Criteria to assess data quality including a national coverage, ease of interpretation, scale, relevance to policy development and catchment management were applied to some 110 measures from which 21 indicators were ultimately selected and used for tabulation, mapping and interpretation. The data were assembled at 250 m cell resolution and aggregated to 5 km cells as the base unit for analysis. To map the indicators or indices, a five-point classification (quintiles) was used, ranging from relatively poorer to better condition. The class boundaries were based on equal intervals or equal areas under the frequency curve of each indicator or index. Indicator values for each 5 km cell ranged from 1 to 5 (1 being poorer, 5 being better). Index values were calculated by adding the scores for a set of indicators, for example, all the 21 identified and taking a mean for all the 5 km cells within each catchment. Data manipulations and analysis used a multi-component decision support system (DSS), geographic information system (GIS) called catchment condition (CatCon). Numerous maps were generated for each indicator and for indices comprising different combinations of indicators, ranging from the complete set (21), a core set (14) to relatively few (6) and for different regionalisations. Cross-comparisons between catchment condition classes and some consumptive outputs from catchments were also carried out. Only maps for the index based on 14 indicators and a single cross-comparison are presented here as illustrations. The web site www.affa.gov.au/catcon/ has more examples. The main points to emerge were: clear interpretable patterns of better to poorer condition were defined for the intensive land-use zone; visualisations of catchment condition were markedly different for classes defined by equal area or equal interval; the broad patterns of relative condition could be captured with relatively few aggregated indicators; the cross-comparisons suggested areas where land-use changes are needed to develop sustainable land-use systems. The study illustrates that relatively low quality but extensive data can be used to provide a rational basis to identify priority areas for management action and for natural resource management policy development. We suggest that the development of a higher quality national data set in Australia to assess the condition of the Nation's catchments may be best achieved through the co-ordination and collection of core data sets (indicators) at regional scales.

TI  - Investigation Of Seasonal Dust In Northeastern Iran And Numerical Simulation Of Extreme Dust Events Using Wrf-Chem Model
JO  - Journal of the Earth and Space Physics
PY  - 2022
AB  - In recent years, dust storm has become a serious environmental concern and has attracted a lot of attention among atmospheric scientists. Northeast of Iran is a large and strategic population area. Due to its proximity to large arid regions in Central Asia, this region has a high risk of experiensing dust events. In recent years, it has faced many problems regarding dust phenomena. This study is conducted to investigate seasonal dust events in northeastern Iran. To achieve this goal, a combination of station data, reanalysis, satellite and output of the WRF-Chem numerical model have been used simultaneously to improve our understanding of the dust seasonal cycle in northeast of Iran. Accordingly, this research was organized in two parts: monitoring and modeling of dust phenomenon. The results of this study may be useful for forecasting dust storms as well as spatial planning. To investigate the dust events seasonal variabilities, the dust surface mass concentration of MERRA-2 dataset, aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the combined Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms of MODIS sensor of Terra and Aqua satellites were examined during the long-term period (2004-2018). Since the emission of dust is highly dependent on biophysical components, it is necessary to use numerical models. The WRF-Chem numerical model was used for this purpose. The study area includes northeastern Iran and parts of Central Asia. The horizontal resolution of the child domin of 30 km model was performed with 32 vertical levels. The NCEP/FNL is used as boundary conditions with 3-hourly time step and 1-degree horizontal resolution for the model configuration. Four extreme dust events were selected to investigate the transport of dust to northeastern Iran. The selected dust events occurred on November 13, 2007, May 29, 2008, June 8, 2015, and October 17, 2017 in northeastern Iran. Therefore, case events were simulated with a time step of 180 seconds and output every three hours using GOCART, AFWA, UoC_S01 and UoC_S11 schemes. The results showed that the maximum dust activity occurred in spring with AOD value equal to 0.59 and dust surface mass concentration is 645.2 µg m -3. The summer is in the next place. Seasonal analysis of AOD and dust using satellite and reanalysis data, showed that Aralkum, Kyzylkum, Karakum and Kara-Bogaz-Gol are the main dust sources in Central Asia that are active in all seasons. Comparison of dust simulation results for PM2.5 and PM10 variable with observational data of air quality control stations in Mashhad showed that GOCART scheme can well depict dust events and provide a low bias towards station data. Also, the study of correlation coefficient between simulation and observation showed that the GOCART scheme explains nearly 90% of the variance of data. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the GOCART scheme is less than 20 micrograms per cubic meter for PM2.5. Accordingly, the GOCART scheme is a suitable scheme for dust study in Northeast of Iran and the WRF-Chem model can be used to operationally forecast dust storms. The dust detection algorithm (DDA) of the AIRS sensor and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the MODIS sensor confirm the contribution of the mentioned sources of dust in transferring dust to the northeast of Iran. The results showed that three of the case studies occurred as a result of the passage of an extratropical Rossby wave and the deepening of the trough on the territory of Turkmenistan. In contrast, the summer case study is the result of the establishment of a summer circulation pattern that has occurred with the simultaneous establishment of an anticyclonic circulation in the southern part of Turkmenistan and the northeastern parts of Iran and a cyclonic circulation in the Sistan plain and southeastern parts of the country. © 2022 Institute of Geophysics.

TI  - Landscape Structure Of The Territory Of The Peatland Of International Importance "Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya Group Of Mires"
JO  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
PY  - 2023
AB  - The article presents the results of landscape division of the territory of the largest Ramsar wetland of international significance in the Volga River basin "Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires". The researched territory is located in the center of the Russian Plain in the east of the Nizhny Novgorod region in the zone of mixed coniferous-deciduous forests on the above the floodplain terraces of the Volga River valley. The Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires has a high natural conservation value, performing environmental-forming functions, contributing to the preservation of the genofund and the cenofund. The mire massif acts as a regulator of the hydrological regime of the Volga River and a number of its tributaries; like other mires, it is a natural filter, which helps to purify water, and a carbon deposit zone. For effective planning of environmental protection measures and a deep - systemic - understanding of the processes and spatial patterns of the placement of objects of the plant and animal world, a landscape zoning scheme of the territory, made at the landscape level, is necessary. The researched territory is a complex of geotopes from high above-floodplain terraces to the left-bank and island floodplain of the largest river in Europe - the Volga river, which in itself is a factor of landscape diversity. The lithogenic base is mainly represented by fluvio-glacial sands and peat. The aeolian relief forms - dunes, which, entering the mire massifs, form dry manes, are confined to the areas of sands within the high above-floodplain terraces. Local low-lying mires are associated with deflation basins. The hydrographic network is represented by rivers - big (Volga), medium (Kerzhenets) and small rivers and streams. The territory, due to poor drainage, is rich in mires (there are mires of all types) and lakes, including the largest lake in the Nizhny Novgorod region - Bolshoe Plotovo, and the deepest lake of the region-Shumskoye. The lakes are represented by several genetic groups, including paleo-thermokarstic lakes, lakes of maituga origin and oxbow-lakes. Despite the low-lying and relatively calm relief and the high level of bog formation swamping, there is one spring within the researched territory - the Kulteiskiy Source. The soil cover is dominated by sod-podzolic sandy and peat-bog soils. The vegetation is mainly represented by pine forests on the sands and vegetation complexes of mires on a peat substrate. During the research in the period from 2006 to 2021, a map of the landscapes of the Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires was drawn. Making this map, we relied on data from thematic maps, literary sources, data from remote sensing of the Earth and materials of our own field research, during which complex descriptions were done at key points. The obtained results can be used in planning and conducting scientific, environmental, educational and economic activities on the territory of the Kamsko-Bakaldinskaya group of mires.

TI  - Gis Based Land Information System For Mandal Soum, Selenge Aimag Of Mongolia
PY  - 2010
AB  - It is important to learn about and use Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing data and software for our profession nowadays. Modern technologies like geo-data processing and earth observation data processing and analysis are needed for Mongolian young researchers and students. This research work is dedicated to create a land information system over agricultural areas of Selenge Aimag (state), Mandal Soum (province) of Mongolia. One task of the work is to establish a land information database which is based on an Open Source Geographic Information System. Work is starting with acquisition of existing geodata and information, qualification, maintenance, utilization and transferring of data from one soum of Mongolia. Furthermore, the principles used for this soum will serve as a pilot and can be applied to other soums in Selenge Aimag and other agricultural areas of Mongolia. This research work will be helpful to establish a structured cadastral database, multi user access to the database, avoid data redundancy of different organization and follow international standards for geographic information. The "Land Management and Fiscal Cadastre" (LMFC) project's aim is to develop a land valuation methodology based on a land information system for selected project areas. The project established already a cadastral database for Darkhan-Uul Aimag settlement area. Continuing work will be done for agricultural and rural area of Selenge, Mandal area. Promoting education and training at fundamental and professional level for land managers and students are vital for the establishment of land information systems in developing countries. The establishment of a land information system for Selenge Aimag will contribute to the National Land Information System of Mongolia. The project demonstrates that Land Information Systems can be created using Open Source GIS software as e. g. QuantumGIS, gvSIG, uDig and the Open Source database management system PostgreSQL /PostGIS. Systems which are based on Open Source GIS software are new for many professionals in Mongolia and of special importance for developing countries due to their cost efficiency. To connect this work to the practice, students of GIS-RS laboratory at Plant Science Agricultural Training Research Institute (PSARTI), which belongs to the State University of Agriculture of Mongolia, are taught as well as staff from other Government institutions. PSARTI works with several international institutes and projects in different fields. The results of the project activities are shared and advise about the use of Open Source GIS software for different education, research and professional level is given, using the establishment of a land information system with complete land coverage and multi cadastral functions in Mongolia. Promoting the use of Open Source GIS software, enhancing data quality and knowledge exchange are the main aims to be followed further. It is important to experiment and use the project results on a national level and to provide education on Geographic Information Science and Systems to researchers and land managers, students in the land management and administration sector. The results will promote good governance and provide fact based information to decision makers and government.

TI  - Flirras: Fast Learning With Integrated Reward And Reduced Action Space For Online Multitask Offloading
JO  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
PY  - 2023
AB  - With the rapid development of edge data intelligence, task offloading (TO) and resource allocation (RA) optimization in multiaccess edge computing networks can significantly improve the Quality of Service (QoS). However, for the online scenario, traditional methods (e.g., game theory and numerical methods) cannot adapt to dynamic environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to adjust the policy to get long-term rewards. Nevertheless, since the joint problem of TO and RA is nonconvex and NP-hard, existing DRL methods cannot guarantee high efficiency because of the large action space. To solve the above problem, we propose a fast learning with integrated reward and reduced action space-based DRL framework (FLIRRAS), which adopts a low-complexity approach to jointly optimize TO and RA strategies. The FLIRRAS framework combines DRL with numerical methods to iteratively pursues the discrete TO and continuous RA. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to learn environmental information, which can get prior knowledge of the offloading decision. Furthermore, a novel reward integrating the utility of TO and RA is designed to motivate the agent to find the optimal policy. To solve the dilemma that the action space is too large, low-complexity convex optimization methods, i.e., subgradient projection and KKT condition, are used to supplement and adjust the decision, which reduces the network parameters and the decision space. In addition, given the dynamic online environment, we introduce the experience replay mechanism, where policy is updated regularly to reflect the best mapping between states. The experiment results show that the performance of FLIRRAS is better than greedy and other DRL approaches, and it outperforms the latest DRL method by over 18.0\% in terms of execution time.

TI  - Partitioning The Impacts Of Land Use/Land Cover Change And Climate Variability On Water Supply Over The Source Region Of The Blue Nile Basin
JO  - LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water plays a vital role in sustaining the natural functioning of the entire ecosystem that supports life on Earth. It plays key roles in the well-being of society in numerous ways. However, climate variability and land use land cover (LULC) change have caused spatiotemporal water supply variation. Disentangling the effects of climate variability from LULC change on water supply is crucial for sustainable water resource management. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to disentangle the relative contribution of LULC change and climate variability to the overall average annual water supply variation. Residual trends analysis combined with Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) annual water yield model was adopted to perform simulations and disentangle the relative impacts of climate variability and LULC change. Ground and satellite data were used in this study. The study area has experienced a significant increasing wetness trend and significant LULC dynamics between 2003 and 2017. As a result, an increasing water supply was observed due to the joint effects of climate variability and LULC change in the watershed (203 mm). The contribution of climate variability was 94\%, whereas LULC contributes only 6\% from 2003 to 2017. Climate variability negatively led to water supply variation while LULC change contributed positively from 2010 to 2017. Although the ongoing soil and water conservation (SWC) practices improved vegetation cover and water retention of the watershed, climate variability is the main driver of water supply variation. Therefore, SWC practices should incorporate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation strategies and scale up to community-based integrated watershed management to sustain water supply.

TI  - Telemedicine On The Move: Health Care Heads Down The Information Superhighway
JO  - Hospital technology series
PY  - 1994
AB  - Telemedicine has drawn increasing attention as one of the emerging new service delivery vehicles that will run on the information superhighway. In reality, remote diagnosis and consultation through the application of telecommunications technology have been practiced for many years. But advances in technology and reform imperatives to extend access beyond traditional boundaries are pushing telemedicine into new applications. This is evidenced by the explosion in the number of pilot projects begun within the last 12 months. While demonstrating telemedicine's growing capabilities--for education and administration, as well as medical practice--these projects also raise a number of legal, clinical, and technical questions that must be answered before government and other payers will routinely reimburse for remote services. Academic and industry consortia are springing up to deal with the most compelling issues, including documenting telemedicine's safety and efficacy, developing uniform data and transmission standards, and determining the minimum resolution needed to maintain the integrity of clinical transmissions. Almost every type of medical specialty has proved amenable to performing evaluations via telemedicine links; however, specialties with less direct patient contact, like radiology and pathology, are generally identified as better candidates for telemedicine interactions. The telemedicine equipment required for these consults ranges from the simple to the ultra-sophisticated, depending on the type of system used and its clinical application. The most common system configuration involves a base station in the main facility where specialists and other consultants are housed and a number of remote referral sites. Consults are performed by interactively sharing voice, video, or image data. Increasingly, systems are being introduced that use easy-to-learn, intuitive displays and controls. Systems also require the use of any number of different communication media including land-based wire networks, high-speed fiberoptics, microwave links, or satellite transponders. Quantum leaps in telemedicine performance are being made constantly, many being swept along as a result of intensified interest in developing similar consumer and business services that are destined for the new information highway. In addition to information infrastructure projects, telemedicine has also recently benefitted from the effects of defense reinvestment, political interest in cost-reducing technologies, increased availability of funding for pilot projects, and the emergence of multifacility, multitiered, integrated delivery systems. Technical, financial, and logistical factors, which had once worked against telemedicine feasibility, are suddenly shifting to rapidly propel telemedicine technologies out of investigational settings and into mainstream clinical practice.

TI  - Mending Man's Ways: Wickedness, Complexity And Off-Road Travel
JO  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
PY  - 2016
AB  - While the concept of wickedness has been applied frequently in planning and design environments, its application to complex regulatory problems is less well-developed. Off-road and social travel has become a significant source of environmental degradation across many regions worldwide, and the widespread failures of travel regulation suggest that it has characteristics of a wicked problem as described by Rittel and Webber. This paper presents a simulation of a complex regulatory system - the interaction of cumulative travel decisions, alternative regulatory regimes, and landscape values - using a case study of a landscape adjoining Las Cruces, New Mexico. This research is built on a morphological analysis of change in travel patterns derived from historical remote sensing imagery. The findings of this paper suggest that the cumulative nature of travel demand among off-road users has important implications for the resilience of natural systems particularly in places of high demand such as metropolitan edges. Regulatory choices can create both virtuous and vicious cycles in travel behavior,which suggests opportunities for constructing adaptive strategy in off-road travel management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dacma: Designing Space Ordering Optimizations To Scalably Manage Aerial Images
JO  - Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aerial images are a special class of remote sensing images, as they are intentionally collected with a high degree of overlap. This high degree of overlap complicates existing index strategies such as R-tree and Space Filling Curve (SFC) based index techniques due to complications in space splitting, granularity of the grid cells and excessive duplication of image object identifiers (IOIs). However, SFC based space ordering can be modified to provide scalable management of overlapping aerial images. This involves overcoming similar IOIs in adjacent grid cells, which would naturally occur in SFC based grids with such data. IOI duplication can be minimized by merging adjacent grid cells through the proposed 'Designing Adjacent Cell Merge Algorithm' (DACMA). This work focuses on establishing a proper adjacent cell merge metric and merge percentage value. Using a highly scalable, distributed HBase cluster for both a single aerial mapping project, and multiple aerial mapping projects, experiments evaluated Jaccard Similarity (JS) and Percentage of Overlap (PO) merge metrics. JS had significant advantages: (i) generating smaller merged regions and (ii) obtaining over 21% and 36% improvement in reducing query response times compared to PO. As a result, JS is proposed for the merge metric for DACMA. For the merge percentage two considerations were dominant: (i) substantial storage reductions with respect to both straight forward SFC-based cell space indexing and 4SA based indexing, and (ii) minimal impact on the query response time. The proposed merge percentage value was selected to optimize the storage (i.e. space) needs and response time (i.e. time) herein named the "Space-Time Trade-off Optimization Percentage"value (or STOP value) is presented. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - What Health Policy Should Be Adopted For Child Psychiatry In 2020? Reflection And Analysis With A View To Earlier Interventions
JO  - Information Psychiatrique
PY  - 2020
AB  - Health policy in child psychiatry must meet the care needs of the whole population. It also needs to avoid creating strands of care that function at varying speeds and rely on different forms of funding, as this would be a biased and inadequate use of the diagnostic classifications of mental disorders, thus producing new exclusions. Thanks to a partially renewed interest in child and adolescent psychiatry, new measures have now been put in place. Coordination with existing measures and interconnection on the ground are essential if these measures are to benefit children and adolescents. No single measure can meet all demands and all needs. The public health service has long considered itself to be the only one responsible for this task. Today, it finds itself in a context where society is demanding to be able to make informed and feasible choices. In order to guarantee the best care for each child, we must give the necessary resources to the universal missions that the public health service continues to take on. Copyright © 2020 John Libbey Eurotext.; La politique de santé de la pédopsychiatrie demande de répondre à tous les besoins de soins, de l'ensemble de la population. Elle doit éviter de créer des filières à plusieurs vitesses et financements, sous prétexte d'un usage biaisé et incomplet des classifications diagnostiques des troubles mentaux. Faute de quoi, les effets en seront la production de nouvelles exclusions. Des nouvelles mesures se déclinent aujourd'hui, grâce à un intérêt partiellement retrouvé pour la psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent. Une coordination avec ce qui existe déjà et un maillage sur le terrain sont indispensables pour qu'elles constituent un élément de plus en faveur des populations. Aucun dispositif unique ne peut répondre à toutes les demandes et à tous les besoins. Le service public a longtemps pensé qu'à lui seul incombait cette mission. Il s'inscrit aujourd'hui dans un paysage où la société exige de pouvoir faire des choix, éclairés et faisables. Afin de garantir le meilleur soin pour chaque enfant, encore faut-il donner les moyens nécessaires aux missions universelles que le service public continue d'assumer.

TI  - Land Use Ecological Risk Evaluation In Three Gorges Reservoir Area Based On Normal Cloud Model
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2014
AB  - Some basic data couldn't be accurately acquired or quantitative evaluated in evaluation of land use ecological risk, so there are the fuzziness and uncertainty problems in the evaluation index and results. In order to solve this problem effectively, normal cloud model comprehensive evaluation model was introduced. In Normal cloud evaluation model, the status of each evaluation index can be intuitive found out and the influences of each evaluation index on land use ecological risk in Three Gorges Reservoir area can be objective reflect. With the LandSAT TM remote sensing data, social and economic data, environmental monitoring data of Three Gorges Reservoir area in the year of 2000 and 2012, the evaluating indexes system was built to evaluate the land use ecological risk in Three Gorges Reservoir area based on the PSR (pressure-state-response, PSR) model. In model, the ecological risk pressure indexes included the proportion of agricultural land, construction land scale, the industrial pollutants emission intensity, the strength of farmland non-point source pollution, road network density and population density; the state of ecological indexes included patch density, shape index, circumference surface integral dimension, concentration, average nearest neighbor distance; the risk response indexes included composite structure index, vegetation coverage, diversity index, the coordination degree of water and soil, land degradation rate. The evaluation standards were set up by referring to a large number of data and consulting relevant experts. Study results indicated that: 1) The level of average land use ecological risk belonged to the lower risk totally in Three Gorges Reservoir area. At the same time, the level of land use ecological risk had an increasing trend. The average normal cloud membership degrees of lower risk were the max in all risk levels both in 2000 and 2012. But the value decreased from 0.4233 to 0.4013 from 2000 to 2012 in Three Gorges Reservoir area. And the second risk level was medium risk. The value was 0.3955, near the value of lower risk tightly in 2012 year. 2) The land use ecological risk level had an increasing trend from northeast to southwest in Three Gorges Reservoir area. There were one county in low risk level, ten in lower risk level, six in medium risk level, and one in highest risk level in 2000. The number of counties in higher risk level and highest risk level increased obviously from 2000 to 2012. Three counties were added into higher risk level, and one added into highest risk level. Those counties distribute in southwest of Three Gorges Reservoir area. Changshou district, which land use ecological risk level increasing from lowest to highest rapidly, needed to be paid most attention especially. 3) The distribution and change of land use ecological risk level were different obviously in each part of Three Gorges Reservoir area. The head area of Three Gorges Reservoir area, including four counties in the Hubei province, belong lowest risk or lower risk area. And the change of risk level was weak. In the hinterland area of Three Gorges Reservoir area, the levels of land use ecological risk were not highest. But the change of risk level was obvious. In four counties, including Puling, Fengdu, Shizhu and Wanzhou, the risk levels increased. Only in Yunyang, the risk level of decreased. In the end area of Three Gorges Reservoir area, the level of use ecological risk was highest for most pollution. Appling normal cloud model, the uncertainty mapping of each evaluation index was realized, and the results had more objectivity through considering to randomness and fuzziness in the processes of evaluation index quantization and level division. The results offer references for land reasonable using and ecological protection policy making in Three Gorges Reservoir Area. ©, 2014, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Estimating The Value Of An Early-Warning System
JO  - REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
PY  - 2009
AB  - An early-warning system generates economic value to the extent that it improves decision making. The value of the information hinges on the degree to which a timely response, aided by warnings, facilitates successful damage mitigation. USDA's Coordinated Framework for Soybean Rust includes a network of sentinel soybean plots and wild kudzu stands monitored by extension agents for the presence of soybean rust, a potentially recurring threat to the U.S. soybean crop since 2005. The linchpin in this early-warning system is a website that provides near real-time, county-level information on the location of the disease. We consider factors that may influence information value.

TI  - Optimal Space Effects: Driving Future Military Gn\&C Technology Needs
PY  - 2012
AB  - This work builds on current exquisite performance in a variety of spacecraft components, subsystems, and algorithms in very demanding guidance, navigation, and control applications through flowing future national interest goals into satellite platform technology requirements within plausible constellation constructs identified along the way. Rather than hypothesizing new developments at the component and algorithm level, the paper focuses on the underlying rationale and methods for pushing the state-of-the-art GNC subsystems for space, from identifying future military challenges, to meeting planned threats with robust space effects (i.e. precise navigation and timing; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance collection), the carefully designed, analyzed, integrated, and tested satellite systems usually work as well as expected on orbit and generally demonstrate robust performance in the presence of space environmental uncertainties. However, the latest complication is that each satellite must continually calculate power, energy, bandwidth, memory storage and thermal constraints and then "play forward" in, for example, a receding horizon optimal control construct that calculates the next move in an infinite game of space chess. The remainder of this work, then, initiates this investigation through identifying constellation constructs, addressing the utility optimal algorithms have on advancing the state-of the-art while still leveraging today's hardware with minimal changes, demonstrates how this all works with a single ISR small satellite slewing maneuver, and presents future tasks needed to adequately evolve these steps from concept to reality, noting that each optimization step, however simplified, places new GNC requirements upon space mission designers and developers.

TI  - Accuracy Evaluation Of Et And Its Components From Three Remote Sensing Et Models And One Process Based Hydrological Model Using Ground Measured Eddy Covariance And Sap Flow
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) and its components, transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (Es) are crucial to understand hydrological cycle and effective water loss in water resource management. Remote sensing models and process based hydrological models are two kinds of effective methods for evaluating ET and its partitions. Although the ability of remote sensing models to simulate ET has been widely verified, there is limited verification of ET components, especially T, which is the major component of ET. This research used ET obtained from eddy covariance system and T obtained from sap flow observation in an apricot orchard of north China to evaluate the accuracy of ET and its components from three remote sensing models (PT-JPL, PML, and SWH) and a processbased hydrological model (SHAW). The results showed that after calibrations, all the four models satisfactorily simulated total ET particularly at annual level. Among them, the PML model had the best fit efficiency, with the most satisfied R2 and NSE values. The PT-JPL estimated average ET was the most accurate, with the slope nearest to 1.0. While for the simulation of T, SHAW model had a better performance owing to the fact that SHAW model simulate plant transpiration using changes in soil water content. The average T/ET of the models for the growing season was close to the observed value of 0.70, except that the T/ET of SWH is high due to the lack of Ei calculation. Furthermore, nearly all the three remote sensing models underestimated ET in the dry spring and overestimated ET in the rainy summer. In comparison with the process-based SHAW model, it is suggested that remote sensing ET relies more heavily on the seasonal change of meteorological factors such as precipitation but less capable in reflecting the gradually delaying process of soil moisture in the dry season. Therefore, it is indicated that for future improvement of remote sensing ET models, adjustment of soil water availability in a much longer term is suggested at least for semi-humid and semi-arid ecosystems.

TI  - The Conservation Of Biodiverse Continuous Forests And Patches May Provide Services That Support Oil Palm Yield: Evidence From Satellite Crop Monitoring
JO  - Cleaner Production Letters
PY  - 2023
AB  - Protecting natural forests such as those identified as high conservation value (HCV) areas may facilitate crop production due to the benefit from ecosystem services provided by biodiversity spill-over from adjacent forests. To investigate the effect of protecting contiguous and isolated forests adjacent to oil palm plantations on crop health, we measured the distance between oil palm plots and the continuous forest and forest patch boundaries. We surveyed 715 oil palm sample plots comprising 613 plots in large-scale oil palm plantation and 102 plots in smallholdings that were at least 300 m apart and had a radius of 100 m. Satellite imagery and ancillary spatial data from 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia were used to determine elevation and vegetation indices (VIs). The VIs derived were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Both NDVI and EVI are used to measure the vegetation greenness. The NDMI is used to determine the water content of plants. The VIs are crucial for a variety of applications, including vegetation monitoring, drought research, and agricultural operations. We then used generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine the relationship between VIs and stand-and landscape-level variables. Each VI was used as a response variable, with elevation, distance from continuous forest or forest patches, and oil palm management system (i.e., smallholding and industrial plantation) as explanatory variables. Our results revealed that the chlorophyll sensitive NDVI decreased with increasing distance from continuous forest, but increased away from the forest patches. In contrast, the dense vegetation sensitive EVI increased away from continuous forest, but decreased when distance from forest patches increased. Proximity to continuous forests or forest patches had no effect on the NDMI. All the vegetation indices were lower in smallholdings than industrial plantations. None of the vegetation indices were significantly influenced by elevation. Given that these indices predict palm health and yield, this pattern could result in greater ecosystem services that benefit oil palm growers in oil palm closer to some forest types through the spillover effects of forest biodiversity from continuous forests and forest patches. This study suggests that conservation and industry stakeholders should work together to strengthen the conservation of biodiverse continuous forests and forest patches in HCV standard to develop more-sustainable oil palm agriculture, because of their potential role in supporting ecosystem services. © 2023

TI  - A Novel Remote Sensing Index For Brine Shrimp (Artemia) Slick Detection In Salt Lakes
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Artemia (brine shrimp) are a widely distributed zooplankton in inland salt lakes and artificial ponds throughout the tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones. Notably, they are of great importance to fishery production and salt lake ecosystem health. Recently, Artemia resources have been threatened by habitat deterioration and overfishing, which mandate adequate monitoring; however, advanced methods for detecting Artemia from remote sensing images have rarely been discussed. Accordingly, this study explored the possibility of detecting the adult Artemia (Artemia) slicks using multispectral optical sensors by analyzing their unique aggregation patterns and consistent optical properties. After measuring Artemia spectra in the field, reflectance troughs were observed at-431 nm and -560 nm, which were deemed likely related to the absorption of beta-carotene and heme, respectively, resulting in their reddish color. These characteristics could also be used to differentiate Artemia from other confounding features, including clean water and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)-or suspended par-ticulate matter (SPM)-dominated water. Based on these spectral signatures, a brine shrimp index (BSI) was developed using the difference between the reflectance at NIR band and a linear baseline between green and SWIR1 bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Further, a BSI-based Artemia slick pixel extraction method was proposed. Using observation geometry information in conjunction with the BSI value of entire lakes, the BSI thresholds for the Artemia-containing pixels were automatically determined, and > 80\% overall accuracy was achieved. The index performance was affected by the presence of residual cloud shadows, high water turbidity, and mixed pixels with low Artemia density. Moreover, BSI values were found to be rela-tively insensitive to atmospheric signals. It was shown here that the BSI detection limit was >0.53\% Artemia subpixel coverage under clean water conditions; whereas a higher coverage was required to separate Artemia from Chl-a-or SPM-dominated water. The mean absolute percentage difference of BSI values calculated from Rayleigh-corrected and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance was <4\% compared with surface reflectance derived BSI, and the relative difference in coverage area was < +/- 10\%. Lastly, time series analyses of Lake Aibi in northwest China and the Great Salt Lake in North America revealed that the annual areal coverage estimation of Artemia slicks based on BSI was a positive indicator of Artemia harvesting, which can facilitate the Artemia resource management.

TI  - Estimating Impervious Surface Percent In Plain River Network Regions Using A Refinement Cart Analysis
PY  - 2013
AB  - The rapid expansion of impervious surface has become a major factor affecting ecosystem health of the high density river network. In this paper, the ensemble learning of CART analysis was used to estimate impervious surface percent(ISP) through Variable Precision Rough Sets (VPRS). First, Landsat TM and ALOS imagery were utilized to construct the ISP predictive model; then, in order to get the best attribute variables of CART decision tree, VPRS was adopted to extract optimum feature subset from multi-source feature sets. Results illustrate the validity of this ensemble learning, and prove that this method can obtain higher accuracy than the traditional single CART method. However, in the initial estimation results, ISP's high value area was underestimated relatively seriously. It was found that there is an intensive relationship between the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and ISP. The increase of ISP will cause significant increase of local TVDI. Then post-processing rules extracted from the relationship was used to improve results. According to the verified results, the combination of VPRS reduction and post-processing rule in CART algorithm has higher analysis precision than the traditional single CART learning algorithm. The root mean square error between estimated ISP value and reference ISP is 10.0\% and the correlation coefficient is 0.89. The method is viable for the estimation of the ISP in plain river network regions.

TI  - Integrating Sensor Technology In Disposable Body-Worn Absorbent Products A Qualitative Study To Define User Profile, (Technical) Criteria, Conditions, And Potential Benefits
JO  - JOURNAL OF WOUND OSTOMY AND CONTINENCE NURSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to define the user profile, (technical) criteria, conditions, and potential benefits of the integration of sensor technology in disposable body-worn incontinence materials. DESIGN: Qualitative study using a framework method. SUBJECT AND SETTING: The sample included residents with incontinence, nurses, and decision-makers in a selection of Flemish nursing homes (Belgium). METHODS: Semistructured interviews were performed between June and August 2020. The interviews with nurses included open-ended questions focusing on the user profile, (technical) criteria, conditions, and potential benefits of the integration of sensor technology in disposable body-worn incontinence materials. The interviews with decision-makers were supplemented with questions about purchase cost and other economic criteria (such as reimbursement). Interviews with residents included questions about wearing comfort. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using a framework method. RESULTS: The user profile was defined as (1) residents with cognitive impairment and (2) residents who are bedridden or are severely limited in mobility. The following (technical) criteria emerged from the analyses: a small, thin, and oval/circular sensor, an adaptable or in front attachment of the sensor on the absorbent product, a real-time indication of the absorbent product's saturation, leakage detection, liquid stool detection, the automatic recording of incontinence-related data, a durable sensor easy to disinfect, and receiving notifications on a wearable device. Conditions included a stable connection between the wearable device and the sensor, accurate measurements, user-friendly system, comprehensible training, affordability, and data protection. Potential benefits included workload reduction, increased comfort for residents and staff, more person-centered care, increased quality of care, less skin damage and economic (eg, less costs due to less excessive absorbent product changes), and/or environmental (e.g. less waste) gains. CONCLUSION: Study findings identified the user profile, (technical) criteria, conditions, and potential benefits of the integration of sensor technology in disposable body-worn incontinence materials. Respondents reported problems with changing routines and skepticism about the sensor's accuracy. Based on findings from this study, we recommend involving representatives of all relevant stakeholders in the design of sensor technology to ensure users' needs and increase the use of sensor technology. Comprehensive education is recommended to inform nurses, residents, and their family members on the importance and benefits of the technology and to aid overcoming barriers to use (skepticism, resistance to new technologies, and changing care routines). Study findings also indicate that the sensor technology cannot replace the existing voiding programs; rather it should be an addition to routine continence care.

TI  - Assessing Debris Flow Susceptibility In Heshigten Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, Using Principal Component Analysis And An Improved Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm
JO  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2016
AB  - Susceptibility analysis is important in any study of debris flows. Unlike debris flows in Southwest China, debris flows in Northern China occur with different characteristics and much lower frequency. However, neglecting the danger of possible debris flows in this northern area may result in a devastating disaster. In this paper, 12 debris flow catchments located near Zhirui town, in Heshigten Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, were investigated. A geographic information system, a global positioning system, and remote sensing were used to determine geological, topographical, morphological, and vegetation factors of influence. Principal component analysis was carried out to convert this set of possibly correlated factors into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated principal components. The accumulative contribution rate of the first five principal components retained most of the information on these factors, accounting for 90.9 \%. An improved fuzzy C-means clustering analysis was applied to determine the susceptibility of debris flows in this area. This method is based on a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is an evolutionary algorithm that can achieve global optimization, and is not sensitive to the initial cluster centers. Results showed that the susceptibility levels for four of the debris flow catchments were high, six were moderate, and two were low. Our quantitative assessments based on these nonlinear methods were consistent with field investigations.

TI  - Remote Sensing Decision Making System For Oil Exploration
JO  - World Petroleum Congress Proceedings
PY  - 1987
AB  - Remote sensing is an essential part of the Oil Exploration Decision Making System. The system is divided into two principal sections: the geological section and the business section. The connection between the two is provided by the geological risk expressed as probabilities associated with individual oil exploration prospects. The oil discovery probabilities are calculated using remote sensing, geological and geophysical data. Next they are utilized in formalized methods of economic analysis. In the first phase of the integrated exploration system, remote sensing can assist geologists in the selection of exploration regions by defining the existence of sedimentary basins. Remote sensing methods can generate a wealth of information useful in determining the value of exploratory prospecting. In the second phase of appraisal, remote sensing data are merged with other available information such as aeromagnetics, gravity, geochemical surveys and seismic surveys. The result of this phase is to estimate the outcome of oil discovery probabilities for locating oil prospects. The probabilities are then used for the financial analysis, often in the form of cash-flow forecasts. The final phase of the integrated exploration system is the drilling of wildcat wells. A post-drilling estimate of petroleum potential involves further analysis of remote sensing data, and further geological and geophysical work. The oil discovery probabilities are recalculated once again with the updated information to create a more accurate assessment of oil potential. © 1987 World Petroleum Congress Proceedings.

TI  - A Qualitative Study Of Nimbyism For Waste In Smaller Urban Areas Of A Low-Income Country, Mzuzu, Malawi
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS
PY  - 2021
AB  - When waste management infrastructure is built, there can be resistance from the local affected populations, often termed the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) phenomenon. This study aims to understand the forms of resistance that may develop in such contexts, focusing on 2 solid waste and 1 liquid waste management site within Mzuzu City, Malawi. At the newest solid waste site, community resistance had grown to the extent that the site was reportedly destroyed by the local community. Interviews and observations of the sites are complemented by examining historic and recent satellite images. It was found that, at the new solid waste site, community engagement had not been conducted effectively prior to construction and as part of ongoing site operations. This was compounded by poor site management and the non-delivery of the promised benefits to the community. In contrast, at the liquid waste site, the community could access untreated sludge for use as fertilizer and were happier to live within its vicinity. While NIMBYism is a frustrating phenomenon for city planners, it is understandable that communities want to protect their health and well-being when there is a history of mismanagement of waste sites which is sadly common in low-income settings. It is difficult for government agencies to deliver these services and broader waste management. In this study, an unsuccessful attempt to do something better with a legitimate goal is not necessarily a failure, but part of a natural learning process for getting things right.

TI  - Landscape And Cultural Aspects Of The Coastal Area Of Western Pomerania As Factors Of Development Of Maritime And Nautical Tourism. Identification And Definition Of Conditions
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering
PY  - 2019
AB  - Maritime tourism in its numerous forms (rapidly developing in the world) has direct impacts on coastal formation and development. As such it has become one of the most important areas of investigation. Among the many varieties of maritime tourism, due to its increasing availability and popularity, nautical tourism, which has recently had a strong influence on the multifaceted Polish coast, deserves special attention. However, due to the natural formation of coasts they are not adapted for most forms of marine tourism. Western Pomerania is a region considered suitable for nautical tourism which is characterized by its unique nature. In addition to its peripheral location, the area is protected from intense urbanization, and at the same time has managed to avoid engaging into investments that could have radically caused the deterioration of the landscape and cultural values of the region. Properly planned activities for the development of maritime tourism can adequately stimulate the spatial expansion of individual municipalities, often changing their existing character and a leading function. The aim of the article is to illustrate the determinants of the proper (past and future) development of coastal towns in the context of the expansion of maritime tourism (especially nautical), with particular emphasis on landscape and cultural aspects, on the example of a selected locality in the Western Pomerania region. As part of the research, the marine tourism potential in the Western Pomerania region, its landscape and cultural aspects concerning maritime tourism development, as well as the analysis of historical and spatial conditions for the location and concentration of nautical tourism activity in the Dziwnów area were identified. This seaside resort, which was selected as part of the research, is characterized by above-average potential of aquatic development and its local, maritime tradition. On the basis of the analyses carried out on the spatial structure of Dziwnów it was found that the village is a model example of tourism synergy of inland and in marine water area. The research included interpretative and historical studies, and the inventory of urban, architectural and landscape elements - essential for the development of nautical tourism, as well as the municipal strategy and field observations. Apart from the aspects related to the nature for the development of nautical tourism, the cultural values of the village, its local traditions and continuity of development of the tourist-oriented function also play a crucial role. The origins of the village date back to the transformation of the original fishing village into a summer resort, then a seaside resort, a post-war spa town - the Kamień Pomorski satellite, into a modern base of organized tourism. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Application Of Water Extraction Methods From Landsat Imagery For Different Environmental Background
JO  - Journal of Geo-Information Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rapid and accurate extraction of water information from satellite images has been a hot issue in remote sensing applications and has important application value in water resources management, water environment monitoring, and disaster emergency management. Although there are a variety of water extraction methods for Landsat series images, the same method can generate different extraction results in different environmental backgrounds due to the influence of environmental background factors such as geographic location, topography, and water body shape. In order to study the applicability of water extraction methods under different environmental conditions, this article focuses on two typical environments: urban areas around Huairou County, Beijing with severe human influence and strong contrast between light and dark images, and non-urban areas around Beijing Miyun Reservoir with obvious topography and small water bodies. Water index method and classification method are tested based on water extraction and accuracy verification using Landsat 5 (2009) and Landsat 8 (2019) satellite images which have slightly different band settings. The water index method includes Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), while the classification method includes Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML). Our results show that SVM has the highest accuracy with overall accuracy > 97% in the urban areas. By selecting training samples reasonably and delicately, the extracted spatial pattern of water results is close to the real water distribution. It applies well to multiple-scale and complex water bodies. In the non-urban areas, SVM can completely identify the fine rivers which are usually difficult to be identified by other methods. It is also suitable for judging the shape and flow direction of small rivers between mountains, though the shadow of the mountain could be easily mixed together by mistake. Due to the difference in sensor band settings, SVM has a better performance in Landsat 8 data. MNDWI can effectively reduce the error extraction rate, resulting in an overall accuracy > 95%. It is convenient to determine the threshold value of MNDWI through visual interpretation, which is more suitable for the rapid extraction of water in the non-urban areas. The environmental background may show different effects on water body extraction. The water index method and classification method have different advantages in different environmental backgrounds. The most suitable method should vary according to the actual situation. In scenarios with higher requirements for efficiency, we should focus on the use of index method, and design a new index which can make full use of the band information. In application scenarios where higher extraction accuracy is required, classification methods can improve the accuracy of water extraction. Moreover, we cannot ignore the differences between interpretation methods in data sources from different sensors. This study provides a reference for the selection of water extraction methods under different environmental backgrounds. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.

JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2021
AB  - This study takes place in Erzurum city of Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey Erzurum Plain Wetland, one of the wetlands of international importance that has biodiversity and countless benefits to its environment. Studies to offer opportunities to monitor long-term changes in the area by using advanced technology economically and effectively are expected to guide decision makers. In the present study, the changes in surface area of Erzurum Plain Wetland were investigated between 1998 and 2017 by using remote sensing techniques. As a result of the change analysis conducted using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, it has been determined there is an expansion in deep and shallow water areas of the wetland. According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989–2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Use Of Avhrr Imagery In Arctic Marine Mammal Research
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 1992
AB  - Remote sensing has traditionally been afforded only limited use in Arctic marine mammal research.  This is primarily because the summers are short and often cloud covered; winters are long and solar illumination is limited to a few hours of twilight.  Orbital sensors operating on a repeat cycle of 16 days simply do not offer the biologist a sufficiently reliable tool for habitat assessment studies.  Compounding the data availability problem was the substantial entry cost to acquire and interpret digital remote sensing imagery.  With the increase in computational power of microcomputers and the increasing availability of orbital remote sensing imagery (both the decreasing costs and increase in the number of available sensors) the utility of orbital platforms for Arctic marine mammal research should be re-examined. This review describes the activities of the Marine Mammal Management section of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Central and Arctic Region, specifically relating to the use of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery in support of marine mammal aerial survey programs.  NOAA offers inexpensive timely imagery which can be interpreted on a variety of microcomputer platforms, which are well within the financial means of the marine mammal biologist's budget.

TI  - The Impact Of Soil Erosion On Soil Fertility And Vine Vigor. A Multidisciplinary Approach Based On Field, Laboratory And Remote Sensing Approaches
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Soil erosion processes in vineyards, beyond surface runoff and sediment transport, have a strong effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and redistribution along the slope. Variation in SOC across the landscape can determine differences in soil fertility and vine vigor. The goal of this research was to analyze the interactions among vines vigor, sediment delivery and SOC in a sloping vineyard located in Sicily. Six pedons were studied along the slope by digging 6 pits up to 60 cm depth. Soil was sampled every 10 cm and SOC, water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were analyzed. Erosion rates, detachment and deposition areas were measured by the pole height method which allowed mapping of the soil redistribution. The vigor of vegetation, expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from high-resolution satellite multispectral data, was compared with measured pruning weight. Results confirmed that soil erosion, sediment redistribution and SOC across the slope was strongly affected by topographic features, slope and curvature. The erosion rate was 16Mg ha(-1) y(-1) since the time of planting (6 years). SOC redistribution was strongly correlated with the detachment or deposition areas as highlighted by pole height measurements. The off-farm SOC loss over six years amounted to 1.2 Mg C ha(-1). SUVA(254) values, which indicate hydrophobic material rich in aromatic constituents of WEOC, decreased significantly along the slope, demonstrating that WEOC in the detachment site is more stable in comparison to deposition sites. The plant vigor was strongly correlated with WEOC constituents. Results demonstrated that high resolution passive remote sensing data combined with soil and plant analyses can survey areas with contrasting SOC, soil fertility, soil erosion and plant vigor. This will allow monitoring of soil erosion and degradation risk areas and support decision-makers in developing measures for friendly environmental management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Learning By Giving In An Introductory Economics Of Altruism Course
JO  - Journal of Economic Education
PY  - 2021
AB  - Supported by the Learning by Giving Foundation or other philanthropic sources, many college courses are allowing students to give away charitable grants to nonprofit organizations. In this article, the author shares the experience of a Learning by Giving Economics of Altruism class taught at an introductory level. The class is taught using best practices from service-learning, and its course design, curricular content, challenges, and outcomes are discussed. The class provides the unique opportunity to teach microeconomic principles to a diverse population of students while making a positive impact on the community. Data show that student learning and overall experience with the service-learning exceed their initial expectations. Increasingly, universities are offering classes that allow students to give away real philanthropic dollars. Classes incorporating philanthropic grant-giving are found in a number of disciplines ranging from public policy and business to social work and philosophy. Just like their counterpart courses in economics and finance that enable students to invest real money to maximize profit, these classes focus on effective investments that maximize social impact. An introductory course on the Economics of Altruism lends itself to this approach because the process of giving away money brings up many economic concepts, including utility maximization, allocation of resources, behavioral economics, social welfare, game theory, and measures of effective philanthropy. These topics appeal to today’s Generation Z (post-Millennial) college students who are characterized by a community-centered, social-change mindset (Grace and Seemiller 2016; Uche 2018). In the course, students actively engage with community organizations as they consider how to allocate a $10,000 grant from the Learning by Giving Foundation. While such a course can easily be targeted to higher-level students, the following details how the Learning by Giving model has been incorporated into an introductory course on the Economics of Altruism. I offer a practical discussion of the course design, challenges, and outcomes of the course based on five years of experience. The class relies heavily on best practices in service-learning in order to impact learning outcomes. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Vulnerability Assessment And Adaptation To Sea Level Rise In High-Wave Environments: A Case Study On O'ahu, Hawai'i
JO  - Ocean and Coastal Management
PY  - 2018
AB  - High energy waves intensify the impacts of sea level rise and threaten coastal communities, requiring measures to prevent harmful consequences. Vulnerability assessments using NOAA's assessment guide were performed in a high wave environment, accounting for the impacts of sea level rise on coastal inundation, longshore transport, benthic habitat as well as on beach users and homeowners. This case study of the North Shore region of Oahu, Hawai'i’ uses multi-criteria evaluation and cost-benefit analysis based on vulnerabilities, impacts, and protective actions such as shoreline hardening, beach nourishment and dunes, vegetative cover, and elevation or relocation of structures. Geomorphology and natural habitats dramatically affect coastal exposure in high energy wave environments. The most viable adaptation strategies include expansion of artificial reefs in benthic habitat dominated areas while the vegetative cover and beach nourishment are most appropriate in developed locations and surf tourism areas. Suitable adaptation strategies were determined based on differences in the biophysical environment and community perceptions. The value of this approach lies in both a generalized method for compiling and analyzing large amounts of data as well as customizing the proposed framework to identify crucial elements necessary for effective adaptation to sea level rise in high-energy wave environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Developing Priority Observational Requirements From Space Using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory
JO  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Over a two-year period beginning in 2015, a panel of subject matter experts, the Space Platform Requirements Working Group (SPRWG), carried out an analysis and prioritization of different space-based observations supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s operational services in the areas of weather, oceans, and space weather. NOAA leadership used the SPRWG analysis of space-based observational priorities in different mission areas, among other inputs, to inform the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT)-based value model and the NOAA Satellite Observing Systems Architecture (NSOSA) study. The goal of the NSOSA study is to develop candidate satellite architectures for the era beginning in approximately 2030. The SPRWG analysis included a prioritized list of observational objectives together with the quantitative attributes of each objective at three levels of performance: a threshold level of minimal utility, an intermediate level that the community expects by 2030, and a maximum effective level, a level for which further improvements would not be cost effective. This process is believed to be unprecedented in the analysis of long-range plans for providing observations from space. This paper describes the process for developing the prioritized objectives and their attributes and how they were combined in the Environmental Data Record (EDR) Value Model (EVM). The EVM helped inform NOAA's assessment of many potential architectures for its future observing system within the NSOSA study. However, neither the SPRWG nor its report represents official NOAA policy positions or decisions, and the responsibility for selecting and implementing the final architecture rests solely with NOAA senior leadership.

TI  - Mountain Landscape Health Diagnosis And Pattern Evolution Based On Remote Sensing: Case Study In Xinjiang Tianshan Karajun-Kurdening
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2021
AB  - At the 37th World Heritage conference in 2013, Xinjiang Tianshan successfully applied for World Natural Heritage. Xinjiang Tianshan has world-class aesthetic value and ecological value. However, with the continuous development and utilization of tourism resources, the ecological environment here is inevitably disturbed by human activities. It is a key problem how to accurately diagnose where the ecological environment has been damaged when we planning and managing natural heritage sites. To solve this problem, we need to build a landscape health diagnosis system based on RS and CIS technology and landscape ecology theory. This paper selects the Xinjiang Tianshan Natural Heritage Site Karajun-Kurdening region as the research area. Based on Landsat and sentinel-2 remote sensing images of 1977, 1990, 1997, 2013 and 2017, the ecological landscape of the study area was classified and interpreted by using the method of supervised classification. The landscape pattern index was calculated by fragstast software, combining landscape ecology theory and Chinese scholars' research results from the landscape stress degree, landscape vitality, natural heritage sites outstanding universal value, and landscape resilience 4 aspects. We constructed a landscape health diagnosis system suitable for mountainous natural heritage sites in arid regions using regional grid analysis and spatial interpolation method. The landscape health in Xinjiang Tianshan Natural Heritage Site Karajun-Kurdening region was diagnosed. In July, 2018, we carried out 17 aerial photogrammetry in the research area using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to verify the accuracy of landscape health diagnosis system. Then, we used the Smart3D software to get 17 high-resolution orthophoto images, through comparing the orthophoto image with diagnostic image. The research results can be obtained. 1) In the past 40 years, the landscape of ice, water and theropencedrymion decreased seriously. The annual change rate of bare land obvious expansion was as high as 62.54%. 2) The landscape health status of the study area was average except in 1997. Since 1997, the landscape health value in the study area has been continuously increasing. 3) From 1977-2017, the landscape health in the north is better than that in the south of the study area. At the same time, the scattered distribution areas with poor or extremely poor landscape health status should be regarded as the key objects and typical areas of future protection work. It is worth mentioning that our landscape health diagnosis system has stronger applicability, landscape health diagnosis system can better monitor and diagnose the landscape health condition in the study area. © 2021 Science Press.

TI  - A Comparative Study Of Built-Up Index Approaches For Automated Extraction Of Built-Up Regions From Remote Sensing Data
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2014
AB  - Accurate built-up information is imperative for loss estimation and disaster management after the occurrence of catastrophic events such as earthquake, tornado, tsunami and flood. These catastrophic events leave behind a trail of mass destruction with property and human losses amounting to millions. Once a natural disaster hits a region, built-up information is required within a short span of time for disaster management. Nowadays, earth observation satellite imagery serves as a promising source to extract the land use / land cover classes. However, the automatic extraction of urban built-up from remote sensing data is a known challenge in the remote sensing community. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) algorithm has been recognized as an effective algorithm for automatic built-up identification from medium spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Few researchers have modified this algorithm and proposed new quantitative expressions for the built-up index. In this paper, three built-up index based, unsupervised built-up extraction algorithms have been reviewed and compared. An automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm is used to assort the built-up index values, obtained from modified built-up index algorithms, into built-up and non built-up regions for enhancing the efficiency of the built-up detection process. Qualitative assessment of these algorithms involves computation of several parameters including recently developed parameters like allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement, and classical parameters such as error of omission, error of commission and overall accuracy. This paper presents a case study where the algorithms have been implemented on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the city of Delhi and its surrounding areas for detection of built-up regions automatically.

TI  - Maxent Modeling For Predicting The Potential Distribution Of Valeriana Jatamansi Jones. In Chakrata Forest Division Of Garhwal Himalaya
JO  - Indian Journal of Ecology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Valeriana jatamansi is distributed in subtropical to the temperate regions between 1000 to 3000m in Himalayas. Its' population is decreasing at an alarming rate to meet the demand of pharmaceutical industries and is placed under endangered categories. The present study was attained to depict its potential distribution in Chakrata forest division. For modeling procedure, Worldclim bioclimatic variables along with slope, aspect, elevation, forest types (based on Sentinel-2) data and 50 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution in the 1164.23 km2 study area. The suitable habitat for V. jatamansi was recorded 207 km2. The temperature (31%) and precipitation (15%) where is the key influential factors that affects its distribution. Jacknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modelling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 0.89. The findings can be applied in various ways such as species restoration and conservation planning, identification of additional localities where V. jatamansi may already exist but has not yet been detected. This approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species. © 2021 Ecological Society of India. All rights reserved.

TI  - Silk Road Initiative And China Energy Security In West Asia
JO  - Central Eurasia Studies
PY  - 2022
AB  - Introduction: Given China’s growing economic growth and the need to supply energy to industries, as well as access to the consumer market for domestic production, Xi Jinping in 2013 introduced the Silk Road Initiative as his country’s macro strategy. The Persian Gulf region is the “economic center of gravity” of the oil industry, with the world's largest oil fields, the lowest production and about two-thirds of the world’s proven energy reserves. With the continuation and deepening of China-West Asia relations in the field of energy supply, efforts have been made to expand and strengthen diplomatic relations with West Asian countries in the past. Given the growing debate and competition from regional and trans-regional actors for greater benefits in West Asia, China, with its growing economic growth and the need to provide energy for continued economic and trade power, through its macro-initiative strategy. The Silk Road has put the expansion of its presence and influence in West Asia on the agenda. Research Question: what goals does China pursue in West Asia through the Energy Silk Road Initiative? Research Hypothesis: China seeks to secure its energy through the implementation of the Silk Road Initiative through long-term contracts and investments with West Asian countries. Methodology (and Theoretical Framework if there are): Energy security is a multidimensional concept, and different stakeholders look at it from their own perspectives. Supply, demand, industry and the environment are considered different dimensions of energy security. Today, due to the challenges posed to the threat of energy security to the economic infrastructure of countries, many governments consider self-sufficiency in the field of energy to ensure the continuation of productive economic activities, is inevitable. China, as one of the leading countries in the field of economic growth and development, in order to maintain its economic position, which translates its position in the international system, and considering the emphasis on a multilateral approach in the international system and Replacing the existing order, energy security and non-disruption in its provision has been one of the main axes of foreign policy and inviolable principle in pursuit of national interests, so in this study, the discussion of energy security as one of the main areas of the Silk Road Initiative, Has been considered as a point of reference and a conceptual framework for explaining the goals of the Silk Road Initiative in the field of energy in West Asia. Results and Discussion: Following the implementation of the Silk Road Initiative in 2013, China’s economic relationship with West Asia entered a more serious phase. indicating that West Asia currently has high priorities in China’s geostrategic sphere. In its cooperation with West Asian countries, China intends to focus on three areas: the first and most important area, the energy sector, the second area, facilitating investment in infrastructure and trade, and the third area, progress in nuclear energy, space satellite and New energy. China has various methods to ensure its energy security, such as huge investments in the exploration and extraction of oil and gas fields, strengthening of energy infrastructure to improve energy efficiency, participation in oil projects, it has used gas, electricity, renewable energy, nuclear energy, etc. in West Asia in the form of the Silk Road initiative. It should also be acknowledged that China’s growing influence in the West Asian region through strategies such as the Silk Road Initiative, despite its declared policy, is not just about economics, but also about pursuing political and security interests and providing the basis for expanding influence and hegemony. The periphery is at the heart of the plan. Conclusion: Conflicts and political unrest in the West Asian region are causing panic and disruption in China’s energy supply channels. Its acquisition has shifted to Central Asia's energy resources. It should be noted that despite the fact that Beiji g supplies most of its energy resources from West Asia, and continued investment to ensure China's energy security is one of its top foreign policy priorities in West Asia. However, the existing political and security challenges in these countries, the energy transfer route, the US influence in the region, etc. are considered as a threat to China’s energy security. Therefore,within the framework of the Silk Road initiative, Beijing has invested in oil and gas resources of Central Asian countries by concluding long-term contracts and investing in energy infrastructure, as a safety valve and alternative to West Asian energy to benefit. Exercising its economic influence in the region will pave the way for regional hegemony and challenge US unilateralism. © 2022,Central Eurasia Studies. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Redd+: The Opportunity For Sustainable Management In Zagros Forests
JO  - Journal of Sustainable Forestry
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) projects aim to prevent deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions as a policy to combat climate changes. This article evaluates changes to the Zagros’ Forest cover in 20 years and predicts the implications of implementing the REDD+ project in the next two decades. Using Landsat Forest cover maps and a logistic regression model the potential for forest cover transfer to non-forest regions was modeled to identify regions at risk of deforestation. A Markov chain was implemented to predict the changes. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was employed for validation, and the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) was utilized to model the REDD+ project baseline to predict the forest cover changes. The findings indicate, 37,809 hectares of forest cover were lost in the past 20 years and with this trend, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions will increase. However, implementing the REDD+ project can prevent the release of 1,714,534.13 tCO2e. Therefore, this deteriorating forest possesses the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by preventing deforestation, identifying deforestation-prone areas and implementing the REDD+ project utilizing the methodology presented. Climate change mitigation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection are just a few of the benefits of REDD+ projects that can aid sustainable forest management. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Comparison Of Remote Sensing Indices For Monitoring Of Desert Cienegas
JO  - Arid Land Research and Management
PY  - 2016
AB  - This research considers the applicability of different vegetation indices at 30 m resolution for mapping and monitoring desert wetland (cienega) health and spatial extent through time at Cienega Creek in southeastern Arizona, USA. Multiple stressors including the risk of decadal-scale drought, the effects of current and predicted global warming, and continued anthropogenic pressures threaten aquatic habitats in the southwest and cienegas are recognized as important sites for conservation and restoration efforts. However, cienegas present a challenge to satellite-imagery based analysis due to their small size and mixed surface cover of open water, exposed soils, and vegetation. We created time series of five well-known vegetation indices using annual Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images retrieved during the April–June dry season, from 1984 to 2011 to map landscape-level distribution of wetlands and monitor the temporal dynamics of individual sites. Indices included the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). One topographic index, the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), was analyzed to examine the utility of topography in mapping distribution of cienegas. Our results indicate that the NDII, calculated using Landsat TM band 5, outperforms the other indices at differentiating cienegas from riparian and upland sites, and was the best means to analyze change. As such, it offers a critical baseline for future studies that seek to extend the analysis of cienegas to other regions and time scales, and has broader applicability to the remote sensing of wetland features in arid landscapes. © 2016, This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.

TI  - Analysis On The Spatial Distribution Variation Characteristic Of Urban Heat Environmental Quality And Its Mechanism - A Case Study Of Hangzhou City
JO  - Chinese Geographical Science
PY  - 2003
AB  - Urban heat environmental quality (UHEQ) is affected by the interacting of weather condition and underlying surface framework of urban area. In the last two decades, many researchers from domestic and overseas have studied many problems at the aspect of urban heat environment such as urban heat islands, urban air temperature and their relation with urban land cover, city population, air pollution etc. In the recent years, Hangzhou, acting as a center city of Zhejiang Province in China, its urbanization quantum and quantity have both changed greatly, in particular, representing as business affairs building, resident real property and all kinds of specialty market having arisen in built-up zone. Based on Landsat TM images data in 1991 and 1999, urban underlying surface temperature value and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated using image interpreting and supervised classification technique by remote sensing software ERDAS image 8.4. The relation model between urban underlying surface temperature (UUST) and urban air temperature was setup according to the certain correlation pattern. Reference to the relational standard of assessing human comfort and other meteorology data of Hangzhou City in summer, the spatial distribution characteristic and the spatial variation degree of human comfort of heat environmental quality are estimated and mapped on a middle scale, that is, in six districts of Hangzhou City. Then the paper reveals the main characteristic of spatial variation from 1991 to 1999. Lastly, the change mechanism is analyzed and discussed from the viewpoint of city planning, construction and environmental protection.

TI  - Growing Value In Your Forestland
JO  - Forest Landowner
PY  - 2008
AB  - Forestland owners are continuously implementing new practices and innovative technology to further stimulate productivity amid rising labor and fertilizer costs. They are implementing integrated silviculture programs to improve yield and return of investment. A leaf index is used to help foresters decide when and how much fertilization or vegetation control treatment is needed in pine plantations. In addition, foresters and landowners are using new remote-sensing technologies to monitor tree-stand growth and health as well as the use of infrared photography, computer software, and imaging that provide accurate, detailed portrait of the tree stand. One notable software, ForestSense by Image Tree, provides users the capability to monitor the forest and hence, provide information on better use of fertilizers, thinning and harvest management.

TI  - Impact Of Urban Morphology And Landscape Characteristics On Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity Of Land Surface Temperature
JO  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban microclimates have undergone extreme changes against the current backdrop of global warming and rapid urbanization. Although several studies on the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of land surface temperatures (LSTs) have been reported, only a few of them describe the key factors and specific spatial relationships that affect LSTs from time series. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the spatial heterogeneity of LST from multiple time series and analyze its relationship with various influencing factors. A case study of the Ganjingzi District (GJZ) of Dalian City, China, was performed, with multi-source data and spatial analysis methods being jointly used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics and driving factors of multi temporal LSTs. The results indicate the following: (i) the GJZ LSTs gradually increased, with the average increase being 0.55 degrees C; (ii) there was a strong and positive correlation among the spatial distribution of LSTs, and the Moran's I value for global spatial autocorrelation exceeded 0.85; and (iii) the fitting degree between the LST and various factors (Adjust-R-2) for the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was better than that for the ordinary least squares approach. NDBI and LST are highly correlated and have good spatial stability. From the spatial distribution of Local-R-2, it can be seen that with the expansion of urban space, the influence of urban areas on LSTs increases. Therefore, reasonable planning of urban land is of great significance for mitigating heat islands.

TI  - Distribution And Relative Abundance Of Forest Birds In Relation To Burn Severity In Southeastern Arizona
JO  - Journal of Wildlife Management
PY  - 2006
AB  - The frequency of wild and prescribed fires in montane forests of the southwestern United States has increased after a century of fire suppression and subsequent fuels accumulation. To assess the effects of recent fires (median time since fire = 6 yr) on the montane forest bird community, we surveyed birds in 8 Sky Island mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona, USA, and examined how the distribution (i.e., presence-absence) of 65 species and relative abundance of 16 species correlated with evidence of severe and less severe fire at >1,500 survey points. We detected associations between fire and bird presence-absence for 17% of the 65 species analyzed and between fire and bird relative abundance for 25% of the 16 species analyzed. Most species (73%) were positively associated with burned areas and displayed stronger associations (i.e., more extreme odds ratios) with survey points that had evidence of severe as opposed to less severe fire. Positive associations with severe fire were strong (>3 to 1 odds) for western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and house wren (Troglodytes aedon), and negative associations with severe fire were strong for warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) and red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). Although recent fires appear to have had a positive effect on the distribution and relative abundance of several montane forest bird species in the region, these species are not the open-woodland birds that we would have expected to have benefited from fire based on previous research. Nevertheless, our results confirm associations between fire and bird presence-absence and relative abundance reported previously for 7 species of birds. Our results also provide new information for Grace's warbler (Dendroica graciae) and greater pewee (C. pertinax), 2 species for which fire data were formerly lacking. Managers can use these data to make and test predictions about the effects of future fires, both severe and less severe, on montane forest birds in the southwestern United States.

TI  - Remotely Sensing Arthropod And Nutrient Stressed Plants: A Case Study With Nitrogen And Cotton Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
JO  - Environmental Entomology
PY  - 2010
AB  - Remote sensing can be used in combination with ground sampling to detect aphid(Aphis gossypii Glover) infested cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Changes in wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) have proven useful for such detection, but these changes can be confused with other factors stressing plants, such as water deficiency and nutrient status. This study was designed to test the utility of this technology to distinguish between two factors stressing plants: nitrogen deficiency and aphids. Field plots were created by applying varying rates of nitrogen to cotton at different dates in the growing season in 2003 and 2004. Subplots were created by applying disruptive insecticides, which increased aphid populations in a portion of the subplots. Airplane and satellite remote sensing data in 2003 and 2004 were supplemented with ground sampling of aphid populations in both years. Insecticide application, nitrogen application rate and date influenced aphid abundance. Cotton with higher aphid populations could be distinguished from cotton with natural aphid infestations independent of plant nitrogen status using a NIR wavelength in 2003 and a proprietary 2004 index. Complex distinctions among varying nitrogen treatments and aphid abundance were not possible using this data. In the future, possible confounding factors should be investigated from the perspective of their change on crop physiology before remote sensing can be used in an integrated pest management (IPM) program. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment Of A Mediterranean Fuel-Type Map For Wildland Fire Management At National Scale: The Cases Of Greece And Portugal
PY  - 2014
AB  - Classification and mapping of wildland fuel is one of the most important factors that should be taken into consideration for wildland fire prevention and planning. In this paper we demonstrate the accuracy assessment of "ArcFUEL" project which has delivered a complete, up-to-date, methodology for Fuel Classification Mapping (FCM on a Web-Geodatabase) based on "readily available" data, harmonized, accessible \& interoperable according to INSPIRE principles, for the Mediterranean Region. The fuel layer has been evaluated in terms of spatial and thematic thematic accuracy by employing an extensive field campaign in Portugal and Greece and standard photointerpretation procedures. For Greece, the overall accuracy was found to be 80.59 \%, while the Kappa value was 0.74. For Portugal the overall accuracy was found to be 67\% and the Kappa value was 0.63. The spatial fuel maps is an end-product essential for computing spatial fuel hazard, fire risk and simulation, fire growth and intensity and post fire effects across a landscape at national and regional scale.

TI  - Grace: A Scalable Graph-Based Approach To Accelerating Recommendation Model Inference
JO  - International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems - ASPLOS
PY  - 2023
AB  - The high memory bandwidth demand of sparse embedding layers continues to be a critical challenge in scaling the performance of recommendation models. While prior works have exploited heterogeneous memory system designs and partial embedding sum memoization techniques, they offer limited benefits. This is because prior designs either target a very small subset of embeddings to simplify their analysis or incur a high processing cost to account for all embeddings, which does not scale with the large sizes of modern embedding tables. This paper proposes GRACE-a lightweight and scalable graph-based algorithm-system co-design framework to significantly improve the embedding layer performance of recommendation models. GRACE proposes a novel Item Co-occurrence Graph (ICG) that scalably records item co-occurrences. GRACE then presents a new system-aware ICG clustering algorithm to find frequently accessed item combinations of arbitrary lengths to compute and memoize their partial sums. High-frequency partial sums are stored in a software-managed cache space to reduce memory traffic and improve the throughput of computing sparse features. We further present a cache data layout and low-cost address computation logic to efficiently lookup item embeddings and their partial sums. Our evaluation shows that GRACE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques SPACE and MERCI by 1.5x and 1.4x, respectively. © 2023 ACM.

JO  - African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure
PY  - 2020
AB  - The National and Youth National Games have been organized for several decades in Thailand, but they have never been evaluated in terms of their success or whether they meet objectives set forth by various stakeholders. In this case study, the social and economic impact of National and Youth Games towards the host city are analyzed. The major issues including technical problems, marketing and public relations problems are described. The stakeholders involved in organizing the previous Games, SAT executives and also sport associations were interviewed for possible alternative solutions to a range of challenges. The main objectives for organizing the National Games and National Youth Games consist of technical objectives and also social and economic objectives. The major issues are the disparity between the larger cities who traditionally dominate the games, and the qualification of athlete registration which allows the athlete to register to a province in three different ways either by birth place, place of education or place of work. The other challenges are little interest from foreign spectators and local citizens. It is also a concern for SAT that the value of National and Youth Games seems to be diminishing among Thai people in general. The reason may be ascribed to the rapid growth of easily accessible Satellite TV and Cable TV across the country. The solutions are not easy to implement because each alternative also has advantages and disadvantages. Some rules might benefit the smaller provinces while others might benefits the larger provinces. SAT should close the gap by providing more opportunities such as training and reinforcement for the cities that lack of resources, plans and great effort should be made all round. © 2020 Africa Journals.

TI  - Using Landsat And Sentinel-2 Spectral Time Series To Detect East African Small Woodlots
JO  - Science of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate maps of gains in tree cover are necessary to quantify carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and land use changes. Satellite-based mapping of emerging smallholder woodlots in heterogeneous landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa is challenging. Our goal was to evaluate the use of time series to detect and map small woodlots (<1 ha) in Tanzania. We distinguished woodlots from other land cover types by woodlots' distinct multi-year spectral time series. Woodlots exhibit greening from planting to maturity followed by browning at harvest. We compared two time series approaches: 1) a linear model of Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) and other indices, and 2) LandTrendr temporal segmentation metrics. The approaches had equivalent woodlot detection accuracy, but LandTrendr segments had lower accuracy for characterizing woodlot age. We tested the effect of the following factors on woodlot detection and mapping accuracy: the length of the time series (2009–2019), frequency of observations (all Landsat vs. only Landsat-8), spatial resolution (30-m Landsat vs. 10-m Sentinel-2), and woodlot age and size. Woodlot mapping accuracies were higher with longer time series (54% at 3-yrs vs 77% at 7-yrs). The accuracies also improved with more observations, especially when the time series was short (3-yrs Landsat-8 only: 54% vs. all-Landsat: 64%, p-value <0.001). Sentinel-2's higher spatial resolution minimized commission errors even for short time series. Finally, less than half of young and small (<0.4 ha) woodlots were detected, suggesting considerable omission errors in our and other woodlot maps. Our results suggest that the accurate detection of woodlots is possible by analyzing multi-year time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. Given the region's woodlot boom, accurate maps are needed to better quantify woodlots' contribution to carbon sequestration, livelihoods enhancement, and landscape management. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - An Efficient Approach For Satellite Image Building Detection Based On Tetra Wavelet
JO  - 2015 International Conference on Control Instrumentation Communication and Computational Technologies, ICCICCT 2015
PY  - 2016
AB  - Building detection is an important task for disaster management and urban area planning. Many papers are already published to provide the solution of building detection but they are failed with insufficient accuracy. This paper provides a advanced and efficient solution for building detection process using the novel Tetra wavelet method. Tetra wavelet process deals with tetra images wh ich are derived from the original grayscale image. Also it handles the pixel values in between 0 to 3 which is also in terms of tetra. The Tetra wavelet process approaches wavelet procedure which is constructed by XOR operation. The fmal building detection is controlled by the eight component connectivity method. This approach is suitable for all types of satellite image building detection problems. The experimental result shows that the proposed method improves the segmentation accuracy at a significant level. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - The Advantages Of Using Drones Over Space-Borne Imagery In The Mapping Of Mangrove Forests
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Satellite data and aerial photos have proved to be useful in efficient conservation and management of mangrove ecosystems. However, there have been only very few attempts to demonstrate the ability of drone images, and none so far to observe vegetation (specieslevel) mapping. The present study compares the utility of drone images (DJI-Phantom-2 with SJ4000 RGB and IR cameras, spatial resolution: 5cm) and satellite images (Pleiades-1B, spatial resolution: 50cm) for mangrove mapping-specifically in terms of image quality, efficiency and classification accuracy, at the Setiu Wetland in Malaysia. Both object- and pixel-based classification approaches were tested (QGIS v.2.12.3 with Orfeo Toolbox). The object-based classification (using a manual rule-set algorithm) of drone imagery with dominant land-cover features (i.e. water, land, Avicennia alba, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata and Casuarina equisetifolia) provided the highest accuracy (overall accuracy (OA): 94.0 +/- 0.5\% and specific producer accuracy (SPA): 97.0 +/- 9.3\%) as compared to the Pleiades imagery (OA: 72.2 +/- 2.7\% and SPA: 51.9 +/- 22.7\%). In addition, the pixel-based classification (using a maximum likelihood algorithm) of drone imagery provided better accuracy (OA: 90.0 +/- 1.9\% and SPA: 87.2 +/- 5.1\%) compared to the Pleiades (OA: 82.8 +/- 3.5\% and SPA: 80.4 +/- 14.3\%). Nevertheless, the drone provided higher temporal resolution images, even on cloudy days, an exceptional benefit when working in a humid tropical climate. In terms of the user-costs, drone costs are much higher, but this becomes advantageous over satellite data for long-term monitoring of a small area. Due to the large data size of the drone imagery, its processing time was about ten times greater than that of the satellite image, and varied according to the various image processing techniques employed (in pixel-based classification, drone >50 hours, Pleiades <5 hours), constituting the main disadvantage of UAV remote sensing. However, the mangrove mapping based on the drone aerial photos provided unprecedented results for Setiu, and was proven to be a viable alternative to satellite-based monitoring/management of these ecosystems. The improvements of drone technology will help to make drone use even more competitive in the future.

TI  - Commercial Satellite Industry In The Context Of Global Space Economy: Launchpad To Off-World Future
JO  - Accelerating Space Commerce, Exploration, and New Discovery conference, ASCEND 2021
PY  - 2021
AB  - Governments and industry continue to expand activities beyond existing space sectors to architect and construct a future where burgeoning in-space activities may flourish, as is evidenced by efforts to facilitate the commercialization of LEO and the development of commercial lunar activities, as well as by the ongoing expansion of on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing services. In the context of this potential new “off-world future”, a firm understanding of the current size of the satellite industry, revenue drivers within the industry, and changes in industry dynamics are critical. Given the prospect of future economic activity generated from emerging and maturing in-space business concepts, this paper characterizes and provides objective context on the current size of the industry to which emerging concepts and prospective revenues can be compared. The companies within the satellite industry, whose business performance results are used to generate indicators comprising the size of the space economy, are key stakeholders with the ability to shape the direction of emerging space activities. Established satellite manufacturers, for example, may build satellites or components for commercial satellite operators and construct the spacecraft and platforms needed to support market growth in LEO and lunar business activities, highlighting the potential complementary supply chains. Success or stagnation in certain satellite industry sectors may impact the performance of others within the broader space economy. Understanding the satellite industry’s gross economic performance and performance of key existing satellite industry sectors is imperative for conceptualizing how emerging markets in an “off-world future” will eventually be integrated within the space industry at large. BryceTech conducts an annual study of the satellite industry’s economic performance for the Satellite Industry Association (SIA). The study is derived from surveys of nearly 100 companies, including 54 SIA members, supplemented with unique data sets, in-depth public information, and independent analysis. Key satellite industry sectors are assessed, including satellite services (television, radio, broadband, fixed and mobile satellite communication services, and remote sensing), manufacturing, ground equipment, and launch services. The study is the most accurate available assessment of the satellite industry in the United States and internationally. The study provides objective measures of the satellite industry to aid communication with policy makers, regulators, legislators, investors, and other industry stakeholders. The study’s findings on the satellite industry’s economic performance and industry dynamics provide metrics to illustrate the influence of the satellite industry on society compared to other industry sectors. The study results revealed global satellite industry revenue of about $271 billion in 2020. The study results present the satellite sector revenues in the context of the broader space economy and across the industry value chain. In each sector, overall revenue, growth rates, and international geographic distribution are analyzed, and trends are discussed. Additional analysis of revenue and contract data offers valuable insight into domestic and international market dynamics. The paper covers the period from 2016 through 2020. Analysis includes assessments of the dynamics and trends regarding the growth of active on-orbit satcom capacity (high-throughput capacity in GEO and new LEO broadband capacity), the diverse heritage of and new emerging start-ups in remote sensing systems and services, and the continuing growth of smallsat activity. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the satellite industry, including an abrupt drop in demand for some services, such as in-flight and on-the-move connectivity and broadcasting of sport and entertainment events, and a satellite production slow-down, are given additional attention. The paper also considers how changes in overall industry long-term dynamics are driving ncreased productivity and new capabilities across all four key satellite industry sectors. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is envisioned as an interoperable confederation of existing and future Earth observations systems that span the both the information collection and information exploitation value chains. The implementation of this approach will require information synthesis across disciplines, domains, and geopolitical boundaries. The benefit of GEOSS will be derived from two primary sources. First, GEOSS will provide the ability to leverage Earth observations in order to make better, more informed decisions on key societal issues. Second, GEOSS will incubate a value-added sector that will respond to emerging and to-be-developed market opportunities. The challenge, as we strive to entrain legacy assets, is to enable these benefits and not negatively impact existing operational strategies and approaches. In addition, the development approach needs to be mindful of the need for capacity building within developing countries. We will explore these issues, identify three key technological enablers, and identify specific implications for information system providers that desire to participate in the GEOSS endeavor. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Quantifying crop water consumption is essential for water resource management. The objective was to estimate the current evapotranspiration (ETa) of the cotton crop (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in the rainfed system, as well as the components of the radiation and energy balance in the Cerrado biome conditions using orbital images and the SEBAL algorithm and validate the estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) using FAO guidelines for crop coefficient (K-c) of the cotton crop. Research was carried out in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, in areas with three cotton cultivars. Images of the Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor sensors were used and ET estimation was made based on the SEBAL algorithm. Mean ETa in the cotton cycle was 3.5 mm dia(-1) and the K-c values ranged from 0.22 and 1.12, on average, in the smaller and larger leaf area, respectively.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Characteristics And Landscape Connectivity Of Heat Islands In Xiamen In The Face Of Rapid Urbanization
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, urban heat waves have become a major problem affecting the lives of citizens. In this context, the accurate identification of the key patches and nodes of urban heat islands is important for improving the urban environment. This study examined the Landsat image data from Xiamen city in 2001, 2011, and 2021 to analyze the construction of the urban heat island (UHI) network. A morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity model were utilized to identify the central thermal landscape patches and key nodes of UHI and their spatial and temporal evolution characteristics in the urban development process. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide valuable insights that can contribute to the enhancement of the urban environment. The results showed that (1) there was a significant increase in the heat island area (HIA) of Xiamen from 2001 to 2021, and the heat island patches show a concentrated trend. The temperature contrast between the urban area and the surrounding countryside was more distinct, indicating the urban construction land has a tendency to gather and spread. (2) The core area of the heat island accounted for the largest proportion of the thermal landscape area during the study period, and its proportion increased significantly. And the rate of increase was first rapid and then slow. The areas of the edge, branch, islet, bridge, loop, and perforation classes all showed different degrees of a decreasing trend. This indicates an increasing degree of aggregation between heat island patches. (3) The top 20 thermal landscape patches with high landscape connectivity importance values were identified. Among them, the importance value and area of the first four patches are relatively large, and belong to the three importance classes of extremely important, important, and generally important heat island core patches, which deserve focused attention and optimization. (4) Cooling measures can be prioritized for core areas of heat islands with high importance values. Connections between hot and cold islands can be interrupted or connected to mitigate the heat island effect throughout the region. The results of this study have important practical guidance for urban planning and sustainable development.

TI  - European Space Agency's Strategic Contribution To Seismology
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2013
AB  - The impacts of disaster events such as earthquakes on economic and human lives are increasing every year, in particular due to the growing urbanization. Until recently, stakeholders involved in disaster risk management focused their efforts mainly on the response phase, immediately after the crisis. Following the recommendations of several recent studies and in order to minimize the increasing impacts of natural disasters, decision-makers and major stakeholders have showed an increasing interest in mitigation activities. Earth Observation (EO) data from space could bring a significant added value to the various phases of the seismic risk management cycle from the mitigation and preparedness phases. Space agencies need to better contribute to the management of geohazards in response to the growing request from the community of users (e. g. seismologists, insurance companies, urban planners). To foster the use of EO remote sensing data, satellite data providers have to take the appropriate measures to remove the policy and technical barriers related to the data access. They have also to increase the awareness of the community of users on the potential benefits that could be gained from the use of EO satellite data. This paper will provide examples of areas where EO remote sensing data from space could bring an added value to the current management of risks and crisis related to earthquakes. Then, the paper will describe the strategic measures undertaken by the European Space Agency in an international framework, to foster the use of satellite data by the various relevant stakeholders.

TI  - Development Of Processing Chains For Rapid Mapping With Satellite Data
PY  - 2007
AB  - In case of a disaster on a large scale the International Charter of Space and Major Disasters ( Charter) provides satellite data from different sensors. Since 2000 more than 140 Charter Calls have proven the great value of this fast disaster response instrument but have also shown different handling problems causing time delay and downgrading the value of rapid mapping products. This paper proposes a framework for a rapid mapping processing chain based on the experiences gathered during the 2005 flood crisis in Switzerland. It focuses on the pre-processing of satellite data, the value-adding step and the visualization of the results. Critical elements are hereby the availability of essential datasets, the processing time, the information extraction and the usability of the products for the end-users. International programs containing rapid mapping elements as PREVIEW or GMES RESPOND and RISK-EOS need further research on the above-mentioned topics to improve the usability and significance of their products and to improve the benefit of satellite data for disaster management support.

TI  - Landscape Composition And Configuration In The Central Highlands Of Ethiopia
JO  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2016
AB  - Landscape dynamics are common phenomenon in the human-dominated environments whereby it can be observed that the composition and configuration between landscape elements change over time. This dynamism brings about habitat loss and fragmentation that can greatly alter ecosystem services at patch, class, and landscape levels. We conducted a study to examine composition and configuration of forested landscape in the central highlands of Ethiopia using satellite images of over a period of four decades, and FRAGSTAT raster dataset was used to analyze fragmentation. Our result showed five land use/land cover (LULC) types in the study area. Cultivated land and settlement land increased at the expense of forestland, shrubland, and grassland. Fragmentation analysis showed the number of patches increased for all LULC types, indicating the level of fragmentation and interspersion. Juxtaposition increased for shrubland, grassland, and cultivated lands and decreased for settlement and forestland resulting in the fragmentation and isolation of patches. The study of LULC along with fragmentation at the landscape level can help improve our understanding of the pace at which conversion of landscape elements is happening and the impacts on ecosystem services as studies of LULC are courser in nature and would not show how each land use is reducing in size, proximity and shape among other things that determine ecosystem services. Such type of studies in rural landscapes are very vital to consider appropriate land management policies for the landscape level by taking into account the interaction between each element for sustainable development. We recommend land managers, conservationists, and land owners for observing the roles of each patch in the matrix to maximize the benefits than focusing on a single element.

TI  - Coastal Ocean Forecast System For The U.s. East Coast
JO  - Oceans Conference Record (IEEE)
PY  - 1996
AB  - The Coastal Ocean Forecast System has been producing experimental daily 24-hour forecasts of water levels and 3-dimensional temperature, salinity and currents on an operational basis for three years at NOAA's National Center for Environmental Prediction. The model system consists of the Princeton Ocean Model forced at the surface by forecast heat and momentum fluxes derived from the meso-Eta atmospheric model. The evolving operational system includes a number of enhancements that correct the surface fluxes and optimize the open ocean lateral boundary conditions. The results of an ongoing evaluation of forecast subtidal coastal water level and sea surface temperature reveal the encouraging predictability of wind-driven set-up and set-down at the coast and the limits of sea surface temperature (SST) predictability without the benefit of data assimilation or model reinitialization. Experimental efforts are presently underway to correctly incorporate the body forcing and open ocean boundary forcing of the tides, to implement assimilation of satellite-derived SST, and to follow this with operational experiments at assimilation of altimeter-based sea surface height fields. In addition, a number of regional forecast systems under development at the National Ocean Service require accurate coastal ocean information from this system as boundary condition forcing.

TI  - A Geospatial Indicator For Assessing Urban Panoramic Views
JO  - Computers, Environment and Urban Systems
PY  - 2015
AB  - We propose a general methodology for the visibility analysis of a selected landscape area, unit or set of features. Its initial field of application is in panoramic views of towns and cities, a dimension of landscape to which varied approaches have been made in recent years, both in iconographic studies and urban planning. The procedure is based on the calculation of visual exposure and includes two additional factors, namely the average vertical angle over the study area and the observation distance. The first is obtained from an extension to the visual exposure algorithm, and the second is evaluated through a weighting curve based on the ability to perceive details of the subject of interest. The result is an indicator we have called View Generation Potential (VGP), which assigns a value to each point in the territory on the basis of its capacity to produce panoramic views of the study area (town or city). The method is easy to use and sources can be readily accessed. VGP can provide useful information for decision-making in urban and land-use planning, which can be integrated into multi-criteria studies and enables the aesthetic and cultural qualities of the landscape of towns and their surrounding areas to be taken into consideration. It can also be used in the management of urban growth via the generation of land-use suitability maps, the treatment of free spaces and the creation of viewpoints. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sediment Yield And Soil Erosion Assessment By Using Empirical Models For Shazand Watershed, A Semi-Arid Area In Center Of Iran
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Today, the assessment of erosion and sediment yield of catchments is among the fundamental issues in water resources management and environmental problems in developing countries. In this regard, empirical methods have received much more interest than other methods due to the lack of reliable hydrometric and partially precise data, especially for long periods of time. In this paper, the intensity of soil erosion and sediment yield is assessed using Modified Pacific Southwest Inter-Agency Committee (MPSIAC) and Erosion Potential Method (EPM) models in Shazand basin (one of the sub-basins of Saveh dam in the center of Iran) and is compared with the hydrometric method. For this purpose, the study area was simulated with the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques using the basic 10 m x 10 m cell size maps. The required parameters for MPSIAC and EPM models were defined in ArcGIS 10.2 and Envi 5.1. Then, soil erosion zonation map and sediment yield value were obtained by 2 models and validated by hydrometric outputs. The results of MPSIAC model show that sediment yield in Pol-e Doab, Bazaneh, Tureh and Azna stations are 365,493.26, 47,879.56, 46,291.95 and 40,005.25 tons per year, respectively, while using EPM model they are 288,103.81, 18,963.83, 43,079.2, and 20,583.76 tons per year, respectively. The comparison between MPSIAC model and hydrometric results in Pol-e Doab, Tureh, and Shazand shows agreement levels of 91, 73 and 94\%, respectively, and 100\% incompatibility in Bazaneh station. In comparison, the difference between EPM model and hydrometric results in Pol-e doab, Bazaneh, Tureh and Shazand stations shows agreement levels of 86, 82, 48 and 79\%, respectively. Based on the obtained results, EPM model has higher compatibility in maximum sediment yield prediction, whereas MPSIAC model shows a better ability to create soil erosion zonation mapping with 10 m x 10 m cell size accuracy.

TI  - The Surface Water Ocean Topography (Swot) Mission And Marine Applications Of Satellite Radar Altimetry For Societal Benefit
JO  - Oceans Conference Record (IEEE)
PY  - 2023
AB  - Continuity in the reference satellite radar altimetry missions (TOPEX/Poseidon; Jason 1, 2, and 3; Sentinel 6 Michael Freilich) involving partnerships between NASA and other space agencies over three decades has ensured an invaluable, cross-calibrated climate data record of key variables including sea surface height and water topography on large lakes and rivers, to significant wave height, surface ocean wind speed, and sea ice height and thickness. These observations have been instrumental to our improved scientific understanding of global ocean circulation, sea level rise and water cycle processes more generally. Importantly, they have also contributed to a growing number of practical applications involving operational government agencies and the private sector. These range from weather prediction, coastal impact assessment and planning, fisheries management, marine transport, and disaster risk management related to sea level change and flooding, among others. Launch in December 2022 of the joint NASA and CNES Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission with its innovative wide-swath (120 km) Ka-band radar interferometer and complementary Jason-class nadir altimeter instruments, will provide observations of water surface topography over the oceans, coasts and land (rivers, lakes, wetlands) at unprecedented resolution that are likely to be a game-changer for science and decision support applications alike. Here we provide an overview of the SWOT mission, data validation, availability and access aspects, in addition to the targeted applications being developed via engagement with international partner organizations under the SWOT Early Adopters program. © 2023 The Marine Technology Society (MTS).

TI  - Mapping Erosion-Sensitive Areas After Wildfires Using Fieldwork, Remote Sensing, And Geographic Information Systems Techniques On A Regional Scale
JO  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2006
AB  - [}1] Alterations in the hydrological cycle following wildfire due to the loss of ground cover vegetation and changes in soil properties have been documented in many studies. Nevertheless, the rapid process of vegetation recovery reduces such negative effects. Vegetation cover before fire, fire severity, and geophysical properties are important factors that control spatial discontinuities involved in the vegetation-covering process. The objective of this study was to estimate the probability of high erosion in order to map erosion-sensitive areas after fire. The analysis was carried out in different plant communities burnt by summer wildfires in the pre-Pyrenean area ( Spain). Three-year Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images have been used for mapping wildfire areas and severity levels. Conversion to spectral reflectance has been applied for radiometric correction by normalizing topographic and atmospheric effects. Likewise, other physical variables have also been incorporated into the geographic information system (GIS): vegetation types, parent material, illumination, slope, aspect, and precipitation. The dependent variable has been characterized by means of fieldwork and a photointerpretation process based on high-resolution digital aerial orthophotographs taken 11-12 years after the fire. Different logistic regression models have been used for mapping the probability of erosion. Results indicate that prefire normalized difference vegetation index values and aspect are the most important variables for estimating erosion-sensitive areas after fire (Nagelkerke r(2) = 0.66; Kappa values = 0.65). Finally, the use of nonparametric models with environmental digital information based on GIS can facilitate the management of burnt areas.

TI  - Analysis Of The Implementation Effects Of Ecological Restoration Projects Based On Carbon Storage And Eco-Environmental Quality: A Case Study Of The Yellow River Delta, China
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - As an important means to address global climate change and land-use/land-cover (LULC) change, ecological restoration projects (ERPs) have a large effect on carbon storage functions and eco-environmental quality. However, the various ERPs carried out in the Yellow River Delta region have important implications for ecological security strategies in China. Therefore, based on land-use data and remote sensing image data, with the help of ArcGIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platforms, this study uses the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, an improved remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model and other methods to deeply examine the evolutionary trends of eco-environmental quality and carbon storage during the implementation of ERPs in the Yellow River Delta and selects key implementation areas for in-depth analysis to determine the implementation effects of ERPs. Our findings suggested that the RSEI and carbon storage levels in the study area had opposite evolutionary trends from 2001 to 2020. Among them, the RSEI showed a fluctuating upwards trend (0.4461 (2001) and 0.5185 (2020)), while the total carbon stock showed a fluctuating downwards trend (30.67 Tg (2001) and 26.40 Tg (2020)). However, from 2015 to 2020, the RSEI and carbon storage were at a relatively stable level, which indirectly indicated that the ERPs carried out during the period from 2015 to 2020 had achieved a good comprehensive implementation effect. In addition, the areas with better improvement effects from 2015 to 2020 were primarily located in the mouth of the Yellow River Delta (Areas C and D), and their RSEI and the total carbon stock showed a certain upwards trend. This research can promote the formulation of the management strategy of ERPs in the Yellow River Delta, which is of tremendous importance to the ecological environmental preservation and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Genetic Description And Remote Sensing Techniques As Management Tools For Zostera Noltii Seagrass Populations Along The Atlantic Moroccan Coast
JO  - Journal of Coastal Research
PY  - 2017
AB  - Genetic description and remote sensing techniques as management tools for Zostera noltii seagrass populations along the Atlantic Moroccan coast. Seagrass meadows provide an essential ecological service in coastal ecosystems worldwide, although they are sensitive to many human factors, as a serious global regression has been documented. During sampling along the Atlantic Moroccan coast, five coastal lagoons were found characterized by the presence of intertidal monospecific seagrass Zostera noltii meadows (from south to north, Nayla, Oualidia, Sidi Moussa, Moulay Bousselham, and Larache). Two descriptive methods used to characterize Z. noltii populations could be used as management tools for future monitoring implementations: (1) the estimation of surface area covered by Z. noltii meadows using remote sensing techniques and in situ field surveys, and (2) the genetic characterisation of Z. noltii populations using simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) as molecular markers. Results revealed that the Nayla lagoon showed the largest area covered by Z. noltii (269,868 m2) and the highest coverage rate (5.19%), while presenting the lowest genetic/genotypic diversity values (T = 36, Â = 3.58, G = 50; R = 0.544; He = 0.43). On the other hand, northern populations displayed lower rates of seagrass coverage (∼1%) and higher values of genetic/genotypic diversity. Further genetic characterization also revealed that Z. noltii populations seem to be highly isolated in three geographically independent regions: northern Morocco (R1, Larache and Moulay Bousselham), central Morocco (R2, Oualidia and Sidi Moussa), and southern Morocco (R3, Nayla), which should be considered independent management units. Both seagrass coverage rate and the genetic description of seagrass populations along the Atlantic Moroccan coast seem to be useful management tools that could be used to evaluate changes in seagrass meadows over time to further establish appropriate conservation strategies. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2017.

TI  - Joint Optimization Of Hvac And Active Insulation Control Strategies In Residential Buildings
PY  - 2022
AB  - Increasing building construction thermal resistance has been shown to be an effective traditional way of improving building energy efficiency. In this approach, the opaque building envelope is often deemed to be a static system that keeps the indoor environment isolated from the outdoor environment. More recently, active insulation systems (AIS) have been conceptualized to enable active control over building envelope thermal properties, allowing the thermal resistance to be optimally modulated in response to changing environmental conditions. Dynamically tuning the building thermal performance can lead to increased energy savings, reduced operating costs, and reductions in operational carbon emissions. When paired with thermal mass, AIS can also increase building load flexibility for providing demand response and grid services. Building flexibility can further be improved if the building is also equipped with optimized HVAC system controls. In this configuration, the AIS and HVAC systems can be beneficially coordinated to optimally condition the space based on the desired operational objectives. In this work, we quantify the potential benefits of jointly optimizing AIS and HVAC system controls by applying model predictive control to a detailed whole-building energy model. The example building is an all-electric single-family residential building, satisfying IECC 2012, in Baltimore, MD. To highlight the increase in benefits from jointly optimizing HVAC and dynamic envelope systems, we compare the results to the performance achieved when optimizing HVAC and AIS systems individually. Results showed that the combined optimization of HVAC and AIS control was able to achieve 13\% peak demand reduction, while savings 3\% energy. This is in contrast to only a 10\% peak reduction and 16\% increase in energy use for the case with optimized HVAC only. These results ultimately motivate further exploration, integration, and joint optimization of dynamic envelope and HVAC system components.

TI  - Assessment With Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture Products And Ground-Based Observations Over Three Dense Network
JO  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in hydrological processes, bio-ecological processes, and biogeochemical processes. Long-term observations of soil moisture over large areas are critical to research on flooding and drought monitoring, water resource management, and crop yield forecasts. In this paper, Fengyun (FY3B and FY3C) SM products, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) SM products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) AMSR2 L3 SM products, the Version 2 (v2) global land parameter data record (LPDR) of SM products, Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS (CATDS) L3 SM products, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) passive L3 SM products and the European Space Agency(ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM products were evaluated using the ground-based observations in the Little Washita, Fort Cobb and Yanco networks. Long-time series comparison between measured and satellite products was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of FY3 series satellites SM products. Bias (mean bias), R (correlation coefficient), RMSE (root mean square error) and ubRMSE (unbiased root mean square error) were calculated to explore the agreement between satellite products and in-situ measurements. Taylor diagrams were used to compare the performance of various satellite products. The result showed that (1) FY3B, FY3C and LPRM AMSR2 ascending and descending products had an obvious overestimate with in-situ soil moisture in three networks. (2) JAXA AMSR2 ascending and descending products had considerable underestimation in three networks. (3) The validation result of SMOS ascending and descending products over the three networks was satisfactory, with a rather high correlation than other X-band products. (4) The validation result of SMAP ascending and descending products outperformed the other products over the Little Washita and Fort Cobb networks. (5) The ESA CCI product had the lowest values of RMSE and ubRMSE than the other products in the Yanco network, revealing the effectiveness of merging active and passive soil moisture products. (6)The LPDR descending SM products had better performance than the LPDR ascending SM products in the LW and FC networks.

TI  - Spectral Rarefaction: Linking Ecological Variability And Plant Species Diversity
JO  - Community Ecology
PY  - 2008
AB  - Species rarefaction curves have long been used for estimating the expected number of species as a function of sampling effort and they represent a powerful tool for quantifying the diversity of an area from local (α-diversity) to regional scale (β- and γ-diversity). Nonetheless, sampling species based on standard plant inventories represents a cost expensive approach. In this view, remotely sensed information may be straightforwardly used for predicting species rich sites. In this paper, we present spectral rarefaction, i.e., the rarefaction of reflectance values derived from satellite imagery, as an effective manner for predicting bio-diverse sites. We tested this approach in ten biogeographical subregions in Switzerland. Plant species data were derived from the Swiss 'Biodiversity Monitoring' programme (BDM), which represents species richness of Switzerland at the landscape scale by a systematic sample of 520 quadrats of 1 km × 1 km. Seven Landsat ETM+ images covering the whole study area were acquired. Species and spectral rarefaction were built and results were compared by Pearson correlation coefficient considering several sampling efforts (as measured by the number of sampled quadrats). Local α-diversity showed a similar pattern considering the ten biogeographical subregions while β- and γ-diversity showed higher values for regions in the Alpine arc and lower values for plateau regions and Jura mountains on the strength of the higher ecological (and spectral) variability of the former areas. Meanwhile, positive correlations between species and spectral richness values were significant only after a certain amount of area was accumulated, thus indicating a scale dependence of the fit of satellite and species data. With this paper, we introduce spectral rarefaction as an effective tool in quantifying diversity at a range of spatial scales. Obviously, the achieved results should be viewed as an aid to plan field survey rather than to replace it. We propose to use worldwide available remotely sensed information as a driver for field sampling design strategies. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó.

TI  - Study On The Factors Influencing Ecological Environment Quality In Shaanxi Province In The Context Of Rural Revitalization
JO  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
PY  - 2023
AB  - The quality of the ecological environment often determines whether human society can achieve sustainable development or not. It is of practical importance to explore how and to what extent rural development affects the ecological environment to achieve regional rural revitalization and sustainable development. Taking Shaanxi Province as the research object and counties as the research unit, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) for a long time series was used to characterize the spatial and temporal changes and changing trends in ecological environment quality in the province. The factors influencing the quality and spatial differences in the ecological environment were explored with the help of spatial and temporal geographical weighted regression models. The study show that: (1) the overall changing trend of ecological environment quality from 2000 to 2020 was positive, with the RSEI value increasing from 0. 483 3 in 2000 to 0. 651 2 in 2020. The ecological environment quality grades were good and relatively good, with the percentage of areas increasing from 40. 14% to 63.43%, which are concentrated in the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi Province and Yan’an City. (2) The overall trend was a " rapid improvement —— slow change for the better" from 2000 to 2020. The areas with an improved ecological environment are much larger than those with a degraded ecological environment. (3) The influence of the population, land, and industry factors on the ecological environment showed an obvious spatial variability. The main factors that affecting the influence mode were the proportion of forest land area, the proportion of rural settlement area, fertilizer use per unit area, and total mechanical power per unit area. It is suggested that a sub-regional, scientific, and rational rural revitalization policy should be formulated for the future development process to coordinate rural development and the ecological environment in Shaanxi Province. © 2023, China Environmental Science Press.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamics Of Ecosystem Service Value In The Southern Slope Of Qilian Mountain From 2000 To 2015
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2020
AB  - Qilian Mountains are important ecological security harrier and priority area for biodiversity protection in western China, of which the southern slope area is the core area for water conservation services. However, at present, there is still a lack of in-depth understanding of the temporal and spatial distribution and dynamic changes of ecosystem services in this region. This paper used remote sensing technology and ecosystem service theory, and integrated multi-source data products and ecosystem serv ice calculation methods to monitor and evaluate the spatio-temporal variation and dynamics of the values of seven ecosystem service types in the southern slope of Qilian Mountains (SSQM ). The results showed that ( 1 ) in the past 16 years, the average unit area value of ecosystem service on the SSQM was 762700 yuan/km", with a total value of 65.87 billion yuan. The climate regulation, water conservation, and air quality regulation services were the dominant service types. (2) The alpine meadow and alpine steppe had the largest total ecosystem service value (ESV) , while forest and shrubland had the largest service value per unit area. Within the study area, the total ESV of Tianjun County and Qilian County was the largest, while the unit area value in Haiyan County and Gangcha County was the largest. (3) In the past 16 years, the ESV on the southern slope of Qilian Mountains has shown an increasing trend, of which the service value of climate regulation and air quality regulation had the fastest growth rate. The growth areas were mainly concentrated in Qilian County and Tianjun County in the northern part of the research area. (4) The mountain area in the east, the Qinghai lake belt in the south and the wetland area in the center can provide multiple composite ecological service functions and should he taken as the focus of the ecological protection and management. The results can provide the theoretical basis and technical support for establishment of Qilian mountain ecological red line and the construction of national parks. © 2020 Science Press.

TI  - Using Satellite Imagery To Assess Large-Scale Habitat Characteristics Of Adirondack Park, New York, Usa
JO  - Environmental Management
PY  - 2000
AB  - Satellite imagery is a useful tool for large-scale habitat analysis; however, its limitations need to be tested. We tested these limitations by varying the methods of a habitat evaluation for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the Adirondack Park, New York, USA, utilizing harvest data to create and validate the assessment models. We used two classified images, one with a large minimum mapping unit but high accuracy and one with no minimum mapping unit but slightly lower accuracy, to test the sensitivity of the evaluation to these differences. We tested the utility of two methods of assessment, habitat suitability index modeling, and pattern recognition modeling. We varied the scale at which the models were applied by using five separate sizes of analysis windows. Results showed that the presence of a large minimum mapping unit eliminates important details of the habitat. Window size is relatively unimportant if the data are averaged to a large resolution (i.e., township), but if the data are used at the smaller resolution, then the window size is an important consideration. In the Adirondacks, the proportion of hardwood and softwood in an area is most important to the spatial dynamics of deer populations. The low occurrence of open area in all parts of the park either limits the effect of this cover type on the population or limits our ability to detect the effect. The arrangement and interspersion of cover types were not significant to deer populations.; Satellite imagery is a useful tool for large-scale habitat analysis; however, its limitations need to be tested.

The arrangement and interspersion of cover types were not significant to deer populations.; Two classified satellite images were used to assess habitat suitability for deer within the Adirondack Park, NY. The 1990-92 imagery classified through the SUNY Northern Forest Lands Inventory project was utilized, along with the 1991-92 imagery classified by the Cornell University Gap Analysis Project. Each is described briefly. The two classification schemes differed primarily in their use of a minimum mapping unit. Habitat suitability was assessed by two methods: a habitat suitability index model and pattern recognition. Results showed that the overall accuracy of both data sets was relatively high, with the greatest difference in class accuracy between the two images being in the merged open-area class. The pattern-recognition model was able to explain more of the variation in the harvest data and was able to determine which variables had the best predictive ability, but the habitat suitability index model offered better resolution. The management implications of the findings are considered.

TI  - Measuring The Sustainability Of Russia’s Arctic Cities
JO  - Ambio
PY  - 2021
AB  - How sustainable are Russia’s Arctic cities? Russia’s far north metropolises are distinctive from other Arctic cities in terms of their large size, efforts to conquer nature, and big business’ impact on the urban landscape. The Russian Arctic cities’ Soviet-era design gave them compact and dense population structures. Such features led to many benefits for achieving sustainability, including more efficient energy use, a larger number of hospital beds, more numerous cultural amenities, and greater access to public transportation. However, Arctic cities outside of Russia have made progress in their own pursuit of sustainability through on-going investments, business development, educational resources, and solid waste management. By teasing out these distinctions, this article highlights urban features that make it possible for the cities to adapt to changes in the global environment and economy. In doing so, it provides the first multidisciplinary, comparative analysis of 46 Arctic cities employing historical, remote sensing, and quantitative methods. It demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the world’s Arctic cities in their quest for sustainability and points to where they can learn from each other in adopting best practices. © 2020, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Effect Of Image Radiometric Correction Levels Of Landsat Images To The Land Cover Maps Resulted From Maximum Likelihood Classification
JO  - E3S Web of Conferences
PY  - 2020
AB  - Radiometric correction of remote sensing images is required to improve the quality of image pixel values and provide a measurable physical unit of each pixel. Selection of the appropriate image radiometric and atmospheric correction level defines the success of any remote sensing-based mapping applications. This study aims to assess the effects of radiometric correction levels applied to Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager, OLI) image acquired in 2018 to the results of the land cover classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The image was corrected into four levels of radiometric and atmospheric correction; no correction (digital number), at-sensor radiance, at-sensor reflectance (top of atmosphere, ToA), and at-surface reflectance (bottom of atmosphere, BoA). A set of classification training sample covering five land cover classes (mangroves, inland vegetation, exposed soil, built-up area, and water body) was selected from the image. To ensure fair class comparison, the number of training sample were set to be proportional to the area of targeted classes. The results of this study show that there is no difference in the classification results of each level of correction, both in the area and distribution of the classes. This finding indicates that MLC result is invariable of image correction level. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Bridging The Data Gap Between The Grace Missions And Assessment Of Groundwater Storage Variations For Telangana State, India
JO  - WATER
PY  - 2022
AB  - Because of changing climatic conditions, uneven distribution of rainfall occurs throughout India. As a result, dependence on groundwater for irrigation has increased tremendously for industrial and domestic purposes. In India approximately 89\% of agricultural demands are met through groundwater. Due to increases in population, demand for groundwater and lack of effective utilization have resulted in rapid depletion of groundwater in most parts of the country. Therefore, quantifying groundwater resources is a serious concern in populated states of India, because it is now difficult to supply enough water to every citizen, and will remain so in the future. Because of difficulties in accessing observation data, researchers have begun to depend on satellite-based remote sensing information to deal with groundwater variations. The present study deals with filling the data gap between Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE FO) missions using multilayer perceptron's (MLPs) during 2017-2018 to obtain a continuous terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) series from 2003 to 2020 for Telangana state, India. The MLP model performed well in predicting the TWSA, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.96 between modeled TWSA and GRACE TWSA during the test period. Telangana state observed negative TWSAs (annual) in the years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2016-19. This TWSA series (2003-2020) was then used to evaluate regional groundwater storage anomalies (GWSAs) in Telangana state, which is considered to be one of the water stress regions in India. The TWSAs were converted to GWSAs using Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) parameters. The Telangana state experienced decreasing GWSA in the years 2005, 2009, and 2012, and from 2015 to 2019, leading to severe droughts. Groundwater well measurements were obtained from the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) and converted to GWSA at a seasonal scale. The GWSAs obtained from GRACE (GWSA(GRACE)) were converted to seasonal values and compared with GWSAs obtained from observation well data (GWSA(obs)). The performance metrics of r = 0.74, RMSE = 5.3, and NSE = 0.62 were obtained between (GWSA(GRACE)) and (GWSA(obs)), representing a good correlation among them. Over the past decade, Telangana state has significantly relied on groundwater resources for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes. As a result, evaluating groundwater storage variations at a regional scale may help policy makers and water resource researchers in the sustainable utilization and management of groundwater resources.

TI  - Breeding Loggerhead Marine Turtles Caretta Caretta In Dry Tortugas National Park, Usa, Show High Fidelity To Diverse Habitats Near Nesting Beaches
JO  - ORYX
PY  - 2016
AB  - We used satellite telemetry to identify in-water habitat used by individuals in the smallest North-west Atlantic subpopulation of adult nesting loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta during the breeding season. During 2010, 2011 and 2012 breeding periods, a total of 20 adult females used habitats proximal to nesting beaches with various levels of protection within Dry Tortugas National Park. We then used a rapid, high-resolution, digital imaging system to map habitat adjacent to nesting beaches, revealing the diversity and distribution of available benthic cover. Turtle behaviour showing measurable site-fidelity to these diverse habitats has implications for managing protected areas and human activities within them. Protecting diverse benthic areas adjacent to loggerhead turtle nesting beaches here and elsewhere could provide benefits for overall biodiversity conservation. © Fauna & Flora International 2014.

TI  - Mapping And Assessment Of Pm<Sub>10</Sub> And O<Sub>3</Sub> Removal By Woody Vegetation At Urban And Regional Level
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study is the follow up of the URBAN-MAES pilot implemented in the framework of the EnRoute project. The study aims at mapping and assessing the process of particulate matter (PM10) and tropospheric ozone (O-3) removal by various forest and shrub ecosystems. Different policy levels and environmental contexts were considered, namely the Metropolitan city of Rome and, at a wider level, the Latium region. The approach involves characterization of the main land cover and ecosystems using Sentinel-2 images, enabling a detailed assessment of Ecosystem Service (ES), and monetary valuation based on externality values. The results showed spatial variations in the pattern of PM10 and O-3 removal inside the Municipality and in the more rural Latium hinterland, reflecting the spatial dynamics of the two pollutants. Evergreen species displayed higher PM10 removal efficiency, whereas deciduous species showed higher O-3 absorption in both rural and urban areas. The overall pollution removal accounted for 5123 and 19,074 Mg of PM10 and O-3, respectively, with a relative monetary benefit of 161 and 149 Million Euro for PM10 and O-3, respectively. Our results provide spatially explicit evidence that may assist policymakers in land-oriented decisions towards improving Green Infrastructure and maximizing ES provision at different governance levels.

TI  - Application Of Landsat Tm Satellite Imagery To Map Geothermal Resources And Land Cover: Case Study Of Silali Prospect
JO  - Transactions - Geothermal Resources Council
PY  - 2011
AB  - Geothermal energy is a clean and renewable energy source which if harnessed can contribute to the Socio-economic growth of Kenya to achieve the power demand envisioned in 'Vision 2030'. The initial investment in geothermal exploration is expensive, time consuming and tiresome venture which requires alot of time, resources and manpower to achieve the targeted results. To reduce time spent during exploration, proper base maps or base data is required to lessen the workload. Various basemaps like topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite images are used for baseline data to guide during exploration. Most of the basemaps give topographical information which is not detailed and upto date enough to assist in providing detailed data interpretation during resource exploration. Classified satellite images come in handy during geothermal exploration surveys since the geoscientists will be equiped with preliminary data which acts as a guide and also gives them a clue of the results to expect during the exploration. With proper image classification, the field exercise can act as a validation process hence reduce the time spent for field work. Satellite image classification is specifically usefull to Geologists since rock types can be determined based on the reflectance characteristics of the rocks. Environmentalists can also benefit from satellite image classification to determine the landuse and landcover of a given area based on the spectral properties of the features. Landsat multispectral image use in geothermal exploration, and to classify the landcover and landuse in Silali geothermal prospect and two image classification methods will be discussed in this paper.

TI  - A Quantitative Framework For Analysing Long Term Spatial Clustering And Vegetation Fragmentation In An Urban Landscape Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rapid urbanization threatens urban green spaces and vegetation, demonstrated by a decrease in connectivity and higher levels of fragmentation. Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been sufficiently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994-2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by significantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p < 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city. This suggest that with increasing vegetation fragmentation, small and isolated vegetation patches do not spatially cluster but are dispersed geographically. The findings of the study underline the potential of LISA measures as a valuable spatially explicit method for the assessment of spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban vegetation patterns.

TI  - Spatially Explicit Experiments For The Exploration Of Land-Use Decision-Making Dynamics
JO  - International Journal of Geographical Information Science
PY  - 2006
AB  - We explore the special outcomes of decision-making through two laboratory-based experiments, one with a homogenous land suitability surface and another with a heterogeneous suitability surface. Subjects make resource allocation decisions on an abstract landscape and are given a monetary incentive to maximize their revenue during the experiment. These experimental results are compared with simulation output from an agent-based model run on the same abstract landscape that uses a utility-maximizing agent. The main findings are: (1) landscapes produced by subjects result in greater patchiness and more edge than the utility-maximization agent predicts; (2) there is considerable diversity in the decisions subjects make despite the relatively simple decision-making context; and (3) there is greater deviation of subject revenue from the maximum potential revenue in early rounds of the experiment compared with later rounds, demonstrating the challenge of making optimal decisions with little historical context. The findings demonstrate the value of using non-maximizing agents in agent-based models of land-cover change and the importance of acknowledging actor heterogeneity in land-change systems.

TI  - Getting Ready For Redd+ In Tanzania: A Case Study Of Progress And Challenges
JO  - ORYX
PY  - 2010
AB  - The proposed mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) offers significant potential for conserving forests to reduce negative impacts of climate change. Tanzania is one of nine pilot countries for the United Nations REDD Programme, receives significant funding from the Norwegian, Finnish and German governments and is a participant in the World Banks Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. In combination, these interventions aim to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, provide an income to rural communities and conserve biodiversity. The establishment of the UN-REDD Programme in Tanzania illustrates real-world challenges in a developing country. These include currently inadequate baseline forestry data sets (needed to calculate reference emission levels), inadequate government capacity and insufficient experience of implementing REDD+-type measures at operational levels. Additionally, for REDD+ to succeed, current users of forest resources must adopt new practices, including the equitable sharing of benefits that accrue from REDD+ implementation. These challenges are being addressed by combined donor support to implement a national forest inventory, remote sensing of forest cover, enhanced capacity for measuring, reporting and verification, and pilot projects to test REDD+ implementation linked to the existing Participatory Forest Management Programme. Our conclusion is that even in a country with considerable donor support, progressive forest policies, laws and regulations, an extensive network of managed forests and increasingly developed locally-based forest management approaches, implementing REDD+ presents many challenges. These are being met by coordinated, genuine partnerships between government, non-government and community-based agencies. © 2010 Fauna & Flora International.

TI  - Mobile Support Center Provides Cost-Effective Alternative To Dedicated Facility
JO  - Proceedings - SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition
PY  - 2007
AB  - Drilling operators worldwide face increasingly complex and costly drilling challenges. In addition to difficult and sometimes harsh downhole environments, the driller is also faced with a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of information available to optimize recovery. In many of these situations, there is little or no room for error and the cost of nonproductive time (NPT) due to a poor or less informed decision can significantly increase the final cost per barrel to the consumer. Advances in cost-effective satellite communication and the application of compression technology have removed the bandwidth limitation, and Internet transfer of continuous high-volume real-time data between the offshore installation and shore-based operations is almost seamless. With the current shortage of skilled personnel, most major oil and gas companies are exploring remote Operation Support Centers to support their real-time E&P business processes. With a combination of infrastructure, technology, services and processes, these support centers are consolidating their expertise in a collaborative environment so that informed real-time decisions can be made to improve drilling processes and reduce costs. The economic justification to management and partners for investing and building support centers is clear, but it is necessary to scale the effort and capital expenditure for support centers to each specific drilling operation. This paper describes the concept of low-cost remote support centers that have been used successfully in the Gulf of Mexico, and land drilling projects on the Alaska North Slope and in northern Mexico. A successful support center must quickly turn real-time data into useful information displayed with minimum latency in a format benefiting decision makers. This depends on the skill and experience of each participating engineer and the quality of the software answer products in this surveillanceenvironment. This paper describes advanced real-time software answer products that take raw drilling data and filter it into different rig states, automatically generating logical outputs.

TI  - Measurement And Modeling Of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (Brdf) On Material Surface
JO  - MEASUREMENT
PY  - 2013
AB  - Measurement and modeling of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is made to describe optical scattering characteristics of the material surface. A measurement device of BRDF with the ability to real-time measurement is developed by the micro fiber spectrometer and three-dimensional turntables. The measured spectral range is from visible to near infrared with 2.4 nm wavelength resolution. The measured angular range is 0-360 degrees in azimuth angle and 0-85 degrees in zenith angle with 0.01 degrees angle resolution. BRDF measurement on tinfoil and ceramic tile is made and the measurement error is no more than 6.05\%. A six-parameter model of BRDF is built according to material surface characteristics. Based on the simulated annealing algorithm, the model parameters of BRDF are obtained through fitting processing of measured data and the maximal fitting error is 9.94\%. The results show that the measuring accuracy of BRDF depends on the precision of measuring platform, the sensitivity of measuring instrument and the stability of illuminating light source, and the modeling accuracy of BRDF is closely related to the measured data and optimization modeling method. The measurement and modeling of BRDF may benefit future optical remote sensing, computer graphics and environmental surveillance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Epibionts Reflect Spatial And Foraging Ecology Of Gulf Of Mexico Loggerhead Turtles (<I>Caretta Caretta</I>)
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2021
AB  - Sea turtles are exposed to numerous threats during migrations to their foraging grounds and at those locations. Therefore, information on sea turtle foraging and spatial ecology can guide conservation initiatives, yet it is difficult to directly observe migrating or foraging turtles. To gain insights into the foraging and spatial ecology of turtles, studies have increasingly analyzed epibionts of nesting turtles, as epibionts must overlap spatially and ecologically with their hosts to colonize successfully. Epibiont analysis may be integrated with stable isotope information to identify taxa that can serve as indicators of sea turtle foraging and spatial ecology, but few studies have pursued this. To determine if epibionts can serve as indicators of foraging and spatial ecology of loggerhead turtles nesting in the northern Gulf of Mexico we combined turtle stable isotope and taxonomic epibiont analysis. We sampled 22 individual turtles and identified over 120,000 epibiont individuals, belonging to 34 macrofauna taxa (>1 mm) and 22 meiofauna taxa (63 mu m-1 mm), including 111 nematode genera. We quantified epidermis delta C-13 and delta N-15, and used these to assign loggerhead turtles to broad foraging regions. The abundance and presence of macrofauna and nematodes did not differ between inferred foraging regions, but the presence of select meiofauna taxa differentiated between three inferred foraging regions. Further, dissimilarities in macrofauna, meiofauna, and nematode assemblages corresponded to dissimilarities in individual stable isotope values within inferred foraging regions. This suggests that certain epibiont taxa may be indicative of foraging regions used by loggerhead turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, and of individual turtle foraging and habitat use specialization within foraging regions. Continued sampling of epibionts at nesting beaches and foraging grounds in the Gulf of Mexico and globally, coupled with satellite telemetry and/or dietary studies, can expand upon our findings to develop epibionts as efficient indicators of sea turtle foraging and spatial ecology.

TI  - Predicting Pm10 Concentrations Using Evolutionary Deep Neural Network And Satellite-Derived Aerosol Optical Depth
JO  - Mathematics
PY  - 2023
AB  - Predicting particulate matter with a diameter of 10 μm (PM10) is crucial due to its impact on human health and the environment. Today, aerosol optical depth (AOD) offers high resolution and wide coverage, making it a viable way to estimate PM concentrations. Recent years have also witnessed in-creasing promise in refining air quality predictions via deep neural network (DNN) models, out-performing other techniques. However, learning the weights and biases of the DNN is a task classified as an NP-hard problem. Current approaches such as gradient-based methods exhibit significant limitations, such as the risk of becoming ensnared in local minimal within multi-objective loss functions, substantial computational requirements, and the requirement for continuous objective functions. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines the binary gray wolf optimizer (BGWO) with DNN to improve the optimization of models for air pollution prediction. The BGWO algorithm, inspired by the behavior of gray wolves, is used to optimize both the weight and bias of the DNN. In the proposed BGWO, a novel sigmoid function is proposed as a transfer function to adjust the position of the wolves. This study gathers meteorological data, topographic information, PM10 pollution data, and satellite images. Data preparation includes tasks such as noise removal and handling missing data. The proposed approach is evaluated through cross-validation using metrics such as correlation rate, R square, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and accuracy. The effectiveness of the BGWO-DNN framework is compared to seven other machine learning (ML) models. The experimental evaluation of the BGWO-DNN method using air pollution data shows its superior performance compared with traditional ML techniques. The BGWO-DNN, CapSA-DNN, and BBO-DNN models achieved the lowest RMSE values of 16.28, 19.26, and 20.74, respectively. Conversely, the SVM-Linear and GBM algorithms displayed the highest levels of error, yielding RMSE values of 36.82 and 32.50, respectively. The BGWO-DNN algorithm secured the highest R2 (88.21%) and accuracy (93.17%) values, signifying its superior performance compared with other models. Additionally, the correlation between predicted and actual values shows that the proposed model surpasses the performance of other ML techniques. This paper also observes relatively stable pollution levels during spring and summer, contrasting with significant fluctuations during autumn and winter. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Forewarned Is Forearmed: Harmonized Approaches For Early Detection Of Potentially Invasive Pests And Pathogens In Sentinel Plantings
JO  - NeoBiota
PY  - 2019
AB  - The number of invasive alien pest and pathogen species affecting ecosystem functioning, human health and economies has increased dramatically over the last decades. Discoveries of invasive pests and pathogens previously unknown to science or with unknown host associations yet damaging on novel hosts highlights the necessity of developing novel tools to predict their appearance in hitherto naïve environments. The use of sentinel plant systems is a promising tool to improve the detection of pests and pathogens before introduction and to provide valuable information for the development of preventative measures to minimize economic or environmental impacts. Though sentinel plantings have been established and studied during the last decade, there still remains a great need for guidance on which tools and protocols to put into practice in order to make assessments accurate and reliable. The sampling and diagnostic protocols chosen should enable as much information as possible about potential damaging agents and species identification. Consistency and comparison of results are based on the adoption of common procedures for sampling design and sample processing. In this paper, we suggest harmonized procedures that should be used in sentinel planting surveys for effective sampling and identification of potential pests and pathogens. We also review the benefits and limitations of various diagnostic methods for early detection in sentinel systems, and the feasibility of the results obtained supporting National Plant Protection Organizations in pest and commodity risk analysis. © Carmen Morales-Rodríguez et al.

TI  - Remote Continuous Glucose Monitoring During The Covid-19 Pandemic In Quarantined Hospitalized Patients In Denmark: A Structured Summary Of A Study Protocol For A Randomized Controlled Trial
JO  - Trials
PY  - 2020
AB  - Objectives: Patients with diabetes are - compared to people without diabetes - at increased risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 related pneumonia during hospitalization. We aim to investigate whether telemetric continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in quarantined hospitalized patients with diabetes and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or another contagious infection can be successfully implemented and is associated with better glycaemic control than usual blood glucose monitoring (finger prick method) and fewer patient-health care worker contacts. Furthermore, we will assess whether glucose variables are associated with the clinical outcome. The hypothesis is that by using remote CGM to monitor glucose levels of COVID-19 infected patients and patients with other contagious infections with diabetes, we can still provide satisfactory (and maybe even better) in-hospital diabetes management despite patients being quarantined. Furthermore, the number of patient-personnel contacts can be lowered compared to standard monitoring with finger-prick glucose. This could potentially reduce the risk of transmitting contagious diseases from the patient to other people and reduces the use of PPE’s. Improved glucose control may reduce the increased risk of poor clinical outcomes associated with combined diabetes and infection. Trial Design: This is a single centre, open label, exploratory, randomised, controlled, 2-arm parallel group (1:1 ratio), controlled trial. Participants: The trial population is patients with diabetes (both type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, newly discovered diabetes that is not classified yet, and all other forms of diabetes) admitted to Nordsjællands Hospital that are quarantined due to COVID-19 infection or another infection. Inclusion criteria: 1. Hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection by real-time PCR or another validated method OR hospitalized with a non-COVID-19 diagnosis and quarantined at time of inclusion. 2. A documented clinically relevant history of diabetes or newly discovered during hospitalization as defined by The World Health Organizations diagnostic criteria for diabetes. 3. Written informed consent obtained before any trial related procedures are performed. 4. Male or female aged over 18 years of age. 5. Must be able to communicate with the study personnel. 6. The subject must be willing and able to comply with trial protocol. Exclusion criteria: 1. Known hypersensitivity to the band-aid of the Dexcom G6 sensors Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomized to either real-time CGM with the Dexcom G6, a CGM system that does not need to be calibrated, or finger-prick glucose monitoring. Blinded CGM will be mounted in the finger-prick group. In the open CGM group, the glucose values will be transmitted to a Smartdevice in the nurse office where glucose levels can be monitored remotely. Main Outcomes: The primary endpoint is the difference between groups in distribution of glucose values being in time in range (TIR), defined as 3.9 to 10 mmol/l. In addition, the primary endpoint is reported as the percentage of days of the whole admission, the patient reaches TIR. Secondary endpoints are the estimated number of saved patient-personnel contacts related to blood glucose measurements, incl. time healthcare providers spent on diabetes related tasks and PPE related tasks, during the patients’ hospitalization. Furthermore, we will assess additional glucose outcomes and associations of glucose variables and patient outcomes (As specified in the protocol). Randomisation: The service used for generating the randomization lists is www.random.org. Randomization is stratified by COVID-19 status and an allocation ratio of 1:1 to either CGM or finger-prick groups. Blinding (Masking): The design of the trial is open, however blinded CGM is recorded in the finger-prick group. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): A sample size of N=72 is required for the primary endpoint analysis based on 80% power to detect a 10% difference between groups in TIR and to allow for a 15% dropout. The 7 participants will be randomized 1:1 to open CGM or finger-prick with 36 in each group. Trial status: This structured protocol summary is based on the CGM-ISO protocol version 1.3, dated 13.05.2020. Date of first patient enrolled: 25.05.2020. Expected last recruiting is May 2021. Patients enrolled to date: 20 in total. 8 with confirmed COVID-19 infection and 12 with other infections. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04430608. Registered 12.06.2020 Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file from the Trial website (Additional file 1).

TI  - Defining A Us Architecture For Environmental Monitoring From Space
JO  - AIAA Space 2009 Conference and Exposition
PY  - 2009
AB  - The U.S. lacks a coherent integrated architecture, organization, and strategy for planning capabilities and investments in space-based environmental monitoring. In order to clarify the underlying problem, this paper contributes a new way to conceptualize the capability development process in terms of a two dimensional value stream - within project development and between project developments. Using this framework, the nature of the observed inconsistent service delivery - often attributed to a "gap" in the research to operations handoff - is investigated through an analysis of several historical projects. It is found that the issues are deeper than "poor coordination;" further, that programs do not progress, as expected, from research to operations. Even when the progression is expanded to separate science maturity from technology maturity, many programs experience maturity cycles as major new generations are initiated. By way of solution, four architectural alternatives are proposed and evaluated. However, until a coordinated vision for remote sensing is agreed to, taking steps to refine alter or clarify agency roles may be of limited value.

TI  - Non-Uniform Vertical Nitrogen Distribution Within Plant Canopy And Its Estimation By Remote Sensing: A Review
JO  - Field Crops Research
PY  - 2013
AB  - Crop growth and production are dependent not only on the amount of total nitrogen (N) absorbed by plants, but also on the vertical leaf N distribution within canopies. The non-uniform leaf N distribution has been reported for various plant canopies. Remote sensing has been widely used for determination of crop N status, but such analysis seldom takes N distribution into consideration, ultimately leading to limited accuracy and decreased practical value of the related results. This paper has reviewed the results of previous studies that investigated the ecophysiological aspects of non-uniform N distribution, and the remote sensing methods that have been proposed to monitor this phenomenon. Additionally, this study used field data to analyze the differences in leaf N distribution in wheat canopies with different plant types (i.e. spread type, semi-spread type, and erect type), and provided insights into the estimation of vertical leaf N distribution by means of remote sensing.The process of reviewing research related to the ecophysiological issues of leaf N distribution led to identification of several important inadequacies in the current body of research. We propose that future work should aim to strengthen an understanding of the dynamic response of vertical N distribution within canopies to the various related environment factors and field management strategies. When a more thorough understanding of vertical N distribution is achieved, researchers will be able to improve related quantitative modeling, and may be able to comprehensively reveal the effect of vertical N distribution on canopy photosynthesis performances. In addition, through a comparison of the leaf N profiles of spread, semi-spread, and erect wheat canopies, it was found here that the semi-spread wheat canopy had a more non-uniform N distribution than did the other two types, despite all types having large and full vegetation coverage at the booting stage.Regarding detection of leaf N distribution using remote sensing, the few existing studies can be grouped into three classes according to the hyperspectral data used. One class employed the spectral data obtained from top-view observations; another class used multi-angle canopy reflectance data, while the third mainly focused on the relationships between spectral reflectance and fluorescence characteristics and the leaf N or chlorophyll content for different vertical layers. Despite important progress having been made, the results of the studies and the methods therein face key limitations in practical application. The present paper suggests two possibilities for the estimation of vertical leaf N distribution with remote sensing. One possibility is based upon hyperspectral imaging, and the other possibility combines a vertical N distribution model and canopy reflectance data. The former method requires investigation of the ability of hyperspectral imaging to obtain pure spectral information of different vertical leaf layers. The latter method requires that the key determinants of vertical N distribution be identified to improve quantitative modeling, and that the parameters of the N distribution model be determined from remotely sensed data. Because of the current lack of adequate data, a concrete case study and a very thorough test analysis could not be presented here. But it is still hoped that this work can provide helpful information for future studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2014
AB  - Integrated Multi-mission Ground Segment for Earth Observation Satellites (IMGEOS) was established with an objective to eliminate human interaction to the maximum extent. All emergency data products will be delivered within an hour of acquisition through FTP delivery. All other standard data products will be delivered through FTP within a day. The IMGEOS activity was envisaged to reengineer the entire chain of operations at the ground segment facilities of NRSC at Shadnagar and Balanagar campuses to adopt an integrated multi-mission approach. To achieve this, the Information Technology Infrastructure was consolidated by implementing virtualized tiered storage and network computing infrastructure in a newly built Data Centre at Shadnagar Campus. One important activity that influences all other activities in the integrated multi-mission approach is the design of appropriate storage and network architecture for realizing all the envisaged operations in a highly streamlined, reliable and secure environment. Storage was consolidated based on the major factors like accessibility, long term data protection, availability, manageability and scalability. The broad operational activities are reception of satellite data, quick look, generation of browse, production of standard and valueadded data products, production chain management, data quality evaluation, quality control and product dissemination. For each of these activities, there are numerous other detailed sub-activities and pre-requisite tasks that need to be implemented to support the above operations. The IMGEOS architecture has taken care of choosing the right technology for the given data sizes, their movement and long-term lossless retention policies. Operational costs of the solution are kept to the minimum possible. Scalability of the solution is also ensured. The main function of the storage is to receive and store the acquired satellite data, facilitate high speed availability of the data for further processing at Data Processing servers and help to generate data products at a rate of about 1000 products per day. It also archives all the acquired data on tape storage for long-term retention and utilization. Data sizes per satellite pass range from hundreds of megabytes to tens of gigabytes The images acquired from remote sensing satellites are valuable assets of NRSC and are used as input for further generation of different types of user data products through multiple Data Processing systems. Hence, it is required to collect and store the data within a shared, high speed repository concurrently accessible by multiple systems. After the raw imagery is stored on a high-speed repository, the images must be processed in order for them to be useful for value-added processing or for imagery analysts. The raw image file has to be copied on to data processing servers for further processing. Given the large file sizes, it is impractical to transfer these files to processing servers via a local area network. Even at gigabit Ethernet rates (up to 60MB/s), a 5GB file will take at least 83 seconds. For this reason, it is useful to employ a shared file system which allows every processing system to directly access the same pool where raw images were stored. Concurrent access by multiple systems is ensured for processing and generation of data products. With the above reasons, it was chosen to have high speed disk arrays for acquisition and processing purposes and tape based storage systems for long-term huge data (Peta Bytes) archival in a virtualized multitier storage architecture. This paper explains the architecture involved in a virtualized tiered storage environment being used for acquisition, processing and archiving the remote sensing data. It also explains the data management aspects involved in ensuring data availability and archiving Peta bytes sized, remote sensing data acquired over the past 40 years.

TI  - Wetland Landscape Spatio-Temporal Degradation Dynamics Using The New Google Earth Engine Cloud-Based Platform: Opportunities For Non-Specialists In Remote Sensing
JO  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
PY  - 2016
AB  - The complex nature of coupled human-natural systems often hinders the identification of forces and mechanisms causing observed environmental changes. The analysis of long-term time series can allow better understanding of those interactions and hence inform more adapted restoration and management programs. However, long-term time series of ground-measured vegetation variables are often not readily available due to the tediousness of the work and the financial and time investment required, especially for large-scale wetland systems. Remote sensing can help overcome this issue by providing more than 40 years of Earth cover images, but until recently the processing and analysis of these images was restricted to experts in remote sensing. The new Google Earth Engine (GEE) opens the remote sensing information mine to engineers or scientists without advanced knowledge in the field, including easy access to petabytes of publicly available remote sensing data and their spatial analysis in the cloud. To illustrate its capabilities, we used GEE to generate time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the human-impacted Tempisque watershed with its severely degraded downstream Palo Verde wetland in northwest Costa Rica. We detail the processing and analysis steps to facilitate replication to any other case study. After defining the boundary of a study area, any user can generate a list and a video of the Landsat and MODIS images available for the area, NDVI maps, and a time series of the NDVI values spatially aggregated over the study area or a set of previously delineated polygons. One of the challenges we address is discriminating between the multitude of image collections available in the GEE catalog for vegetation mapping. We evaluate and compare the results obtained from five selected Landsat and MODIS image collections and identify the collections that give the best quality results for our case study. We conclude that MODIS is more appropriate for this tropical region because of the higher temporal resolution and hence higher probability to record cloud-free images. NDVI time series from Landsat images demonstrate a significant number of missing values. Landsat maps of NDVI suggest that the entire watershed and protected wetland witnessed an overall increase in vegetation greenness and hence cover since 1986, matching the abandonment of cattle ranching and the known degradation of the wetland by cattail invasion. Within-season vegetation variability can be tracked using MODIS images despite their coarser spatial resolution, showing high variability linked to precipitation patterns in this region. This GEE application illustrates new opportunities for biosystems engineers and other scientists to integrate historical vegetation and land cover data into comprehensive datasets to understand human impacts on ecosystems, and provides the guidance to do so.

TI  - Decommissioning Planning For The Kinsale Head Gas Field, Offshore Ireland
JO  - Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Symposium: Decommissioning and Abandonment 2019
PY  - 2020
AB  - The Kinsale Head gas field offshore Ireland was discovered in 1971 and bought on stream in 1978. After 40 years of continuous gas production, a detailed plan for decommissioning of the field facilities is now being implemented. Kinsale Head and a number of satellite gas fields, all operated by PETRONAS subsidiary PSE Kinsale Energy Limited, are the only producing facilities in the North Celtic Sea Basin, off the south coast of Ireland. The facilities include two fixed platforms, 10 subsea wells and extensive subsea infrastructure including 150 km of subsea pipelines and 80 km of subsea umbilicals, as well as an onshore reception terminal. Careful and innovative field management has extended the producing life from an originally estimated 20 years to over 42 years at time of Cessation of Production forecast to occur in 2020. The paper describes some of the methods used to prolong field operating life. Planning for decommissioning commenced in 2015-2016 and the paper describes the engineering and regulatory planning process followed. As this is the first-offshore field to be decommissioned in Ireland, extensive and detailed engagement with the regulatory authorities was undertaken prior to the submission of the decommissioning plan in 2018. The paper demonstrates how a systematic and logical approach to both the regulatory approval process and the physical execution plan helps to de-risk the project. In particular, a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process was followed to underpin the selected strategy and to demonstrate a 'best-in-class' approach to the decommissioning program. As part of the EIA process, a number of analytical techniques were used including Net Environmental Benefits Analysis (NEBA) and Comparative Assessment (CA); this is believed to be the first time these techniques were used for offshore projects in Ireland. © Copyright 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Assessing Spatial Variation In Algal Productivity In A Tropical River Floodplain Using Satellite Remote Sensing
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Studies of tropical floodplains have shown that algae are the primary source material for higher consumers in freshwater aquatic habitats. Thus, methods that can predict the spatial variation of algal productivity provide an important input to better inform management and conservation of floodplains. In this study, a prediction of the spatial variability in algal productivity was made for the Mitchell River floodplain in northern Australia. The spatial variation of aquatic habitat types and turbidity were estimated using satellite remote sensing and then combined with statistical modelling to map the spatial variation in algal primary productivity. Open water and submerged plants habitats, covering 79\% of the freshwater flooded floodplain extent, had higher rates of algal production compared to the 21\% cover of emergent and floating aquatic plant habitats. Across the floodplain, the predicted average algal productivity was 150.9 +/- 95.47 SD mg C m(-2) d(-1) and the total daily algal production was estimated to be 85.02 +/- 0.07 SD ton C. This study provides a spatially explicit representation of habitat types, turbidity, and algal productivity on a tropical floodplain and presents an approach to map 'hotspots' of algal production and provide key insights into the functioning of complex floodplain-river ecosystems. As this approach uses satellite remotely sensed data, it can be applied in different floodplains worldwide to identify areas of high ecological value that may be sensitive to development and be used by decision makers and river managers to protect these important ecological assets.

TI  - The "Carta Della Natura" Mapping Project In The Supramonte Area (Central-East Sardinia)
JO  - ANNALI DI BOTANICA
PY  - 2008
AB  - Since 1991, the Italian framework law on protected areas, has been calling for the editing of a national Nature Map, an instrument for the assessment of the state of the environment in Italy. The methodology applied in Sardinia is comparable with those applied in the other regions of Italy, with the necessary modifications, generalizations and integrations. Satellite imagery represents the fundamental informative layer to provide a synoptic view of the whole territory. In a second proceeding step, supervised classification is thematically enhanced by using logical niche models of species and habitats derived from assessed relationships between species-habitats known distributions patterns and available predictors, i.e. GIS thematic layers. This has resulted in the production of a habitat map with 24 habitat and land use classes. The environmental assessment procedure delivered four maps, the ecological value, the environmental sensitivity, the anthropic pressure and the land vulnerability (fragility). A reduction from 70 to 24 habitat/land use types, is coherent with the aims of the projects and planned deliverables. These 24 classes have been detected with semi-automatic procedures and with a high level of reliability. It is a reasonable compromise between thematic resolution and the possibility to record a synoptic view of the whole land in an acceptable lap of time. Various stakeholders will benefit from knowing the current condition of habitats distribution. Described deliverables are powerful tools for monitoring at regional level future land-use and habitat changes on a solid quantitative basis, for environmental conservation and habitat management.

TI  - Simultaneous Multi-Sensor Data For Global Information Management System
PY  - 2008
AB  - An international consortium of specialists from the Netherlands, Russia, Bulgaria, United States and Australia has developed and demonstrated a new airborne multi-sensor system that is ready for implementation in environmental remote sensing. The airborne multi-sensor system consists of several cameras and produces (underground) soil moisture data, ground temperature data, digital elevation models, and high resolution orthophotos. All sensors are mounted on board one single light aircraft and are operated simultaneously to produce a wide range of critical information at a time that is then processed into an Information Monitoring System (IMS). The international team has demonstrated the benefits of the system in a show case project in Bulgaria in the summer of 2007, and the results are presented in this paper.

TI  - Method Of Optimizing The Costs Of A Satellite Network In Ka And Q/V Bands In The Feeder Link
JO  - 35th AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference, ICSSC 2017
PY  - 2017
AB  - The importance of implementing the use of the Ka and Q/V bands in the Feeder Link lies in the saturation that exists in other frequency bands. The new generation of HTS/VHTS satellites operates based on multibeam coverage; one of the main advantages of the HTS/VHTS satellites is the reduction of the cost of available satellite capacity. The method proposed in this paper for the optimization of the costs of a HTS satellite network focuses on the analysis of the forward link depending on the number of beams used and the G/T ratio of the user station. The methodology presented in this paper achieves the optimal trade-off solution for the highest capacity achievable according to a set of technical and cost requirements and constraints for different scenarios. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

TI  - Importance Of Color For Artificial Clay Caterpillars As Sentinel Prey In Maize, Soybean, And Prairie
JO  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
PY  - 2023
AB  - The use of artificial clay caterpillars to measure predation pressure under real field conditions is one method that has garnered recent support for quantifying ecosystem services that beneficial insects provide. Here, we focus on color and ask whether it is an important variable that should be considered in studies using clay caterpillars as sentinel prey. We deployed a total of 1920 brown, cream, green, gray, terracotta, and white clay caterpillars onto maize, soybean, and prairie plants to test if lighter colored caterpillars will be attacked and retrieved more than caterpillars with darker colors. As hypothesized, color was a significant predictor with green and terracotta caterpillars performing best, whereas brown and gray caterpillars performed the worst. Interestingly, clay caterpillars were also attacked proportionally to the number of insects in the surrounding habitat. Combined, we suggest artificial clay caterpillars could be useful for rapid ecosystem function assessments, but only when their color is considered.

TI  - Integrating Multi-Sensors Data For Species Distribution Mapping Using Deep Learning And Envelope Models
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - The integration of ecological and atmospheric characteristics for biodiversity management is fundamental for long-term ecosystem conservation and drafting forest management strategies, especially in the current era of climate change. The explicit modelling of regional ecological responses and their impact on individual species is a significant prerequisite for any adaptation strategy. The present study focuses on predicting the regional distribution of Rhododendron arboreum, a medicinal plant species found in the Himalayan region. Advanced Species Distribution Models (SDM) based on the principle of predefined hypothesis, namely BIOCLIM, was used to model the potential distribution of Rhododendron arboreum. This hypothesis tends to vary with the change in locations, and thus, robust models are required to establish nonlinear complex relations between the input parameters. To address this nonlinear relation, a class of deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is proposed, designed, and tested, which eventually gave much better accuracy than the BIOCLIM model. Both of the models were given 16 input parameters, including ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled and were then utilized in establishing the linear and nonlinear relationship to better fit the occurrence scenarios of the species. The input parameters were mostly acquired from the recent satellite missions, including MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ECOSTRESS. The performance across all the thresholds was evaluated using the value of the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics. The AUC value was found to be 0.917 with CNN, whereas it was 0.68 with BIOCLIM, respectively. The performance evaluation metrics indicate the superiority of CNN for species distribution over BIOCLIM.

TI  - Construction And Demolition Waste Based On The Automatic Recycling Management
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2020
AB  - Over 3000 million tons of waste management are generated annually, out of which 25%-30% are Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW). Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) is generating major issues regarding logistics, provision, and environmental impact. The European Commission, by its Waste Framework Directive, is requesting to increase the recycling rate of the weight by 2020. Since actual material separation techniques require manual quality control and sorting, which is dangerous because workers suffer from exposure to hazardous elements. The desire is to develop a system that will overcome the limitations of current sorting technologies, developing a highly automated processing line, guaranteeing high throughput, and extreme flexibility. The article presents the Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) management using an automatic system for recycling the materials. Moreover, the current material separation methods usually require manual quality control to reach a useful purity of raw materials. The idea of the paper aims to go beyond the technological limitations by exploiting the flexibility of a robotic arm and a classification algorithm based on the information coming from hyperspectral cameras and reflectance sensors. Several different material classes which identify the incoming waste for their future recycling, each with a high-value application in the industry, thus increasing their economic value. In the future, this automated system for sorting the waste will increase the workers' productivity, digitalize the industrial sector, and increase the percentage of recycling CDW up to 90 %. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

TI  - Identification And Classification Of Medicinal Plants Of The Indian Himalayan Region Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing And Random Forest Techniques
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Indian Himalaya region harbours approximately 1748 plants, which have been prioritized for medicinal usage. To ease the pressure on these plants, the government of India is encouraging the in-situ cultivation of medicinal plants. As a consequence, Saussurea costus, Valeriana jatamansi, and Picrorhiza kurroa are some of the important crops which are being cultivated on large scale owing to their high market demand, conservation value and medicinal properties. Identification of these plants in the field requires taxonomic skills, which is one of the major bottlenecks in the conservation and management of these plants. In this background, a hyperspectral library of the above three medicinal plants has been prepared by collecting its spectral data from Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand states of Indian Himalaya. The Random forest (RF) model was implied on the spectral data for the classification of these medicinal plants which resulted in training accuracy of 84.39 \% (kappa coefficient = 0.72) and testing accuracy of 85.29\% (kappa coefficient = 0.77). This RF classifier has identified Green (555598 nm), red (605 nm), and NIR (725-840 nm) wavelength regions suitable for discrimination of the above species.

TI  - A Phenology-Based Method To Map Cropping Patterns Under A Wheat-Maize Rotation Using Remotely Sensed Time-Series Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2018
AB  - Agricultural land use and cropping patterns are closely related to food production, soil degradation, water resource management, greenhouse gas emission, and regional climate alterations. Methods for reliable and cost-efficient mapping of cropping pattern, as well as their changes over space and time, are therefore urgently needed. To cope with this need, we developed a phenology-based method to map cropping patterns based on time-series of vegetation index data. The proposed method builds on the well-known threshold model' to retrieve phenological metrics. Values of four phenological parameters are used to identify crop seasons. Using a set of rules, the crop season information is translated into cropping pattern. To illustrate the method, cropping patterns were determined for three consecutive years (2008-2010) in the Henan province of China, where reliable validation data was available. Cropping patterns were derived using eight-day composite MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. Results show that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory overall accuracy (84\%) in extracting cropping patterns. Interestingly, the accuracy obtained with our method based on MODIS EVI data was comparable with that from Landsat-5 TM image classification. We conclude that the proposed method for cropland and cropping pattern identification based on MODIS data offers a simple, yet reliable way to derive important land use information over large areas.

TI  - The Change Of Land Cover And Land Use And Its Impact Factors In Upriver Key Regions Of The Yellow River
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2009
AB  - Owing to the influence of global change, land cover and land use have changed significantly over the last decade in the cold and arid regions of China, such as Madoi County which is located in the source area of the Yellow River. In this paper, land-use/cover change and landscape dynamics are investigated using satellite remote sensing (RS) and a geographical information system (GIS). The objectives of this paper are to determine land-use/cover transition rates between different cover types in the Madoi County over 10 years e.g., from 1990 to 2000. Second, the changes of landscape metrics using various indices and models are quantified. The impact factors of LUCC (Land-Use land cover Change) are systematically identified by integrating remote sensing as well as statistical data, including climate, frozen soil, hydrological data and the socio-economic data. Using 30m30m spatial resolution Landsat (Enhanced) Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) data in our study area, nine land cover classes can be discriminated. Our results show that Grassland, Marshes and Water Bodies decrease notably, while oppositely, Sands - Gobi and Barren land increase significantly. The number of lakes with an acreage larger than six hectares decreased from 405 in 1990 to 261 in 2000. Numerous small lakes dried out. The area of grassland with a high cover fraction decreased as well, while the surface area of grassland with a medium level of cover fraction increased. The medium cover fraction grassland mainly originates from high cover fraction grassland. The desertification of land is a serious issue. (ii) The inter-transformations between Grasslands, Barren Land, Sands, Gobi, Water Bodies and Marshes are remarkable. The Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (SWDI), the Evenness Index (EI) and the extent of Landscape Heterogeneity (LH) has improved. Marshes have become more fragmented hence, with less connected patches. (iii) In the recent 30 years, average annual temperature, the power of evaporation and the index of dryness did increase significantly. Moreover, soil moisture content (SMC) decreased and the drought trend accelerated. The degradation of frozen soil has impacted on the decrease of surface water area and induced a drop in groundwater levels. Monitoring LUCC in sensitive regions would not only benefit from a study of vulnerable ecosystems in cold and high altitude regions, but would provide scientifically based decision-making tools for local governments as well.

TI  - Impact Of Provincial Water Management On Environment And Social Welfare In West Of Zayanderood Basin, Iran
JO  - UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
PY  - 2018
AB  - Water is the important limitations of management in Zayanderood basin. Adoption and implementation of basin water management bill as provincial in the parliament in 2006. Zayanderood basin management became a dual management and increased the environmental degradation for agricultural production in the west of the basin. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the non-expert decision of managers on the environment and water in the west of the Zayanderud basin. So, land cover changes were investigated using Landsat images in the basin from 1993 to 2015. Then, the cost of the destruction of rangeland was estimated in this area for agricultural development. In this study, some of the indicators for measuring the economic values of ecosystems have improved compared to previous studies. Results showed that the change cover land is increasing quickly, while water scarcity of Zayanderood basin has remained in critical condition. Also, an economic value of at least US\$1179.77 per hectare was delivered to people in 2015 by the rangeland and the cost of destruction rangelands was \$10,247.3 per hectare over the last decade. The total cost of the destruction of rangelands was calculated around US\$21,341,342.5 from 2008 to 2015 in this area. The result showed the impact of natural resource services destruction on person's welfare. So, proposed to the decision makers to consider the economic value of rangeland for assessment of agricultural development projects, because the projects with high social costs is not adopted in this area.

TI  - Rainfall-Surface Runoff Estimation For The Lower Bhavani Basin In South India Using Scs-Cn Model And Geospatial Techniques
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
PY  - 2020
AB  - Rainfall and surface runoff are the two most important components, which control the groundwater recharge of the basin. The long-term groundwater recharge of an aquifer gets affected by the population growth, irregular agriculture activities and industrialization. Hence, estimation of rainfall-surface runoff is very much essential for proper groundwater management practices. In the present study, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model was employed in combination with geospatial techniques to estimate rainfall-surface runoff for the Lower Bhavani River basin in South India. To develop the SCS-CN model, rainfall data were obtained for 33 years (1983-2015) from 22 rain gauge stations spread over the basin. IRS LISS-IV satellite data of 5.8 m spatial resolution were used to analyze the land use/land cover (LU/LC) behavior. Based on the soil properties, four Hydrological Soil Groups (HSG) were identified in the basin which is most significant for surface runoff estimation. Curve Number (CN) values were obtained for various Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) such as dry condition (AMC I), average condition (AMC II) and wet condition (AMC III). Spatial distribution of CN values was plotted using Geographical Information System (GIS) for the entire Lower Bhavani Basin to assess the surface runoff potential. The results indicate that the annual rainfall varies from 267 mm (2002) to 1528.6 mm (2005), and the annual surface runoff varies from 102.04 mm (1985) to 463.02 mm (2010). The SCS-CN model outputs predict that the average surface runoff of the basin is 211.99 mm, and the average surface runoff volume is 81,995,380 m(3). The study also indicates that nearly 53\% of the basin area is dominated by high to very high surface runoff potential. Finally, the output of surface runoff potential was validated with the Average Groundwater Level Fluctuation (AGLF) observed in 57 wells spread over the entire basin. The basin AGLF ranges from 2.32 to 21.72 m. The surface runoff potential categories are satisfactorily matching with the AGLF categories. Moderate surface runoff as well as moderate AGLF zones mostly occupy the central portion of the basin, which possess good groundwater potential. However, the high surface runoff zones in the basin lead more surface water flow into the river channels, which reduce the infiltration rate and decline the water table. This problem can be solved by constructing suitable artificial groundwater recharge structures across the river channels in the high surface runoff potential areas.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Of Impervious Surfaces And Their Impacts On Land Surface Temperature In Beijing, China
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
PY  - 2007
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST), which is heavily influenced by urban surface structures, is a significant parameter in urban environmental analysis. This study examined the effect impervious surfaces (IS) spatial patterns have on LST in Beijing, China. A classification and regression tree model (CART) was adopted to estimate IS as a continuous variable using Landsat images from two seasons combined with QuickBird. LST was retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image to examine the relationships between IS and LST. The results revealed that CART was capable of consistently predicting LST with acceptable accuracy (correlation coefficient of 0.94 and the average error of 8.59\%). Spatial patterns of IS exhibited changing gradients across the various urban-rural transects, with LST values showing a concentric shape that increased as you moved from the outskirts towards the downtown areas. Transect analysis also indicated that the changes in both IS and LST patterns were similar at various resolution levels, which suggests a distinct linear relationship between them. Results of correlation analysis further showed that IS tended to be positively correlated with LST, and that the correlation coefficients increased from 0.807 to 0.925 with increases in IS pixel size. The findings identified in this study provide a theoretical basis for improving urban planning efforts to lessen urban temperatures and thus dampen urban heat island effects.

TI  - Comparative Study Of Deep Neural Networks For Landslide Susceptibility Assessment: A Case Study Of Pyeongchang-Gun, South Korea
JO  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
PY  - 2024
AB  - With an increase in local precipitation caused by extreme climatic phenomena, the frequency of landslides and associated damage has also increased. Therefore, compiling fine-scale landslide susceptibility assessment maps based on data from landslide-affected areas is essential. Deep neural network (DNN) and kernel-based DNN(DNNK) models were used to prepare landslide susceptibility maps of the mountainous Pyeongchang-gun region (South Korea) within a geographic information system framework. To map landslide susceptibility, datasets of landslide occurrence areas, topography, land use, forest, and soil were collected and entered into spatial databases, and 18 factors were then selected from the databases and used as model inputs. The training and test datasets consisted of 1600 and 400 landslide locations, respectively. The test accuracies of the DNN and DNNK models were 98.19% and 97.53% and 94.11% and 92.22% for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the average precision value of the precision-recall curve, respectively. The location of future landslides can now be quickly and efficiently predicted using remote sensing data at a lower cost and with less labor. The landslide susceptibility maps produced in this study can play a role in sustainability and serve as references for establishing policies for landslide prevention and mitigation. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping By Integrating Analytical Hierarchy Process, Frequency Ratio, And Fuzzy Gamma Operator Models, Case Study: North Of Lorestan Province, Iran
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2022
AB  - Identifying landslide-prone areas is an essential step in assessing landslide risk and reducing landslide damage. In this paper, GIS-based spatial analysis has been used to prepare the landslide susceptibility (LS) map in the north of Lorestan province in western Iran. For this purpose, three main criteria and their sub-criteria were identified as causative factors including geology and topography (i.e., distance from the fault, lithology, slope, aspect, and elevation), climate (i.e., rainfall and distance from the river), and environmental parameters (i.e., distance from the road, land-cover, NDVI). One hundred thirty-six known landslides were randomly divided into training (≅ 70%) and validation (≅ 30%) datasets. This study is based on the integration of popular analytic hierarchy process (AHP), frequency ratio (FR), and the fuzzy gamma operator (FGO) techniques. AHP was utilized to prioritize causal factors and fuzzy technique was applied in two stages of factor map fuzzification and calculation of sub-criteria maps and then overlap of fuzzified map layers. The fuzzy membership (FM) values were determined based on the FR method, which was normalized between the ranges of 0 and 1. Finally, LS zoning maps were estimated in five susceptibility classes (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high). Validation processes by comparing the three output maps with the layer of validation landslides in the study area and area under receiver operating characteristic curve confirm that the gamma value of 0.9 (AUC = 0.88) offers a more accurate LS map compared to other gamma values. The results of this study will be reliable for landslide risk reduction strategies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

JO  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
PY  - 2007
AB  - This study proposes a methodology simple, but easy to include/understand in the decision making by the land managers, to determine the landscape value by means of the integration of different indicators under an exclusively ecological approach. Some of these indicators are based on vegetal the intrinsic formation characteristics like their degree of proximity to the vegetation climax. Others analyze the vegetal importance of the formation in their regional and national contexts (peculiarity or singularity and representativeness). Also, other indicators proposed by the Landscape Ecology, in special indices of diversity, connectivity and Interspersion / Juxtaposition are used, considering the spatial distribution of the patch by the regional territory and an adjacent strip to the regional contour of the Community of Madrid. Also other criteria have been considered to calculate the ecological value of some landscapes. They have considered the property of pixels to spaces with some figure of protection: protected natural areas, special protection areas for the birds, sites of Community importance, preserved forest and public utility forest. These two values -landscaping and ecological-comprise of the methodological scheme proposed in project FIREMAP to evaluate the wildfire vulnerability. The final aim is to develop a set of methods to map a synthetic index of the forest fire risk. This index leans in Remote Sensing and GIS. Its newness is in the integration of the aspects associated to the determination of the wildfire danger and the wildfire vulnerability of the potentially affected forest resources.

PY  - 2014
AB  - The 1992 Earth Summit and its message of sustainable development drove the launching of a System for integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting, the SEEA. Since then, sustainable development and the SEEA have given way to green growth and green economy indicators in the latest 2012 Summit. A lengthy revision process has now produced a curtailed SEEA central framework. The new framework focuses on expenditures for environmental protection and resource management, and stocks and flows of economic resources; both are covered by the conventional national accounts. Environmental degradation, notably from pollution, is left to experimental ecosystem accounts. Further revision of the SEEA should reverse this retrenchment from integrative environmental-economic accounting. A comprehensive satellite system, rather than a limited statistical standard, might put the SEEA back on the policy agenda.

AB  - Nowadays, following the proliferation on the web of many geoinformation data with the emergence of GoogleMap, VirtualEarth and other client and data providers, some important problem of accessibility and exploitation have appeared due to the heavy of those data flux and moreover to the heterogeneous standard for metadata description. Some major efforts are done by the Open Geospatial Consortium®, a non-profit, international, voluntary consensus standards organization, in order to lead the development of standards for geospatial and location based services. One of the most recognized and used standard for access to geospatial data is the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). A WMS produces dynamically maps of spatially referenced data from geographic information. Through this standard, any client can access maps and combine (overlay them like clear acetate sheets) them from one or more servers. Since 2006, EADS Astrium is an OGC's Technical Committee Member, which gives us the opportunity to submit drafted OGC standards that enable interoperability of geospatial data and services. EADS Astrium participates to different technical and thematic working group and leads a European OGC pilot project federating Earth Observation Space resources. In the framework of internal R&D activities, EADS Astrium is developing a Meta Earth Information environment (MeTiS) in order to demonstrate the advantages of interoperability standards and new Web 2.0 technologies. Web 2.0 is the business revolution of these last years due to the Internet transition towards a collaborative platform. MeTiS is a Mash-Up solution based on Web2.0 technologies (AJAX, CSS...) that allows users to continue interacting with the MMI in real time despite the heavy transfer of geospatial data. Using image streaming capabilities, users can navigate and zoom in map and geospatial data with the maximum of agility achievable according to the network bandwidth. MeTiS is a virtual earth information environment integrating both benefits of Web 2.0 wave technologies together with OGC interoperability standards (WMS). MeTiS offers to end user an ergonomic and user friendly interface for geospatial data discovery and aggregation. Dedicated to users' needs for environmental monitoring purpose, MeTiS manages and records user-context allowing persistent remote access to various distributed data sources. It provides access to remote interoperable servers such as background "streaming" web map APIs like Googlemap, YahooMap, Windows Live Local, etc... and environmental WMS offering access to data and value added products at different scales relevant to different user communities. MeTiS offers many functional and operational capabilities such as navigation into a web on-line "Google Map Like" application, subscription to a certain number of WMS and dynamically aggregates the related layers, definition and management of different thematic working environments and saving/restoring users' context for further connections.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass Of Two Different Forest Types In Myanmar From Sentinel‐2 Data With Machine Learning And Geostatistical Algorithms
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - The accurate estimation of spatially explicit forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides an essential basis for sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration accounting, especially in Myanmar, where there is a lack of data for forest conservation due to operational limitations. This study mapped the forest AGB using Sentinel‐2 (S‐2) images and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) based on random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and Kriging algorithms in two forest reserves (Namhton and Yinmar) in Myanmar, and compared their performance against AGB measured by the traditional methods. Specifically, a suite of forest sample plots were deployed in the two forest reserves, and forest attributes were measured to calculate the plot‐level AGB based on allometric equations. The spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs) and textures derived from processed S‐2 data and topographic parameters from SRTM were utilized to statistically link with field‐based AGB by implementing random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms. Followed by an evaluation of the algorithmic performances, RF‐based Kriging (RFK) models were employed to determine the spatial distribution of AGB as an improvement of accuracy against RF models. The study’s results showed that textural measures produced from wavelet analysis (WA) and vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel‐2 were the strongest predictors for evergreen forest reserve (Namhton) AGB prediction and spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) showed the highest sensitivity to the deciduous forest reserve (Yinmar) AGB prediction. The fitted models were RF‐based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) for Namhton forest reserve and RFbased co‐Kriging (RFCK) for Yinmar forest reserve because their respective R2, whilst the RMSE values were validated as 0.47 and 24.91 AGB t/ha and 0.52 and 34.72 AGB t/ha, respectively. The proposed random forest Kriging framework provides robust AGB maps, which are essential to estimate the carbon sequestration potential in the context of REDD+. From this particular study, we suggest that the protection/disturbance status of forests affects AGB values directly in the study area; thus, community‐participated or engaged forest utilization and conservation initiatives are recommended to promote sustainable forest management. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A Big Bang-Big Crunch Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System For Explainable Semantic Segmentation Of Trees In Satellite Images Using Hsv Color Space
JO  - IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems
PY  - 2020
AB  - In recent years, new sensor technologies have increased the accessibility of high-resolution satellite images. The information in these images can help to improve activities like urban planning and growth analysis of cities. Additionally, information extracted from these images can be used for taking decisions related to infrastructure planning, e.g. identifying objects that might interfere with network assets like underground cables. To be able to justify the cost of network planning decisions a high degree of interpretability is required. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the state of the art for segmenting these images, but like any black box model they do not offer any explanation for their output. In this paper, we present an approach on how to use a Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) for performing explainable semantic segmentation of trees in satellite images. The FLS uses the HSV (hue, saturation, value) of the pixels as inputs and was optimized by using an evolutionary algorithm called Big Bang Big Crunch. The best configuration for the Interval Type-2 FLS has an Intersection over Union metric measure of 60.6%, which is close to the results obtained from neural network, however the proposed FLS provides interpretable outputs which is highly needed for the real-world operation especially in the telecommunication domain. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Can Southeast Asia Eradicate Yaws By 2010? Some Lessons From The Yaws Eradication Programme Of India
JO  - National Medical Journal of India
PY  - 2007
AB  - Yaws has traditionally been known as a skin disease that affects people living in hilly, remote and inaccessible areas. Despite the availability of successful treatment and yaws control programmes worldwide since 1948, yaws is endemic in a number of countries, probably because it is not considered a priority disease for eradication. The presence of a disease that can be eradicated in a community can be taken as a sign of 'backwardness' and an indicator of inappropriate public health efforts. Yaws is endemic in 3 countries of the Southeast Asia (SEA) Region of WHO - Indonesia, India and Timor-Leste. The WHO SEA Regional Office has set a target for yaws eradication from the region by year 2010. Yaws eradication is at various stages in these countries. India has reported no cases for the past 3 years and has declared elimination. In the other 2 countries yaws eradication programmes are in their infancy and achieving the WHO regional goal appears impossible. However, if lessons are learnt from the Yaws Eradication Programme in India and an externally funded, technically supported, vertical programme is started immediately in Indonesia and Timor-Leste, the target would not be difficult to accomplish. © The National Medical Journal of India 2007.

TI  - Application Of High-Resolution Stereo Satellite Images To Detailed Landslide Hazard Assessment
JO  - Geomorphology
PY  - 2006
AB  - This study investigates and demonstrates the state of the art in remote sensing techniques for detailed landslide hazard assessment applicable to large areas. Since the most common methods of landslide hazard assessment using simple inventories and weighted overlays are heavily dependent on three-dimensional terrain visualization and analysis, stereo satellite images from the IKONOS Very High Resolution (VHR) sensor are used for this study. The DEMs created from IKONOS stereo images appear to be much more accurate and sensitive to micro-scale terrain features than a DEM created from digital contour data with a 2 m contour interval. Pan-sharpened stereo IKONOS images permit interpretation of recent landslides as small as 2-3 m in width as well as relict landslides older than 50 years. A cost-benefit analysis comparing stereo air photo interpretation with stereo satellite image interpretation suggests that stereo satellite imagery is usually more cost-effective for detailed landslide hazard assessment over large areas. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping Ecosystem Services Using Imaging Spectroscopy Data
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) generate benefits to human well-being but quality and amount of their provisioning is threatened by environmental change. Remote sensing techniques allow assessments of ES at critical scales using combinations of remotely measurable ecosystem properties. In this contribution, we use an ES assessement approach suggested by Homolova et al. {[}1] and extend it to estimate ES supply continuously for a heterogenous landscape across different Earth spheres using data of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer. We further suggest a conceptional framework to combine ES maps to match the needs of different stakeholders. Our results show the heterogenuous supply of agronomic ES, carbon sequestration and cultural ES within the landscape and and its different ecosystems. Our proposed ES mapping approach and the conceptual framework developed for combining ES according to stakeholder requests, provide spatially explicit information on ES across heterogeneous landscapes and can therefore improve decision-making of stakeholders.

TI  - Sentieri Project: Air Pollution And Health Impact Of Population Living In Industrial Areas In Italy
JO  - Epidemiologia e Prevenzione
PY  - 2023
AB  - Objectives: to estimate the impact of PM2.5 and PM10 in the Italian industrial areas included in the SENTIERI project characterized by industrial plants with combustion processes deriving from point emissions. Design: using satellite data, the Population Weighted Exposure (PWE) to PM2.5 and PM10 for 2011 and 2015 was estimated. The concentration-response functions available were used to estimate the number of premature deaths attributable to exposure to industrial emissions. The counterfactual levels recommended by the new WHO Air Quality Guidelines were used. Setting and participants: for the selection of industrial plants, the European database on emissions of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register was used. Residents in areas of 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km around the selected industrial plants were considered. Main outcome measures: the number of premature deaths from non-accidental causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and lung cancer was estimated. Results: residents were exposed to PM2.5 values of 17.3 µg/m3 (Northern Italy: 23.3) and to 24.3 µg/m3 (Northern Italy: 30.3) of PM10. PWE for both pollutants tends to increase as the size of the area under study is reduced and it is generally higher everywhere in 2011 than in 2015, with values that are always higher than the average (overall) in the Norther Italy. In 2011, 1,709 (IC95% 1,309-1,903) and 1,611 (IC95% 1,225-2,353) non accidental premature deaths were estimated attributable to PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, in residents close to the industrial plants (1 km x 1 km). Deaths attributable to exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 tend to follow a North-Central-South&Islands gradient for all observed causes and for both years of analysis. Conclusions: although exposure assessment of the population by using random-forest model does not allow to disentangle the contribution of the industrial component, the results of the study are suggestive of an impact on health from PM exposure in the industrial areas considered, with a greater impact in the vicinity of the plants, recommending the implementation of urgent impact reduction actions. © 2023, Inferenze Scarl.

TI  - Modeling The Spatial Variation Of Calcium Carbonate Equivalent To Depth Using Machine Learning Techniques
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Inorganic carbon is the largest source of carbon in terrestrial surface, particularly in arid and semiarid regions, including the Chahardowli Plain in western Iran. Inorganic carbon plays an equal or greater role than organic soil carbon in these areas, although less attention has been paid in quantifying their variability. The objective of this study was to model and map calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) presenting inorganic carbon in soil using machine learning and digital soil mapping techniques. Chahardowli Plain in foothills of the Zagros Mountains in the southeast of Kurdistan Province in Iran was taken as a case study area. CCE was measured at 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm depths following GloalSoilMap.net project specifications. A total of 145 samples were collected from 30 soil profiles using the conditional Latin hypercube (cLHS) method of sampling. Relationships between CCE and environmental predictors were modeled using random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) models. In general, the RF model performed slightly superior than the DT model. The mean value of CCE increased with soil depth, from 3.5\% (0-5 cm) to 63.8\% (30-60 cm). Remote sensing (RS) variables and terrestrial variables were equally important. The importance of RS variables was higher at the surface than terrestrial variables, and vice versa. The most significant variables were Channel Network Base Level (CNBL) variable and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) with the same variable importance value (21.1\%). In areas affected by river activities, the use of the CNBL and vertical distance to channel networks (VDCN) as variables in digital soil mapping (DSM) could increase the accuracy of soil property prediction maps. The VDCN played a principal role in soil distribution in the study area by affecting the rate of discharge and, thus, erosion and sedimentation. A high percentage of carbonate in parts of the region could exacerbate nutrient deficiencies for most crops and provide information for sustainably managing agricultural activity.

TI  - A Review Of Drought Monitoring With Big Data: Issues, Methods, Challenges And Research Directions
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
PY  - 2020
AB  - Over recent years, the frequency and intensity of droughts have increased and there has been a large drying trend over many parts of the world. Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger. There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought, it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies, researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring. Challenges related to data life cycle such as data challenges, data processing challenges and data infrastructure management challenges are also discussed. Finally, we conclude that big data analytic can be beneficial in drought monitoring but there is a need for statistical and artificial intelligence-based approaches.

TI  - Drivers And Implications Of The Extreme 2022 Wildfire Season In Southwest Europe
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Wildfire is a common phenomenon in Mediterranean countries but the 2022 fire season has been extreme in southwest Europe (Portugal, Spain and France). Here we provide a preliminary but comprehensive analysis of 2022's wildfire sea-son in southwest Europe. Burned area has exceeded the 2001-2021 median by a factor of 52 in some regions and large wildfires (>500 ha) started to occur in June-July, earlier than the traditional fire season. These anomalies were asso-ciated with record-breaking values of fuel dryness, atmospheric water demand and pyrometeorological conditions. Live fuel moisture content was below the historical minima for almost 50 \% of the season in some regions. A few large wildfires were responsible for 82 \% of the burned area and, in turn, 47 \% of the area burned occurred in protected areas. Shrublands, transitional woodlands and conifer forests (but not eucalypt plantations) were the land cover types most affected by extreme fires. As climate change intensifies, we can expect such fire seasons to become the new nor-mal in large parts of the continent, potentially leading to major negative impacts on rural economies. These results highlight the need for landscape level fuel management also in protected areas, to avoid fire-induced biodiversity losses and landscape scale degradation. Our results have important policy implications and indicate that fire preven-tion should be explicitly addressed within continental forest legislation and strategies.

AB  - In this article, the deployment problem of LEO satellite communication is investigated and analyzed by the financial tool, i.e. real option theory. Traditional methods often neglect the existence of uncertainty and underestimates the value of staged deployment decisions. Real option theory pays more attention to the value of flexibility in large-scale complex engineering system, such as satellite constellation. The objective of this work is to analyze the flexible approach of staged deployment for mega-constellation and deduce the option price equations. Finally, a simple example is given to demonstrate the fact that staged deployment brings the flexibility for the system and real option theory can evaluate this value more exactly. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Globalized Poverty And Environment: 21st Century Challenges And Innovative Solutions
JO  - Globalized Poverty and Environment: 21st Century Challenges and Innovative Solutions
PY  - 2014
AB  - This book reviews the key conceptions and economic theories of poverty, explains poverty-environment nexus, and finally offers innovative socio-economic and scientific geospatial solutions for the 21st Century. The book makes it possible for our readers to understand poverty thorough a concise review of the major theoretical economic frameworks, measures of poverty, and points out the need to understand rural-urban dichotomy of poverty. We find the theories and measures to be less-than perfect and therefore point out the need to treat these measures and theories as convenient tools lacking perfect accuracy and utmost scientific reliability. It follows then that the supposedly knowledgeably crafted poverty reduction and environmental preservation solutions are inherently imperfect. The economic solutions proposed in this book transcend extant humdrum macroeconomic and policy measures targeting poverty and environmental issues. We point to a new paradigm in which private sector and other stakeholders can create new and inclusive markets where value is co-created and shared. Above all, this book offers timely state-of-the-art geospatial solutions targeting the most pressing global problems of water, e.g., the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions to estimate changes in stored water in the water-poverty-environment nexus, pollution, agriculture and disaster management, where geospatial techniques are applied under strong environmental impact assessment regulatory regimes. "This book provides a good summary of economic theories of poverty as well as a vivid depiction of the state of environmental degradation in the world. People often work separately on different issues that are, in fact, closely intertwined. The principle of holism is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and I believe that this joint-venture of two experts on poverty and environment has produced something more than a sum of two separate monographs on the issues. Various points raised in this volume are worth heeding when we think of formulation and implementation of a truly effective post-MDGs development agenda.

TI  - Remote Sensing Inversion Of Soil Nutrient On Farmland In Huangshui River Basin Based On Xgboost Model
JO  - Arid Land Geography
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Huangshui River Basin is an important part of the Huangshui Valley. Additionally, collaborative environmental factors that predict the spatial distribution of soil nutrients are particularly important for managing soil nutrients. Moreover, less attention is paid to the effect of model parameters on the results obtained from soil nutrient inversion studies. In this study, the Huangshui River Basin in Qinghai Province (China) was selected as the study area, and 28 factors, including elevation, aspect, slope, plane curvature, section curvature, relief degree of land surface, topographic wetness index, soil pH, and spectral reflectance, were selected. In addition, these factors were combined with the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to construct artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models for predicting the spatial distribution of four soil nutrients in farmlands: soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK), respectively. Further, the prediction accuracy of these three models was evaluated based on the model coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and relative percent deviation (RPD). The results revealed that: (1) All four soil nutrients exhibited a moderate degree of variability, with TN showing the highest variability of 69.481%. The XGBoost model based on the Bayesian optimized hyperparameter combination was better than other models in predicting the TN content (R2, RMSE, and RPD were 0.893, 0.359, and 2.470, respectively). The R2 values of the XGBoost model validation set for estimating the SOM, AK, and AP contents were 0.801, 0.509, and 0.442, respectively, and the corresponding RPD values were 2.152, 1.210, and 1.274, respectively. Moreover, this model exhibited a better prediction capability. (2) The comparison of the number of optimizations and errors of the three models revealed that the BOA-XGBoost model exhibited minimum number of parameter optimizations, higher efficiency, and better robustness. The ANN and SVM models demonstrated different prediction accuracies for different nutrients; additionally, the SVM model predicted the SOM content with high accuracy (RPD=1.580), while the ANN model predicted TN efficiently (RPD=2.460). Based on Landsat 8 remote sensing images, the XGBoost inversion model developed by combining 28 factors of the Huangshui River Basin was found to be more suitable for application in soil nutrient inversion research; furthermore, it can more accurately describe the spatial distribution pattern of the soil nutrient inversion in the Huangshui River Basin, better ensure precise agriculture fertilization, improve the fertilizer utilization rate and crop yield, and provide a reference for precise agriculture fertilization in the Huangshui River Basin. © 2023 Science and Technology of Food Industry.

TI  - Application Of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Data For Habitat Mapping Of Pacific Islands: Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean)
JO  - Journal of Marine Science and Engineering
PY  - 2019
AB  - Sustainable and ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is a priority of Pacific Island countries basing their economy on marine resources. The urgency of management coral reef systems and associated coastal environments, threatened by the effects of climate change, require a detailed habitat mapping of the present status and a future monitoring of changes over time. Here, we present a remote sensing study using free available Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping at large scale the most sensible and high value habitats (corals, seagrasses, mangroves) of Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean), carried out without any sea truth validation. Remote sensing 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' classification methods applied to 2017 Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m resolution together with comparisons with free ancillary data on web platform and available scientific literature were used to map mangrove, coral, and seagrass communities in the Palau Archipelago. This paper addresses the challenge of multispectral benthic mapping estimation using commercial software for preprocessing steps (ERDAS ATCOR) and for benthic classification (ENVI) on the base of satellite image analysis. The accuracy of the methods was tested comparing results with reference NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA) habitat maps achieved through Ikonos and Quickbird imagery interpretation and sea-truth validations. Results showed how the proposed approach allowed an overall good classification of marine habitats, namely a good concordance of mangroves cover around Palau Archipelago with previous literature and a good identification of coastal habitats in two sites (barrier reef and coastal reef) with an accuracy of 39.8-56.8%, suitable for survey and monitoring of most sensible habitats in tropical remote islands. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - High Resolution Stream Water Quality Assessment In The Vancouver, British Columbia Region: A Citizen Science Study
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - Changing land cover and climate regimes modify water quantity and quality in natural stream systems. In regions undergoing rapid change, it is difficult to effectively monitor and quantify these impacts at local to regional scales. In Vancouver, British Columbia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Canada, 750 measurements were taken from a total of 81 unique sampling sites representing 49 streams located in urban, forest, and agricultural-dominant watersheds at a frequency of up to 12 times per year between 2013 and 2016. Dissolved nitrate (NO3-N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations, turbidity, water temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by citizen scientists in addition to observations of hydrology, vegetation, land use, and visible stream impacts. Land cover was mapped at a 15-m resolution using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and used to determine dominant land cover for each watershed in which a sample was recorded. Regional, seasonal, and catchment-type trends in measurements were determined using statistical analyses. The relationships of nutrients to land cover varied seasonally and on a catchment-type basis. Nitrate showed seasonal highs in winter and lows in summer, though phosphate had less seasonal variation. Overall, nitrate concentrations were positively associated to agriculture and deciduous forest and negatively associated with coniferous forest. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were positively associated with agricultural, deciduous forest, and disturbed land cover and negatively associated with urban land cover. Both urban and agricultural land cover were significantly associated with an increase in water conductivity. Increased forest land cover was associated with better water quality, including lower turbidity, conductivity, and water temperature. This study showed the importance of high resolution sampling in understanding seasonal and spatial dynamics of stream water quality, made possible with the large number of measurements taken with the help of trained volunteers. The results underscore the value of citizen science in freshwater research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The work is devoted to the effect of the change of cropland area on the rate of soil erosion in sites of the European part of Russia located in different climatic, landscape and geomorphological conditions. Mapping of the croplands on the territory of 9 river basins for the two time slices (the middle of the 1980s, and the present-day period 2013-2015) was carried out by visual interpretation of multi-seasonal images Landsat 5 and Landsat 8. Using vector layers obtained as a result of digitization, the areas of croplands in the analyzed periods have been calculated, and changes which occurred in 30 years were estimated. The decrease of croplands area was revealed in all studied river basins. An assessment of the effect of cropland reduction on the soil loss rate was carried out. Using the SRMM DEM with a 30 m spatial resolution, the following morphometric characteristics of relief for cultivated and abandoned croplands were calculated: steepness of slopes, flowpath length, factor LS. Based on the results of calculations, the average values of the factor LS reduced from 1985 to 2015 on the croplands in all considered basins. The obtained data confirm that the reduction of the croplands area is one of the factors responsible for the decrease of modern soil loss rates observed in field studies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Valuing Map Validation: The Need For Rigorous Land Cover Map Accuracy Assessment In Economic Valuations Of Ecosystem Services
JO  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
PY  - 2015
AB  - Valuations of ecosystem services often use data on land cover class areal extent. Area estimates from land cover maps may be biased by misclassification error resulting in flawed assessments and inaccurate valuations. Adjustment for misclassification error is possible for maps subjected to a rigorous validation programme including an accuracy assessment. Unfortunately, validation is rare and/or poorly undertaken as often not regarded as a high priority. The benefit of map validation and hence its value is indicated with two maps. The International Geosphere Biosphere Programme's DISCover map was used to estimate wetland value globally. The latter changed from US\$ 1.92 trillion yr(-1) to US\$ 2.79 trillion yr(-1) when adjusted for misclassification bias. For the conterminous USA, ecosystem services value based on six land cover classes from the National Land Cover Database (2006) changed from US\$ 1118 billion yr(-1) to US\$ 600 billion yr(-1) after adjustment for misclassification bias. The effect of error-adjustment on the valuations indicates the value of map validation to rigorous evidence-based science and policy work in relation to aspects of natural capital. The benefit arising from validation was orders of magnitude larger than mapping costs and it is argued that validation should be a high priority in mapping programmes and inform valuations.

TI  - The Information Milieu Of Remote Sensing: An Overview
JO  - REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW
PY  - 2014
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to provide an overview of issues relevant to scientific information literacy within the context of the remote sensing, a cross-cutting scientific discipline. The authors examine the range of sources of scientific information, trends in publishing and the characteristics of scholarly articles in the field of remote sensing. They focus on challenges in finding and using information, as well as current trends and emerging issues. Design/methodology/approach - Issues pertinent to teaching information literacy and particularly remote sensing research and lifelong learning are reviewed, drawing on the knowledge and experience of the authors, as well as published resources. Findings - The large and increasing volume of publications in remote sensing suggests that professionals in this field require a contextual understanding of knowledge production and dissemination in remote sensing, as well as specific literature search skills. Research limitations/implications - Just as for the field of remote sensing, scientific knowledge dissemination is changing rapidly. The full implications of electronic publications have probably not yet been realized in remote sensing, but have already changed the landscape considerably. In particular, open-access publications may have significant implications for both scholars and libraries. Practical implications - This paper will be useful to information professionals, including librarians, who will benefit from a deeper understanding of remote sensing literature and how remote sensing information is produced, stored and disseminated. This knowledge is essential for teaching remote sensing students advanced information literacy skills. Originality/value - Librarians, as well as educators and professionals in the field of remote sensing, require information on the context of remote sensing knowledge production and dissemination as a key component of information literacy. A review of the literature did not reveal current treatment of information literacy in the field of remote sensing.

AB  - Advent of Technology amidst mushrooming Economic progress of Artificial intelligence(AI) and spatial remote sensing techniques carried with it, revolution in control and distribution of Satellite Images and imagery-derived information which are slackly in the hands of government and riveting into private segment progressively for the upcoming and the very evident latent market. Remote sensing technology has established the ability to create and provide a certain level of information which might possibly intrude upon some usual social opinions of privacy at individual level and hence, may be accountable for unswerving lawful and moral scales of aftermaths. This paper evaluates the potential market of space imagery, its utility pertaining to issues concerned with human rights and also accentuates many legal as well as ethical issues that may be of concern in near future to the remote sensing communities. The paper also showcases various policies and concerns that are to be integrated in policy making. Self-monitoring of the work is the main key to striking the perfect balance between the civil rights of an individual, the financial benefits related to the field of remote sensing community and the nation at large. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Building Change Detection In Remote Sensing Imagery With Focal Self-Attention And Multi-Level Feature Fusion
JO  - ELECTRONICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Accurate and intelligent building change detection greatly contributes to effective urban development, optimized resource management, and informed decision-making in domains such as urban planning, land management, and environmental monitoring. Existing methodologies face challenges in effectively integrating local and global features for accurate building change detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that uses focal self-attention to process the feature vector of input images, which uses a "focusing" mechanism to guide the calculation of the self-attention mechanism. By focusing more on critical areas when processing image features in different regions, focal self-attention can better handle both local and global information, and is more flexible and adaptive than other methods, improving detection accuracy. In addition, our multi-level feature fusion module groups the features and then constructs a hierarchical residual structure to fuse the grouped features. On the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets, our proposed method achieved F1-scores of 91.62\% and 89.45\%, respectively. Compared with existing methods, ours performed better on building change detection tasks. Our method therefore provides a framework for solving problems related to building change detection, with some reference value and guiding significance.

TI  - Open-Source Processing And Analysis Of Aerial Imagery Acquired With A Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial System To Support Invasive Plant Management
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
PY  - 2017
AB  - Remote sensing by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is a dynamic evolving technology. UAS are particularly useful in environmental monitoring and management because they have the capability to provide data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, data acquisition costs are lower than those of conventional methods such as extensive ground sampling, manned airplanes, or satellites. Small fixed-wing UAS in particular offer further potential benefits as they extend the operational coverage of the area under study at lower operator risks and accelerate data deployment times. Taking these aspects into account, UAS might be an effective tool to support management of invasive plant based on early detection and regular monitoring. A straightforward UAS approach to map invasive plant species is presented in this study with the intention of providing ready-to-use field maps essential for action-oriented management. Our UAS utilizes low-cost sensors, free-of-charge software for mission planning and an affordable, commercial aerial platform to reduce operational costs, reducing expenses with personnel while increasing overall efficiency. We illustrate our approach using a real example of invasion by Acacia mangium in a Brazilian Savanna ecosystem. A. mangium was correctly identified with an overall accuracy of 82.7\% from the analysis of imagery. This approach provides land management authorities and practitioners with new prospects for environmental restoration in areas where invasive plant species are present.

TI  - Mapping Wildfire Danger At Regional Scale With An Index Model Integrating Coarse Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Data
JO  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2007
AB  - [} 1] Wildfires are a prevalent natural hazard in the south of France. Planners need a permanent fire danger assessment valid for several years over a territory as large and heterogeneous as Midi-Pyrenees region. To this end, we developed an expert knowledge-based index model adapted to the specific features of the study area. The fire danger depends on two complementary elements: spatial occurrence and fire intensity. Among the GIS layers identified as input variables for modeling, vegetation fire susceptibility is one of the most influent. However, the main difficulty at this scale is the scarcity or the lack of exhaustiveness of the data. In this respect, remote sensing imagery is capable of providing relevant information. We proposed to calculate an annual relative greenness index ( annual RGRE) that reflects vegetation dryness in summer. We processed times series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from SPOT-VEGETATION images over the last six available years ( 1998 to 2003). The first step was to verify that these images characterize vegetation types and highlight intraannual and interannual response variability. It is then possible to identify phenological stages corresponding to the maximum NDVI ( and therefore to maximum photosynthetic activity) during the growing season, the minimum NDVI at the end of the growing season and the minimum NDVI during winter period. These phenology metrics ground the annual RGRE calculation. Values obtained for each observation year show significant correlation (r(2) = 0.70) with the De Martonne aridity index calculated for the same period. A synthesis of yearly index was integrated in the model as a variable that expresses fire susceptibility.

JO  - 35th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2014, ACRS 2014: Sensing for Reintegration of Societies
PY  - 2014
AB  - FORMOSAT-2, an earth observation remote sensing satellite has been launched and operated by National Space Organization, National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs-NSPO) of Taiwan since 2004. Its unique daily revisit feature with 2-m GSD has demonstrated tremendous benefits in various applications especially in disaster response and continuous change detection monitoring. NSPO is determined to become one of the high resolution image providers in the world. Therefore a follow-on FORMOSAT-5 satellite is being developed and targeted to launch in 2015. From the demand perspective, with growing variety of space resource availability in recent years, horizontal interoperability of satellite programming operation is crucial to provide decision-support platform for users with different purposes. Based on experience operating FORMOSAT-2 satellite, NSPO is developing a satellite multi-mission programming system prototype with web service interface. This system, Formosa SPS (sensor planning system), can be used for determining the feasibility of an intended sensor planning request and it features a common platform of sharing satellite resource. Meanwhile, due to the orbit feature, there are different chances that a specific AOI (area of interest) lies within the field of view for different satellite in certain period of time. Therefore, systematic analyses are performed in real-time for multi-satellite scenario. 3D simulation system using free application programming interface (API) technology is also being developed. In this paper, we will introduce the background and objective of this system development and present its mechanism and function. Formosa SPS 1.0 is OGC Compliant certified.

TI  - Monte-Carlo Siamese Policy On Actor For Satellite Image Super Resolution
JO  - IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the past few years supervised and adversarial learning have been widely adopted in various complex computer vision tasks. It seems natural to wonder whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling. We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote sensing datasets. Based on our experiments, we report considerable improvement over state-of-the-art methods by encapsulating supervised models in a reinforcement learning framework. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Impact Of Insolation Data Source On Remote Sensing Retrievals Of Evapotranspiration Over The California Delta
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - The energy delivered to the land surface via insolation is a primary driver of evapotranspiration (ET)the exchange of water vapor between the land and atmosphere. Spatially distributed ET products are in great demand in the water resource management community for real-time operations and sustainable water use planning. The accuracy and deliverability of these products are determined in part by the characteristics and quality of the insolation data sources used as input to the ET models. This paper investigates the practical utility of three different insolation datasets within the context of a satellite-based remote sensing framework for mapping ET at high spatiotemporal resolution, in an application over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in California. The datasets tested included one reanalysis product: The Climate System Forecast Reanalysis (CFSR) at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, and two remote sensing insolation products generated with geostationary satellite imagery: a product for the continental United States at 0.2 degrees, developed by the University of Wisconsin Space Sciences and Engineering Center (SSEC) and a coarser resolution (1 degrees) global Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. The three insolation data sources were compared to pyranometer data collected at flux towers within the Delta region to establish relative accuracy. The satellite products significantly outperformed CFSR, with root-mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.7, 1.5, and 1.4 MJm(-2)d(-1) for CFSR, CERES, and SSEC, respectively, at daily timesteps. The satellite-based products provided more accurate estimates of cloud occurrence and radiation transmission, while the reanalysis tended to underestimate solar radiation under cloudy-sky conditions. However, this difference in insolation performance did not translate into comparable improvement in the ET retrieval accuracy, where the RMSE in daily ET was 0.98 and 0.94 mm d(-1) using the CFSR and SSEC insolation data sources, respectively, for all the flux sites combined. The lack of a notable impact on the aggregate ET performance may be due in part to the predominantly clear-sky conditions prevalent in central California, under which the reanalysis and satellite-based insolation data sources have comparable accuracy. While satellite-based insolation data could improve ET retrieval in more humid regions with greater cloud-cover frequency, over the California Delta and climatologically similar regions in the western U.S., the CFSR data may suffice for real-time ET modeling efforts.

TI  - A Landscape Management Analysis Framework And Its Preliminary Application In Ejina Oasis, Northwest China
JO  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
PY  - 2019
AB  - The implementation of integrated landscape management to support local and regional human well-being is crucial in arid regions, but its application to date is very limited. Although analytical frameworks have been established to maximize ecosystem services via trade-offs between different landscape configurations, consumption factors such as water resources are rarely and weakly considered in such frameworks. In this paper, an improved integrated landscape-management analysis framework, called the Consumption-integrated Landscape Management to Ecosystem Service (CLMES), is proposed. In this framework, consumption factors are integrated at the same level as ecosystem services. The improved analytical framework is then used to assess and optimize landscape design in the Ejina Oasis, an extremely arid region in western China. Three landscape conditions (past, current, and future) are evaluated, based on the CLMES. Our results indicate that the Heihe River water-allocation program effectively promoted ecosystem services in the Ejina Oasis from 2000 to 2011. However, the excessive expansion of cropland led to a slight decline in habitat quality. An optimized landscape configuration and policy suggestions are proposed, which may be beneficial to the improvement of total water-use efficiency, oasis stability, and resilience of the ecological-social system in the Ejina Oasis.

TI  - Prevalence Of Depression And Predictors Of Discharge To A Psychiatric Hospital In Young People With Hospital-Treated Deliberate Self-Poisoning At An Australian Sentinel Unit
JO  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
PY  - 2022
AB  - Objective: Hospital treated deliberate self-poisoning is common in young people. Internationally, estimates of rates of depression in this population are very wide (14.6% to 88%). The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of depression and the independent predictors of referral for psychiatric hospitalisation in young people (aged 16 to 25 years) following an index episode of hospital treated deliberate self-poisoning. Method: A retrospective cohort study design (n = 1410), with data drawn from a population-based clinical case register. Unadjusted and adjusted estimates of predictors of referral for psychiatric admission (after-care) used logistic regression models. Results: Prevalence of any depression diagnosis was 35.5% (n = 500); and 25.4% (n = 358) were referred for a psychiatric admission. The adjusted estimates for predictors of psychiatric inpatient referral were: high suicidal level (OR 118.21: CI 95% 63.23–220.99), low/moderate suicidal level (14.27: 9.38–21.72), any depression (2.88: 1.97–4.22), any psychosis (4.06; 1.15–14.36), older age (1.12: 1.04–1.21), and number of support people (0.88: 0.78–0.98). Conclusion: Depression was diagnosed in more than a third and was an independent predictor of psychiatric inpatient referral, so service providers need to account for this level of need in the provision of assessment and after-care services. Evidence-based guidelines for psychiatric inpatient after-care for deliberate self-poisoning and/or depression in young people are limited. Our explanatory model included suicidal level, depression, psychosis, older age, and available support persons, suggesting that the treating clinicians were making these discharge decisions for admission in keeping with those limited guidelines, although the balance of benefits and harms of psychiatric hospitalisation are not established. Future research examining patient experiences, effectiveness of psychiatric hospitalisation, and alternatives to hospitalisation is warranted. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Real-World Data Analytics Fit For Regulatory Decision-Making
JO  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LAW \& MEDICINE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Healthcare database analyses (claims, electronic health records) have been identified by various regulatory initiatives, including the 21(st) Century Cures Act and Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as useful supplements to randomized clinical trials to generate evidence on the effectiveness, harm, and value of medical products in routine care. Specific applications include accelerated drug approval pathways and secondary indications for approved medical products. Such real-world data ("RWD") analyses reflect how medical products impact health outside a highly controlled research environment. A constant stream of data from the routine operation of modern healthcare systems that can be analyzed in rapid cycles enables incremental evidence development for regulatory decision-making. Key evidentiary needs by regulators include 1) monitoring of medication performance in routine care, including the effectiveness, safety and value; 2) identifying new patient strata in which a drug may have added value or unacceptable harms; and 3) monitoring targeted utilization. Four broad requirements have been proposed to enable successful regulatory decision-making based on healthcare database analyses (collectively, "MVET"): Meaningful evidence that provides relevant and context-informed evidence sufficient for interpretation, drawing conclusions, and making decisions; valid evidence that meets scientific and technical quality standards to allow causal interpretations: expedited evidence that provides incremental evidence that is synchronized with the decision-making process; and transparent evidence that is audible, reproducible, robust, and ultimately trusted by decision-makers. Evidence generation systems that satisfy MVET requirements to a high degree will contribute to effective regulatory decision-making. Rapid-cycle analytics of healthcare databases is maturing at a time when regulatory overhaul increasingly demands such evidence. Governance, regulations, and data quality are catching up as the utility of this resource is demonstrated in multiple contexts.

End-user organizations directly involved in the project include the World Health Organization, European research institutes, and several organizations based in Africa. Earth observation provides a broad range of information types: digital elevation maps, urban maps, cartography, maps of water bodies, vegetation maps, land surface temperature maps, and monitoring of wind-blown Sahelian dust. This information is used in applications such as malaria and meningococcal meningitis epidemic early warning, in planning fieldwork campaigns for research into the Ebola virus's reservoir, and in the management of development projects in public health. This paper describes the work done in the DUE EPIDEMIC project and the potential benefits that earth observation can bring to the epidemiological research.

TI  - Experimental Study On Precise Recognition Of Settlements In Mountainous Areas Based On Uav Image And Lidar Point Cloud
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - As the main type of ground objects in mountainous environment, mountain settlement is also an important subject to monitor for the prevention of geological disasters. The accurate and fast identification of mountain settlement is essential for disaster monitoring and rural planning. The fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data has attracted widespread attention for remote sensing. Equipped with high-definition cameras, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) can capture the image data with plenty of information about spectral texture, while the airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging, LiDAR) equipped with high precision sensors is capable to locate objects precisely. Combining the advantages shown by the two kinds of data features enables the integration of two kinds of data, thus supplementing the advantages of spatial information and optical information. This paper aims at addressing the inaccuracy of boundary extraction in the existing methods of mountain settlement extraction and the limitation on the use of manual features to express image information. A mountainous settlement classification method is proposed by combining the feature information of LiDAR data and UAV image data sources. According to the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the experimental results, when the point cloud data with fused spectral information is oriented to the precise identification of mountainous areas, the RMSE (root-mean-square error, RMSE) value of building boundaries is relatively stable, ranging between 0 and 0.2 m through comparison of the calculation results with the actual data. The overall accuracy evaluation index of the extracted building area is determined to exceed 80\%, which is higher than the other two single data sources extracted from the mountain settlement information. Besides, the extracted contour lines are made clearer, which suggests the classification advantages of the point cloud data fused with image information. It is demonstrated that the classification method is conducive to the accurate identification of mountain settlements, which indicates its practical value in the accurate identification of mountain settlements.

TI  - Synergy Of Gis And Remote Sensing Data In Forest Fire Danger Modeling
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2008
AB  - Forest fires constitute an important problem for the environment degradation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Fire Risk Index (DFRI) that takes into account different static and dynamic factors of risk for fire occurrence. Variables like insolation hours, vegetation cover, altitude, slope, proximity to main roads, and fire statistics have been used to develop a Static Fire Risk Index (SFRI) using a logistic regression model. Using satellite data to derive water stress of forest, a new dynamic index is defined weighting the static index with the actual value of water stress indicators. This methodology has been previously tested for some fires in the Canary Islands (Spain), and, in this case, we prove its usefulness using both NOAA-AVHRR and Terra-MODIS sensors data. As test sites, two different fires that took place in September 2005 on La Palma Island and August 2007 on Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain) have been considered in order to validate the suitability of these tools for a regional scale application, in an area where multiple microclimates are present mainly due to its steep orography and the trade winds. © 2009 IEEE.

TI  - Comparison Of Predictor Sets For Species Richness And The Number Of Rare Species Of Butterflies And Birds
JO  - Journal of Biogeography
PY  - 2007
AB  - Aim: Accurate inventories of biota are typically restricted to few locations within an extensive region. Accordingly, effective planning must involve some form of surrogate measures coupled with spatial modelling. We conducted a simultaneous comparison of models of both species richness and the number of rare species using three types of surrogates (indicator species, vegetation composition and structure, and topoclimate) as predictors. We evaluated each type of surrogate alone and in combination with others. Location: Data for our analyses were collected from 1996-2004 in three adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA), the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range and Toquima Range. Methods: Data on species richness and species composition of butterflies and birds and measures of vegetation composition and structure were obtained in the field. Topoclimatic variables were derived by GIS from digital sources and satellite images. We used Poisson regression with Bayesian model averaging to predict species richness and the number of rare species. We compared the expected prediction success of all models on the basis of internal and external validation trials. Results: Same-taxon indicator species were the most accurate predictors of species richness and of the number of rare species of butterflies and birds. Cross-taxon indicator species and topoclimate variables were reasonably accurate predictors of species richness of butterflies and birds and of the number of rare butterfly species. Although vegetation variables were more effective for predicting species richness and number of rare species of birds than of butterflies, they were the least accurate predictors overall. Main conclusions: Although indicator species may provide the most accurate predictions of species richness, their practical value, like any surrogate measure, depends greatly on ecological considerations and land-use context. In general, the ability to predict numbers of rare species based on any set of candidate predictors was weaker than the ability to predict species richness, which may result from the high degree of stochasticity that often characterizes distributions of rare species. Our statistical approach for objective examination of different candidate predictors can help ensure that selection of species-richness surrogates in any system is scientifically reliable and cost-effective. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Sar Imagery And Novel Integration Of Nature-Inspired Algorithms Into Support Vector Regression
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Flood has long been known as one of the most catastrophic natural hazards worldwide. Mapping flood-prone areas is an important part of flood disaster management. In this study, a flood susceptibility mapping frame-work was developed based on a novel integration of nature-inspired algorithms into support vector regression (SVR). To this end, various remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) datasets were applied to the hybridized SVR models to map flood susceptibility in Ahwaz township, Iran. The proposed framework has two main steps: 1) updating the flood inventory (historical flooded locations) using the proposed RS-based flood detection method developed within the google earth engine (GEE) platform. The mosaicked images of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been used in this step; 2) producing flood sus-ceptibility map using the standalone SVR and hybridized model of SVR. The hybridized methods were derived from a novel integration of SVR with meta-heuristic algorithms, hence forming the SVR-bat algorithm (SVR-BA), SVR-invasive weed optimization (SVR-IWO), and SVR-firefly algorithm (SVR-FA). A spatial database of flood locations and 11 conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to stream, curvature, rainfall, soil type, and land use/cover) were built for the susceptibility modelling. The accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated using the statistical and sensitivity indices, such as root mean square error (RMSE), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) index. The results indicated that all hybridized models out-performed the standalone SVR. According to AUROC values, the predictive power of the SVR-FA was the highest with the value of 0.81, followed by SVR-IWO, SVR-BA, and SVR with values of 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively.

TI  - Introducing Artmo’s Machine-Learning Classification Algorithms Toolbox: Application To Plant-Type Detection In A Semi-Steppe Iranian Landscape
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Accurate plant-type (PT) detection forms an important basis for sustainable land management maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this sense, Sentinel-2 satellite images of the Copernicus program offer spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric characteristics with great potential for mapping and monitoring PTs. In addition, the selection of a best-performing algorithm needs to be considered for obtaining PT classification as accurate as possible. To date, no freely downloadable toolbox exists that brings the diversity of the latest supervised machine-learning classification algorithms (MLCAs) together into a single intuitive user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). To fill this gap and to facilitate and automate the usage of MLCAs, here we present a novel GUI software package that allows systematically training, validating, and applying pixel-based MLCA models to remote sensing imagery. The so-called MLCA toolbox has been integrated within ARTMO’s software framework developed in Matlab which implements most of the state-of-the-art methods in the machine learning community. To demonstrate its utility, we chose a heterogeneous case study scene, a landscape in Southwest Iran to map PTs. In this area, four main PTs were identified, consisting of shrub land, grass land, semi-shrub land, and shrub land–grass land vegetation. Having developed 21 MLCAs using the same training and validation, datasets led to varying accuracy results. Gaussian process classifier (GPC) was validated as the top-performing classifier, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 90%. GPC follows a Laplace approximation to the Gaussian likelihood under the supervised classification framework, emerging as a very competitive alternative to common MLCAs. Random forests resulted in the second-best performance with an OA of 86%. Two other types of ensemble-learning algorithms, i.e., tree-ensemble learning (bagging) and decision tree (with error-correcting output codes), yielded an OA of 83% and 82%, respectively. Following, thirteen classifiers reported OA between 70% and 80%, and the remaining four classifiers reported an OA below 70%. We conclude that GPC substantially outperformed all classifiers, and thus, provides enormous potential for the classification of a diversity of land-cover types. In addition, its probabilistic formulation provides valuable band ranking information, as well as associated predictive variance at a pixel level. Nevertheless, as these are supervised (data-driven) classifiers, performances depend on the entered training data, meaning that an assessment of all MLCAs is crucial for any application. Our analysis demonstrated the efficacy of ARTMO’s MLCA toolbox for an automated evaluation of the classifiers and subsequent thematic mapping. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Using Satellite Systems To Improve The Management Of Fresh Water Resources
JO  - AIAA 57th International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2006
PY  - 2006
AB  - Fresh water is a critical element for the environment and for sustaining human life. The fresh water cycle is characterized by several complex interactions in which evaporation, transpiration, precipitation, runoff, and ground water aquifers all interact. However, human activity has altered the natural water cycle at all levels, through climate impact, water usage, agriculture, and a variety of land use practices, including extensive urbanization. Better weather and climate information and forecasts about the geospatial distribution and amount of precipitation throughout the year can improve our ability to use fresh water more efficiently. In particular, improved decision support tools and forecasts can contribute to the improvement of water management practices. Such information holds sizable social and economic value for individuals, families, and for industry alike. In the United States and many other countries, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) environmental satellites and other satellite systems provide essential inputs to weather and climate forecast models necessary for estimating precipitation and other water-related information. Data from NASA's EO research satellites can contribute to the future development of vital new water management information systems. This paper presents interim results of an ongoing study of the economic and social benefits of using satellite systems to improve the assessment and management of fresh water resources in the United States.

TI  - Research Progress On Exposure And Health Effects Of Green Space
JO  - Journal of Environmental and Occupational Medicine
PY  - 2021
AB  - Accumulating studies suggest that green space exposure is related to a variety of health benefits; however, limited studies have been conducted in China. We reviewed the methods of exposure assessment, study designs, and main findings of previous studies regarding to green space exposure and its acute and chronic health effects. In the aspect of exposure assessments, different types of indicators were employed in the epidemiological studies, such as land use types of green space, greenness index retrieved from satellite remote sensing data, and green space expsosure data extracted from the images of street view. Epidemiological studies of green space exposure have the following features: 1) The majority of the studies were conducted in developed countries rather than developing ones; 2) Green space exposure was suggested to have potential health effects in various stages of the life cycle from pregnancy, infancy, adolescence, adulthood to senior years; 3) Results were consistent that exposure to green space might improve birth weight and be protective against mortality, whereas failed to be consistent on other health outcomes; 4) The mechanisms of health benefits of green space were still unclear. © 2021, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

TI  - <I>Prosopis Juliflora</I> Management And Grassland Restoration In Baringo County, Kenya: Opportunities For Soil Carbon Sequestration And Local Livelihoods
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
PY  - 2021
AB  - Climate change, land degradation and invasive alien species (IAS) threaten grassland ecosystems worldwide. IAS clearing and grassland restoration would help to reduce the negative effects of IAS, restore the original vegetation cover and sustain livelihoods while contributing to climate change mitigation, but uncertain financial benefits to local stakeholders hamper such efforts. This study assessed where and when net financial benefit could be realized from Prosopis juliflora management and subsequent grassland restoration by combining ecological, social and financial information. Impacts of Prosopis invasion and grassland degradation on soil organic carbon (SOC) in nine sublocations in Baringo County, Kenya, were evaluated. Then the financial impacts of Prosopis removal and grassland restoration in the area were calculated and spatially explicit management scenarios for each sublocation modelled, combining geographical information derived from satellite images taken in different years of the invasion with SOC data and socio-economic data collected in the sublocations. The expanding Prosopis distribution and density since 1995 have increased cumulated SOC storage on former bare land or degraded grasslands. On former pristine or restored grasslands, however, Prosopis invasion has reduced total SOC storage. Prosopis removal and grassland restoration are predicted to yield financial benefits through charcoal made from removed trees, increased cattle numbers and carbon credits. However, a trade-off between increased SOC and net financial benefit was found. The predicted net SOC increase would contribute around one-tenth, at most, to the net financial benefit. The available budget, based on Baringo households' average willingness to pay, would enable removal, on average, of one-fifth of Prosopis per sublocation in a single year. A larger area can be cleared if Prosopis is sparse than if it is dense. The analyses show that in some sublocations, households' annual investments could result in restoration of all former grassland areas. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how integrating and linking detailed ecological, social and financial geodata to develop accurate and realistic invasive alien species management scenarios can illustrate costs and benefits of management interventions in a spatial context. Such scenarios should be used more extensively to support land management decisions.

TI  - Simulating Human Impacts On Global Water Resources Using Vic-5
JO  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2020
AB  - Questions related to historical and future water resources and scarcity have been addressed by several macroscale hydrological models. One of these models is the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. However, further model developments were needed to holistically assess anthropogenic impacts on global water resources using VIC. Our study developed VIC-WUR, which extends the VIC model using (1) integrated routing, (2) surface and groundwater use for various sectors (irrigation, domestic, industrial, energy, and livestock), (3) environmental flow requirements for both surface and groundwater systems, and (4) dam operation. Global gridded datasets on sectoral demands were developed separately and used as an input for the VIC-WUR model. Simulated national water withdrawals were in line with reported Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) national annual withdrawals (adjusted R-2 > 0.8), both per sector and per source. However, trends in time for domestic and industrial water withdrawal were mixed compared with previous studies. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies were well represented (global mean root-mean-squared error, RMSE, values of 1.9 and 3.5mm for annual and interannual anomalies respectively), whereas groundwater depletion trends were overestimated. The implemented anthropogenic impact modules increased simulated stream-flow performance for 370 of the 462 anthropogenically impacted Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) monitoring stations, mostly due to the effects of reservoir operation. An assessment of environmental flow requirements indicates that global water withdrawals have to be severely limited (by 39 \%) to protect aquatic ecosystems, especially with respect to groundwater withdrawals. VIC-WUR has potential for studying the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic developments on current and future water resources and sector-specific water scarcity. The additions presented here make the VIC model more suited for fully integrated worldwide water resource assessments.

TI  - Simulating Soybean-Rice Rotation And Irrigation Strategies In Arkansas, Usa Using Apex
JO  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
PY  - 2020
AB  - With population growth and resource depletion, maximizing the efficiency of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping systems is urgently needed. The goal of this study was to shed light on precise irrigation amounts and optimal agronomic practices via simulating rice-rice and soybean-rice crop rotations in the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. The APEX model was calibrated using observations from five fields under soybean-rice rotation in Arkansas from 2017 to 2019 and remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) values to assess modeled vegetation growth. Different irrigation practices were assessed, including conventional flooding (CVF), known as cascade, multiple inlet rice irrigation with polypipe (MIRI), and furrow irrigation (FIR). The amount of water used differed between fields, following each field's measured or estimated input. Moreover, fields were managed with either continuous flooding (CF) or alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation. Two 20-year scenarios were simulated to test yield changes: (1) between rice-rice and soybean-rice rotation and (2) under reduced irrigation amounts. After calibration with crop yield and LAI, the modeled LAI correlated to the observations with R2 values greater than 0.66, and the percent bias (PBIAS) values were within 32%. The PBIAS and percent difference for modeled versus observed yield were within 2.5% for rice and 15% for soybean. Contrary to expectation, the rice-rice and soybean-rice rotation yields were not statistically significant. The results of the reduced irrigation scenario differed by field, but reducing irrigation beyond 20% from the original amount input by the farmers significantly reduced yields in all fields, except for one field that was over-irrigated. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Lithologic Mapping Using Random Forests Applied To Geophysical And Remote-Sensing Data: A Demonstration Study From The Eastern Goldfields Of Australia
JO  - Geophysics
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia is one of the world's premier gold-producing regions; however, large areas of prospective bedrock are under cover and lack detailed lithologic mapping. Away from the near-mine environment, exploration for new gold prospects requires mapping geology using the limited data available with robust estimates of uncertainty. We used the machine learning algorithm Random Forests (RF) to classify the lithology of an underexplored area adjacent to the historically significant Junction gold mine, using geophysical and remote-sensing data, with no geochemical sampling available at this reconnaissance stage. Using a sparse training sample, 1.6% of the total ground area, we produce a refined lithologic map. The classification is stable, despite including parts of the study area with later intrusions and variable cover depth, and it preserves the stratigraphic units defined in the training data. We assess the uncertainty associated with this new RF classification using information entropy, identifying those areas of the refined map that are most likely to be incorrectly classified. We find that information entropy correlates well with inaccuracy, providing a mechanism for explorers to direct future expenditure toward areas most likely to be incorrectly mapped or geologically complex. We conclude that the method can be an effective additional tool available to geoscientists in a greenfield, orogenic gold setting when confronted with limited data. We determine that the method could be used either to substantially improve an existing map, or produce a new map, taking sparse observations as a starting point. It can be implemented in similar situations (with limited outcrop information and no geochemical data) as an objective, data-driven alternative to conventional interpretation with the additional value of quantifying uncertainty. © The Authors.

TI  - Rice Crop Phenology Model To Monitor Rice Planting And Harvesting Time Using Remote Sensing Approach
PY  - 2021
AB  - Rice is one of the most significant food commodity products in Indonesia. The production of rice in 2019 reached 49.8 million tons. On a global scale, rice is consumed by half of the human population around the world. This study will support the development of sustainable natural resources management, which is an important thing to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals in zero poverty and zero hunger. Remote sensing is a useful instrument to monitor natural resources. This study used Sentinel-2 imageries to extract rice phenology using vegetation indices (NDVI and NDWI), then acquired the planting and harvesting time using the temporal analysis. The NDVI value is showing a parabolic curve regarding the planting stage of the rice. The value of NDVI is high in the transplanting stage but decreases in the harvesting phase. Besides that, in the seedling and transplanting stage, NDWI has a higher value than NDVI. However, in tillering until the harvesting phase, NDWI has a similar characteristic but lower value than NDVI. Based on the spatial and temporal distribution of rice planting and harvesting date, it is known that climate is not a resistant factor, especially the irrigated rice field. Nevertheless, in the rainfed rice field, the planting time depends on climate conditions.

TI  - Risk Assessment Of Alien Azolla Filiculoides Lam In Anzali Lagoon Using Remote Sensing Imagery
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Long-term evaluation of the population change trend of different plant species in lagoons is of great importance in preserving the environment. Lagoons are the fundamental habitats for aquatic biodiversity conservation, which has at least one relatively narrow connection to the sea. In this research, Landsat time-series data are used to investigate the changes in Azolla (or green devil) expansion, and its effective factors over 30 years from the arrival of this aquatic fern from 1988 to 2018 in the International Lagoon of Anzali in the North of Iran using the spectral angular mapper (SAM) method and related field data. The results indicated that (1) the changes of Azolla plant expansion have a direct correlation with the volume of lagoon water and rainfall and an inverse relation with the region temperature, (2) The spread of Azolla has not been steady over three decades, increasing in some years and decreasing in others, (3) The high Azolla surface cover has caused environmental hazards in the lagoon and has reduced the value in the eastern, southwestern, and partly central parts of the area. Therefore, in order to maintain balance in the natural ecosystem of Anzali Lagoon, fundamental decisions must be made for determining the range and shelter of the lagoon and controlling the outflow of water resources. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.

TI  - Analysis Of Impervious Surface And Suburban Form Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
JO  - Environmental Remote Sensing and Systems Analysis
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban areas are spatially and ecologically complex, and planning for their growth is data intensive. This is particularly true in suburban areas dominated by continuous urban sprawl. Galster (2001) noted that this term is not easily defined but generally refers to the patterns, processes, causes, and consequences of low-density and segregated land use development in populated places. The potential of sprawling suburban development to impact water quality is well documented (Bowen and Valiela 2001; Interlandi and Crockett 2003; Tu et al. 2007). Some analysts had estimated that substantial declines in watershed health begin to occur with as little as 10% impervious cover (Arnold and Gibbons 1996). Sprawl poses a unique threat to urban surface water quality in part because it incorporates an extensive array of impervious features, such as roads, rooftops, and parking lots. This threat can add to the fiscal strain placed on growing municipalities already financing stormwater management with special fees and utilities (Kasperson 2001). On the other hand, low-density suburban areas can accommodate an arrangement of open space that actually mitigates stormwater volume and pollution (Moglen and Kim 2007). Such a result is indicative of a proper spatial understanding of the relationship between suburban land use and surface water quality (Brabec et al. 2002). © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems Provide Lasting Glycemic Benefit In Type 1 And 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review
JO  - Medical Clinics of North America
PY  - 2015
AB  - Internet blood glucose monitoring systems (IBGMS) are associated with improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are pharmacologically managed, using oral agents or insulin. IBGMS improves glycemic levels in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). IBGMS has not led to increased hypoglycemia. Mechanisms underlying IBGMS-associated glycemic improvement extend beyond optimizing insulin dose titration. The most important effects seem to be associated with increased patient self-motivation and improved patient-physician communication. IBGMS have been recommended in clinical practice guidelines, and their effectiveness and safety in trials suggest that this approach is appropriate for patients with T1D or T2D. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In view of the economic, social and ecological importance of Canada's forest ecosystems, there is a growing interest in studying the response of these ecosystems to climate change. Accurate knowledge regarding growth trajectories is needed for both policy makers and forest managers to ensure sustainability of the forest resource. However, results of previous analyses regarding the sign and magnitude of trends have often diverged. The main objective of this paper was to analyse the current state of scientific knowledge on growth and productivity trends in Canada's forests and provide some explanatory elements for contrasting observations. The three methods that are commonly used for assessments of tree growth and forest productivity (i.e. forest inventory data, tree-ring records, and satellite observations) have different underlying physiological assumptions and operate on different spatiotemporal scales, which complicates direct comparisons of trend values between studies. Within our systematic review of 44 peer-reviewed studies, half identified increasing trends for tree growth or forest productivity, while the other half showed negative trends. Biases and uncertainties associated with the three methods may explain some of the observed discrepancies. Given the complexity of interactions and feedbacks between ecosystem processes at different scales, researchers should consider the different approaches as complementary, rather than contradictory. Here, we propose the integration of these different approaches into a single framework that capitalizes on their respective advantages while limiting associated biases. Harmonization of sampling protocols and improvement of data processing and analyses would allow for more consistent trend estimations, thereby providing greater insight into climate-change related trends in forest growth and productivity. Similarly, a more open data-sharing culture should speed-up progress in this field of research.

TI  - Spatial Finance: Practical And Theoretical Contributions To Financial Analysis
JO  - Journal of Sustainable Finance and Investment
PY  - 2022
AB  - We introduce and define a new concept, ‘Spatial Finance’, as the integration of geospatial data and analysis into financial theory and practice, and describe how developments in earth observation, particularly as the result of new satellite constellations, combined with new artificial intelligence methods and cloud computing, create a plethora of potential applications for Spatial Finance. We argue that Spatial Finance will become a core future competency for financial analysis, and this will have significant implications for information markets, risk modelling and management, valuation modelling, and the identification of investment opportunities. The paper reviews the characteristics of geospatial data and related technology developments, some current and future applications of Spatial Finance, and its potential impact on financial theory and practice. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Space Technology For Disaster Management: Data Access And Its Place In The Community
PY  - 2007
AB  - The ways in which remotely sensed data can be used to manage and alleviate the consequences of natural disasters have never been fully exploited. If prediction of impending disaster is to be useful, those affected by catastrophe and those who come to their aid must work together. A global strategy based on a vision for disaster management will fail if those affected by hazards are not involved in their own disaster preparation, relief efforts and rehabilitation. Local people are experts in ground knowledge; all that is needed is for those with expertise in remote sensing to pass on their skills, knowledge and data in a way that can be understood and valued. To do this, those threatened by catastrophe must understand how disaster relates to their lives, how satellite data can be used with confidence to prepare for local hazards and how to apply information that can help lessen the effects of catastrophe. This can be achieved by making available remotely sensed images with simple explanations that enhance vegetation, topography and geology. With timely, reliable information, preventive measures can be taken; surface features identified on satellite images can guide refugee placement and hazards can be anticipated and contained.

TI  - Predicting Environmental Suitability And Geographical Distribution Of <I>Dicrocoelium Dendriticum</I> At Littoral Of Caspian Sea: An Ecological Niche-Based Modeling
JO  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
PY  - 2019
AB  - Dicrocoeliasisis caused by the small liver fluke (Dicrocoelium spp.), mainly Dicrocoelium dendriticum in domestic and wild ruminants. The small liver fluke is the probable predisposing cause of economic burden. The impact of geographic and climatic factors on the incidence of dicrocoeliasis has been severely ignored in different geographical areas. Due to the lack of data regarding dicrocoeliasis in Iran, this study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and intensity of ovine and bovine Dicrocoelium infection in the coastal strip south of the Caspian Sea. Fecal samples were obtained from the cattle and sheep in three provinces of Guilan, Mazandaran and Golestan at the littoral of the Caspian Sea. All collected samples were then tested by flotation methods for determining the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG). Moreover, we applied maximum entropy niche-based modeling (MaxEnt), coupled with remote sensing and the Geographical Information System (GIS) to visualize the spatial distribution and risk factors of Dicrocoelium dendriticum at the littoral of Caspian Sea. A total of 2688 stool samples were collected from cattle (n = 1344) and sheep (n = 1344) in coastal provinces of the Caspian Sea including Guilan (n = 1280), Mazandaran (n = 768) and Golestan (n = 640) provinces. Based on the data presented here, the highest rate of infection was observed in Guilan and Mazandaran provinces. The results revealed the prevalence rates of 36.72\% and 6.09\% for sheep and cattle in Guilan province, respectively. This rate was 22.4\% for sheep and 3.91\% for cattle in Mazandaran province. However, the rate of sheep infection was 90\% in some point locations. Dicrocoelium infection was found to be significantly different between three provinces in sheep (P < 0.00001, Chi = 111.633). Our findings exhibited a high reliability of the MaxEnt model, and area under the curve (AUC) values of the training and test data sets were determined to be 0.852 and 0.818, respectively. Jackknife analysis showed the relative variable contribution to the model performance, where four variables were found as key influential factors that highly affected the habitat suitability of the presence of the lancet fluke including the precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17), altitude, temperature seasonality (Bio4), and precipitation of driest month (Bio14). The findings of this study demonstrated a high presence rate of Dicrocoelium infection at the littoral of Caspian Sea, Iran. Moreover, climatic variables can be considered as important predictive factors affecting the distribution of infection in the studied areas. Further studies based on the findings of the GIS are also very important in the country for planning control programs.

TI  - Knowledge-Based Raster Mapping Approach To Wetland Assessment: A Case Study In Suzhou, China
JO  - WETLANDS
PY  - 2016
AB  - We present a knowledge-based raster mapping (KBRM) approach to assessing wetlands based on the wetland-environment model, which is built by local experts using their knowledge and experience. The Delphi method and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were employed to improve the consistency and the quality of the elicited expert knowledge. The environmental factors selected by local experts include edge density, aquatic connectivity, water-body density, road density, urban area density, vegetation screening index, and slope gradient. The experts assigned weights to those environmental factors and created optimality function curves to characterize the relationships between individual factors and the wetland condition. At each raster cell, an optimality value for each environmental factor was calculated based on the local value of that factor, and an overall optimality score was then calculated as the weighted average of the optimality values for individual factors. As a case study, we implemented this approach in assessing the wetlands in Suzhou, China. While our approach does not directly require field information, its result is comparable with the result of the rapid field method that is directly based on field data. In addition, our approach is advantageous in representing interior details of a wetland.

TI  - Remote Sensing The Environmental Effects Of Afforestation Projects: Multi- And Hyperspectral Temporal Analysis For Punjab, India
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2012
AB  - This project enhances the understanding of reforestation and land cover dynamics in Punjab, India: the "grain bowl" of India. Using multi- And hyperspectral satellite datasets, we investigate the impacts of reforestation and afforestation on agriculture, biodiversity, and the subsequent economic benefits. In coordination with NASA's Mesoamerican Regional Visualization and Monitoring System (SERVIR), and the University of Alabama in Huntsville, we have analysed Landsat ETM+ and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) multispectral images as well as Hyperion hyperspectral images acquired from 2004 - 2011. Using GIS and image processing software, ArcGIS 10 and ENVI 4.8, we analysed several aspects of land cover indicative of vegetation stress, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and liquid water index (LWI), we also used this GIS software to determine future land cover scenarios for Punjab. This paper reports on the current status of this on-going research. It focuses on the ways in which remote sensing is providing a unique perspective for the study of an often-overlooked process in environmental land management: afforestation and reforestation. This investigation of forested landscape recovery and its effects on rainfall, agriculture, and biodiversity will provide a template for scientific environmental modelling using remote sensing as well as satellite-based operational models of potential value to many deforested regions around the world.

TI  - Statistical Modeling Of Extreme Precipitation With Trmm Data
JO  - Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper improves upon an existing extreme precipitation monitoring system that is based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) daily product (3B42) using new statistical models. The proposed system utilizes a regional modeling approach in which data from similar locations are pooled to increase the quality of the resulting model parameter estimates to compensate for the short data record. The regional analysis is divided into two stages. First, the region defined by the TRMM measurements is partitioned into approximately 28 000 nonoverlapping clusters using a recursive k-means clustering scheme. Next, a statistical model is used characterize the extreme precipitation events occurring in each cluster. Instead of applying the block maxima approach used in the existing system, in which the generalized extreme value probability distribution is fit to the annual precipitation maxima at each site separately, the present work adopts the peak-over-threshold method of classifying points as extreme if they exceed a prespecified threshold. Theoretical considerations motivate using the point process framework for modeling extremes. The fitted parameters are used to estimate trends and to construct simple and intuitive average recurrence interval (ARI) maps that reveal how rare a particular precipitation event is. This information could be used by policy makers for disaster monitoring and prevention. The new method eliminates much of the noise that was produced by the existing models because of a short data record, producing more reasonable ARI maps when compared with NOAA's long-term Climate Prediction Center ground-based observations. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied to other extreme climate records. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Does Redd Plus Complement Law Enforcement? Evaluating Impacts Of An Incipient Initiative In Madre De Dios, Peru
JO  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
PY  - 2022
AB  - Subnational initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance carbon stocks (REDD+) have been implemented across the tropics over the last decade. Such initiatives are often embedded within pre-existing conservation policies, such as forest law enforcement, making it challenging to disentangle attributable impacts. In this article, we analyze a new REDD+ project implemented in Brazil nut concessions in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Public law enforcement to verify compliance with Peru's Forest Law was already ongoing and intensified locally during our study period. Thus, we combine longitudinal data from remote sensing and household surveys of 197 concessionaires in a before-after control-intervention (BACI) study design to: a) evaluate the project's impacts during the 2012-2018 period on deforestation, forest degradation, and the participants' wellbeing and b) assess how the law-enforcing field inspections may have complemented the project effects. Our results show that the REDD+ initiative had insignificant effects on deforestation and forest degradation, but confirm the curbing effects of the field inspection measures on forest loss. The non-significance of the REDD+ effects may reflect delays in cash incentive payments to enrolled concessionaires, lack of careful alignment of benefit provision with project participants, and limited enforcement of project conditionalities. Most REDD+ participants reported a reduced subjective wellbeing, which may reflect the frustrated expectations associated with project implementation. We discuss the implications of our results and outline lessons for similar tropical forest conservation initiatives.

TI  - Satellite Launch Vehicle Performance In Real Time - An Over View On The Evolution And Present Capability At Satish Dhawan Space Centre Shar
JO  - International Astronautical Federation - 56th International Astronautical Congress 2005
PY  - 2005
AB  - The performance monitoring of a satellite launch vehicle during flight is one of the primary tasks in a launch complex. The Real Time System (RTS) operates on a dedicated Real Time network, which supports three independent real time systems. The first one aids the flight safety officer with the required data to monitor the flight in real time based on tracking and telemetry data. It supports not only range safety decision making but also extends the mission displays till satellite injection. The second one processes the telemetry data to derive the vehicle parameters and to make it available elaborately on vehicle system consoles for sub-system specialists during flight and for quick-look analysis after the flight. Third one displays various instrumentation status at Mission Control Centre for the senior executives to monitor ground systems readiness and to provide synthesis to mission executives. The system also provides details from auto launch sequence and mission events including the orbit injection. Over the last three decades, the RTS has been evolved at Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR Range in a systematic way. The systems run on two independent dual redundant networks for redundancy. While setting up the hardware, network and the software, importance is given to reliability, fault tolerance and many performance enhancement features with value added attributes. The console displays are organized with novel concept to have connectivity to all servers on the network with menu driven radio buttons for selecting displays for pre launch phase and launch phase mission monitoring. Today, SDSC SHAR possesses a state-of-the-art facility and this paper provides a brief on the evolution, philosophy followed and on the real time system network.

TI  - Sar Small Satellite Constellations: Added Value Vs. Existing Earth Observation Space System
PY  - 2021
AB  - Small satellites offer important advantages in creating new opportunities for implementing spatially-distributed space-based systems in Constellations. In this paper we focus on new emerging earth observation application and concepts, that can be used or are being used to create data collection systems via small satellites. The "complementarity" of small satellite constellations in term of revisit/coverage/resolution/band/responsiveness versus existing asset like Copernicus and Italian assets such as COSMO Sky-Med has been also investigated with the purpose to provide an improvement on emergency management, infrastructure monitoring and other domains, with a wider use of "space technology" and to offer solution closer to user needs also in term of further temporal resolution improvement. In particular, the focus of the Small SAT Constellation is on the need to improve revisit time, change detection and responsiveness, having heterogeneous on board sources (e.g. radar, optical) and supplying more quickly the information needed for the decision making process. A space mission embarking SAR instrument is capable of "all-weather" observations, sensing the Area day and night and imaging through clouds. These aspects identify small satellite as the perfect asset for a quick response after the occurring of a natural disaster/damage being able to grant the necessary information over the area of interest in any condition.

TI  - From Skin To Bulk: An Adjustment Technique For Assimilation Of Satellite-Derived Temperature Observations In Numerical Models Of Small Inland Water Bodies
JO  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
PY  - 2016
AB  - Data Assimilation (DA) has been proposed for multiple water resources studies that require rapid employment of incoming observations to update and improve accuracy of operational prediction models. The usefulness of DA approaches in assimilating water temperature observations from different types of monitoring technologies (e. g., remote sensing and in-situ sensors) into numerical models of in-land water bodies (e. g., lakes and reservoirs) has, however, received limited attention. In contrast to in-situ temperature sensors, remote sensing technologies (e. g., satellites) provide the benefit of collecting measurements with better X-Y spatial coverage. However, assimilating water temperature measurements from satellites can introduce biases in the updated numerical model of water bodies because the physical region represented by these measurements do not directly correspond with the numerical model's representation of the water column. This study proposes a novel approach to address this representation challenge by coupling a skin temperature adjustment technique based on available air and in-situ water temperature observations, with an ensemble Kalman filter based data assimilation technique. Additionally, the proposed approach used in this study for four-dimensional analysis of a reservoir provides reasonably accurate surface layer and water column temperature forecasts, in spite of the use of a fairly small ensemble. Application of the methodology on a test site-Eagle Creek Reservoir-in Central Indiana demonstrated that assimilation of remotely sensed skin temperature data using the proposed approach improved the overall root mean square difference between modeled surface layer temperatures and the adjusted remotely sensed skin temperature observations from 5.6 degrees C to 0.51 degrees C (i. e., 91\% improvement). In addition, the overall error in the water column temperature predictions when compared with in-situ observations also decreased from 1.95 degrees C (before assimilation) to 1.42 degrees C (after assimilation), thereby, giving a 27\% improvement in errors. In contrast, doing data assimilation without the proposed temperature adjustment would have increased this error to 1.98 degrees C (i. e., 1.5\% deterioration). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Impact Of Urban Imperviousness On Boundary Layer Meteorology And Air Chemistry On A Regional Scale
JO  - Meteorologische Zeitschrift
PY  - 2021
AB  - It has been long understood that land cover change from natural to impervious modif es the surface energy balance and hence the dynamical properties of the overlying atmosphere. The urban heat island is manifested in the formation of an urban boundary layer with distinct thermodynamic features that in turn govern transport processes of air pollutants. While many studies already demonstrated the benefit of urban canopy models (UCM) for atmospheric modelling, work on the impact on urban air chemistry is scarce. This study uses the state-of-the-art coupled chemistry-climate modelling system MECO(n) to assess the impact of the COSMO UCM TERRA_URB on the dynamics and gas phase chemistry in the boundary layer of the urban agglomeration Rhine-Main in Germany. Comparing the model results to ground observations and satellite and ground based remote sensing data, we found that the UCM experiment reduces the bias in temperature at the surface and throughout the boundary layer. This is true for ground level NO2 and ozone distribution as well. The application of MECO(n) for urban planning purposes is discussed by designing case studies representing two projected scenarios in future urban planning – densificati n of central urban areas and urban sprawl. Averaged over the core urban region and 10-days during a heat wave period in July 2018, model results indicate a warming of 0.7 K in surface temperature and 0.2 K in air temperature per 10 % increase in impervious surface area fraction. Within this period, a 50 % total increase of imperviousness accounts for a 3 K and 1 K spatially averaged warming respectively. This change in thermodynamic features results in a decrease of surface NO2 concentration by 10–20 % through increased turbulent mixing in areas with highest impervious fraction and highest emissions. In the evening and nighttime however, increased densificati n in the urban centre results in amplifie canyon blocking, which in turn results in average increase in near surface NO2 concentrations of about 10 %, compared to the status quo. This work intends to analyse regional scale features of surface-atmosphere interactions in an urban boundary layer and can be seen as preparatory work for higher resolution street scale models. © 2021 The authors.

TI  - Ecological Compensation Estimation Of Soil And Water Conservation Based On Cost-Benefit Analysis
JO  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2013
AB  - Soil and water conservation ecological compensation can be simply defined as a monetary payment to offset the environmental loss. An illustration is given in this study describing the payment compensation to water resource conservation and soil losses in Erlongshan reservoir catchment, China. A semi-distributed hydrological SWAT model was applied to establish compensation standard considering six scenarios of land use changes by combined application of remote sensing and geographic information systems. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) method is applied to evaluate the function of soil and water conservation, of which marginal opportunity cost and market value methods have been explored calculate the cost and benefit of water and soil conservation ecological function from provider and beneficiaries. Finally the ecological compensation of soil and water conservation for different land-use scenarios is calculated incorporating benefit apportion coefficient. The results provide an economically evaluated and market-oriented standard for the study of eco-compensation of environmental services and will be of great benefit to the implementation of soil and water conservation at a mesoscale catchment scale.

PY  - 2022
AB  - The normal methods for monitoring environmental pollution with image data have many false positives. Therefore, this study is proposing a single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) (a variant of NS)-based method as a decision-making model using intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher generalized Shapley Choquet integral operators for feature extraction and automatic material classification in mining area using satellite data. The experimental results show that this decision-making model using intuitionistic fuzzy Hamacher generalized Shapley Choquet integral operators for feature extraction and automatic material classification can better predict the presence of four heavy metals, i.e., vanadium(V), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni) in the study area than other methods. For vanadium metal, the determination accuracies, namely, producer accuracy, user accuracy, overall accuracy, and Kappa were 94.5\%, 94.1\%, 93.88\%, and 0.93\%, respectively. It was found that the estimated results and the distribution trend of heavy metals are almost the same as in actual ground measurements.

TI  - Mangrove Species Classification With Uav-Based Remote Sensing Data And Xgboost
JO  - National Remote Sensing Bulletin
PY  - 2021
AB  - Mangrove forest provides huge value of ecosystem services, such as beach protection, siltation promotion, flood and wave prevention, preventing waves, and biodiversity maintenance. Species composition and diversity are key parameters for assessing the health of forest ecosystem, and the loss of species diversity often accelerates degradation of structure and function of forest ecosystem. Therefore, accurately monitoring species composition and spatio-temporal distribution of mangrove forest are helpful for timely and effective management and restoration measures, which can further retain the quality of the mangrove ecosystem and biodiversity. The traditional means of obtaining mangrove species information requires time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly field survey, however, it is difficult to further understand the continuous distribution of forest health. In contrast, remote sensing technology is more cost-effective and can achieve spatially continuous monitoring of mangrove species composition and health status. With the fast-developing fine-resolution multispectral satellites, the images are used for classifying mangrove species due to their rich spatial geometric information. However, compared to multispectral images that contain limited spectral information, hyperspectral data are more effective for tree species discrimination or classification due to hundreds or even thousands of continuous bands that can reflect vegetation functional traits (e.g. pigment content, specific leaf area and nitrogen content). Moreover, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point cloud can acquire details related to three-dimensional features of the vegetation structure. Traditionally, there are many data dimension reduction or feature extraction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA). However, these methods should combine with other classifiers in classification of plant species. To improve the classification accuracy and efficiency, this paper introduces a new machine learning method with both feature selection and classification functions-eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The rapidly growing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and portable sensors of hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR have provided higher quality remote sensing data. UAV-based remote sensing data can derive massive features of spectra, texture and structure, therefore, how to extract dominant features is a key issue to improve the efficiency and accuracy of mangrove species classification. With UAV-based hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR point cloud of the buffer area in Shenzhen Futian Mangrove Nature Reserve, this study aims to extract eight types of dominant features suitable for mangrove species classification using "feature_importance" property of XGBoost. The dominant features include: single feature derived from UAV-based hyperspectral imagery (spectral bands, vegetation indices and texture: F1-F3) and their fused feature (F4), single feature derived from UAV-based LiDAR point cloud (height and intensity feature: F5, F6) and their fused feature (F7), and fused feature coupling hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR point cloud. Synthetically considering species classification accuracy and mapping results, the classification model based on F8 feature held the best performance (overall accuracy was 96.41%, Moran's I was 0.5520). The classification performance based on fused feature of single data source (F4 and F7, overall accuracy was separately 96.74% and 90.64%) was superior than that of single feature (F1-F3, F5 and F6, overall accuracy was 90.31%, 92.20%, 91.96%, 87.66% and 81.99% respectively). The Moran's I of classification maps based on fused feature (F4, F7 and F8) and texture feature (F3) were greater than that of single feature (F1, F2, F5 and F6). Moreover, mangrove species classification models based on different dominant features have their own advantages on spatial mapping. The introduction of F3 effectively solved the common sal -and-pepper effect in the mapping results based on F1 and F2; moreover, the salt-and-pepper effect in the edge of classification images (near tidal flat area) was significantly improved in the mapping results based on F5, F7 and F8. We conclude that: (1) The combination of UAV-based remote sensing data and XGBoost is feasible to pixel-oriented accurate classification of mangrove species, the fusion feature of UAV-based hyperspectral image and LiDAR point cloud has the best classification effect when comprehensively comparing classification accuracy (OA) and mapping effect (Moran's I); (2) when fusing the different types of features derived from UAV-based hyperspectral or LiDAR data alone, the corresponding classification accuracy and mapping effect behaved better than the single feature derived from the same UAV data source; (3) XGBoost, a machine learning method with both feature selection and classification functions, has great potential in remote sensing image classification; (4) the intensity features derived from LiDAR point clouds are greatly affected by UAV flight strips, however, the height features are robust in mangrove species classification. Future research will focus on unmixing of hyperspectral data, fuzzy classification and radiation transfer models (such as PROSAIL) to improve the accuracy and interpretability of mangrove species classification. This paper demonstrated the feasibility of UAV-based remote sensing data and XGBoost in the pixel-oriented precise classification of mangrove species, which can provide scientific basis and technical support for three-dimensional monitoring of health, conservation and restoration for mangrove ecosystem. © 2021, Science Press.

AB  - Understanding the effectiveness of air pollution control policies is important for future policy making. China has implemented strict air pollution control policies since the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). There is still a lack of overall evaluation of the effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution improvement in China since the 11th FYP. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution control policies from 2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satellite remote sensing. We used the satellite-derived PM2.5 of 2005-2013 from one of our previous studies. For the data of 2014-2017, we developed a two-stage statistical model to retrieve satellite PM2.5 data using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD), assimilated meteorology, and land use data. The first stage is a day-specific linear mixed effects (LME) model and the second stage is a generalized additive model (GAM). Results show that the Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented in the 11th FYP period and focused on SO2 emissions control, had co-benefits with PM2.5 reductions. The increasing trends of PM2.5 pollution (1.88 and 3.14 mu g m(-3) year(-1) for all of China and the Jingjinji region in 2004-2007, p<0.005) were suppressed after 2007. The overall PM2.5 trend for all of China was -0.56 mu g m(-3) year(-1) with marginal significance (p = 0. 053) and PM2.5 concentrations in the Pearl River Delta region had a big drop (4.81 mu g m(-3) year(-1), p<0.001) in 2007-2010. The ECER policy during the 12th FYP period was basically an extension of the 11th FYP policy. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant which comprises primary particles and secondary particles such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemental carbon, etc. Since the ECER policy focused on single-pollutant control, it had shown great limitation for PM2.5 reductions. The PM2.5 concentrations did not decrease from 2010 to 2013 in polluted areas (p values of the trends were greater than 0.05). Therefore, China implemented two stricter policies: the 12th FYP on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions (APPC-KR) in 2012, and the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) in 2013. The goal of air quality improvement (especially PM2.5 concentration improvement) and measures for multi-pollutant control were proposed. These policies led to dramatic decreases in PM2.5 after 2013 (4.27 mu g m(-3) year(-1) for all of China in 2013-2017, p<0.001).

TI  - Improve Attached Residential Buildings Daylight Access Through Atrium Optimization In Hot Climate
JO  - Journal of Solar Energy Research
PY  - 2023
AB  - The construction industry tries to optimize energy consumption and reduce environmental damage. Lighting is an important parameter which is effective in energy consumption of buildings. The amount of light which is received on different floors of high-rise residential buildings is not the same. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the best optimal physical parameters of the atrium that can provide sufficient lighting to all building floors. This study analyses this issue in the humid subtropical climate of the Dezful city. A model was simulated by Grasshopper, then Honeybee and Ladybug plugins were used to evaluate each space lighting. Daylight autonomy and Useful daylight illuminance indices were considered to compare the proposed models. This research aimed to achieve the best position and elongation of the atrium and to optimize the dimensions as well as the setbacks of the atrium on the floors to receive the minimum light is required for residential spaces. Based on the results, the position of atriums can be selected according to occupancy hours, and east-west elongation illustrated the best performance. Using the obtained patterns can lead to introducing models that can increase the DLA value of the first floor in multi-story buildings by 3% to 8%. © The Author(s).

TI  - Estimation Method Of Soil Salinity Based On Remote Sensing Data Assimilation
JO  - Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery
PY  - 2022
AB  - Soil salinization seriously restricts sustainable agricultural development, and it is a main environmental problem in arid and semiarid regions. Therefore, the method of assimilating remote sensing data is used to monitor spatial and temporal information of soil salinity in a regional scale, which is of great significance to management of soil salinization. The feasibility of soil salinity estimation to assimilate HYDRUS-ID model and remote sensing data was explored by using ensemble KaLman filter. The study area was located in Shahaoqu Irrigation District of Hetao Irrigation District. The remote sensing data was obtained by GF-1 satellite. Spectral indexes were screened by gray correlation method, and inversion models of soil salinity at different depths were constructed by ridge regression models. Then remote sensing data was applied to HYDRUS-ID model by using ensemble Kalman filter to carry out assimilation study of soil salinity of different depths in a regional scale. The main conclusions were as follows:based on ridge regression models of soil salinity at different depths, R2 were above 0. 64 and RE were 0. 14 〜0. 22. Inversion accuracies were relatively good and inversion values were relatively accurate. In a single point scale, compared with inversion values and simulation values, assimilation values were closer to measured values. EFF of assimilation values were 0. 84〜0. 93 and their NER were 0. 61〜0. 73. They were all positive values. And their RMSE were reduced to 0. 006% 〜0.011%. These results showed the scheme of data assimilation improved simulation accuracies of HYDRUS-ID model. In a regional scale, r of assimilation values were above 0. 94 and their NER were above 0. 61. And they were better than r and NER of inversion values and simulation values. Meanwhile, with increase of depth, the accuracy of assimilation was decreased. The results indicated that data assimilation greatly improved simulation accuracies of soil salinity at different depths by using ensemble K aim an filter. The research result can provide certain reference value for improving monitoring accuracy of soil salinity in a regional scale. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial Assessment Of Ecological Vulnerability In Fuzhou District In China Using Remote Sensing And Gis
JO  - Nature Environment and Pollution Technology
PY  - 2017
AB  - With the growth of global population and intense land use changes, the problem of ecological vulnerability has become prominent. Assessment of ecological vulnerability bears significance in protection and restoration of the ecological environment. Assessment results for a given area can reveal regional characteristic differences in system vulnerability and provide basis for the rational use and protection of the natural environment. To analyse the ecological vulnerability in Fuzhou district in China and its causes, systematic assessment and zoning of ecosystem vulnerability were proposed. Using the remote sensing and geographic information system technologies, ecological vulnerability was spatially, explicitly, and comprehensively assessed. Results showed that the most vulnerable areas of Fuzhou district include Pingtan Comprehensive Experimental Area, Fuqing City, Fuzhou City and Changle City. Counties of Yongtai, Minhou and Minqing feature good vegetation coverages and low ecological vulnerability. In Fuzhou City, three zones, namely, Taijiang, Gulou and Cangshan Zones, feature high or extremely high percentage vulnerability. The other two zones comprise better ecosystems. Analysis of correlation coefficients between vulnerability value and various indices showed distinct factors of ecological vulnerability for each region. The main factors affecting the ecosystems in Fuqing, Jin'an Zone, and Changle City include climate, vegetation and soil, respectively, whereas the factors that simultaneously affect the ecosystem in Cangshan Zone consist of soil, land use, topography and vegetation. The key challenge in improving ecological vulnerability of these areas is optimization and coordination of land use/coverage under natural conditions. The results can provide basis and reference for future research and relevant formulation, such as the mode of selection of resource utilization and environmental protection, and improvement of key factors.

TI  - Incorporation Of Net Radiation Model Considering Complex Terrain In Evapotranspiration Determination With Sentinel-2 Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary mechanism of water transformation between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate ET estimation given complex terrain conditions is essential to guide water resource management in mountainous areas. This study is based on the ETWatch model driven by Sentinel-2 remote sensing data at a spatial resolution of 10 m incorporating a net radiation model considering the impact of a complex terrain. We tested our model with two years of data in two regions with a high relief near the Huairou (2020) and Baotianman (2019) weather stations. Regarding the validation results of the ET model, the coefficient of determination (R-2) reached 0.84 in Huairou and 0.86 in Baotianman, while the root mean square error (RMSE) value reached 0.59 mm in Baotianman and 0.82 mm in Huairou. The validation results indicated that the model is applicable in regions with a complex terrain, and the ET results can capture topographic textures. In terms of the slope aspect, the ET value on south-facing slopes is higher than that on north-facing slopes in both study areas. Accurate ET monitoring in mountainous regions with a high relief yields a profound meaning in obtaining a better understanding of the characteristics of heat and water fluxes at different vegetation growth stages and underlying surface types, which can provide constructive suggestions for water management in mountainous areas.

TI  - Identifying Habitats And Corridors Of An Invasive Plant, Ageratina Altissima, In An Urban Forest
JO  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
PY  - 2019
AB  - The spread of invasive plants in urban forests is of great concern to land managers and ecologists. Here, we analyse the distribution pattern and potential occurrence of a problematic invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, on Mt. Umyeon, in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea, using multiple species distribution modelling with geographic information system layers and a time series of Landsat 8 satellite imagery data. Also, we identify this species' potential dispersal corridors using a network-based landscape lattice approach. All five species distribution models performed well with a range of test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.843-0.899 with an average of 0.876. Distance from trails had the greatest effect on its occurrence probability, and generally exerted a negative influence within ca. 20m of trails, indicating that urban forest trails facilitate the spread of invasive plants. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, 7 August 2016 tasselled cap brightness index was an important variable having a negative effect on the presence of A. altissima. Elevation generally had a positive effect on its presence, although it was less important than tasselled cap brightness index. We explicitly detected the distribution pattern of high invasion risk corridors, mostly located on or around trails, which follow the central ridgeline of the study area. The results and approaches employed here can be useful for understanding, monitoring, and predicting invasive plant distribution and spread for the management of urban natural resources and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network -Support Vector Machine Model-Gaussian Process Regression: A New Machine Model For Predicting Monthly And Daily Rainfall
JO  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Rainfall prediction is an important issue in water resource management. Predicting rainfall helps researchers to monitor droughts, surface water and floods. The current study introduces a new deep learning model named convolutional neural network (CONN)- support vector machine (SVM)- Gaussian regression process (GPR) to predict daily and monthly rainfall data in Terengganu River Basin, Malaysia. The CONN-SVM-GRP model can extract the most important features automatically. The main advantage of the new model is to reflect the uncertainty values in the modelling process. The lagged rainfall values were used as the input variables to the models. The proposed CONN-SVM-GRP model successfully decreased the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of other models by 5.9\%-23\% at the daily scale and 20\%-61\% at the monthly scale. The CONN-SVM-GRP model also provided the lowest uncertainty among other models, making it a reliable tool for predicting data points and intervals. Hence, it can be concluded that CONN-SVM-GRP model contributes to the sustainable management of water resources, even when satellite data is unavailable, by using lagged values to predict rainfall. Additionally, the model extracts important features without using preprocessing methods, further improving its efficiency. Overall, the CONN-SVM-GRP model can help researchers predict rainfall, which is essential for monitoring water resources and mitigating the impacts of droughts, floods, and other natural disasters.

TI  - State Updating Of Root Zone Soil Moisture Estimates Of An Unsaturated Zone Metamodel For Operational Water Resources Management
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
PY  - 2019
AB  - Combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows the incorporation of up-to-date information in metamodels, offering new opportunities for operational water resources management. We developed a data assimilation scheme for the unsaturated zone metamodel MetaSWAP using OpenDA, which is an open source data assimilation framework. A twin experiment showed the feasibility of applying an Ensemble Kalman filter as a data assimilation method for updating metamodels. Furthermore, we assessed the accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates when assimilating the regional SMAP L3 Enhanced surface soil moisture product. The model accuracy is assessed using in situ soil moisture measurements collected at 12 locations in the Twente region, the Netherlands. Although the accuracy of the model estimates does not improve in terms of correlation coefficient, the accuracy does improve in terms of Root Mean Square Error and bias. Therefore, the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations has value for updating root zone soil moisture model estimates. In addition, the accuracy of the model estimates improves on both regional and local spatial scales. The increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data will lead to new possibilities for integrating metamodelling and data assimilation in operational water resources management. However, we expect that significant investments in computational capacities are necessary for effective implementation in decision-making.

TI  - Study On Spatial Distribution Of Aerosol Optical Depth And Particulate Matter Using Modis Data
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2018
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is one of the main pollutants in the atmosphere, which is harmful to human. PM10 and PM2.5 became the main subject attracting more and more interest. To compensate the weakness of conventional observation method, application of remote sensing tools have been widely used in environmental monitoring. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data has a high temporal resolution, which, at present, is an ideal data source in simulative monitoring of regional-scale environment changes. In this study, we focused on PM2.5 and AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) in coastal areas. Correlation between each two of them was analyzed. From the daily average value year of two sites PM2.5, the concentration of air particulate pollutants is low before and after summer, and the heating season is higher in winter and spring. The average PM2.5 concentration value of 2014 and 2015 is 50.11μg/m3 and 41.11μg/m3 respectively in Fushan station, and that of the Laishan station is 45.63μg/m3 and 38.73μg/m3 respectively. From the interannual variation, the concentration of air particulate pollutants in the two regions has a tendency to decrease. According to the new standard of air quality of the PM2.5 monitoring network, the air quality of the vast majority of dates belongs to the excellent grade. In light of the policy of air pollution, the PM2.5 concentration in 2015 was lower than that in 2014. Due to the complexity of atmospheric components and their interactions, and the spatial and temporal constraints of PM2.5 detection resulted in a low correlation between the AOT and PM2.5. © 2018 SPIE.

TI  - Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images To Explore The Spatial Relationship Between Landscape Patterns And Ecosystem Service Values In Regions Of Urbanization
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urbanization has substantially changed landscape patterns and seriously disturbed the structure and function of the ecosystems. However, the spatial characteristics and relationships between landscape patterns and ecosystem service values (ESVs) along the urban-rural gradient remain unclear. Based on high-resolution images, this study used concentric buffer zones to explore the characteristics and relationship between landscape pattern indexes (LPIs) and ESVs in the rural-urban gradient to reveal the impact of urban development on urban ecosystems. The results showed that the landscape heterogeneity was high in the urban fringe 18-20 km from the urban center. The PD, ED, LSI, SHAPE\_MN, DIVISION, SPLIT, and SHIDI variables had the lowest values in the urban center, while CONTAG and AI had the high values in the urban. Water bodies and forest land are the main land use/land cover (LULC) types that provide ecosystem services. The total ESV of Kunshan city totaled 5597.31 x 10(6) CNY in 2018. The average ESV increased from 2.42 x 10(6) CNY to 9.92 x 10(6) CNY along the urban-rural gradient, which indicated that natural landscapes had higher ESVs. ED and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) had positive effects on ESV, while Largest Patch Index (LPI), Contagion (CONTAG), Proportion of Like Adjacencies (PLADJ), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), and Aggregation Index (AI) had negative effects on ESV. The results of the regression model indicated there were quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs, which revealed how landscape pattern affected ESVs. The study can provide a scientific reference for the optimization of urban landscape patterns and urban and rural sustainable development.

AB  - In this paper, we present a non-linear, adaptive interpolation model based on the voter model cellular automaton (VMCA), which is a simple iterative algorithm that produces fractal patterns. This algorithm is based on the interpolation of missing data using the value of a randomly selected neighbor. This method of interpolation also preserves a realistic amount of spatial autocorrelation, extracted from neighboring existing data, also found in these landscapes. Another advantage of this method is that, given its locality and restricted underlying computational model, its implementation may perform significantly faster than other interpolation methods, with similar overall results. The initial findings are good with the least error around the edges even then the perceptual error is minimal for the entire surface.

TI  - Infiltration Efficiency Index For Gis Analysis Using Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Data
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - Infiltration models and impervious surface models have gained significant attention in recent years as crucial tools in urban and environmental planning, to assess the extent of land-surface changes and their impacts on hydrological processes. These models are important for understanding the hydrological dynamics and ecological impacts of urbanization and for the improvement of sustainable land-use planning and stormwater-management strategies. Due to the fact that many authors partially or entirely overlook the significance of the infiltration process in geographic information system (GIS) analyses, there is currently no universally accepted method for creating an infiltration model that is suitable for GIS multicriteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA). This research paper presents an innovative approach to modeling the infiltration-efficiency index (IEI) for GIS analysis, with a focus on achieving high-quality results. The proposed methodology integrates very-high-resolution (VHR) remote-sensing data, GIS-MCDA, and statistical methods. The methodology was tested and demonstrated on a small sub-catchment in Metkovic, Croatia. The study developed a VHR IEI model from six specific criteria that produced values between 0 and 0.71. The model revealed that 14.89\% of the research area is covered by impervious surfaces. This percentage is relatively favorable when compared to urban areas globally. The majority of the research area (62.79\%) has good infiltration efficiency. These areas are predominantly characterized by agricultural land use, encompassing orchards, tangerines, olive groves, vineyards, and a diverse range of low-lying and high vegetation on flat terrain. The IEI model can provide input spatial data for high-resolution GIS analysis of hydrological processes. This model will aid decision-makers in stormwater-management, flood-risk assessment, land-use planning, and the design of green infrastructure. By utilizing the information derived from this study, policymakers can make informed decisions to mitigate flooding risks and promote sustainable urban development.

TI  - Promoting Tech Transfer Between Space And Global Mental Health
JO  - AEROSPACE MEDICINE AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE
PY  - 2020
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Numerous issues in mental health benefit from technological innovation. An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors,'omics', and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space. METHODS: We prepared a systematic review of studies pertaining to mental health technological innovation and space medicine. RESULTS: For Earth mental health technologies translatable to long-duration space missions, we cite several example technologies, including device-based psychotherapy and social support, conversational agents 'aka chatbots', and nutritional and physical activity focused mental health. Space technologies translatable to Earth mental health include remote sensing devices, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, chronotherapies, and nutritional advances. DISCUSSION: There is a rich history of space technologies informing Earth technological trends, including general health care on Earth, and vice versa. To avoid the traditional happenstance approach that results in delays, missed opportunities, and increased cost, and to improve outcomes for both Earth and space utilization of these technologies, we propose increased dialogue and training opportunities to enhance innovation and outcomes.

TI  - Reflection Of Eo Data In Blue Economy: Sustainable Growth
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2022
AB  - There is a reason that earth is called the Blue Planet. About 71% of the globe is covered by water which holds roughly 80% of the total life forms. More than 1/3 of the global population lives within 100 km of the sea, more than 3 billion people rely on water bodies for a living, and waterways carry out more than 78% of international trade in goods which creates the value of the ocean economy around 3 trillion USD annually. Along with transportation and tourism, new activities such as offshore wind energy, growing aquaculture and marine biotechnologies are accelerating the growth of the Blue economy. Globally, approximately 350 million jobs are linked to the oceans through aquaculture, fishing, coastal and marine research & tourism and activities. However, these activities are growing without sufficient consideration for sustainability and are often affected by climate change, ocean pollution and overfishing. These facts certainly bring much attention to the fact that thinking and acting blue is the future for our planet. The concept of the Blue Economy was introduced in 2010. Since then, it has been gaining popularity throughout the globe as we live in the 21st century where data is the new oil and becoming more and more important across multiple industries and at UN Climate Change Conference COP26 the ocean also became the fundamental part. Similarly, Earth Observation (EO) data became an essential source of information for the monitoring and modelling of oceanic, atmospheric and terrestrial processes. EO has the potential to support the Blue economy and address a wide range of issues, including disaster risk management, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation, coastal water safety and security, and short and long term planning challenges. This paper unfolds the opportunities for Earth Observation Data to provide innovative solutions to develop and secure Blue Growth and meet global sustainable development goals (SDGs) challenges. There is a long list of potential applications of EO in the maritime sector to increase information management, decision-making planning for coastal and marine resources management. The majority of these applications positively impact human activities on the earth. Also, this paper emphasises the global market trends of emerging sectors in the blue economy and how EO data is revolutionising them by efficient operations (using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep learning technologies) and ease of decision making.

PY  - 2008
AB  - This paper outlines the response of students and young space professionals on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the first artificial satellite and the 40th anniversary of the Outer Space Treaty. The contribution has been coordinated by the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) in support of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications. It follows consultation of the SGAC community through a series of meetings, online discussions and online surveys. The first two online surveys collected over 750 different visions from the international community, totaling approximately 276 youth from over 28 countries and builds on previous SGAC policy contributions. A summary of these results was presented as the top 10 visions of today's youth as an invited input to world space leaders gathered at the Symposium on "The future of space exploration: Solutions to earthly problems" held in Boston, USA from April 12-14 2007 and at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in May 2007. These key visions suggested the enhancement for humanity's reach beyond this planet - both physically and intellectual. These key visions were themed into three main categories: •Improvement of Human Survival Probability - sustained exploration to become a multi- planet species, humans to Mars, new treaty structures to ensure a secure space environment, etc •Improvement of Human Quality of Life and the Environment - new political systems or astrocracy, benefits of tele-medicine, tele-education, and commercialization of space, new energy and resources: space solar power, etc. •Improvement of Human Knowledge and Understanding - complete survey of extinct and extant life forms, use of space data for advanced environmental monitoring, etc. This paper will summarize the outcomes from a further online survey and represent key recommendations given by international youth advocates on further steps that could be taken by space agencies and organizations to make the top 10 visions a reality. In turn the online discussions that are used to engage the youth audience would be recorded and would help to reflect the confidence of the younger generation in these visions. The categories listed above would also be investigated further from the technology, policy and ethical aspects. Recent activities in development to further disseminate the necessary connections between using of space technology for solving global challenges is discussed.

TI  - A Study On Variations Of Shoreline Changes And Temporal-Spatial Potentiality For Cloud Seeding At Urumia Lake
PY  - 2015
AB  - Protecting the living environment has become one of the greatest human concerns; sudden increase of population, industry and technology development, unrestrained over consumption of the citizens and climate changes, have all caused many problems for mankind. Shores are special zones that are in contact with three Atmosphere, Hydrosphere and Lithosphere environments of earth. Shore lines are of the most important linear features of the earth's surface which have an animated and alive nature. In this regard, optimized management of the shores and environmental protection for stable development require observing the shorelines and their variations. Protection of shorelines within appropriate time periods is of high importance for the purpose of optimized management of the shores. The twenty first century has been called the era of information explosion. A time that, through benefits of new technologies, information experts attempt to generate more and up to date information in various fields and to provide them for managers and decision makers in order to be considered for future planning and also to assist the planners to arrange and set a comprehensive plan. Aerial images and remote sensing technology are economic methods to acquire the required data. Such methods are free from common time and place limitations in survey based methods. Among remote sensing data, the ones acquired from optical images have several benefits which include low cost, interpretation simplicity and ease of access. That is why most of the researches concerning extraction of shorelines are practiced using optical images. On the other hand, wide range coverage of satellite images along with rapid access to them caused these images to be used extensively for extracting the shorelines. The attempt in this research is to use satellite images and their application in order to study variations of the shorelines. Thus, for this purpose, Landsat satellite images from TM and ETM+ sensors in the 35 time period has been used. In order to reach better results, images from MODIS satellite has been used as auxiliary data for the images that are with an error margin. Initial classification on the images was conducted to distinguish water and non water applications. Neural network classification was applied with specific scales on the images and the two major applications were thereby extracted. Then, in order to authenticate the proceedings, Error matrix and Kappa coefficient has been applied on the classified images. Base pixel method of neural network was used for the purpose of information extraction while authenticity of that was evaluated too. The outcomes display the trend of Urmia shoreline has been approximately constant between the years of 1976 to 1995 and has experienced very low variations. In 1998 the lake experienced increase of water and therefore advancement of the shoreline of the lake due to increase of precipitation and the volume of inflowing water to the basin. During 2000 to 20125, however, the lake's shoreline has experienced a downward trend, which was intensified in 2007 and reached to its most critical level ever since, that is decreasing to about one third. Further, temporal and spatial potentiality evaluation of clouds seeding in Urmia lake zone has been studied as a solution for improvement and recovery of the current status of the lake, and an algorithm was proposed for optimized temporal-spatial study on could seeding. Ecological, meteorological and synoptic data were used for timing study of the cloud's seeding plan, which upon study; it is easy to evaluate precipitation potential and quality of the system. At the next step, the rate of humidity and also stability of the precipitating system can be analyzed using radar acquired data. Whereas extracted date from MODIS images are expressing the spatial position, therefore in order to study the location of the cloud's seeding, MODIS images of the selected time intervals along with applying MCM algorithm were used to conclude thick clouds. Also, with interpolation of the TRMM data, it is possible to deduce maximum precipitation in the form of spatial arena. One of the data categories that is used both for temporal and spatial analysis is radar images which in addition to time, displays the existing humidity range, movement direction, and positions of accumulated precipitation cores. Therefore, using this algorithm, it is possible to conclude the most optimized spatial position in order to execute the seeding plan.

TI  - Using Goal-Directed Design To Create A Novel System For Improving Chronic Illness Care
JO  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: A learning health system enables patients, clinicians, and researchers to work together to choose care based on the best evidence, drive discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care, and ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care; all in a more real-time fashion. Objective: Our paper describes how goal-directed design (GDD) methods were employed to understand the context and goals of potential participants in such a system as part of a design process to translate the concept of a learning health system into a prototype collaborative chronic care network (C3N), specifically for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: Thirty-six one-on-one in-depth interviews and observations were conducted with patients (10/36, 28\%), caregivers (10/36, 28\%), physicians/researchers (10/36, 28\%), and nurses (6/36, 17\%) from a pediatric gastroenterology center participating in the ImproveCareNow network. GDD methods were used to determine the context and goals of participants. These same methods were used in conjunction with idealized design process techniques to help determine characteristics of a learning health system for this pediatric health care ecology. Research was conducted in a clinic and, in the case of some patients and caregivers, at home. Results: Thematic analysis revealed 3 parent-child dyad personas (ie, representations of interviewees' behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and contextual information) that represented adaptation to a chronic illness over time. These were used as part of a design process to generate scenarios (potential interactions between personas and the learning health system under design) from which system requirements were derived. These scenarios in turn helped guide generation, prioritization, design, measurement, and implementation of approximately 100 prototype interventions consistent with the aim of C3N becoming a learning health network. Conclusions: GDD methods help ensure human goals and contexts inform the design of a network of health care interventions which reflect the shape and purpose of a C3N in pediatric chronic illness care. Developing online and in-person interventions according to well-documented context and motivations of participants increases the likelihood that a C3N will enable all participants to act in ways that achieve their goals with grace and dignity. GDD methods complemented quality-improvement methods to generate prototypes consistent with clinical and research aims, as well as the goals of patient disease management.

TI  - Aerial Drone Technology Can Assist Compliance Of Trap Fisheries
JO  - FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY
PY  - 2020
AB  - Illegal fishing is a global issue that threatens the viability of fishing industries and biodiversity conservation. Management agencies typically use on-ground surveillance to monitor and minimise illegal fishing practices, the efficacy of which may be enhanced by integrating emerging remote sensing technology. Affordable drones may contribute to cost-effective detection of illegal fishing activity and associated gear, although their application has yet to be evaluated in many types of fisheries. Here, the utility of drones for the detection of crab traps and floats set in a shallow estuary was quantitatively tested, and the effects of survey altitudes, cameras and monitor screens on detection rates were determined. It was found that drone flight altitude and float colour influenced the detection rates of common crab trap floats, with infrared cameras improving the detection of floats camouflaged by black paint. However, the type of monitor screen used by the drone operator had no influence on the detection of crab traps. Overall, it appears drones can contribute to cost-effective compliance in estuarine trap fisheries, and the approach can contribute to evidence-based standard operating procedures.

TI  - Journaling And The Creative Writing Workshop In Counseling And Recovery Of Adult Participants
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background. I discuss a method of facilitation that I have used in my Creative Writing courses at the University of Lethbridge for many years. I tend to focus primarily on potentials and possibilities in third-year courses and then move on to questions of forms, genre, and structure in the. Advanced. or exit-year courses. These courses rely heavily on rapport and a specific structure which has the effect (most of the time) of opening the spigot of the students' creative energies. Purpose of Study. Data from this pedagogy is plotted in a qualitative exploration using in-depth phenomenological. prompts. or thought experiments. This data will be presented in order to depict how art making or (in this case, Creative Writing journaling) contributes to mental health recovery and stability. The hope of our team is that this method may be deploy at a downtown satellite program open to street people and all and any who seek help. Sources of Evidence. An interpretative phenomenological approach is applied to data collected in several years of Creative Writing workshops at the University of Lethbridge. This data is broken down into three main categories: explanatory models of how the skills, qualities and approaches of the facilitator assisted recovery, on transformative characteristics of art making in this particular venue, and the wider social benefits of such art making. Main Argument. Using collaborative techniques grounded on the premise that the workshop is unconditionally a. safe place,. a progressive conversation is established in which the matter of the self is drawn into both language that is fresh and control of language that holistically conforms to the group dynamic. In this dynamic, remarkable recoveries may take place. I will focus the discussion on the structure of the collaborative journalizing, the purpose of which is to bring structure into the very production of personal and creative recovery. The journaling is an extended process-meditation, begun on the first day of a half-semester course and finished on the day a final portfolio is submitted for grading. I argue that the dream-journaling should have a basic structure in any case, and discuss several such schema as they have been used not only in Creative Writing but also in the community and in the literature of counselling and guidance. Conclusions. The findings provide a initial but profound exploration into art facilitators' pragmatic knowledge and wisdom related to the health and recovery benefits of art making in the area of counselling and guidance. It also explores important skills and competencies required by those facilitating art making programs in mental health recovery contexts. Such data may help to inform policy and design of health recovery programs associated with Creative Writing workshops both in the college or university setting as well as the community health unit.

PY  - 2022
AB  - Water moves among sea atmosphere ice and lithosphere which is described as water cycle or hydrology cycle.In the context of global change and anthropogenic influence since the industrial revolution unbalanced relationship between input water and output water leads to water resource conserved or short consequently spatial distributing variously. In this study long time meteorology and surface water data were obtained from 2001 to 2020 groundwater and land cover were surveyed soil water data from remote sensing retrieval were collected and actual evapotranspiration data were generated by ETWatch model.All of these data were applied to water balance accounts in order to illustrate dynamic balanced relationship between precipitation actual evapotranspiration runoff and variable storage as well as analyze water conservation distribution from viewpoints of soil water and groundwater in order to understand hydrological process conversion locate key protective ecological space and solve water resource management problems in water conservation zone.Results showed that in Xiaoluan River Basin 1 Precipitation increased with a trend of 3.76 mm / a slowly from 2001 to 2015 while fast from 2016 to 2020 and exhibited spatial variability decreasing gradually from east to west with the highest value in Saihanba Forest Farm located in the northeast of the basin. 2 Actual evapotranspiration increased with a trend of 2.71 mm / a lower than that of precipitation. It was lower than precipitation in years with more precipitation when water was reserved or supplied to evaporate and transpire in later years with less precipitation.The spatial distribution was characterized as high-low-high from upper to lower reaches.Actual evapotranspiration of wetland>forest>cultivated land>construction land>grass>sandy and naked land. 3 Runoff decreased with a trend of 0.13 mm / a.The decreasing rate of wet season was greater than that of the whole year while it showed an increasing trend in dry season certificating a significant reducing flood peak and compensating for the drought effect. 4 Variable storage increased with a trend of 1.17 mm / a in spite of negative value and more and more water resource were stored in the form of soil water and groundwater.Soil water increased with a trend of 0.0018 m3/ m3/ a and exhibited spatial variability decreasing from upper to lower reaches with the highest value in the ecotone of forest and grass located in the west-north of the basin.Since 2010 high soil water zone stretched from middle to lower reaches.Groundwater maintained stable with a slight rise.The area of groundwater level rising zone was larger than that of falling zone with high level from August to September.Researching method of water balance in small basin was explored at the view of integrated survey and monitoring providing support for water resource integrated management. © 2022 China Geological Survey.

TI  - Impact Of Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Landscape Structure In The Dry Lands Of Southern Africa: A Case Of The Zambezi Region, Namibia
JO  - GEOJOURNAL
PY  - 2022
AB  - The study evaluated patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) change in the Zambezi Region, Namibia between 1984 and 2010 using geospatial tools. Spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes were quantified using the post classification change detection method. The images were classified into five land use and land cover classes: forest land, shrub land, bare land, crop/grass land and other land. Landscape metrics were calculated using Fragstats to understand the landscape patterns and structural integrity of the landscape. The results showed that political transition (before and after independence) has resulted in dramatic decreases in patch density and increases in the interspersion and juxtaposition index values. The general pattern of LULC showed that the communal area compared to protected area became structurally diverse and ecologically more fragmented from 1984 to 2010. This study provides a foundation and baseline data demonstrating LULC alteration and landscape context suitable for monitoring future changes of protected and communal areas. Our approach is a novel way to assess the drivers and patterns of LULC under different land tenure types for natural resources conservation and sustainable land management in the dry lands of Southern Africa.

TI  - Quantifying Livestock Effects On Bunchgrass Vegetation With Landsat Etm+ Data Across A Single Growing Season
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2016
AB  - Grassland systems provide important habitat for native biodiversity and forage for livestock, with livestock grazing playing an important role influencing sustainable ecosystem function. Traditional field techniques to monitor the effects of grazing on vegetation are costly and limited to small spatial scales. Remote sensing has the potential to provide quantitative and repeatable monitoring data across large spatial and temporal scales for more informed grazing management. To investigate the ability of vegetation metrics derived from remotely sensed imagery to detect the effect of cattle grazing on bunchgrass grassland vegetation across a growing season, we sampled 32 sites across four prescribed stocking rates on a section of Pacific Northwest bunchgrass prairie in northeastern Oregon. We collected vegetation data on vertical structure, biomass, and cover at three different time periods: June, August, and October 2012 to understand the potential to measure vegetation at different phenological stages across a growing season. We acquired remotely sensed Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data closest in date to three field sampling bouts. We correlated the field vegetation metrics to Landsat spectral bands, 14 commonly used vegetation indices, and the tasselled cap wetness, brightness, and greenness transformations. To increase the explanatory value of the satellite-derived data, full, stepwise, and best-subset multiple regression models were fit to each of the vegetation metrics at the three different times of the year. Predicted vegetation metrics were then mapped across the study area. Field-based results indicated that as the stocking rate increased, the mean vegetation amounts of vertical structure, cover, and biomass decreased. The multiple regression models using common vegetation indices had the ability to discern different levels of grazing across the study area, but different spectral indices proved to be the best predictors of vegetation metrics for differing phenological windows. Field measures of vegetation cover yielded the highest correlations to remotely sensed data across all sampling periods. Our results from this analysis can be used to improve grassland monitoring by providing multiple measures of vegetation amounts across a growing season that better align with land management decision making. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Comparison Of Changes In Groundwater Storage Using Grace Data And A Hydrological Model In California's Central Valley
JO  - American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Annual Conference 2012, ASPRS 2012
PY  - 2012
AB  - The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) measures gravity anomalies on earth to estimate changes in total water storage (TWS), and may be a useful tool for calculating changes in groundwater storage for California's agriculturally productive Central Valley region. Under current California law, well owners are not required to report groundwater extraction rates, making estimation of total groundwater extraction difficult. As a result, other groundwater change detection techniques are used to estimate changes in groundwater storage in the Central Valley aquifer. From October 2002 to September 2009, GRACE was used to measure changes in TWS for the Sacramento River Basin, and the San Joaquin River Basin (including the Tulare Lake Basin), which contain the Central Valley aquifer. Net groundwater storage changes were calculated from the changes in TWS by incorporating estimates for additional components of the hydrological budget including soil moisture, snow pack, and surface water storage. The changes in groundwater storage at the river basin and regional level (the two basins combined) were then compared to modeled values calculated using the California Department of Water Resources' Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSIM). At the regional level (the Central Valley aquifer) it was found that GRACE-derived estimates of groundwater change in storage produced comparable results to C2VSIM. However, at the river basin level (Sacramento and San Joaquin), GRACE-derived estimates were significantly different from those modeled by C2VSIM, highlighting the current limit of GRACE's spatial resolution. This work has the potential to improve California's groundwater resource management at the regional level and in validating existing hydrological models for the Central Valley. The work also underscores the need for higher resolution satellite data that are applicable smaller scale management.

AB  - From the evolution of traditional fiber art to modern fiber art, the selection of production processes and materials has become wider and wider, and new materials and new technologies are constantly being added. Modern design concepts also make fiber art and space more integrated. It further satisfies the public's aesthetic demand for space decoration. From the perspective of green eco-environmental protection design, this paper introduces a coordinated development model to study the coordinated development of fiber art and architectural decoration. The research results show that fiber art is an indispensable part of architectural decoration in its rich expression form, attached to space design. Its unique material and texture meet people's emotional needs for material and touch. Fiber art is displayed in space and played the greatest value and significance.

TI  - A Lung-Function Information-System
JO  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
PY  - 1991
AB  - A lung function information system (LFIS) was developed for the data analysis of pulmonary function tests at different locations.  This system was connected to the hospital information system (HIS) for the retrieval of patient data and the storage of the lung function variables of patients to generate follow-up reports and to support financial and administrative management.  The application programs were developed in such a way that high flexibility was obtained with respect to the patient-computer-technician interaction.  The sampled data are stored on a disc to correct earlier decisions, perform recalculations and reanalyse the data for research purposes.  When the measurements performed on a patient are authorized, the sampled data are deleted, except for when they are needed for future research.  A distributed computer system was chosen to combine the benefits of a centralized system with those of several stand-alone systems.  The main tasks of the central unit are to store collected data and computer programs, generate a final lung function report on laser printer and provide a connection to the HIS.  In the satellite computers, which are located close to the lung function equipment, the signals and raw data are processed. Furthermore, the satellite computers were in use for program development and several research projects, and for the offline data processing of the lung function measurements from two other hospitals by means of a modem connection.  The LFIS improved the quantity and quality of data acquisition.  It resulted in an increased capacity of about 50\% concerning spirometry, and facilitated time-consuming complex analyses. It also avoided miscalculations and mistakes in reports previously experienced with hand calculations.

TI  - Systematic Way Of Optimizing Redundancy
JO  - 16th AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference
PY  - 1996
AB  - For increased reliability, redundant components are often used in a satellite. Twofold redundancy is widely used, but may not always be the best. Each added component increases the satellite mass. This paper describes how to choose redundant components, to get the maximum reliability for a given mass. Conversely, the method can be used to minimize the satellite mass for a specified system reliability. Each redundant component with a mass M increases the satellite reliability by a ratio r. We define a figure of merit as (10 Iog10 r)/M, measured in units of dB/kg. Starting with no redundancy, a series of optimum configurations are generated, by repeatedly adding the redundant component with the highest figure of merit. The trade-off between reliability and mass can be plotted on a graph. A similar analysis can be made based on the cost, instead of mass. The method can then be used to minimize the cost for a specified system reliability. © 199S by Gary D. Gordon.

TI  - Mapping And Monitoring Zero-Deforestation Commitments
JO  - BIOSCIENCE
PY  - 2021
AB  - A growing number of companies have announced zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs) to eliminate commodities produced at the expense of forests from their supply chains. Translating these aspirational goals into forest conservation requires forest mapping and monitoring (M\&M) systems that are technically adequate and therefore credible, salient so that they address the needs of decision makers, legitimate in that they are fair and unbiased, and scalable over space and time. We identify 12 attributes of M\&M that contribute to these goals and assess how two prominent ZDC programs, the Amazon Soy Moratorium and the High Carbon Stock Approach, integrate these attributes into their M\&M systems. These programs prioritize different attributes, highlighting fundamental trade-offs in Met.M design. Rather than prescribe a one-sizefits-all solution, we provide policymakers and practitioners with guidance on the design of ZDC M\&M systems that fit their specific use case and that may contribute to more effective implementation of ZDCs.

TI  - Assessing Land Cover And Ecological Quality Changes Under The New-Type Urbanization From Multi-Source Remote Sensing
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2021
AB  - The traditional rapid urbanization process is the result of a strong focus on economic development, while its ecological and environmental aspects are less focused upon. The "new-type urbanization " (NTU) concept considers ecological conservation during the urbanization process. The different impacts of the two processes on regional ecological environment evolutions remain insufficiently investigated and still draw significant attention from urban planners and land managers when formulating proper land use policies. Thus, this study was designed to fill the gap by evaluating and comparing different effects of the traditional urbanization and NTU on urban land cover (LC) and ecological quality changes in the Jiangbei New Area, Nanjing, China. We first established a LC database using an object-oriented classification of multi-source high-resolution satellite images. Next, we quantified changes in ecological quality using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model. Subsequently, spatial auto-correlation analysis was conducted to detect the clustering trend of the changing ecological quality in the study area over time. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the LC maps was 90.75\% in 2009, 91.75\% in 2015, and 92.04\% in 2019. The average RSEI values of the study area were 0.583, 0.559, and 0.579, respectively. The spatial auto-correlation analysis indicated a strong positive correlation between the ecological qualities. However, the spatial distribution changed slightly from a clustered trend to a more random and dispersed trend as the Moran's I decreased. The observed changes are attributed to the strict implementation of ecological conservation and restoration policies by the local government in the NTU process, as well as an increased residents' awareness of protecting natural resources, indicating that the traditional urbanization has a stronger negative disturbance on regional ecological conditions than NTU. The proposed evaluation method can be applied to other similar regions for sustainable urban management.

TI  - Application Of Gis Image System And Remote Sensing Technology In Physical Geography Land Planning
JO  - SOFT COMPUTING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Physical geography is the foundation of urban social and economic development. The quantity and quality of land resources and their distribution directly affect the economic, social, environmental and comprehensive benefits of the city. Now, in our country, low land use efficiency and irrational land structure in physical geography are both prominent phenomena. One of the main reasons is the lack of scientific and reasonable physical geography land use structure and utilization efficiency plan. Using remote sensing and geographic information system technology, this paper conducts a comprehensive and systematic survey of urban land use changes and obtains land use classification maps for two periods, supports further research and correctly guides people to develop and utilize natural resources and protect the ecological environment and provide powerful reference materials for realizing sustainable land use and sustainable social and economic development. In addition, this article will also introduce multi-source remote sensing image data fusion technology, including fusion information representation, fusion principle, fusion system framework model, fusion algorithm, control and application. By combining ETM remote sensing data with large-scale topographic maps, GIS is used as a supporting tool to construct a spatial database of urban environment, which promotes the development of research.

TI  - Satellite Derived Impervious Surface Area As An Indicator For Water Resource Impacts In A Semi-Arid Environment, Utah, Usa
PY  - 2004
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) has recently emerged as an important ecological indicator of cumulative water resource impacts to urban watersheds. An ISA study was conducted in Cache County, Utah, to examine the potential of ISA as an indicator of water resource impacts in the region. Two LANDSAT 7 images from the spring of 2000 and, the summer of 2002 were analysed to compute ISA. Water chemistry and discharge data were collected from canals during five stormwater runoff events. Variables measured included dissolved metals, nutrients, sediment, oil and grease, fecal coliforms, and field parameters (e.g., water temperature). Percent ISA and loading coefficients were calculated for each of the contributing basins for a total of eight sampling locations. Results of linear regressions correlating mean site concentrations and percentage ISA were positive and strong (p<0.03) for total phosphorus (R-2=0.86), total nitrogen (R-2=0.94), orthophosphate (R2=0.94), total suspended solids (R-2=0.67), boron (R-2=0.82), copper (R-2=0.98), lead (R-2=0.96), zinc (R-2=0.97), and turbidity (R-2=0.67). Mean site loading coefficients were similarly correlated. Additionally, potential water quality impacts were evaluated by comparing mean site concentrations and percentage ISA with Utah and European water quality standards or pollution indicators. Those that exceeded the Utah standards or pollutant indicator values were total phosphorus, total suspended solids, lead, aluminium, and fecal coliform. Concentrations above the European standards were aluminium and iron. The Cache County study indicates that ISA is an applicable parameter as an indicator for cumulative water resource impacts and, further, suggests its application as an additional resource tool for the assessment and subsequent planning for water resource protection in urban developments.

TI  - Residential Green Space In Childhood Is Associated With Lower Risk Of Psychiatric Disorders From Adolescence Into Adulthood
JO  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
PY  - 2019
AB  - Urban residence is associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders, but the underlying drivers remain unknown. There is increasing evidence that the level of exposure to natural environments impacts mental health, but few large-scale epidemiological studies have assessed the general existence and importance of such associations. Here, we investigate the prospective association between green space and mental health in the Danish population. Green space presence was assessed at the individual level using high-resolution satellite data to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index within a 210 x 210 m square around each person's place of residence (similar to 1 million people) from birth to the age of 10. We show that high levels of green space presence during childhood are associated with lower risk of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders later in life. Risk for subsequent mental illness for those who lived with the lowest level of green space during childhood was up to 55\% higher across various disorders compared with those who lived with the highest level of green space. The association remained even after adjusting for urbanization, socioeconomic factors, parental history of mental illness, and parental age. Stronger association of cumulative green space presence during childhood compared with single-year green space presence suggests that presence throughout childhood is important. Our results show that green space during childhood is associated with better mental health, supporting efforts to better integrate natural environments into urban planning and childhood life.

TI  - Management Of U.s. Agricultural Lands Differentially Affects Avian Habitat Connectivity
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2023
AB  - Despite frequently being implicated in species declines, agricultural lands may nonetheless play an important role in connecting wildlife populations by serving as movement corridors or stopover sites between areas of high-quality habitat. For many North American bird species, agricultural intensification over the past half century has substantially impacted populations, yet recent studies have noted the potential for supporting avian biodiversity on agricultural lands through the promotion of functional connectivity. To support avian conservation efforts on agricultural lands across the United States, we used publicly available data from eBird to quantify and map the effects of agriculture on habitat suitability (using random forest models) and functional connectivity (via circuit theory) for three focal species that have experienced agriculture-linked declines or range contractions in recent decades: Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). Our analysis drew on novel, remotely sensed estimates of agricultural management intensity to quantify the effects of management practices on avian habitat and movement, revealing complex, species-specific relationships between agriculture and habitat value for the three focal species. Rangelands and croplands exhibited relatively high connectivity values for Greater Sage-grouse and Bobolink, respectively, mirroring these species' strong habitat preferences for open sagebrush and cultivated grasslands. By contrast, American Black Duck migratory connectivity was low on all agricultural cover types. Mapping our model results across each species' geographic range in the U.S. revealed key areas for agricultural management action to preserve high-quality habitat and connectivity, and we link these spatial recommendations to government incentive programs that can be used to increase wildlife-friendly management on U.S. agricultural lands.

TI  - Probability Assessment Of Vegetation Vulnerability To Drought Based On Remote Sensing Data
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2018
AB  - Drought is one of the important factors causing vegetation degradation. Determination of areas with vegetation more sensitive to drought can be effective in drought risk management. Considering the ability to describe vegetation conditions, vegetation health index (VHI) was used to determine the probability of vegetation vulnerability to drought and to provide the map of Iran showing sensitive areas to drought. This study tries to express the probability of vegetation vulnerability to drought in four main climatic classes including hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid and semi-humid, and humid in Iran. Temperature condition index (TCI) and vegetation condition index (VCI) were calculated using land surface temperature (LST) derived from the MOD11A2 product and normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from MOD13A2 product, MODIS sensor. Combining these two indices, VHI was calculated for late of March, April, May, and June during 2000-2017. VHI was classified into five classes representing the drought intensity. Then, the probability of occurrence (\%) of each class was calculated and multiplied with weight of each class, varying from 0 to 40 based on drought intensity. Finally, probability of vegetation vulnerability index (PVVI) was calculated by summing of the values obtained for each class. The results showed that PVVI was higher in arid and hyper-arid areas than that in other areas in the four studied periods. The highest mean values of PVVI in humid as well as semi-arid and semi-humid classes were found in April as 59.87 and 62.4, respectively, while the highest mean values of PVVI in arid and hyper-arid classes were observed in May as 70.98 and 68.13, respectively. In total, our results showed that PVVI is affected by different climatic and topographic conditions, and it suggested that this index be used to determine the probability of vegetation vulnerability.

TI  - Satellite Data For A Rapid Assessment Of Tsunami Inundation Areas After The 2011 Tohoku Tsunami
JO  - Pure and Applied Geophysics
PY  - 2013
AB  - The M w = 9.0 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Japan's Tohoku region produced a great tsunami causing catastrophic damage and loss of life. Within hours of the tsunami event, satellite data were readily available and massive media coverage immediately circulated thousands of photographs and videos of the tsunami. Satellite data allow a rapid assessment of inundated areas where access can be difficult either as a result of damaged infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, ports, airports) or because of safety issues (e.g., the hazard at Nuclear Power Plant at Fukushima). In this study, we assessed in a day tsunami inundation distances and runup heights using satellite data (very high-resolution satellite images from the GeoEye1 satellite and from the DigitalGlobe worldview, SRTM and ASTER GDEM) of the Tohoku region, Northeast Japan. Field survey data by Japanese and other international scientists validated our results. This study focused on three different locations. Site selection was based on coastal morphologies and the distance to the tsunami source (epicenter). Study sites are Rikuzentakata, Oyagawahama, and Yagawahama in the Oshika Peninsula, and the Sendai coastal plain (Sendai City to Yamamoto City). Maximum inundation distance (6 km along the river) and maximum runup (39 m) at Rikuzentakata estimated from satellite data agree closely with the 39.7 m inundation reported in the field. Here the ria coastal morphology and horn shaped bay enhanced the tsunami runup and effects. The Sendai coastal plain shows large inundation distances (6 km) and lower runup heights. Natori City and Wakabayashi Ward, on the Sendai plain, have similar runup values (12 and 16 m, respectively) obtained from SRTM data; these are comparable to those obtained from field surveys (12 and 9.5 m). However, at Yagawahama and Oyagawahama, Miyagi Prefecture, both SRTM and ASTER data provided maximum runup heights (41 to 45 m and 33 to 34 m, respectively), which are higher than those measured in the field (about 27 m). This difference in DEM and field data is associated with ASTER and SRTM DEM's pixel size and vertical accuracy, the latter being dependent on ground coverage, slope, aspect and elevation. Countries with less access to technology and infrastructure can benefit from the use of satellite imagery and freely available DEMs for an initial, pre-field surveys, rapid estimate of inundated areas, distances and runup, and for assisting in hazard management and mitigation after a natural disaster. © 2012 Springer Basel AG.

TI  - A New High Resolution Object-Oriented Approach To Define The Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of The Cover-Management Factor In Soil Erosion Modelling
JO  - CATENA
PY  - 2022
AB  - The cover management factor (C-factor) calculation requires the assessment of the intra-annual spatiotemporal variability of biomass cover, owed to the natural growth cycle of vegetation and the impact of agriculture on land cover. However, this is frequently omitted, and the vegetation conditions are approximated by assigning constant values to static classified Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps, such as the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC). Using as test site the Sperchios River catchment, Central Greece, this study introduces a new approach to estimate C-factor in a spatiotemporally exhaustive manner. The goal is to increase estimation accuracy in erosion modelling applications. The C-factor computations are performed on monthly scale, based on LULC maps that portray the basin's agricultural areas in unprecedented detail. The methodology involves the use of a biophysical index, namely Fraction of Vegetation Cover (F-cover) and empirical literature data on crop types. F-cover was developed from Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery in 10-m analysis. Such analysis (compared to the 300-m one provided by the EU) is a major improvement towards a more precise estimation of C-factor. The study identified the monthly C-factor fluctuation at basin scale, and the most susceptible months seasons at localities in terms of land cover/soil loss potential. The higher C-factor values were acquired in October and the lower in May. Mean annual (numerical) C-factor complies with the value of July. All monthly values are significantly higher - almost double - than the mean annual stationary one. The revealed patterns would not have been detected in a lower temporal (e.g., annual) resolution without the incorporation of vegetation density seasonality. The study shows high reproducibility and upscaling potential, as the utilized datasets are available in all European Union (EU) Member States, having similar structure, thus they can be harmonized towards a unified continental approach.

TI  - Climate Change And Effective Factors And Evaluation Of Edremit Coastal Areas
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
PY  - 2015
AB  - As is known, global warming is mentioned by many scientific institutions of UN. Since 1985, it is known that the temperature of the Planet increased of 1.5 degrees. So, UN takes attention to global climate change. This situation is also evaluated in climate conferences which performed 18 times and focused on precautions, because of the increase of temperature in the last 30 years. In this context, countries are cautioned about releasing CO,. This subject is socialised in different days and years. When coastal areas evaluated within the framework of the above considerations, they are important places where land and water integrated. Transporting pollution from soil to water and also from water to soil is important issue for coastal areas. In terms of particularly tourism activities and many other vital activities, coastal areas appear as a place which is the most widely used throughout the history of mankind and is being used. In this respect, Turkey always has been a potential place with a length of 8333 km coastline. Also, from past to present, our coasts continue to be used with maritime transport, fishing, and water-related industrial sector (such as thermal power plants), the second housing and tourism and likewise, activities. So, with this study, while considering status of coastal areas, we tried to make some determinations of the coast of Edremit Kucukkuyu and it identified regarding the measures and suggestions. In this study, the Gulf of Edremit 1985-2012 satellite images were evaluated by the method of remote sensing and environmental and sociocultural factors influencing coastal change have been presented. Thus, while putting forward the current state of the field, considered the development over the years. Based on global environmental problems, the situation was assessed for planning and also tried to develop recommendations for future planning decisions. In this research, as considering climate values within a certain period of time, developments are evaluated.

PY  - 2004
AB  - This study examines urban quality of life by assessing the relationship between observed socioeconomic conditions and urban forest amenities in Terre Haute, Indiana, USA. Using remote-sensing methods and techniques, and ordinary least squares regression, the paper determines the relationship between urban leaf area and a population density parameter with median income and median housing value. Results demonstrate positive correlations between urban leaf area, population density, and their interaction with median income and median housing value. Furthermore, leaf area, density, and their interaction statistically account for observed variance in median income and median housing value, indicating that these variables may be used to study observed quality-of-life metrics. The methods used in this study may be useful to city managers, planners, and foresters who are concerned with urban quality-of-life issues, and who are interested in developing and implementing alternative policy assessment regimes.

TI  - Membrane Technology Costs And Me
JO  - Water Research
PY  - 2017
AB  - A reflection of the place cost analysis holds in membrane process technology research and development is provided. The review encompassed two membrane processes and applications: (a) reverse osmosis (RO) for seawater desalination, and (b) membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for wastewater treatment. The cost analysis undertaken extended to (i) the determination of operating expenditure (OPEX) trends using simple analytical expressions, (ii) the subsequent estimation of the sensitivity of OPEX to individual system parameters, and (iii) published data on CAPEX for individual full-scale installations or from cost analyses. An appraisal of the peer-reviewed literature through a survey of a leading scientific database was also carried out. This bibliometric analysis was based on authors’ keywords; it aimed to establish the profile of process cost for each of the two applications when compared with other popular research topics. The OPEX analysis, ostensibly through a consideration of specific energy demand in kWh per m3 permeate, revealed it to relate primarily to hydrodynamics in the case of RO, and to both membrane fouling and air scouring for MBRs. The bibliometric analysis of research trends revealed a marked difference in emphasis on cost aspects between the two research areas, with the focus on cost specifically being 16 times greater for RO desalination of seawater than MBR treatment of wastewater. MBR research appears to be dominated by fouling and foulant characterisation, making up almost a quarter of all studies, notwithstanding evidence from practitioners that other process parameters are as important in determining MBR process OPEX and operability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Soil Moisture Assessment Through The Ssmmi And Gssim Algorithm Based On Spot, Worldview-2, And Sentinel-2 Images In The Daliuta Coal Mining Area, China
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2020
AB  - A set of indicators that focus only on numerical values is constructed based on remotely sensed images to assess soil moisture conditions. The quantitative evaluation of soil moisture variation in two periods is rarely referred to in the current literature. In this study, a scaled soil moisture monitoring index (SSMMI) was established to monitor the soil moisture status during 2010–2018 in the Daliuta Coal Mining Area (DCMA), China, based on SPOT-5, SPOT-6, and Sentinel-2 images. We also employed a gradient-based structural similarity (GSSIM) algorithm to quantitatively analyze the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the soil moisture in the DCMA. The optimal scale for exploring the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture was determined by local variance and semivariance methods. The results showed that the soil moisture decreased at a rate of 0.0213/a from 2010 to 2018. The areas with the extremely dry and dry levels, which were mainly located in the northwest, some regions of the central area, and the southeast of the DCMA, decreased from 14.48% in 2010 to 13.66% in 2018. The proportion of the no dry level was improved by 14.62%, while the area of the extremely wet and wet levels decreased by 13.79%. The mean value of the soil moisture in the unmined area was greater than that in the DCMA, which was larger than that in the mined area. The result of the GSSIM analysis indicated that the area of dramatic change, where the soil moisture changed substantially, was chiefly distributed in the north, west, some central regions, and some parts of the south and east of the DCMA. The region where the substantial change occurred was surrounded by a moderate-change area, which was encompassed by a low-change area. The area with dramatic and moderate decreases in the soil moisture accounted for 64.52% of the region, which was greater than that with incremental soil moisture changes, which accounted for 5.85% of the region. The area also showed decreased soil moisture from 2010 to 2018. Soil moisture changes are closely related to variations in land cover. For instance, vegetative cover over an open-pit mining area can cause a dramatic reduction in soil moisture. Ninety-three meters was the optimal scale used for monitoring the soil moisture in the DCMA, which indicates that we can adopt the SPOT-5, SPOT-6, and Sentinel-2 images to evaluate the soil moisture conditions in the DCMA. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Spatial–Temporal Patterns Of Summer Urban Islands And Their Economic Implications In Beijing
JO  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
PY  - 2022
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) has a great influence on human wellbeing in urban areas. Previous studies have investigated impact on environment, ecosystem, and human health of UHI. To investigate economic impact of UHI is a lack of research. In this study, spatial-econometric hedonic housing price models are developed for estimating the marginal value of summer UHI in Beijing, China. The results showed that UHI effects in Beijing became severe from 2015 to 2017. The heat islands showed a mix of high and sub-high land surface temperature (LST). The spatial Durbin model estimates that one-unit increase of UHI intensity (UHII) would lower the housing value by 3.91%. Regarding the different districts, households had different attitudes to the UHI effect. Specifically, households regarded UHI effect as amenity in the four suburban districts with hills and relatively low LSTs; however, in most urban districts and their surroundings, households were willing to pay to avoid UHI effects with 13.0 dollars to 826.3 dollars for one-degree UHII decrease. This study highlights the urgent need for planners and decision-makers to consider urban expansion, UHI effect, and their economic impact in future urban planning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Rapid Eco-Physical Impact Assessment Of Tropical Cyclones Using Geospatial Technology: A Case From Severe Cyclonic Storms Amphan
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2022
AB  - The tropical cyclones are very destructive during landfall, generating high wind speeds, heavy intensive rainfall, and severe storm surges with huge coastal inundations that have massive socioeconomic and ecological catastrophic effects on human beings and the economic well-being. The sizable ecological effects of cyclonic storms cannot be ignored because of the uncertainty of impact, intensity induced by a warming ocean, and sea level rise. The Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which falls under the category five classifications under the scheme of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), on the basis the maximum sustained wind speeds gusting up to 168 km/h affected parts of West Bengal and Odisha in India, and south-west Bangladesh between May 16 and 20, 2020. In this work, we have focused on the coastal districts of Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Balasore in Odisha, Purba Medinipur, and South Twenty-Four Parganas in West Bengal, India and, Khulna, Barisal division of Bangladesh that have been seriously affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan. The objective of the study is to analyze the eco-physical assessment of tropical cyclone Amphan using geospatial technology. Therefore, shoreline change detection and enhance vegetation index have been used in this research work to systematically analyze the eco-physical impact parameters of Cyclonic Storm Amphan using ortho-rectified Landsat 8/OLI imagery and MODIS dataset of USGS with high spatial resolutions of 30-500 m. The result highlights that about 60.33\% of the total transects of the study area was eroded, but only 24.99\% of the total transects experienced accretion, and 14.68\% of the total transects depicted stability. The scientific study will benefit coastal managers and policymakers in formulating action plans for coastal zone management, natural resilience, and sustainable future development.

TI  - The Use Of L-Band Sar Derived Soil Moisture Data In Protecting Critical Infrastructure
JO  - 3rd Conference on Geophysics for Infrastructure Planning, Monitoring and BIM, Held at Near Surface Geoscience Conference and Exhibition 2023, NSG 2023
PY  - 2023
AB  - From collapsing dams to failing embankments, disaster can strike when engineers fail to account for the presence of water in soil. ASTERRA addresses this risk by detecting underground soil moisture as deep as 3.0 metres below ground using patented algorithms combined with AI on satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. From tailings dams to waste mineral tips, road and rail infrastructure, this method can identify damage and locate potential points of failure, allowing preventative maintenance to be directed to where it is needed most, and crucially before the onset of failure can occur. This proprietary methodology was originally used in the search for water on Mars and has since been adapted to monitor soil moisture around critical infrastructure on Earth from orbit. The process uses data from commercial satellites equipped with L-Band SAR, which can penetrate through clouds, vegetation and soil. SAR data is analysed using a patented algorithm before delivering hard intelligence to planners, engineers, and policymakers. This allows decision-makers to make data-informed choices about the repair, maintenance, and long-term planning of above and below-ground infrastructure. This paper highlights the benefits of SAR data as a means of remotely monitoring soil moisture content and thereby safeguarding critical infrastructure. © 2023 NSG. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Ecological Network Design Based On Optimizing Ecosystem Services:case Study In The Huang-Huai-Hai Region, China
JO  - Ecological Indicators
PY  - 2023
AB  - In modern agricultural landscapes, constructing ‘ecological networks’ is regarded as an efficient way to conserve biodiversity and maintain ecosystem services. Here we aimed to develop an approach to design ecological corridor by employing the ecological source - resistance surface - ecological corridor framework in combination with semi-natural habitat planning and ecosystem service trade-off assessment. ‘Ecological source patches’ were identified based on a ‘Remote Sensing Ecological Index’ (RSEI) to objectively classify ecological and environmental conditions. Our resulting spatial resistance surface was further modified used based on the ‘Cultivated Land Use Intensity’ index, to derive a high accuracy and rationality of ecological corridor extraction in agriculture landscape. While planning the ecological network, key nodes and resulting semi-natural habitat (SNH) distribution were identified using Linkage Mapper tools and circuit theory. We constructed ecological network scenarios with different amounts of semi-natural habitats and calculated resulting regional ecosystem service values (ESV) using an equivalence factor method to explore optimal spatial layouts. The results showed, while regional ecosystem service values generally increased in line with semi-natural habitat area contained within the ecological network, ecological networks with forests covering 10% of the total area were predicted as an optimal scenario balancing ecosystem services with agricultural yield in the study region. Networks with mixed forest and grassland cover totaling 20% of the area represented an alternative choice that strongly enhanced regional ecosystem services while may still allowing for high agricultural productivity. In constructing corridors, identifying, restoring and protecting key ecological nodes using targeted management and habitat restoration, while protecting existing wetlands and other water bodies that support regional water cycle and supply services, should be prioritized. Regional policy measures furthermore need to promote targeted ecological network planning to help improve the overall sustainability of agricultural production. © 2023 The Author(s)

TI  - The Smart Grid-State-Of-The-Art And Future Trends
JO  - ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition with that suggested by a study group of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,) Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are given next. The first considers distribution network active management and future development trends in technologies and methods, where centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid. Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new and innovative research approaches and results are included. These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI) in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for wind-thermal-pumped storage systems, optimized power system restoration, robust data transmission upon compressive sensing, data fusion for wide-area oscillation monitoring, satellite based GPS synchronized monitoring systems, stability in Smart Grid with emerging renewable energy techno- logies.

TI  - Application Of Thermal Infrared Imagery To Canal Leakage Detection
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 1982
AB  - The North Unit Irrigation District of central Oregon is an area of limited water availability. Because of the limited water resource, close monitoring of water conveyance, application, and drainage are required. An HRB Singer AN/AAS 14 optical-electronic thermal infrared scanning system was used to test its utility for monitoring one aspect of the water management scheme, the conveyance or canal system. Thermal infrared imagery, sensed in the 8-14 μm portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, was found to be an economical and practical method of detecting conveyance system leakage sites. © 1982.

TI  - Changes Of Land Use And Landscape Pattern In Taihu Lake Basin
JO  - Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology
PY  - 2005
AB  - Based on three sets of land use data (1985, 1995 and 2000), and by means of the techniques of remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS), and landscape ecology, this paper studied the changes of land use and landscape pattern from 1985 to 2000 in Taihu Lake Basin located at Yangtse River Delta. The results showed that in past 15 years, the farmland in this Basin decreased, while the built-up areas, woodland, grassland and water body increased. The decrease of the farmland occupied 89.64% of total decrement, while the increase of the built-up areas accounted for 79.21% of total increment. Under the disturbance of human activities, the landscape structure and landscape heterogeneity in Taihu Lake Basin changed greatly. The patches density decreased from 0.996 to 0.930, diversity indices decreased from 1.127 to 1.113, evenness indices decreased from 62.891% to 62.109%; while the edge density increased from 4.408 to 4.459, dominance indices increased from 0.665 to 0.679, and shape indices increased from 1.540 to 2.796. The landscape heterogeneity varied with different kinds of landscape, indicating the complexity of landscape ecosystem. In all kinds of landscapes, farmland and grassland had the highest values of diversity indices. The diversity indices of water bodies decreased firstly and then increased, while those of built-up areas were in adverse. The evenness index was decreased in the order of woodland > farmland > grassland > water body > built-up areas. Population, economy and policies were the driving forces of the dynamic changes of landscape pattern in Lake Taihu Basin during past 15 years, and land use change in the Basin caused distinct landscape effects, such as landscape fragmenting, edge effects intensification, and environmental quality declining. The mode of land use should be adjusted in landscape scale to rehabilitate and reconstruct the landscape ecosystems in Taihu Lake Basin.

TI  - The Investigative Role Of Landsat‐Tm In The Examination Of Pre‐ And Proto‐Historic Water Management Sites In Northeast Thailand
JO  - Geocarto International
PY  - 1992
AB  - Recent archaeological research has demonstrated the presence of large numbers of ancient settlements mu ‘ang baran in northeastern Thailand with a time depth extending back more than two thousand years. The density of settlement is surprising in view of the severity of the climate with its long dry season, which makes the northeast one of the least productive agricultural regions in present‐day Thailand. It is clear that the existence of mu’ang boran necessitated careful management of the scarce water resources. In this study, the main types of earth‐work constructed for water control and storage are discussed and their air‐form characteristics, as seen on conventional air photography and Landsat imagery, are examined. The detectability of these earthworks on Landsat‐TM imagery is assessed using data from four separate field areas and the value of satellite imagery in prehistoric settlement pattern analysis is demonstrated. © 1992 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - 4dhi: An Index For Approximate Knn Search Of Remotely Sensed Images In Key-Value Databases
JO  - Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - State-of-the-art, scalable, indexing techniques in location-based image data retrieval are primarily focused on supporting window and range queries. However, support of these indexes is not well explored when there are multiple spatially similar images to retrieve for a given geographic location. Adoption of existing spatial indexes such as the kD-tree pose major scalability impediments. In response, this work proposes a novel scalable, key-value, database oriented, secondary-memory based, spatial index to retrieve the top k most spatially similar images to a given geographic location. The proposed index introduces a 4-dimensional Hilbert index (4DHI). This space filling curve is implemented atop HBase (a key-value database). Experiments performed on both synthetically generated and real world data demonstrate comparable accuracy with MD-HBase (a state of the art, scalable, multidimensional point data management system) and better performance. Specifically, 4DHI yielded 34% - 39% storage improvements compared to the disk consumption of the original index of MD-HBase. The compactness in 4DHI also yielded up to 3.4 and 4.7 fold gains when retrieving 6400 and 12800 neighbours, respectively; compared to the adoption of original index of MD-HBase for respective neighbour searches. An optimization technique termed 'Bounding Box Displacement' (BBD) is introduced to improve the accuracy of the top k approximations in relation to the results of in-memory kD-tree. Finally, a method of reducing row key length is also discussed for the proposed 4DHI to further improve the storage efficiency and scalability in managing large numbers of remotely sensed images. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Higher Education In The Arab World: Research And Development From The Perspective Of Oman And Sohar University
JO  - Higher Education in the Arab World: Research and Development
PY  - 2022
AB  - Arab states face challenges in many fields and sectors as they seek to move up the value chain and develop a knowledge-based economy. Increased investment in Research and Development (RandD) across all sectors is essential to provide solutions to these challenges and move beyond an oil-based economy. RandD in the higher education sector has an important role to play in solving the challenges facing Arab countries. The Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and Innovation has a responsibility in Oman for driving research and innovation through the development of national strategies along with funding key aspects of work linked to the Oman Vision 2040. Accordingly, higher education institutions in Oman, and Sohar University in particular, have established research platforms and centers focused on strategically important fields. In Oman, The Research Council (TRC) works to build research capacity, create a supportive environment for research, and provide funding to researchers. The aim is to enhance the quality of higher education and build confidence with stakeholders to support innovation across all sectors. Sohar University allocates about 5% of its annual revenue to support research and development. This approach is intended to build research capacity by supporting university staff to undertake research and knowledge transfer. In addition, through a number of partnerships, Sohar University has contributed to attracting local and Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) as part of its research and development. Examples include: (A) work with WR GRACE (USA) to establish one of the three qualitative testing laboratories of catalysts in the world used in the oil industry; a project that involved an investment value of $3.5 Million; (B) establishment of a $13 Million Advanced Manufacturing Research Center in partnership with the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion as part of the Sultanate’s program to implement the diversification of the economy; (C) funding from the British government as part of the UK-GCC research grants for the establishment of a food growing plant to localize advanced food technologies and support food security in Oman. These projects have contributed to the growth of the quality of research and development in Oman and demonstrate the importance of working in partnership across sectors. These projects have increased local value-added, have attracted local and foreign investment, supported innovation and creativity, created jobs for Omanis, and enhanced research and development capabilities. The investment in these projects has been impactful with the results demonstrating the validity of this partnership approach focused on strategically important challenges. They have also supported Sohar University in obtaining professional accreditation from organizations such as the Oman Academic Accreditation Authority and Engineers Australia. It is anticipated that the impact of this approach will contribute to RandD in the wider Omani context and establish Sohar University as one of the Sultanate’s leading RandD institutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

TI  - A Review Of Property Rights In Outer Space From A Land Management Perspective
JO  - Journal of Property, Planning and Environmental Law
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose: In light of the discussions on outer space property management, this conceptual review paper aims to discuss and evaluate if, when and under which conditions certain land management and property right frameworks can apply to allocate and/or restrict property rights in outer space. Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies a pragmatic review approach which seeks to better understand if and how the basic tenets of the land management frameworks could better shape and revise the challenges in outer space regulations. Findings: Despite the fact that regulatory guidelines on outer space rights are existing, the analysis shows that these lack a number of practical tools and measures aiming at intervening if stakeholders do not follow the rules. With the use of land management frameworks, it is possible to derive policy options for making the outer space management more practical and action-oriented, in particular for the removal of space debris. These include amongst others more attention for formulating global public restrictions in outer space, incorporating regulatory guidelines for accessing open space regimes, addressing responsiveness and robustness in adherence and compliance to regulations Research limitations/implications: Given the conceptual and discursive character of the paper, there are no specific empirical data, yet several recommendations for further research include expanding the boundary work between the land management and regulatory outer space domain. Practical implications: The insights derived from land management and real estate related property theories could potentially provide new starting points for (re)formulating the regulatory framework for outer space property discourses. Social implications: Interpreting the outer space regulations from known and practiced land management perspective helps to bridge the policy–society knowledge and necessity gap on outer space activities. Originality/value: The specific land management perspective and discursive analysis on outer space debris provide new options for devising and extending regulatory guidelines for assigning responsibilities on outer space debris and debris rights, restrictions and responsibilities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - The Academic Profession: Quality Assurance, Governance, Relevance, And Satisfaction
JO  - The Academic Profession in Europe: New Tasks and New Challenges
PY  - 2013
AB  - The academic profession has been changing, hopefully improving. These changes affect the profession’s internal modes of regulation and its autonomy and ability to avoid the intervention of external forces. The professional tensions with which the academic profession has to live with nowadays are included by experts in at least in four categories: massification, knowledge economy, managerialism, and competition. In this context, the definition of academic profession has become ambiguous due to the interference between academic jobs and those of other professionals that are theoretically a sort of “satellites” of the academia. It is clear that higher education faces new opportunities and new challenges in its role as actor to a more globalised society. Universities are under growing political pressure for reform in face of more acute competition for public resources in tandem with a marked slowdown in the growth of funding. In the same time, the universities are held responsible for quality assurance in respect of institutions’ academic activities. A major challenge in higher education is to demonstrate relevance and educational quality to an increasingly wide range of stakeholders’ conflicting expectations in the name of “accountability”. The concept of “social relevance” gains prominence. Relevance and importance of higher education need to be evaluated according to the extent of balance between societal expectations from various academic institutions and their true functions. Although academic career seems to remain an attractive choice, the challenge seems to be related to questions about the personal costs of succeeding in academic careers and how to maintain balance between work and family, personal satisfaction and career requirements. This “cost-benefit” of academic careers is operating in the general context of abandoning the tenure system and developing a parallel system of term appointment. Developing between the changes in the social, economic and political context, on the one hand, and the changes in higher education system, on the other hand, the academic profession has to define a new identity for itself. The “professionalisation” of academic profession is becoming more important as universities try to respond to issues relating to standards and quality, growing international competition, and generally “doing more with less”. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - Figs are keystone resources of tropical and subtropical forests since they are speciose and supporting plenteous animals. Ficus sarmentosa var. henryi (King) Corner, a functionally dioecious evergreen fig, is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. However, genetic information has hitherto been nearly terra incognita for this species, which hinders the protection and management of this species and the forests. In this study, we developed and characterized 10 polymorphic microsatellites in F. sarmentosa var. henryi. The numbers of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 15. The observed and expected heterozygosities within populations were 0-0.857 and 0-0.876, respectively. These polymorphic microsatellites will contribute to further population genetic studies, and thereby benefit resource conservation and forest protection.

TI  - Spatial Process Of Surface Urban Heat Island In Rapidly Growing Seoul Metropolitan Area For Sustainable Urban Planning Using Landsat Data (1996-2017)
JO  - CLIMATE
PY  - 2019
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is an important research topic in the scholarly community. There are only few research studies related to the UHI in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA). Therefore, this study examined the impact of urbanization on the formation of UHI in the SMA as a geospatial study by using Landsat data from 1996, 2006, and 2017. For this purpose, we analyzed the relative variation of land surface temperature (LST) with changes of land use/land cover (LULC) rather than absolute values of LST using gradient, intensity, and directional analyses. It was observed that the impervious surface (IS) has expanded, and the UHI effect was more penetrating in the study area, with considerable loss of other LULC including green surfaces along with the rapid urbanization of the study area. In this study, we divided the IS into persistent IS (PIS) and newly added IS (NAIS). The spatial distribution of the IS, forest surface (FS), PIS, and NAIS was observed based on gradient zones (GZs). The results show that GZ(1) recorded a difference of 6.0 degrees C when compared with the GZ(109) in 2017. The results also show that the city center was warmer than the surrounding areas during the period of study. Results reveal that the mean LST has a strong significant positive relationship with a fraction of IS and PIS in 2006 and 2017. On other hand, the mean LST has a strong negative relationship with a fraction of FS and NAIS in the same time points. Relatively low temperatures were recorded in FS and NAIS in both time points. Further, it was proved that the local climate of the SMA and its surroundings had been affected by the UHI effect. Therefore, urban planners of the SMA should seriously consider the issue and plan to mitigate the effect by improving the green surfaces of the city. More greening-oriented concepts are recommended in both horizontal and vertical directions of the SMA, that can be used to control the negative impact associated with UHI. The overall outputs of the study could be used as a proxy indicator for the sustainability of the SMA and its surroundings.

TI  - Greening The Urban Environment Using Geospatial Techniques, A Case Study Of Bangkok, Thailand
PY  - 2017
AB  - Urbanization is one of human induced activities causing land use changes. In recent years, various land use transformations in Bangkok influenced the city's ecological sustainability in all means, i.e., diminishing the city's cultivated land and greenery. This study investigates lack of green spaces due to extreme urban growth in the mega city. To do so, first, land use transitions are modelled through two different images; one from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper for the year 1994, and second from HJ-1A CCD for the year 2012. Next, the Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov Model (MLP-Markov) is applied to predict land use change for the year 2030. The MLP neural network is trained to model land use transitions through creating transition maps. Markov Chain predictive model is applied with sufficient accuracy to process the transition maps for the prediction process. The results indicate that 348km(2) of green areas are transformed into built-up areas for the period 1994-2012,witha considerable loss of greenery (42\%). The MLP model predictions show 4\% increase in built-up and 6\% decrease in greenery for the period 2012-2030. The study highly recommends conservation of green spaces and green corridors in the city. Future research can include analysing green plot ratio for suitable green patches in vulnerable sites. The research output will benefit urban planners to implement long term planning strategies for securing natural environment in mega cities. (C) The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2014, Nigeria halted transmission of wild poliovirus for the first time in its history. A critical enabling component in this historic achievement was the use of satellite data to produce more accurate maps and population estimates used in planning and implementing vaccination campaigns. This article employs a value-of-information approach to estimate the net socioeconomic benefits associated with this use of satellite data. We calculate the increase in the likelihood of halting transmission of polio associated with the use of satellite-based information compared to traditional data sources, and we consider the benefits associated with savings to the healthcare system as well as health benefits. Using a conservative approach focused on just 1 year of benefits, we estimate net socioeconomic benefits of between \$46.0 million and \$153.9 million. In addition to these quantified benefits, we also recognize qualitative benefits associated with improving human health, reaching marginalized communities, and building capacity among local populations. We also explore the substantial benefits associated with follow-on projects that have made use of the satellite-based data products and methodologies originally developed for the Nigeria polio eradication effort.

TI  - Detecting Major Phenological Stages Of Rice Using Modis-Evi Data And Symlet11 Wavelet In Northeast China
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2012
AB  - Plant phenology refers to the emergence of an annual cycle of natural phenomena in plants affected by climate and other environmental factors. Information of crop phenology can directly reflect the effect of temperature and precipitation on the crop, which is essential for evaluating crop growth, productivity and crop management. Remote sensing technique is an important method to detect vegetation phenology with high spatial-temporal scales. Vegetation index generated by infrared and near-infrared band based on satellite remotely sensed data can reflect the status of vegetation growth and coverage more accurately. The Northeast China includes Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which rice area accounts for about 10% of total rice area and its rice yield accounts for 11% of total rice yield in China. Rice planting in Northeast China plays an important role in China's food safety. In this study, we developed a method for detecting phenological stages of rice in Northeast China based on the EOS-MODIS multi-temporal remote sensing data, including MOD09A1 and MCD12Q1 in 2008. The rice crop phenological stages were detected by using EOS-MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data, and compared with the observed rice phenological stages in 24 selected agro-meteorological sites in Northeast China. The method consists of four procedures: (1) calculating the EVI value and extracting time profile from the location where 24 selected sites through MODIS-EVI data; (2) filtering the noise in EVI time profile by wavelet transform with twenty six types of wavelets; (3) identifying the rice planting date, heading date and ripening date by the variation characteristics in the smoothed EVI time profile; (4) comparing the result calculated by this method with the observed data from the 24 agro-meteorological sites in study area in 2008 and calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), then choosing the best type of wavelets. Due to the temporal resolution of the MODIS/Terra is 8 days, there will be missing data in the EVI time profile. The cubic spline interpolated (CSI) method (more smoother and stabler) was applied to repair the missing data, which can reflect the missing data more authentic. The twenty six types of wavelet: Daubechies(7-20), Coiflet(3-5) and Symlet(7-15) were used when filtering EVI time profile. The results showed that, the case using Symlet11 shows a remarkably good result in determining phenological stages, which is compared with the observed data. Most of the RMSE in planting date were less than 16 days. Most of the RMSE in heading date and ripening date were less than 8 days. It was shown that the Symlet11 filtering is the best method, which can be used to detect rice phenology in Northeast China. Furthermore, the Symlet11 filtering can be used to analyze variations and distribution of rice phenology with high-spatial scale in the whole Northeast China.

TI  - Mapping Root Zone Soil Moisture Using Remotely Sensed Optical Imagery
JO  - Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering
PY  - 2003
AB  - Field-based soil moisture measurements are cumbersome. Remote sensing techniques based on active or passive microwave data have limitations. This paper presents and validates a new method based on land surface energy balances using remotely sensed optical data (including thermal infrared), which allows field and landscape-scale mapping of soil moisture depth-averaged through the root zone of existing vegetation. Root zone depth can be variable when crops are emerging. The pixel-wise "evaporative fraction" (ratio of latent heat flux to net available energy) is related to volumetric soil moisture through a standard regression curve that is independent of soil and vegetation type. Validation with measured root zone soil moisture in cropped soils in Mexico and Pakistan has a root mean square error of 0.05 cm3 cm-3: the error is less than 0.07 cm3 cm-3 in 90% of cases. Consequently, soil moisture data should be presented in class intervals of 0.05 cm3 cm-3. The utility of this method is demonstrated at the field scale using multitemporal thematic mapper imagery for irrigated areas near Cortazar in Mexico, and for river basin-scale water resources distribution in Pakistan. The potential limitation is the presence of clouds and the time lag between consecutive images with field-scale resolution. With the falling price of optical satellite imagery, this technique should gain wider acceptance with river basin planners, watershed managers, and irrigation and drainage engineers.

TI  - Improved Retrievals Of Aerosol Optical Depth And Fine Mode Fraction From Goci Geostationary Satellite Data Using Machine Learning Over East Asia
JO  - ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) are important information for air quality research. Both are mainly obtained from satellite data based on a radiative transfer model, which requires heavy computation and has uncertainties. We proposed machine learning-based models to estimate AOD and FMF directly from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) reflectances over East Asia. Hourly AOD and FMF were estimated for 00–07 UTC at a spatial resolution of 6 km using the GOCI reflectances, their channel differences (with 30-day minimum reflectance), solar and satellite viewing geometry, meteorological data, geographical information, and the Day Of the Year (DOY) as input features. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning approaches were applied and evaluated using random, spatial, and temporal 10-fold cross-validation with ground-based observation data. LightGBM (R2 = 0.89–0.93 and RMSE = 0.071–0.091 for AOD and R2 = 0.67–0.81 and RMSE = 0.079–0.105 for FMF) and RF (R2 = 0.88–0.92 and RMSE = 0.080–0.095 for AOD and R2 = 0.59–0.76 and RMSE = 0.092–0.118 for FMF) agreed well with the in-situ data. The machine learning models showed much smaller errors when compared to GOCI-based Yonsei aerosol retrieval and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Dark Target and Deep Blue algorithms. The Shapley Additive exPlanations values (SHAP)-based feature importance result revealed that the 412 nm band (i.e., ch01) contributed most in both AOD and FMF retrievals. Relative humidity and air temperature were also identified as important factors especially for FMF, which suggests that considering meteorological conditions helps improve AOD and FMF estimation. Besides, spatial distribution of AOD and FMF showed that using the channel difference features to indirectly consider surface reflectance was very helpful for AOD retrieval on bright surfaces. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Methods For Specifying Spatial Boundaries Of Cities In The World: The Impacts Of Delineation Methods On City Sustainability Indices
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze how different definitions and methods for delineating the spatial boundaries of cities have an impact on the values of city sustainability indicators. It is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities from the outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. For this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. Although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. Those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. These methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. Furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. For example, the average values of CO2 emissions per capita and PM10 concentration in cities with more than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. When analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. It is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policy making. Otherwise, ineffective and inefficient policies will be developed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Jointly Developed Fcc Catalysts With Novel Mesoporous Zeolite Deliver Higher Yields And Economic Value To Refiners
JO  - NPRA Annual Meeting Technical Papers
PY  - 2011
AB  - Rive Technology Inc and Grace Davison Refining Technologies jointly developed the Rive's Molecular Highway™ technology, which makes traditional zeolite catalysts more capable of cracking large hydrocarbon molecules. It improves on zeolite Y by creating a network of intermediate sized (2-6 nm) mesoporous " molecular highways" throughout the crystals of zeolite Y. These "molecular highways" admit and pre-crack even the largest feed molecules, while also channeling product gasoline and diesel molecules safely out of the zeolite. This new catalyst is a drop-in replacement for current catalysts and will enable refiners to increase throughput and profitability without capital investment. A discussion covers the Rive™ zeolite technology; its incorporation into a Grace proprietary catalyst matrix formulation; preparations for a first refinery trial; and the benefits of Rive™ zeolite mesoporosity. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the NPRA 2011 Annual Meeting (San Antonio, TX 3/21/2011).

PY  - 2013
AB  - The degree of urbanization and resulting effects on Ecosystem Services is investigated in the Yangtze River Delta in China within a 20 year time frame from 1990 to 2010. A Random forest classifier is used to classify the Landsat mosaic from 1990 and the HJ-1A/B mosaic dating from 2010. Urban Land Index (UI) and Urban Expansion Index (UX) are used to represent the intensity and rapidity of urbanization. Post-Classification Change Detection is then performed and Ecosystem Service value losses for the land-cover classes water, wetland, forest and cropland that transitioned to urban areas are calculated according to a valuation scheme adapted to the Chinese market. The results showed that Yangtze River Delta experienced significant urbanization during 1990 to 2010. Urban areas increased alongside a major decrease in cropland resulting in a substantial loss of 4.2 billion CNY in Ecosystem Services.

AB  - Many of the models designed to support the hydrologic studies associated with urban water resources planning require input parameters that are defined in terms of land cover. Estimating the land cover is a difficult and expensive task and any innovation that can reduce these problems should be of significant value to the water resources planning community. The purpose of the reported investigation was to compare conventional and Landsat-based methods for determining the land cover inputs of hydrologic planning and design models. Comparisons were based on a case study of the Fourmile Run Watershed in Virginia. Results of the study indicated that for planning model studies the Landsat-based approach is highly cost-effective. However, in the design model investigations the errors encountered when the Landsat date are used were unacceptable.

TI  - Perspectives Of The Antipsoriatic Heliotherapy In Poland
JO  - Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Statistical analysis of the daily course of exposures to TL-01 tube radiation for 93 psoriatic patients from the Medical University of Łódź during 20-day phototherapy shows that the dose of 1 J/cm2 represents a unit of single exposure necessary for psoriasis healing. This value is converted to the antipsoriatic effective dose of 317.9 J/m2 using the TL-01 lamp irradiance spectrum and the antipsoriatic action spectrum. It is proposed that the daily exposure of 317.9 J/m2 serves as the standard antipsoriatic dose (SAPD) providing a link between the cabinet and the out-door exposures and it could be used for planning heliotherapy in Poland. A model is proposed to calculate ambient antipsoriatic doses for 3 h exposures around the local noon (9 am-12 am GMT) based on satellite measurements of ozone and cloud characteristics. The model constants are determined by a comparison with pertaining antipsoriatic doses measured by the Brewer spectrophotometer in central Poland. It is found that 3 h exposures to solar radiation in the period 15 May-15 September provides the mean (2005-2013) doses in the range 2.7-3.1 SAPD over Poland. Thus, heliotherapy could be treated as an alternative to the cabinet phototherapy for almost 4 months. It seems that the most effective site for antipsoriatic heliotherapy is the south/east part of Poland (the Bieszczady Mountains). The heliotherapy could be carried out in existing national health centers equipped with the standard easy-to-use biometers for on-line monitoring of UV level and controlling duration of sunbathing to avoid erythema risks. It is even possible to control the antipsoriatic heliotherapy by a patient himself, using low-cost hand-held instruments measuring UV index. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Agricultural Area Diversification And Crop Water Demand Analysis: A Remote Sensing And Gis Approach
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2013
AB  - Large scale adoption of input intensive rice-wheat cropping system in the centrally located Jalandhar district of Indian Punjab has led to over-exploitation of ground water resources, intensive use of chemical fertilizers and deterioration of soil health. To overcome these shortfalls, in the present study, agricultural area diversification plan has been generated from agricultural area and crop rotation maps derived from remote sensing data (IRS P6-AWiFS and RADARSAT ScanSAR) along with few agro-physical parameters in GIS environment. Cropping system indices (area diversity, multiple cropping and cultivated land utilization) were also worked out from remote sensing data. Analysis of remote sensing data (2004-05) revealed that rice and wheat individually remained the dominant crops, occupy 57. 8% and 64. 9% of total agricultural area (TAA), respectively. Therefore, in the diversified plan, it is suggested that at least 39% of the current 40% TAA under rice-wheat rotation should be replaced by other low water requiring, high value and soil enriching crops, particularly in coarse textured alluvial plain having good quality ground water zones with low annual rainfall(<700 mm). This will reduce water requirement to the tune of 15,660 cm depth while stabilizing the production and profitability by crop area diversification without further degradation of natural resources. © 2012 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.

AB  - One of the processes of the Organic Agriculture is the conversion, in which the agricultural activity is converted from conventional farming to the organic one. In the coffee case, the conversion from conventional to the organic system may bring some benefits, for example, the independence of external inputs, lower risk to health and it can provide more profits to the producer. Thus, this research aims to verify the economic viability of the organic coffee production of a rural property called Sítio Terra Verde, in Espírito Santo do Pinhal, São Paulo State, to convert from conventional to organic production. It was used linear programming to maximize profit and minimize costs of coffee production in two scenarios. The conversion planning has three stages: input replacement, conversion and organic production. The results showed that the adoption of organic technique provided higher profits for the producers than the conventional system at the end of the conversion period, when coffee prices increase. It was concluded that the adoption of organic management for the coffee farming can be economically viable, but it is extremely dependent on the price gap between conventional and organic systems.

TI  - Temporal Dynamics Of Evapotranspiration In Semiarid Native Forests In Brazil And Spain Using Remote Sensing
JO  - Hydrological Processes
PY  - 2021
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in integrated water resource planning, development and management. This process is particularly relevant in semiarid regions. The aim of this study is, hence, to compare spatial and temporal patterns of actual ET, as well as the temporal trends in two different semiarid forests, Caatinga (Brazil) and Tierra de Pinares (Spain). We used the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) to assess actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in both areas. In the Brazilian semiarid forest, Caatinga is the main vegetation, while it is Pinares in Spain. For this purpose, 69 Landsat-5 and 42 Landsat-8 images (1995–2019) were used. The Mann–Kendall test was applied to assess the occurrence of trends in precipitation, temperature and potential ET data; and the Temporal Stability Index (TSI) to know which areas have greater seasonal ETa. The annual amplitude of the potential evapotranspiration (ET0) is the same in both areas, however, the Caatinga values are higher. In the Caatinga forest, when ET0 presents its highest values throughout the year, ETa presents the lowest, and vice versa. In the Pinares forest, ETa follows the ET0 dynamics during the year, and the difference between ET0 and ETa is maximum during the summer. The Caatinga forest showed a greater spatial variation of ETa than the Pinares forest as well as a greater extension with lower temporal stability of ETa than the Pinares forest. Both the Caatinga forest and the Pinares forest showed significant positive trends in annual ET0 and ETa. We estimate that the value of ETa increases more rapidly in Pinares than in the Brazilian Caatinga. Taking Caatinga as a hydrological mirror, some consequences are expected to Pinares, such as significant changes in the water balance, increase of biodiversity vulnerability, and reduction of water availability in soil and reservoirs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Understanding Measurement Reporting And Verification Systems For Redd+ As An Investment For Generating Carbon Benefits
JO  - Forests
PY  - 2017
AB  - Reducing emissions from forests-generating carbon credits-in return for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) payments represents a primary objective of forestry and development projects worldwide. Setting reference levels (RLs), establishing a target for emission reductions from avoided deforestation and degradation, and implementing an efficient monitoring system underlie effective REDD+ projects, as they are key factors that affect the generation of carbon credits. We analyzed the interdependencies among these factors and their respective weights in generating carbon credits. Our findings show that the amounts of avoided emissions under a REDD+ scheme mainly vary according to the monitoring technique adopted; nevertheless, RLs have a nearly equal influence. The target for reduction of emissions showed a relatively minor impact on the generation of carbon credits, particularly when coupled with low RLs. Uncertainties in forest monitoring can severely undermine the derived allocation of benefits, such as the REDD+ results-based payments to developing countries. Combining statistically-sound sampling designs with Lidar data provides a means to reduce uncertainties and likewise increases the amount of accountable carbon credits that can be claimed. This combined approach requires large financial resources; we found that results-based payments can potentially pay-off the necessary investment in technologies that would enable accurate and precise estimates of activity data and emission factors. Conceiving of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems as investments is an opportunity for tropical countries in particular to implement well-defined, long-term forest monitoring strategies. © 2017 by the authors.

JO  - URBANO
PY  - 2019
AB  - The concentration of human activities in areas with intense urbanization and deficiencies in urban planning impacts natural and semi-natural ecosystems. As a result, adequate planning of urban growth aligned with sustainable dwelling practices is needed. This is relevant in regions with natural and heritage environmental values, which simultaneously have a tendency towards deterioration, spatial fragmentation (agricultural and natural) and socio-environmental segregation. The aim of this study was to identify the inconsistencies in land planning in the regulations that govern the land uses proposed in the regional planning instruments (IPTs in Spanish) (La Campana Satellite Intercommunal Regulation Plan (PRI-LC and PREMVAL)), and the sustainability criteria that guide the natural and heritage areas proposed in the La Campana-Penuelas Biosphere Reserve (BR) zoning. By studying the PRI-LC and comparing it with the zoning model proposed for the La Campana-Penuelas BR, the overlapping spaces between the urban expansion and protection areas were analyzed. The results show the existence of zones of potential territorial conflict (in areas of natural and agricultural value) in each BR zone (core, buffer and transition). There is no agreement between the IPTs that ensure the protection of areas of environmental value. The regulation presents numerous inconsistencies and discrepancies that are at odds with the sustainable development criteria, and with a protection entity like a BR, particularly in areas allocated for agricultural use. It is recommended that the citizen participation and awareness tools be updated, and the sustainability criteria be modified using those implemented in the Regional Planning Instruments for Biosphere Reserves.

TI  - Linking Capacity Development To Goos Monitoring Networks To Achieve Sustained Ocean Observation
JO  - Frontiers in Marine Science
PY  - 2018
AB  - Developing enduring capacity to monitor ocean life requires investing in people and their institutions to build infrastructure, ownership, and long-term support networks. International initiatives can enhance access to scientific data, tools and methodologies, and develop local expertise to use them, but without ongoing engagement may fail to have lasting benefit. Linking capacity development and technology transfer to sustained ocean monitoring is a win-win proposition. Trained local experts will benefit from joining global communities of experts who are building the comprehensive Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). This two-way exchange will benefit scientists and policy makers in developing and developed countries. The first step toward the GOOS is complete: identification of an initial set of biological Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) that incorporate the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Essential Biological Variables (EBVs), and link to the physical and biogeochemical EOVs. EOVs provide a globally consistent approach to monitoring where the costs of monitoring oceans can be shared and where capacity and expertise can be transferred globally. Integrating monitoring with existing international reporting and policy development connects ocean observations with agreements underlying many countries' commitments and obligations, including under SDG 14, thus catalyzing progress toward sustained use of the ocean. Combining scientific expertise with international capacity development initiatives can help meet the need of developing countries to engage in the agreed United Nations (UN) initiatives including new negotiations for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, and the needs of the global community to understand how the ocean is changing. © 2018 Bax, Appeltans, Brainard, Duffy, Dunstan, Hanich, Harden Davies, Hills, Miloslavich, Muller-Karger, Simmons, Aburto-Oropeza, Batten, Benedetti-Cecchi, Checkley, Chiba, Fischer, Andersen Garcia, Gunn, Klein, Kudela, Marsac, Obura, Shin, Sloyan, Tanhua and Wilkin.

TI  - The Demeter Microsatellite And Ground Segment
JO  - Planetary and Space Science
PY  - 2006
AB  - The Demeter program is the first application of the Myriade microsatellite program conducted by the Cnes (French Space Agency) since 1997. The Myriade objective was to benefit from the miniaturization of the technologies to develop a product with a reduced size, weight and cost able to implement either scientific missions, demonstrators or operational applications in different areas: earth observation, astronomy, fundamental physics or telecommunications, within limited financial budget. The Demeter satellite was launched in end of June 2004, from Baikonour, aboard a Dnepr launcher, on a sun synchronous orbit at 710 km altitude. Its main scientific objectives are the detection and characterization of ionosphere electrical and magnetic disturbances in connection with a seismic activity. The scientific payload has been built by French scientific institutes (LPCE, CESR, CETP) involved in external and internal geophysics and by SSD/ESTEC (ESA). It is composed of several electrical and magnetic sensors, an ion spectrometer, an energetic particle analyzer and a Langmuir probe. The Demeter platform is designed in order to offer a high level of performances in terms of power, attitude and orbit control, data storage and transmission, flexibility. For example the large amount of scientific data is transmitted to the ground station with a high data rate telemetry link in X band. This paper describes the Demeter satellite and ground segment. It focuses on the specific design adaptations of the Myriade product for Demeter and it presents the preliminary in orbit platform performances. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring The Impact Of Land Cover Change On Surface Urban Heat Island Through Google Earth Engine: Proposal Of A Global Methodology, First Applications And Problems
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2018
AB  - All over the world, the rapid urbanization process is challenging the sustainable development of our cities. In 2015, the United Nation highlighted in Goal 11 of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) the importance to "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for proper indicators, representing different aspects of city conditions, obviously including the Land Cover (LC) changes and the urban climate with its most distinct feature, the Urban Heat Island (UHI). One of the aspects of UHI is the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), which has been investigated through airborne and satellite remote sensing over many years. The purpose of this work is to show the present potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process the huge and continuously increasing free satellite Earth Observation (EO) Big Data for long-term and wide spatio-temporal monitoring of SUHI and its connection with LC changes. A large-scale spatio-temporal procedure was implemented under GEE, also benefiting from the already established Climate Engine (CE) tool to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imagery and the simple indicator Detrended Rate Matrix was introduced to globally represent the net effect of LC changes on SUHI. The implemented procedure was successfully applied to six metropolitan areas in the U.S., and a general increasing of SUHI due to urban growth was clearly highlighted. As a matter of fact, GEE indeed allowed us to process more than 6000 Landsat images acquired over the period 1992-2011, performing a long-term and wide spatio-temporal study on SUHI vs. LC change monitoring. The present feasibility of the proposed procedure and the encouraging obtained results, although preliminary and requiring further investigations (calibration problems related to LST determination from Landsat imagery were evidenced), pave the way for a possible global service on SUHI monitoring, able to supply valuable indications to address an increasingly sustainable urban planning of our cities.

TI  - Atmospheric Observations And Numerical Waeather Prediction
JO  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
PY  - 2007
AB  - Today's 72-hour weather forecast is as accurate, globally, as the 24-hour forecast of the 1980s. The recent improvement in accuracy, for the southern hemisphere in particular, is remarkable. This achievement came about through scientific understanding of dynamical and physical processes in the atmosphere coupled with new and enhanced modelling techniques, increased availability of remote-sensing data from weather satellites, and progress in data assimilation techniques that incorporate weather observations into numerical prediction models. The great advances in computing power have also contributed significantly to the forecaster's performance. Further improvements in the accuracy and reliability of climate and weather forecasts are to be expected as a result of superior data observation and assimilation techniques and modelling. The challenge to the forecaster is to provide user-specific risk-management information on various time scales, so that the users of this information can realize the social and economic value of advanced weather and environmental predictions more fully.

JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Remote sensing technologies are extensively applied to prevent, monitor, and forecast hazardous risk conditions in the present-day global climate change era. This paper presents an overview of the current stage of remote sensing approaches employed to study coastal and delta river regions. The advantages and limitations of Earth Observation technology in characterizing the effects of climate variations on coastal environments are also presented. The role of the constellations of satellite sensors for Earth Observation, collecting helpful information on the Earth's system and its temporal changes, is emphasized. For some key technologies, the principal characteristics of the processing chains adopted to obtain from the collected raw data added-value products are summarized. Emphasis is put on studying various disaster risks that affect coastal and megacity areas, where heterogeneous and interlinked hazard conditions can severely affect the population.

TI  - Forest Disturbances And The Attribution Derived From Yearly Landsat Time Series Over 1990-2020 In The Hengduan Mountains Region Of Southwest China
JO  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background Natural forests in the Hengduan Mountains Region (HDMR) have pivotal ecological functions and provide diverse ecosystem services. Capturing long-term forest disturbance and drivers at a regional scale is crucial for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. Methods We used 30-m resolution Landsat time series images and the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform to map forest disturbances at an annual time scale between 1990 and 2020 and attributed causal agents of forest disturbance, including fire, logging, road construction and insects, using disturbance properties and spectral and topographic variables in the random forest model. Results The conventional and area-adjusted overall accuracies (OAs) of the forest disturbance map were 92.3\% and 97.70\% +/- 0.06\%, respectively, and the OA of mapping disturbance agents was 85.80\%. The estimated disturbed forest area totalled 3313.13 km(2) (approximately 2.31\% of the total forest area in 1990) from 1990 to 2020, with considerable interannual fluctuations and significant regional differences. The predominant disturbance agent was fire, which comprised approximately 83.33\% of the forest area disturbance, followed by logging (12.2\%), insects (2.4\%) and road construction (2.0\%). Massive forest disturbances occurred mainly before 2000, and the post-2000 annual disturbance area significantly dropped by 55\% compared with the pre-2000 value. Conclusions This study provided spatially explicit and retrospective information on annual forest disturbance and associated agents in the HDMR. The findings suggest that China's logging bans in natural forests combined with other forest sustainability programmes have effectively curbed forest disturbances in the HDMR, which has implications for enhancing future forest management and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Cross-Border Education In Africa For Global Geoinformation - Focus On Waternet.
PY  - 2010
AB  - The SADC regional programme of WaterNet draws its membership from university departments and research institutions from 17 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa that are involved in education, training, research and outreach in Integrated Water Resources Management. WaterNet is governed by its members through the WaterNet Trust and managed on a day to day basis by the Secretariat currently domiciled at the University of Zimbabwe. Since inception in 1999, WaterNet's flagship has been the Masters degree in Integrated Water Resources Management, hosted by six universities offering six different specialisations within SADC, although at the moment the degree is only conferred by two of these. So far, four professors, sponsored by WaterNet have been appointed to provide academic guidance at the various host institutions. To date, over 300 students have graduated from the programme. Various research projects have been carried out, resulting in a number of practical implementations within the region as well as PhD graduates. Several hundreds of water professionals have benefited from short professional development and training courses sponsored by WaterNet and offered at various locations within the region. To date, nine symposia have been held annually and throughout the SADC region, at which fora, practitioners have presented their research findings and several of these have been peer reviewed and published in the Journal of Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, of which eight volumes have been produced so far. The modules offered in the Masters programme and the professional development courses are continually reviewed and updated through WaterNet's quality control and review committee, of which there have been new additions including aspects of climate change. Earth Observation and Geographic Information Systems (EO and GIS) are integral parts of IWRM-related studies; hence the objective of cooperation to strengthen the EO and GIS related curricula in the WaterNet educational system. ITC and WaterNet will jointly work together to develop EO-GIS related curricula of which it has already been agreed to set up a seventh specialization in this area to be based at the University of KwaZulu Natal. This paper outlines the objectives, governing structure, activities and achievements of WaterNet and further justifies the need to incorporate global geoinformation for Integrated Water Resources Management.

TI  - The Legal Framework For South African Space Activities: An Analysis Of The Legal Rules Governing Launching, Operation Of A Satellite And Applications By Private Actors
JO  - 62nd International Astronautical Congress 2011, IAC 2011
PY  - 2011
AB  - South Africa as an emerging space faring nation has been participating actively in the exploration of space since the dawn of the Space Age in the 1950's and there has been an continuous history of scientific endeavours moving from a satellite tracking, support for lunar and interplanetary missions from a CSIR tracking station at Hartebeesthoek, launch of - kilogram micro-satellite, SunSat in 1999 and the launch of eighty kilogram micro-satellite, in 2009. In addition, space applications have become an indispensable part of the modern information society and growing recognition of the benefits derived from the use of space applications is encouraging the country to conduct space activities. All these activities show a commitment by the government of South Africa to advance its scientific and technology activities in order to deliver on a wide range of national priorities relating to our socio-economic development. All these activities were undertaken without any specific relevant legal framework as the first national legislation was only enacted in 1993, amended in 1995.However, for the country to effectively participate in international markets, a supportive legal and regulatory environment which is in accordance with international standards and practices should be strengthened. Even though a number of basic components of the legal framework covering activities directly contributing to the launching of spacecraft and the operation of such craft in outer space and communications are in place, but some gaps remain in other areas including remote sensing as there are only policies than laws. As a result, existing regimes are currently not very supportive of commercial space activities as they are focusing on National interests.

TI  - Land Reclamation And Risk Assessment In The Coastal Zone Of China From 2000 To 2010
JO  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2020
AB  - Monitoring and assessing of land reclamation are essential components of sustainable coastal management. In this study, satellite remote sensing data were used in combination with ground investigations to systematically obtain land reclamation data for the coastal zone of China from 2000-2010. Then, the spatiotemporal variation in land reclamation and morphology of the coastal zone was analyzed. Furthermore, a spatially explicit habitat risk assessment (HRA) model from the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST 3.0) suite of tools was adopted to evaluate the risk posed by land reclamation to key coastal habitats over these ten years. Our results show that (1) the overall land reclamation intensity was higher in the north and lower in the south. At the Sea Region level, both the sea-filling area and tidal flat reclamation area in the Bohai Sea were higher than those of the other three sea regions. At the province level, Hebei, Jiangsu and Tianjin provinces were the top three in sea-filling reclamation, while Liaoning, Jiangsu and Shandong exhibited the greatest increases in tidal flat reclamation; (2) 31.2\% of land reclamation happened in the natural coastal zone, reducing natural coastlines from 54.6\% to 44.1\% between 2000 and 2010; (3) land reclamation posed a great risk to important coastal habitats. Half of the tidal flat and 5\% of the mangrove habitats experienced a high risk from tidal flat reclamation and sea filling, while 43.1\% of saline meadows were at high risk, mainly from agricultural development and industrial construction. We argue that regional development strategies played important roles in stimulating land reclamation from 2000-2010. Considering multiple social and ecological functions of the coastal zone, trade-offs between land reclamation and ecosystem conservation should be recognized. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Increased Water Use Efficiency In China And Its Drivers During 2000-2016
JO  - ECOSYSTEMS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the carbon uptake per unit of water consumption, is a critical indicator of the coupling between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in WUE and its drivers is vital for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Herein, we used a remote sensing-driven analytical model to estimate spatiotemporal variations of WUE in China during 2000-2016 and quantified its key drivers. The simulated WUE matched well with the eddy covariance observations across different ecosystems in China, with coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.81. The annual WUE increased significantly at a rate of 0.021 g C mm(-1) H2O y(-1) (P < 0.01), with the mean value of 1.62 g C mm(-1) H2O during 2000-2016. Analyses based on a factorial experiment (FE) and the sensitivity method (SE) showed that the increased leaf area index was the largest contributor to the increase in WUE, with contributions of 50.1\% and 42.8\% determined via FE and SE, respectively. CO2 enrichment was the second largest contributor (FE: 20.7\% and SE: 31.4\%), followed by the decrease in the vapor pressure deficit (FE: 15.4\% and SE: 13.4\%). The increased ratio of water loss by canopy interaction had a negative impact on WUE due to the increased non-productive water loss. Although these attributions had some inherent uncertainties, the results highlighted that the significant greening in China, which was mainly caused by human land-use management, and increased CO2 concentrations significantly promoted WUE during the recent 17 years.

TI  - Analyzing Long-Term High-Rise Building Areas Changes Using Deep Learning And Multisource Satellite Images
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - High-rise building areas (HRBs) provide significant social and environmental services and play a crucial role in modern urbanization. The large-scale and long-term spatial distribution of HRBs is of great interest to many fields, such as urban planning and local climate analysis. While previous studies have confirmed the value of Sentinel-2 images in extracting HRBs and their changes, current work is limited to relatively local areas and short-term analysis. One reason is due to the fact that the earliest Sentinel-2 image can only date back to 2015. To address this research gap, this paper proposes an efficient procedure to intelligently extract HRBs and their changes from multitemporal Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images, using a specifically designed fully convolutional network. To validate the proposed method, we selected four typical cities in China, namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Zhengzhou, as study areas. We utilized Landsat-7 images acquired in 2000 and 2010, along with Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2020, as experimental data. We extracted and analyzed three periods of HRBs and their changes in the four cities, along with urban rail terminal data and gross domestic product (GDP) data in the same period. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently extract HRBs and their changes in the four cities over the past 20 years, with an overall accuracy of more than 90\%. HRBs changes are primarily driven by urban planning policies and geographical factors. There is a strong positive correlation between the increase in HRBs and the increase in rail terminals, both in terms of quantity and spatial distribution. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between HRBs increase and GDP increase in terms of quantity, but the trend varies in different cities due to their diverse developing modes. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed method can be a potential operational tool to extract large-scale and long-term HRBs and their changes in China.

TI  - A Copula Approach For Sea Level Anomaly Prediction: A Case Study For The Black Sea
JO  - SURVEY REVIEW
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forecasting future sea levels is of great importance in terms of the conservation of coastal areas, monitoring and forecasting coastal ecosystems, and the maintenance and planning of coastal structures. In addition, highly accurate sea level forecasts allow adequate water management policies and coastal infrastructures to be developed. Today, many methods, such as harmonic analyses, artificial neural networks and support vector machines, are used to predict sea level anomalies. In this study, a novel approach based on Copula functions is presented for the prediction of sea level anomalies. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the applicability and capability of Copula-based prediction models in predicting short-term variations in the sea level. The minimum 95\% correlations and minimum 22 mm RMSE values in sea level anomaly predictions during the testing period indicate that the Copula approach can be a powerful tool in the prediction of sea level anomalies.

TI  - Long-Term Evaluation Of Three Satellite Ocean Color Algorithms For Identifying Harmful Algal Blooms (Karenia Brevis) Along The West Coast Of Florida: A Matchup Assessment
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - We present a simple algorithm to identify Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico along the west coast of Florida in satellite imagery. It is based on an empirical analysis of collocated matchups of satellite and in situ measurements. The results of this Empirical Approach is compared to those of a Bio-optical Technique - taken from the published literature - and the Operational Method currently implemented by the NOAA Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System for K. brevis blooms. These three algorithms are evaluated using a multi-year MODIS data set (from July, 2002 to October, 2006) and a long-term in situ database. Matchup pairs, consisting of remotely-sensed ocean color parameters and near-coincident field measurements of K. brevis concentration, are used to assess the accuracy of the algorithms. Fair evaluation of the algorithms was only possible in the central west Florida shelf (i.e. between 25.75°N and 28.25°N) during the boreal Summer and Fall months (i.e. July to December) due to the availability of valid cloud-free matchups. Even though the predictive values of the three algorithms are similar, the statistical measure of success in red tide identification (defined as cell counts in excess of 1.5×104 cells L-1) varied considerably (sensitivity-Empirical: 86%; Bio-optical: 77%; Operational: 26%), as did their effectiveness in identifying non-bloom cases (specificity-Empirical: 53%; Bio-optical: 65%; Operational: 84%). As the Operational Method had an elevated frequency of false-negative cases (i.e. presented low accuracy in detecting known red tides), and because of the considerable overlap between the optical characteristics of the red tide and non-bloom population, only the other two algorithms underwent a procedure for further inspecting possible detection improvements. Both optimized versions of the Empirical and Bio-optical algorithms performed similarly, being equally specific and sensitive (~70% for both) and showing low levels of uncertainties (i.e. few cases of false-negatives and false-positives: ~30%)-improved positive predictive values (~60%) were also observed along with good negative predictive values (~80%). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Long Time Series Of Daily Evapotranspiration In China Based On The Sebal Model And Multisource Images And Validation
JO  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
PY  - 2021
AB  - Satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) have been widely used for water resources management in China. An accurate ET product with a high spatiotemporal resolution is required for research on drought stress and water resources management. However, such a product is currently lacking. Moreover, the performances of different ET estimation algorithms for China have not been clearly studied, especially under different environmental conditions. Therefore, the aims of this study were as follows: (1) to use multisource images to generate a long-time-series (2001-2018) daily ET product with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); (2) to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the SEBAL ET in China using flux observational data and hydrological observational data; and (3) to compare the performance of the SEBAL ET with the MOD16 ET product at the point scale and basin scale under different environmental conditions in China. At the point scale, both the models performed best in the conditions of forest cover, subtropical zones, hilly terrain, or summer, respectively, and SEBAL performed better in most conditions. In general, the accuracy of the SEBAL ET (rRMSE = 44.91 \%) was slightly higher than that of the MOD16 ET (rRMSE = 48.72 \%). In the basin-scale validation, both the models performed better than in the point-scale validation, with SEBAL obtaining results superior (rRMSE = 13.57 \%) to MOD16 (rRMSE D 32.84 \%). Additionally, both the models showed a negative bias, with the bias of the MOD16 ET being higher than that of the SEBAL ET. In the daily-scale validation, the SEBAL ET product showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.92 mmd(-1) and an r value of 0.79. In general, the SEBAL ET product can be used for the qualitative analysis and most quantitative analyses of regional ET. The SEBAL ET product is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4243988 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4896147 (Cheng, 2020a, b). The results of this study can provide a reference for the application of remotely sensed ET products and the improvement of satellite ET observation algorithms.

PY  - 1999
AB  - The emergence, on the markets, of new technologies evokes, for the potential users, a lot of questions concerning the implementation and operation costs associated with these technologies. Nevertheless, for a lot of users, costs should be considered with the benefits these technologies are able to generate. The benefit-cost analysis is a useful tool for a financial evaluation of the transferability of the technology. This method has been selected to evaluate the eventual implementation of remote sensing technologies for snow cover measurements in the La Grande river basin (Quebec, Canada). Indeed, a better assessment of the snow water equivalent leads to a better forecasting of the water inputs due to the snowmelt. Thus, the improvement of the snow cover monitoring has direct impact on hydroelectric reservoir management. The benefit-cost analysis was used to compare three acquisition modes of the satellite Radarsat 1 (ScanSAR, Wide and Standard). The costs considered for this project are: R D costs and operations costs (the purchase of images and costs of gound truth measurements). We evaluated the raw benefits on the basis of reducing the standard deviation of predicted inflows. The results shows that the ScanSAR mode is the primary remote sensing tool for the monitoring ofthe snow cover, on an operational basis. With this acquisition mode, the benefit-cost ratios range between 2.3:1 and 3.9:1, using a conservative 4% reduction of the standard deviation. Even if the reduction is only 3%, ScanSAR remains profitable. Due to the large number of images needed to cover all the territory, the Standard and Wide modes are penalized by the purchase and the processing costs of the data and with delays associated to the processing. Nevertheless, with these two modes, it could be possible to work with a partial coverage of the watershed, 75% being covered in 4 days in Wide mode. The estimated B/C ratios (1.5:1 et 2:1) confirm the advantages of this alternative, particularly if any technical problems (geometric correction and radiometric precision) are encountered with ScanSAR products. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

TI  - Landslide Risk Management In The Arno River Basin
JO  - Landslide Science and Practice: Social and Economic Impact and Policies
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Basin Plan is, under the Italian law, the legislative, technical-operational and knowledge instrument used to plan, programme actions, and use regulations for soil conservation, protection and valorisation, and for correct water use in context of the physical and environmental characteristics of the Basin territory (Fig. 1). In specific terms, the Hydrogeological Management Plan (PAI), approved by the Arno River Basin Authority in 2005, faces the issues concerning landslide risk and geomorphological hazard. The Arno River Basin Authority constantly updates its landslide hazard zonation by identifying landslide prone sites on the basis of the Italian Landslide Inventory Criteria (IFFI project-ISPRA). Moreover, satellite-based radar interferometry detects assets at risk of landslide activity. A procedure that not only allows the maximum level of interplay and coherence between land use planning and river basin planning, but also influences and supports decisions at the different administrative levels. This allows the provisional cost-benefit assessment of landslide risk reduction actions with the general aim of environmental protection and efficient territorial management policy. Under the European Legislation, that foresees the integrated management of the different basins belonging to each District, National Basin Authorities are assigned a coordination role as regards to the updating procedure of the River Basin District Management Plans, under Directive 2000/60/EC, and the drafting of the Flood Management Plans under Directive 2007/60/EC. This active role envisages the updating of the knowledge framework and data concerning slope instability and landslides. It will result in the consequent updating of the Landslide Hydrogeological Management Plan which is included, like the above mentioned plans, in the River Basin District Management Plan. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

TI  - I Ac-12-B4-7b-2-14357 A Performance Assessment Of An 1nterferometr1c Sar Network For The Equatorial Region
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2012
AB  - Intcrfcromctric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions employing flying formations are already playing a major role in operational bi-static remote sensing applications; viz. the TerraSAR-X and Tandcm-X formation. The user requirement for 3-D digital elevation model (DEM) imagery for application in cartography, rectification, geographic information system (G1S) and other application areas is on the rise. The equatorial region (ER) is vastly populated by developing nations that sparsely harness the benefits of space missions and are in need of affordable satellite data to assist in urban development, disaster monitoring and mitigation, o mapping and various other application areas. The ER is defined as the boundary lines of latitude between 10 N o o and 10 S of the Equator. The design of a small SAR satellite network, positioned at an inclination of 10 , with each satellite having different ascending nodes and possibly different eccentricities, thereby implementing a Pendulum configuration, offers a possible solution for providing rapid SAR data to developing nations. A bi/multistatic configuration based on a "master" satellite (transmitter/receiver) and several "slave" (receiver- only) satellites is proposed. The "slave" satellites are positioned at variable distances behind or ahead of the "master" satellite, allowing for a single pass interferometry. The requirement for high resolution data and low payload mass, informed the decision of selecting the X-band frequency for payload operations. This paper addresses the possibilities of implementing a formation of small SAR satellites in low Earth orbit, for intcrfcromctric operations over the equatorial region. It starts by considering the orbit network configuration, and then proposing a method of defining the formation envelope for the respective acrosstrack and along-track distances between two satellites flying in trailing formation. Parametric analysis of the orbital element requirements necessary to maintain the formation is then discussed and a proposed in-orbit formation configuration is described.

TI  - Rapid Mapping And Annual Dynamic Evaluation Of Quality Of Urban Green Spaces On Google Earth Engine
JO  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
PY  - 2021
AB  - In order to achieve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to green spaces, monitoring dynamic urban green spaces (UGSs) in cities around the world is crucial. Continuous dynamic UGS mapping is challenged by large computation, time consumption, and energy consumption requirements. Therefore, a fast and automated workflow is needed to produce a high-precision UGS map. In this study, we proposed an automatic workflow to produce up-to-date UGS maps using Otsu's algorithm, a Random Forest (RF) classifier, and the migrating training samples method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We took the central urban area of Beijing, China, as the study area to validate this method, and we rapidly obtained an annual UGS map of the central urban area of Beijing from 2016 to 2020. The accuracy assessment results showed that the average overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (KC) were 96.47\% and 94.25\%, respectively. Additionally, we used six indicators to measure quality and temporal changes in the UGS spatial distribution between 2016 and 2020. In particular, we evaluated the quality of UGS using the urban greenness index (UGI) and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) at the pixel level. The experimental results indicate the following: (1) The UGSs in the center of Beijing increased by 48.62 km(2) from 2016 to 2020, and the increase was mainly focused in Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Shijingshan Districts. (2) The average proportion of relatively high and above levels (UGI > 0.5) in six districts increased by 2.71\% in the study area from 2016 to 2020, and this proportion peaked at 36.04\% in 2018. However, our result revealed that the increase was non-linear during this assessment period. (3) Although there was no significant increase or decrease in SHDI values in the study area, the distribution of the SHDI displayed a noticeable fluctuation in the northwest, southwest, and northeast regions of the study area between 2016 and 2020. Furthermore, we discussed and analyzed the influence of population on the spatial distribution of UGSs. We found that three of the five cold spots were located in the east and southeast of Haidian District. Therefore, the proposed workflow could provide rapid mapping and dynamic evaluation of the quality of UGS.</p>

TI  - The Role Of Forest Canopy Cover In Habitat Selection: Insights From The Iberian Lynx
JO  - European Journal of Wildlife Research
PY  - 2019
AB  - Habitat selection models for woodland species usually consider forest attributes derived from land cover maps, such as an area covered by forests or distance to forest edge, but canopy cover is less frequently used as a predictor. We evaluated the effect of including forest canopy cover data in habitat selection models for woodland species using the endangered Iberian lynx as a case study. We considered four canopy cover classes for both conifer and broadleaved forests, together with other land cover predictors, and analyzed a large telemetry (GPS-GSM collars) dataset. The model that included forest canopy cover outperformed, both in predictive power and in conservation management insights, the model that only used forest area. The effect of forest canopy cover on lynx habitat selection was especially strong for broadleaved forests; an increased tree cover in these forests consistently translated into significantly lower selection probabilities. Open broadleaved forests were found to clearly be the most preferred habitat. By contrast, the habitat model without canopy cover data indicated that broadleaved forests were significantly less preferred than shrublands and mountain olive groves, which may mislead conservation management actions. We conclude that habitat selection models for woodland species should consider forest canopy cover as a relevant candidate predictor as it can capture important factors influencing habitat use, such as understory vegetation abundance or prey availability. Recent developments on remote sensing technologies will increase the availability of spatially continuous information on canopy cover, facilitating a more widespread use of vegetation structural variables in habitat modeling and hence improving the conservation planning value of these models. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Bush Encroachment And Impacts On Grass Biomass In Senkelle Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary, Ethiopia
JO  - Biodiversity
PY  - 2020
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess bush encroachment and its impact on herbaceous biomass in Senkelle Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary. Data on the extent and trend of bush encroachment were collected using Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing techniques. A total of 50 plots were used for vegetation and grass biomass data collection. A nested plot design was used to collect woody species with diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥ 10 cm, dbh > 2 cm and < 10 cm and dbh ≤ 2 cm. Within each 20 m × 50 m plot, five subplots, each 0.5 m × 0.5 m, were used to gather grass biomass data. Grass biomass was determined in the laboratory by oven drying at 65–70°C for 48 h. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Analysis of satellite data was done by preprocessing satellite images and enumerating a change matrix. The results showed that: (i) total area covered by grassland declined by 9.8% while the total area covered by bushland increased by 21.4% over the past 30 years; (ii)seven woody species belonging to four families were recorded in the encroached area; (iii) there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in grass biomass between encroached and non-encroached strata; and (iv) the abundance of tree/shrub species and grass biomass were negatively correlated. Key policy insights There is an urgent requirement to implement projects that focus on bush clearance and the rehabilitation of grasslands appropriate for relevant foraging species–which could increase forage quality and quantity in protected areas. There is a need to develop and implement systems to determine the carrying capacity of the Swayne’s Hartebeest in the Senkelle Swayne’s Hartebeest Sanctuary to minimize negative impacts of overgrazing and ensure conservation of the species. Conflicting interests of local communities on the grazing land call for continuous awareness of the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services in these protected areas. © 2020 Biodiversity Conservancy International.

TI  - Forest Fire Spread Simulation Algorithm Based On Cellular Automata
JO  - Natural Hazards
PY  - 2018
AB  - Traditional models result in low efficiency and poor accuracy when simulating the spread of large-scale forest fires. We constructed an improved model that couples cellular automata with an existing forest fire model to ensure better time accuracy of forest fire spread. Our model considers the impact of time steps on simulation accuracy to provide an optimal time step value. The model was tested using a case study of forest fire spread at Daxing’an Mountain in May 2006. The results show that the optimal time step for the forest fire spread geographic cellular automata simulation algorithm is 1/8 of the time taken for cellular material to be completely combusted. When compared with real fire data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, our model was found to have high temporal and spatial consistency, with a mean Kappa coefficient of 0.6352 and mean accuracy of 87.89%. This algorithm can be used to simulate and predict forest fire spread and is also reversible (i.e., it can identify fire source points). © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Relationships Between The Evaporative Stress Index And Winter Wheat And Spring Barley Yield Anomalies In The Czech Republic
JO  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
PY  - 2016
AB  - There is a growing demand for timely, spatially distributed information regarding crop condition and water use to inform agricultural decision making and yield forecasting efforts. Thermal infrared remote sensing of land-surface temperature has proven valuable for mapping evapotranspiration (ET) and crop stress from field to global scales using energy balance models. This is because canopy temperature is strongly regulated by the transpiration flux, which is reduced under stress conditions. This study investigates the utility of an evaporative stress index (ESI), computed using the thermal-based Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model, for explaining yield variability over the Czech Republic for the period 2002-2014. ESI timeseries, representing standardized anomalies in the actual-to-reference ET ratio and an indicator of vegetation health, are compared with yield data collected for winter wheat and spring barley crops in 32 agricultural districts, comprising a range of climatic conditions within the Czech Republic. Correlations between ESI and yield anomalies vary with climatic region, with strongest correlations identified in the more drought-prone South Moravian districts and weaker relationships in the wetter highlands regions. In most regions, correlations with spring barley yield anomalies exceeded performance for winter wheat. For both crops, correlations peaked during the 1 to 2 mo period prior to the nominal harvest date. These results provide guidance for effective integration of remotely sensed moisture stress indicators within operational yield forecasting systems.

TI  - Assessment Of Farmland Landscape Multifunctionality At County Level In Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area
JO  - Shengtai Xuebao
PY  - 2016
AB  - With the development of urbanization and the upgrade of agricultural industrialization, farmland landscape function has developed from a single production function to the function bundle of the economic function, ecological function and cultural function. Thus the farmland landscape multifunctionality has become a hot topic in academic research. However, the existing studies discussed more on coupling the multi indices of farmland function. How to map different functions and the multi-scale correlation analysis on the farmland landscape functions is lack of attention. This study has selected the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area as study area, and calculated six farmland landscape functions spatially. The functions are respectively grain provision function, landscape connection function, soil conservation function, landscape scenery function, population capacity function, and habitat sustain function. Remote sensed net primary productivity (NPP), Habitat Quality model in InVEST, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model, Integral Index of Connectivity (IIC), demographic census data, and Relief Degree of Land Surface (RDLS) are used to quantify these functions. The farmland landscape multifunctionality is quantified by hot spot identification and spatial overlay using spatial autocorrelation method. The result shows that the grain provision function is significant in the middle plain; the landscape connection function is prominent in the south plain; both of the soil conservation function and the habitat sustain function are high in the Yan Mountain and Taihang Mountain; the population capacity function near Beijing City is relatively important. The spatial distribution of different farmland landscape functions differs a lot in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area in the year of 2010. The Beijing-Tianjing-Heibei area has a higher distribution of farmland landscape multifunctionality in the south than the north at county level. There are few counties in high value of all functions. The trade-off and synergy relations between each function are almost equal in number. The functions of landscape connectivity and grain provision are in synergy, while the trade-off between landscape connectivity and soil conservation is apparent. Based on remote sensed images and GIS analysis, this study mapped the farmland landscape multifunctionality and the relationships between different functions, which is an exploration in studying agricultural functions. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Assessing The Economic Value Of Carbon Sequestration In Taman Negara Pahang
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2020
AB  - Aesthetic benefits are not enough. Authorities need to be presented with economic benefits as well to make decisions in favour of forests and help them conserved or expanded. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the economic value of carbon sequestration in Taman Negara Pahang (TNP), Malaysia, a national park with an extensive forest area. The study area covers 247,700 hectares of the Pahang State. The study uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) method of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify the density of the forest across the study area. Consequently, by using the NDVI results, the carbon sequestration in TNP and its economic value were calculated. As a result, the research found that the potential of carbon storage or sequestration in TNP was 142,560,513 tonnes CO2. The economic value of which was worth RM2,637,369,490.50. The results of the GIS calculation were more accurate than the conventional method. It was due to the reason that they were based on evaluating density on a smaller scale of 900m x 900m (81ha). The results were aligned with previous studies pointing out higher density areas holding higher economic values. The study results can be used to convince Malaysian authorities to make wise decisions about such forests as they worth billions of Ringgit Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Novel Assessment Tools For Inland Aquaculture In The Western Godavari Delta Region Of Andhra Pradesh
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
PY  - 2023
AB  - The production of fisheries and shrimp has been twice every 10 years for the previous five decades, making it the most rapidly expanding food industry. This growth is due to intensive farming and the conversion of agriculture into aquaculture in many parts of South Asia. Furthermore, intensive aquaculture generates positive economic growth but leads to environmental degradation without proper monitoring. Unfortunately, technical innovation is less in aquaculture than agricultural and manufacturing industries. The advent of remote sensing and soft computing has expanded various opportunities for utilizing and integrating technological advances in civil and environmental disciplines. This paper presents the aquaculture scenario in the western Godavari delta region of Andhra Pradesh and proposes various novel assessment tools to monitor the aquaculture environment. An experimental investigation was carried out on the physicochemical characteristics of the inland aquaculture ponds to evaluate water quality in the aquaculture ponds. Furthermore, to assess the intensity of inland aquaculture, the current work concentrates on the potential application of remote sensing and soft computing approaches. Geospatial models of kriging and inverse distance weighing (IDW) show higher performance in estimating ammonia levels in the intensive aquaculture groundwaters with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.947 and 0.901, respectively. Teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) and adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO), two of the five soft computing techniques utilized in the study, perform better than the others. Additionally, it was found that remote sensing-based assessment tools and soft computing prediction models were both trustworthy, accurate, and easy to use. Furthermore, these methods could assist in the real-time evaluation of inland aquaculture waters by stakeholders and policymakers.

TI  - A Low-Cost Mobile Ground Station For Satellite Communication In Vhf Band
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2016
AB  - In this paper, we present the architecture and performance of a low-cost, small, mobile and easily deployable ground station to track and receive signals from amateur band satellites which operate on the VHF-band (144 MHz to 147 MHz). The proposed ground station uses a 6-dB gain monopole antenna, and a small low noise amplifier with 23 dB gain. The rest of the analog front-end is a software-defined radio receiver with a USB interface to a laptop computer. The software-defined nature of the front-end gives the station the flexibility to target satellites with diverse power, modulation and error-correcting schemes. The system is completed by open-source and freely available software for tracking satellite positions and for signal decoding and processing. We report performance evaluation results for outdoor operation. In addition, we also report our experience, performance analysis and link margin calculations for operation on an indoor environment with limited satellite visibility. These results would benefit ground station deployment in places with limited access to outdoor antennas, whether because of financial, regulatory or other restrictions. We also report results with a variety of amateur-band satellites, such as the FUNcube, Vellox-II, CANX 4 and 5, and AMSAT. Copyright © 2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

TI  - Application Of Geospatial Models To Map Potential Ruditapes Philippinarum Habitat Using Remote Sensing And Gis
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2014
AB  - This study applied geographic information system (GIS)-based models to map the potential Ruditapes philippinarum (Korean littleneck clam) habitat area in the Geunso Bay tidal flat, Korea. Remote-sensing techniques were used to construct spatial datasets of ecological environments, and field observations were undertaken to determine the distribution of macrobenthos. The mapping of potential habitat was completed and eight controlling factors relating to the distribution of tidal macrobenthos were determined. These were the tidal flat digital elevation model, slope, aspect, tidal annual exposure duration, distance from tidal channels, tidal channel density, spectral reflectance of the near-infrared bands, and surface sedimentary types, which were all generated from satellite imagery. The spatial relationships between the distribution of R. philippinarum and each control factor were calculated using a frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks combined with GIS data. Individuals were randomly divided into a training set (50%) to analyse habitat potential using the frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural network models, and a test set (50%) to validate the predicted habitat potential map. The relationships were overlaid to produce a potential habitat map with a R. philippinarum habitat potential (RPHP) index value. These maps were validated by comparing them to surveyed habitat locations such as those in the validation data set. From the validation results, the frequency ratio model showed prediction accuracy of 82.88%, while the accuracy of the logistic regression and artificial neural networks models was 70.77% and 80.45%, respectively. Thus, the frequency ratio model provided a more accurate prediction than the other models. Our data demonstrate that frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks models based on GIS analysis are effective for generating potential habitat maps of R. philippinarum species in a tidal flat. The results of this study will be useful for conserving and managing the macrofauna of tidal flats. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Satellite Imagery And Gis For Disaster Response & Management In The United Nations: The Unosat Approach
JO  - Proceedings of ISCRAM 2004 - 1st International Workshop on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management
PY  - 2004
AB  - Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have the potential to provide United Nations (UN) humanitarian agencies and their partners with much needed disaster related information and improved management of resources. However, the technical nature of these tools requires considerable expertise to fully benefit from satellite images and related geographic information. The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is implementing the UNOSAT service on behalf of the UN Institute on Training and Research (UNITAR) together with several private actors. UNOSAT provides the UN and its partners with the expertise in Earth Observation (EO) and GIS applications. As a crisis is part of a spectrum of disaster related events, UNOSAT provides services in all phases of humanitarian assistance, including planning, crisis response, relief and development. UNOSAT's objectives are to facilitate the territory planning and monitoring processes of local authorities, local technicians, development project managers and humanitarian field operators working in coordination with or within the framework of UN activities, on issues such as disaster management, risk prevention, peace keeping operations, post conflict reconstruction, environmental rehabilitation and social and economic development. A key part of this work is to accelerate and expand the use of accurate geographic information derived from EO-satellite imagery. UNOSAT is also involved in several international initiatives aimed at improved crisis response and management, such as the International Charter "Space and Major Disasters", an important asset in providing timely information to relief personnel on the ground. By working closely with its UN sister agencies, UNOPS/UNOSAT offers a one-stop-shop for satellite imagery and GIS services related to disaster response & management within the United Nations. © Proceedings ISCRAM 2004.

TI  - Bahamian Seagrass Extent And Blue Carbon Accounting Using Earth Observation
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Seagrasses are among the world's most productive ecosystems due to their vast 'blue' carbon sequestration rates and stocks, yet have a largely untapped potential for climate change mitigation and national climate agendas like the Nationally Determined Contributions of the Paris Agreement. To account for the value of seagrasses for these agendas, spatially explicit high-confidence seagrass ecosystem assessments guided by nationally aggregated data are necessary. Modern Earth Observation advances could provide a scalable technological solution to assess the national extent and blue carbon service of seagrass ecosystems. Here, we developed and applied a scalable Earth Observation framework within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to account the national extent, blue carbon stock and sequestration rate of seagrass ecosystems across the shallow waters of The Bahamas-113,037 km(2). Our geospatial ecosystem extent accounting was based on big multi-temporal data analytics of over 18,000 10-m Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2017-2021, and deep feature engineering of multi-temporal spectral, color, object-based and textural metrics with Random Forests machine learning classification. The extent accounting was trained and validated using a nationwide reference data synthesis based on human-guided image annotation, recent space-borne benthic habitat maps, and field data collections. Bahamian seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates were quantified using region-specific in-situ seagrass blue carbon data. The mapped Bahamian seagrass extent covers an area up to 46,792 km(2), translating into a carbon storage of 723 Mg C, and a sequestration rate of 123 Mt CO2 annually. This equals up to 68 times the amount of CO2 emitted by The Bahamas in 2018, potentially rendering the country carbon-neutral. The developed accounts fill a vast mapping blank in the global seagrass map-29\% of the global seagrass extent-highlighting the necessity of including their blue carbon fluxes into national climate agendas and showcasing the need for more cost-effective conservation and restoration efforts for their meadows. We envisage that the synergy between our scalable Earth Observation technology and near-future nation-specific in-situ observations can and will support spatially-explicit seagrass and ocean ecosystem accounting, accelerating effective policy-making, blue carbon crediting, and relevant financial investments in and beyond The Bahamas.

TI  - Projecting Future Land Use/Land Cover By Integrating Drivers And Plan Prescriptions: The Case For Watershed Applications
JO  - GISCIENCE \& REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Watershed planning is a pivotal exercise for all jurisdictions irrespective of size, landscape complexity, or other nuances. As a result of the intricate relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and water resources, it becomes prudent to not only develop historical and contemporary LULC data for watershed planning purposes, but more importantly, the production of future LULC datasets has the potential to better inform watershed planners. This study explored an optimal workflow that can be adopted for the production of baseline LULC input images from a moderate spatial resolution sensor such as Landsat, and the identification, translation, and configuration of land change drivers and regional comprehensive plan prescriptions in the creation of future LULC data for a regional watershed. The study conducted in the Lower Chippewa River Watershed, Wisconsin, USA demonstrated that an object-based hybrid classification approach resulted in the generation of improved projected images with a 15\% increase in area under the curve (AUC) value compared to a pixel-based hybrid classification method even though both methods displayed comparable overall image classification accuracies (<= 1.8\%). Results further displayed that configuring anthropogenic drivers in a trend format rather than individual year values can result in a more efficient training of a multi-layer perceptron neural network - Markov Chain model. The calibrated and validated model demonstrated that on average, residential, commercial, institutional, green vegetation/shrub, and industrial LULC are expected to grow through 2050, though at a slower rate (12\%) compared to contemporary period (39\%), while forest and agricultural lands are slated to decline (-2\%).

TI  - Structure And Influence Of Tropical River Plumes In The Great Barrier Reef: Application And Performance Of An Airborne Sea Surface Salinity Mapping System
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2003
AB  - Input of freshwater from rivers is a critical consideration in the study and management of coral and seagrass ecosystems in tropical regions. Low salinity water can transport natural and manmade river-borne contaminants into the sea, and can directly stress marine ecosystems that are adapted to higher salinity levels. An efficient method of mapping surface salinity distribution over large ocean areas is required to address such environmental issues. We describe here an investigation of the utility of airborne remote sensing of sea surface salinity using an L-band passive microwave radiometer. The study combined aircraft overflights of the scanning low frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR) with shipboard and in situ instrument deployments to map surface and subsurface salinity distributions, respectively, in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. The goals of the investigation were (a) to assess the performance of the airborne salinity mapper; (b) to use the maps and in situ data to develop an integrated description of the structure and zone of influence of a river plume under prevailing monsoon weather conditions; and (c) to determine the extent to which the sea surface salinity distribution expressed the subsurface structure. The SLFMR was found to have sufficient precision (1 psu) and accuracy ( similar to 3 psu) to provide a useful description of plumes emanating from estuaries of moderate discharge levels with a salinity range of 16 to 32 psu in the open sea. The aircraft surveys provided a means of rapidly assessing the spatial extent of the surface salinity distribution of the plume, while in situ data revealed subsurface structure detail and provided essential validation data for the SLFMR. The combined approach allowed us to efficiently determine the structure and zone of influence of the plume, and demonstrated the utility of sea surface salinity remote sensing for studying coastal circulation in tropical seas.

TI  - Pathfinding Of 2d & 3d Game Real-Time Strategy With Depth Direction A* Algorithm For Multi-Layer
JO  - 2009 8th International Symposium on Natural Language Processing, SNLP '09
PY  - 2009
AB  - The pathfinding analysis has importance for various working such as logistics, transportation, operation management, system analysis and design, project management, network and production line. Especially, game programming technology has effect to economic and dominates culture, increasingly. The shortest path analysis is artificial intelligent which developed capability about think cause and effect, learning and thinking like human. Heuristic technique is method for solving a problem which gets result or not. It may return unexpected value which depends on each problem. 3D game realtime strategy uses shortest path analysis control path for movement of character, wheeled vehicle, animals, and fantasy buildings. It uses path for movement ever time, both in sea, terra and sky (three layers). The position of 3D object use refers 2D coordinate. Generally, the most of 3D game strategy both on LAN and online will play on terrain more than inside building or the room. This research proposes two essences.

TI  - Assessment Of Quickbird High Spatial Resolution Imagery To Detect Red Attack Damage Due To Mountain Pine Beetle Infestation
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2006
AB  - High spatial resolution remotely sensed data has the potential to complement existing forest health programs for both strategic planning over large areas, as well as for detailed and precise identification of tree crowns subject to stress and infestation. The area impacted by the current mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has increased 40-fold over the previous 5 years, with approximately 8.5 million ha of forest infested in 2005. As a result of the spatial extent and intensity of the outbreak, new technologies are being assessed to help detect, map, and monitor the damage caused by the beetle, and to inform mitigation of future beetle outbreaks. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of high spatial resolution QuickBird multi-spectral imagery to detect mountain pine beetle red attack damage. ANOVA testing of individual spectral bands, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a ratio of red to green reflectance (Red-Green Index or RGI), indicated that the RGI was the most successful (p < 0.001) at separating non-attack crowns from red attack crowns. Based on this result, the RGI was subsequently used to develop a binary classification of red attack and non-attack pixels. The total number of QuickBird pixels classified as having red attack damage within a 50 in buffer of a known forest health survey point were compared to the number of red attack trees recorded at the time of the forest health survey. The relationship between the number of red attack pixels and observed red attack crowns was assessed using independent validation data and was found to be significant (r(2)=0.48, p < 0.001, standard error=2.8 crowns). A comparison of the number of QuickBird pixels classified as red attack, and a broader scale index of mountain pine beetle red attack damage (Enhanced Wetness Difference Index, calculated from a time series of Landsat imagery), was significant (r(2)=0.61, p < 0.001, standard error=1.3 crowns). These results suggest that high spatial resolution imagery, in particular QuickBird satellite imagery, has a valuable role to play in identifying tree crowns with red attack damage. This information could subsequently be used to augment existing detailed forest health surveys, calibrate synoptic estimates of red attack damage generated from over-view surveys and/or coarse scale remotely sensed data, and facilitate the generation of value-added information products, such as estimates of timber volume impacts at the forest stand level.

TI  - Mapping Evapotranspiration Variability Over A Complex Oasis-Desert Ecosystem Based On Automated Calibration Of Landsat 7 Etm+ Data In Sebal
JO  - GISCIENCE \& REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fragmented ecosystems of the desiccated Aral Sea seek answers to the profound local hydrologically- and water-related problems. Particularly, in the Small Aral Sea Basin (SASB), these problems are associated with low precipitation, increased temperature, land use and evapotranspiration (ET) changes. Here, the utility of high-resolution satellite dataset is employed to model the growing season dynamic of near-surface fluxes controlled by the advective effects of desert and oasis ecosystems in the SASB. This study adapted and applied the sensible heat flux calibration mechanism of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to 16 clear-sky Landsat 7 ETM+ dataset, following a guided automatic pixels search from surface temperature T-s and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI (). Results were comprehensively validated with flux components and actual ET (ETa) outputs of Eddy Covariance (EC) and Meteorological Station (KZL) observations located in the desert and oasis, respectively. Compared with the original SEBAL, a noteworthy enhancement of flux estimations was achieved as follows: - desert ecosystem ETa R-2 = 0.94; oasis ecosystem ETa R-2 = 0.98 (P < 0.05). The improvement uncovered the exact land use contributions to ETa variability, with average estimates ranging from 1.24 mm to 6.98 mm . Additionally, instantaneous ET to NDVI (ETins-NDVI) ratio indicated that desert and oasis consumptive water use vary significantly with time of the season. This study indicates the possibility of continuous daily ET monitoring with considerable implications for improving water resources decision support over complex data-scarce drylands.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Implications Of Urbanization For Urban Heat Islands In Beijing: A Predictive Approach Based On Ca–Markov Modeling (2004–2050)
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - The rapid increase in infrastructural development in populated areas has had numerous adverse impacts. The rise in land surface temperature (LST) and its associated damage to urban ecological systems result from urban development. Understanding the current and future LST phenomenon and its relationship to landscape composition and land use/cover (LUC) changes is critical to developing policies to mitigate the disastrous impacts of urban heat islands (UHIs) on urban ecosystems. Using remote sensing and GIS data, this study assessed the multi-scale relationship of LUCC and LST of the cosmopolitan exponentially growing area of Beijing, China. We investigated the impacts of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration for a time series (2004–2019) of Landsat data using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a single channel algorithm (SCA), respectively. We built a CA–Markov model to forecast future (2025 and 2050) LUCC and LST spatial patterns. Our results indicate that the cumulative changes in an urban area (UA) increased by about 908.15 km2 (5%), and 11% of vegetation area (VA) decreased from 2004 to 2019. The correlation coefficient of LUCC including vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas with LST had values of r = −0.155 (p > 0.419), −0.809 (p = 0.000), and 0.526 (p = 0.003), respectively. The results surrounding future forecasts revealed an estimated 2309.55 km2 (14%) decrease in vegetation (urban and forest), while an expansion of 1194.78 km2 (8%) was predicted for a built-up area from 2019 to 2050. This decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely cause a rise of about ~5.74◦ C to ~9.66◦ C in temperature. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that LST is directly related to the vegetation index. In conclusion, the estimated overall increase of 7.5◦ C in LST was predicted from 2019–2050, which is alarming for the urban community’s environmental health. The present results provide insight into sustainable environmental development through effective urban planning of Beijing and other urban hotspots. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Remote Sensing Recognition Of Construction Waste Accumulation Based On Resources Satellite Three Multi-View Stereoscopic Image
PY  - 2020
AB  - Due to economic growth and the development of urban modernization, the amount of construction waste is increasing year by year. The rapid identification of large-scale construction waste deposit is beneficial to improving urban planning and management capabilities. This article is based on the three-line array image stereo data of Resources satellite three to obtain DEM. At that time, Renzhuang Village in Pingdingshan was a test area. Based on the DEM elevation change information, the surface roughness coefficient of the structured surface was used as an irregular elevation texture feature, combined with the slope and aspect, to obtain the construction waste accumulation of other ground objects in the surrounding area. The overall recognition rate is 85.12\%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.70. It provides application value for the rapid identification of construction waste accumulation and its change information management and safety instability analysis.

TI  - Vegetation Recovery On Landslide Susceptibility In The Chi-Sun Watershed
JO  - Journal of Chinese Soil and Water Conservation
PY  - 2015
AB  - In this study, logistic regression, a multivariate analysis method, was used for landslide susceptibility analysis of the Chi-Sun watershed. After extracting and selecting environmental factors, elevation, slope, terrain roughness, slope roughness, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), wetness index, and accumulated rainfall were selected as causal factors of landslides. An inspection of the distribution of the landslides caused by Typhoon Morakot revealed that the landslides were located in medium-high and high susceptibility areas of the upstream watershed. The predicted susceptibility values show a good agreement with the observed landslides, indicating that both the model and the factors used in the model are valid and that the simulation results match the Typhoon Morakot event. In addition, past NDVI values obtained by analyzing SPOT-5 satellite images suggest favorable vegetation recovery in the watershed landslide areas, except in the upstream areas. This study focused on providing suitable recovery and planning strategies around the riparian areas of the upstream watershed. The effects of vegetation recovery on landslide susceptibility values were evaluated using the developed model. Landslide hazard areas were analyzed and mapped on the basis of vegetation recovery for various buffer ranges. ©, 2015, Chinese Soil and Water Conservation Society. All right reserved.

TI  - Implications Of Climate Change On Streamflow Of A Snow-Fed River System Of The Northwest Himalaya
JO  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
PY  - 2013
AB  - Air temperature and snow cover variability are sensitive indicators of climate change. This study was undertaken to forecast and quantify the potential streamflow response to climate change in the Jhelum River basin. The implications of air temperature trends (+0.11A degrees C/decade) reported for the entire north-west Himalaya for past century and the regional warming (+0.7A degrees C/decade) trends of three observatories analyzed between last two decades were used for future projection of snow cover depletion and stream flow. The streamflow was simulated and validated for the year 2007-2008 using snowmelt runoff model (SRM) based on in-situ temperature and precipitation with remotely sensed snow cover area. The simulation was repeated using higher values of temperature and modified snow cover depletion curves according to the assumed future climate. Early snow cover depletion was observed in the basin in response to warmer climate. The results show that with the increase in air temperature, streamflow pattern of Jhelum will be severely affected. Significant redistribution of streamflow was observed in both the scenarios. Higher discharge was observed during spring-summer months due to early snowmelt contribution with water deficit during monsoon months. Discharge increased by 5\%-40\% during the months of March to May in 2030 and 2050. The magnitude of impact of air temperature is higher in the scenario-2 based on regional warming. The inferences pertaining to change in future streamflow pattern can facilitate long term decisions and planning concerning hydro-power potential, water resource management and flood hazard mapping in the region.

TI  - "This Degrading And Stealthy Practice": Accounting, Stigma And Indigenous Wages In Australia 1897-1972
JO  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
PY  - 2018
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to make visible the relationship between accounting and stigma in the absence of accounting. This research examines how failure to implement mandatory accounting and auditing requirements in the management of indigenous wages contributed to stigmatisation of indigenous Australians and led to maladministration and unchecked financial fraud that continued for over 75 years. The accounting failures are by those charged with protecting the financial interests of the indigenous population. Design/methodology/approach An historical and qualitative approach has been used that draws upon archival and contemporary sources. Findings Prior research has examined the nexus between accounting mechanisms and stigma. This research suggests that the absence of accounting mechanisms can also contribute to stigma. Research limitations/implications This research highlights the complex relationship between accounting and stigma, suggesting that it is simplistic to examine the nexus between accounting and stigma without considering the social forces in which stigmatisation occurs. Social implications This research demonstrates decades of failed accounting have contributed to the ongoing social disadvantage of indigenous Australians. The presence of accounting mechanisms cannot eradicate the past, or fix the present, but can create an environment where financial abuse does not occur. Originality/value This research demonstrates that stigma can be exacerbated in the negative space created by failures or absence of accounting.

PY  - 2015
AB  - This study employed genetic adaptive neural networks with texture analysis in the classification of high-resolution satellite images from which data related to surface conditions and hazard log in slope areas of the Laonong River in Southern Taiwan were derived. Meanwhile, using the weighting ratios of various disaster causing factors inferred from the dangerous value method, this study explored the degree of slope land disturbance. Then, this study incorporated the relationship between rainfall and landslides to draw a landslide potential map using the discriminant analysis approach combined with the geographic information system platform. Results of image classification show that the values of coefficient of agreement for different time periods are at intermediate-high level. The predicted potential of landslide is in reasonable confidence level. The findings of this research will be a valuable reference in the follow-up drafting of slope development and treatment policies, and the academic and engineering assessment of landslide disasters caused by slope development. In addition, the results suggest that the proposed method and procedures can be an effective tool for landslide monitoring and would be easily transferred to other similar applications. © 2015 ejge.

AB  - In the next decades, climate change will put forests in the Hungarian Great Plain in the Carpathian Basin to the test, e.g., changing seasonal patterns, more intense storms, longer dry periods, and pests are expected to occur. To aid in the decision-making process for the conservation of ecosystems depending on forestry, how woods could adapt to changing meso- and microclimatic conditions in the near future needs to be defined. In addition to trendlike warming processes, calculations show an increase in climate extremes, which need to be monitored in accordance with spatial planning, at least for medium-scale mappings. We can use the MODIS sensor dataset if up-to-date terrestrial conditions and multi-decadal geographical processes are of interest. For geographic evaluations of changes, we used vegetation spectral indices; Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the summer half year, 16-day MODIS data composites between 2000 and 2017 in an intensively forested study area in the Hungarian Great Plain. We delineated forest areas on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve using Corine Land Cover maps (2000, 2006, and 2012). Mid-year changes over the nearly two-decade-long period are currently in balance; however, based on their reactions, forests are highly sensitive to abrupt changes caused by extreme climatic events. The higher occurrence of years or periods with extreme water shortages marks an observable decrease in biomass production, even in shorter index time series, such as that between 2004 and 2012. In the drought-stricken July-August periods, the effect of a dry year, subsequent to years with more precipitation, immediately pushes back the green mass and the reduction in the biomass production could become persistent, according to climatology predictions. The changes of specific sub-periods in the vegetation period can be evaluated even in a relatively short, 18-year data series, including the change in the growing values of the vegetative growth in spring or the increase in the summertime biomass production. Standardized differences highlight spatial differences in the biomass production; in response to years with the highest (negative) biomass difference; typically, the northern and southwestern parts of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve in the study area have longer lasting losses in biomass production. A comparison of NDVI and EVI values with the PaDI drought index and the vegetation indices of LANDSAT Operational Land Imager sensor respectively confirms our results. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - The Art Of The Possible: Economic Prospects For Space, Fantasy And Practicality
JO  - JBIS - Journal of the British Interplanetary Society
PY  - 1996
AB  - The economic prospects from space activities grow ever more visible each day as Earth-orbiting satellites expand their capabilities in communications, Earth-observing and global positioning technologies. Such technologies, however, can be accomplished using existing launch vehicles and satellites, modest advances in the state of the art will open up even larger economic possibilities. The result is that the reasons for manned space flight wither on the altear of practicality and are treated as an indulgence of those dependent upon government largesse but of no interest to more realistic decision makers, whether private or public. This paper sketches out an economically grounded sequence of events which takes advantage of the vast sums being expended on the International Space Station and provides justification for the next generation of manned space vehicles. Loss of human access to space will not end space-based activities but move them in another direction for some unknown time period. Recovering momentum for manned space flight would be a difficult process so that the key lies in not losing one's way. An alternative pathway is proposed. Tying the dream to practicality, however, limits the flights of fancy that are possible but one begins with the value that space is worth exploring for mankind.

TI  - Fusing Multiple Existing Space-Time Land Cover Products
JO  - Environmetrics
PY  - 2017
AB  - Land cover (LC) is a critical variable driving many environmental processes, so its assessment, monitoring, and characterization are essential. However, existing LC products, derived primarily from satellite spectral imagery, each have different temporal and spatial resolutions and different LC classes. Most effort is focused on either fusing a pair of LC products over a small space-time region or on interpolating missing values in an individual LC product. Here, we review the complexities of LC identification and propose a method for fusing multiple existing LC products to produce a single LC record for a large spatial-temporal grid, referred to as spatiotemporal categorical map fusion. We first reconcile the LC classes of different LC products and then present a probabilistic weighted nearest neighbor estimator of LC class. This estimator depends on three unknown parameters that are estimated using numerical optimization to maximize an agreement criterion that we define. We illustrate the method using six LC products over the Rocky Mountains and show the improvement gained by supplying the optimization with data-driven information describing the spatial-temporal behavior of each LC class. Given the massive size of the LC products, we show how the optimal parameters for a given year are often optimal for other years, leading to shorter computing times.

TI  - Guiding Decisions On The Future Of Dams: A Gis Database Characterizing Ecological And Social Considerations Of Dam Decisions
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2024
AB  - In the United States and elsewhere, there are a growing number of dams which have exceeded their design life and will need to be repaired or removed in the coming decades. Most of these dams no longer serve their original purpose and removal can provide ecological benefits and eliminate future maintenance costs and hazards. However, many decision-makers have been ill-prepared by community resistance to proposals to remove dams. Given the number of dam removal initiatives that have failed or been delayed due to community resistance, both ecological and social attributes of dams need to be better mapped and conveyed in understandable ways. The goal of this study was to support future decisions regarding dams by 1) developing a set of metrics to assess the social and ecological dimensions of dams, and 2) using these metrics to develop a GIS database, for the 1000+ dams in the Narragansett Bay/Rhode Island area of southern New England. The database characterizes the ecological benefits of dam removal or modification, in terms of fish passage, and the social dimensions that may need to be considered when engaging a community in discussions about the future of a dam. Our emphasis was on small-head dams (i.e. <5 m tall) which comprise most dams in the study area. We created social value metrics that used GIS data to assess dams and their impoundments for potential benefits to waterfront properties, history, sense-of-place, and recreation. We modeled our ecological metrics and ranking system after the Nature Conservancy's Northeast Aquatic Connectivity study which considered factors relating to river connectivity and watershed quality. We evaluated our social and ecological metrics using case studies of dams in the study area that had been previously removed or modified. We assumed that both sets of dams were ecologically important, but the modified dams had higher social value that prohibited their removal. Dams that had been removed or modified were both ranked as high priority in terms of value for fish passage, particularly for diadromous fish. Dams that were modified to include fish passage had substantially larger impoundments, more waterfront properties, and more features associated with recreational or cultural value (e.g. boating opportunity, visibility, etc.). Our social metrics were consistent with expectations based on the limited case studies (7 removals, 19 modifications) available in the study area. We made the dam assessment metrics readily accessible to stakeholders through an interactive ArcGIS Online web map. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An Outbreak Of Streptococcus Pyogenes In A Mental Health Facility: Advantage Of Well-Timed Whole-Genome Sequencing Over Emm Typing
JO  - Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology
PY  - 2018
AB  - OBJECTIVE We report the utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) conducted in a clinically relevant time frame (ie, sufficient for guiding management decision), in managing a Streptococcus pyogenes outbreak, and present a comparison of its performance with emm typing.SETTING A 2,000-bed tertiary-care psychiatric hospital.METHODS Active surveillance was conducted to identify new cases of S. pyogenes. WGS guided targeted epidemiological investigations, and infection control measures were implemented. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome phylogeny, emm typing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. We compared the ability of WGS and emm typing to correctly identify person-to-person transmission and to guide the management of the outbreak.RESULTS The study included 204 patients and 152 staff. We identified 35 patients and 2 staff members with S. pyogenes. WGS revealed polyclonal S. pyogenes infections with 3 genetically distinct phylogenetic clusters (C1-C3). Cluster C1 isolates were all emm type 4, sequence type 915 and had pairwise SNP differences of 0-5, which suggested recent person-to-person transmissions. Epidemiological investigation revealed that cluster C1 was mediated by dermal colonization and transmission of S. pyogenes in a male residential ward. Clusters C2 and C3 were genomically diverse, with pairwise SNP differences of 21-45 and 26-58, and emm 11 and mostly emm120, respectively. Clusters C2 and C3, which may have been considered person-to-person transmissions by emm typing, were shown by WGS to be unlikely by integrating pairwise SNP differences with epidemiology.CONCLUSIONS WGS had higher resolution than emm typing in identifying clusters with recent and ongoing person-to-person transmissions, which allowed implementation of targeted intervention to control the outbreak.

TI  - Managing Marine Protected Areas In Remote Areas: The Case Of The Subantarctic Heard And Mcdonald Islands
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2019
AB  - Large marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established to contribute to global conservation targets but present an immense challenge for managers as they seek to govern human interactions with the environment over a vast geographical expanse. These challenges are further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the absence of critical management functions such as environmental monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In 2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area, Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for future research.

TI  - Fine-Scale Mapping By Spatial Risk Distribution Modeling For Regional Malaria Endemicity And Its Implications Under The Low-To-Moderate Transmission Setting In Western Cambodia
JO  - PLOS ONE
PY  - 2016
AB  - The disease burden of malaria has decreased as malaria elimination efforts progress. The mapping approach that uses spatial risk distribution modeling needs some adjustment and reinvestigation in accordance with situational changes. Here we applied a mathematical modeling approach for standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) calculated by annual parasite incidence using routinely aggregated surveillance reports, environmental data such as remote sensing data, and non-environmental anthropogenic data to create fine-scale spatial risk distribution maps of western Cambodia. Furthermore, we incorporated a combination of containment status indicators into the model to demonstrate spatial heterogeneities of the relationship between containment status and risks. The explanatory model was fitted to estimate the SMR of each area (adjusted Pearson correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.774; Akaike information criterion AIC = 149.423). A Bayesian modeling framework was applied to estimate the uncertainty of the model and cross-scale predictions. Fine-scale maps were created by the spatial interpolation of estimated SMRs at each village. Compared with geocoded case data, corresponding predicted values showed conformity {[}Spearman's rank correlation r = 0.662 in the inverse distance weighed interpolation and 0.645 in ordinal kriging (95\% confidence intervals of 0.414-0.827 and 0.368-0.813, respectively), Welch's t-test; Not significant]. The proposed approach successfully explained regional malaria risks and fine-scale risk maps were created under low-to-moderate malaria transmission settings where reinvestigations of existing risk modeling approaches were needed. Moreover, different representations of simulated outcomes of containment status indicators for respective areas provided useful insights for tailored interventional planning, considering regional malaria endemicity.

TI  - Distribution Of Ecological Restoration Projects Associated With Land Use And Land Cover Change In China And Their Ecological Impacts
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - China is prone to broad land degradation and thus has been implementing ecological restoration projects (ERPs) since the reform and opening up. The extent of ERPs, as well as the varied planting efforts including tree gain projects (TGPs), grass gain projects (GGPs), and shrub gain projects (SGPs), have remained largely unknown. In addition, the mixed success of ERPs on preventing soil erosion and improving biodiversity is not well known. Based on a land use and land cover (LULC) product and a trajectory-based change detection approach, we successfully generated the first national map of ERPs associated with land use and land cover change (LUCC) and its three associated subcategories. Then, we applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model to evaluate the dynamics of sediment retention and habitat quality. In addition, we explored the heterogeneous patterns for the ecological impacts of ERPs. Our results suggested that during the past 40 years, a total ERP area of 9.54 × 106 hm2 was observed nationwide, mainly in the northwestern provinces of China. Of the three ERP subcategories, TGPs accounted for the largest area (48.55%), followed by GGPs (47.50%) and SGPs (3.96%). The national average sediment retention experienced a significant increase, whereas the national average habitat quality experienced a significant decline. ERP-driven increases in habitat quality were offset partly by the LUCCs induced by economic development policies in some regions, especially in northeast China. The simultaneous effect of construction land expansion and ERP implementation on sediment retention made the synchronization between ERP implementation and sediment retention improvement insignificant. We also suggested the optimal direction for ERP implementation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Accuracy And Impact Of Spatial Aids Based Upon Satellite Enumeration To Improve Indoor Residual Spraying Spatial Coverage
JO  - MALARIA JOURNAL
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a key tool in the fight to control, eliminate and ultimately eradicate malaria. IRS protection is based on a communal effect such that an individual's protection primarily relies on the community-level coverage of IRS with limited protection being provided by household-level coverage. To ensure a communal effect is achieved through IRS, achieving high and uniform community-level coverage should be the ultimate priority of an IRS campaign. Ensuring high community-level coverage of IRS in malaria-endemic areas is challenging given the lack of information available about both the location and number of households needing IRS in any given area. A process termed 'mSpray' has been developed and implemented and involves use of satellite imagery for enumeration for planning IRS and a mobile application to guide IRS implementation. This study assessed (1) the accuracy of the satellite enumeration and (2) how various degrees of spatial aid provided through the mSpray process affected community-level IRS coverage during the 2015 spray campaign in Zambia. Methods: A 2-stage sampling process was applied to assess accuracy of satellite enumeration to determine number and location of sprayable structures. Results indicated an overall sensitivity of 94\% for satellite enumeration compared to finding structures on the ground. Results: After adjusting for structure size, roof, and wall type, households in Nchelenge District where all types of satellite-based spatial aids (paper-based maps plus use of the mobile mSpray application) were used were more likely to have received IRS than Kasama district where maps used were not based on satellite enumeration. The probability of a household being sprayed in Nchelenge district where tablet-based maps were used, did not differ statistically from that of a household in Samfya District, where detailed paper-based spatial aids based on satellite enumeration were provided. Conclusion: IRS coverage from the 2015 spray season benefited from the use of spatial aids based upon satellite enumeration. These spatial aids can guide costly IRS planning and implementation leading to attainment of higher spatial coverage, and likely improve disease impact.

TI  - Satellite-Based Monitoring On Green-Up Date For Optimizing The Rest-Grazing Period In Xilin Gol Grassland
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecological degradation has occurred in global grasslands and has impaired their ecosystem services severely, so ecological conservation of grasslands should be focused more on the effectiveness of management measures. The green-up process decides the year-round forage yield and ecological conditions of grasslands. Adopting rest-grazing during the green-up process can guarantee a successful green-up, thus realizing more economic benefits without grassland degradation. Therefore, studies should pay more attention to whether the green-up process is really covered by the rest-grazing period or not. We analyze the spatiotemporal variations and the stability of the annual green-up date in Xilin Gol Grassland from 2000 to 2018 based on MODIS time series images and compare the green-up date with the rest-grazing period to assess the effectiveness of the rest-grazing policy. The results show that the green-up date of Xilin Gol Grassland had advanced 15 days on average because of the increasing trend of both temperature and precipitation during 2000 similar to 2018. The green-up date is mostly 120 similar to 130 d in the east, about 10 days earlier than the west (130 similar to 140 d) and 20 days earlier than in the central areas (140 similar to 150 d), also because of the spatial variations of temperature and precipitation. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the green-up date showed a significant negative correlation with precipitation, so the green-up date is more unstable in the arid areas. The rest-grazing period started more than 45 days earlier than the green-up date and failed to cover it in several years, which occurred more frequently in southern counties. The average green-up date appeared after rest-grazing started in over 98\% of areas, and the time gap is 15 similar to 45 days in 88\% of areas, which not only could not avoid grassland degradation effectively but also increased herdsmen's life burden. This study aims to accurately grasp the temporal and spatial variations of the green-up date in order to provide references for adjusting a more proper rest-grazing period, thus promoting ecological conservation and sustainable development of animal husbandry.

JO  - International Astronautical Federation - 58th International Astronautical Congress 2007
PY  - 2007
AB  - India is a very large country in terms of area and population with diverse ethnic and cultural out looks. Majority of population of rural India is living in remote inaccessible areas, difficult mountainous regions, the Thar Desert region and group of Andman and Nicobar Islands etc. Under such difficult terrain conditions and scattered population areas, it has not been possible to provide formal or informal education and health care/medical facilities in majority of areas of the country. The use of space system for Tele- health and Tele- medicine will improve the living standard and ensure better health care system and facilitates to the masses. By taking advantage of satellite based education as well as terrestrial system (complementing each other) to support tele-health, is considered the only possibility to redress the grievances of masses in these difficult areas by importing health related information and setting up community center within reasonable reach for providing first-aid and initial checkup facility from such country centers. These centers are linked by both satellite and territorial media to referral hospital for transmission of basic information like body temperature/blood sugar and blood pressure, ECG data by using distance interface with basic devices like BP instrument, sugar monitoring instrument, ECG machine out put etc. This data will be processed and seen by referral Doctor on round the clock basis or on selected mode in emergencies. The referral hospital will advise the patient at remote side by way of prescriptions of medicine, further diagnosis and or advise for nearest district hospital for further consultation for specific treatment. The Thar Central of Arts health and education, a non government organization (NGO) is actively involved in the establishment of such a network. This network is also proposed to connect Primary Health Center (PHC) setup across India for taking advise from the referral hospital. This network is also intended to be utilized for referral training of nurses, technicians and doctors at primary health center saving costs and travel time. The Thar Central of Arts health and education is in dialog with UNESCO, W.H.O, ITU for their collective support as well as with central and state government departments dealing with health care of masses. This project is being launched progressively from second quarter of 2007. This paper describes the salient features of this network and the expected benefits to the rural populations.

TI  - Ghana’s Experience In The Establishment Of A National Digital Seismic Network Observatory
JO  - Journal of Seismology
PY  - 2015
AB  - The Government of Ghana has established a National Digital Seismic Network Observatory in Ghana with the aim of monitoring events such as earthquakes, blasts from mining and quarrying, nuclear tests, etc. The Digital Observatory was commissioned on 19 December 2012, and was dedicated to Geosciences in Ghana. Previously Ghana did not have any operational, digital seismic network acquisition system with the capability of monitoring and analysing data for planning and research purposes. The Ghana Geological Survey has been monitoring seismic events with an analogue system which was not efficient and does not deliver real-time data. Hence, the importance of setting up the National Digital Seismic Network System which would enable the Geological Survey to constantly monitor, manage and coordinate both natural and man-made seismic activities in the country and around the globe, to some extent on real-time basis. The Network System is made up of six remote digital stations that transmit data via satellite to the central observatory. Sensors used are 3× Trillium Compact and 3× Trillium 120PA with Trident digitizers. The department has also acquired strong motion equipment: Titan accelerometers with Taurus digitizers from Nanometrics. Three of each of these instruments have been installed at the Akosombo and Kpong hydrodams, and also at the Weija water supply dam. These instruments are used to monitor dams. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) values established from the analysed data from the accelerometers will be used to retrofit or carry out maintenance work of the dam structures to avoid collapse. Apart from these, the observatory also assesses and analyses seismic waveforms relevant to its needs from the Global Seismographic Network (GSN) system operated by the US Geological Survey. The Ghana Geological Survey, through its Seismic Network Observatory makes data available to its stakeholder institutions for earthquake disaster mitigation; reports on all aspects of seismic-related disasters to the relevant government agencies that deal with disasters; makes recommendations to the government of Ghana on earthquake safety measures; and provides information to assist government institutions develop appropriate land and building policies. The Geological Survey Department, in collaboration with stakeholder agencies, periodically organises public lectures on earthquake disaster risk mitigation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Environmental Pollution And Biodiversity: Light Pollution And Sea Turtles In The Caribbean
JO  - Journal of Environmental Economics and Management
PY  - 2016
AB  - We examine the impact of pollution on biodiversity by studying the effect of coastal light pollution on the sea turtle population in the Caribbean. To this end we assemble a panel data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite-derived measures of nighttime light. Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to $288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately $2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Understanding High-Throughput Satellites: Market Disruptions, Technology, And Value Analysis
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2019
AB  - High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) are a distinctive class of communication satellites that provide significantly more throughput per allocated bandwidth than traditional wide-beam communication satellites. They are the proverbial wave of creative disruption in the space industry and are poised to disrupt the communication market in significant ways. The first objective of this work is to introduce these satellites, discuss their markets, and present their underlying technology base. The second objective is to develop a decision-analytic framework for assessing the value of HTS and to provide meaningful results of the value of such systems under realistic design, operational, and market conditions. We develop the cost and revenue models of HTS. To build the revenue model, we develop a hybrid data-driven and scenario-based load factor model that combines historical data based on financial records from current HTS operators with extrapolations based on best-, nominal-, and worst-case scenarios. We then integrate the cost and revenue models within a stochastic simulation environment and perform Monte-Carlo analysis of the net present value (NPV) of HTS. One important result is that a medium-size HTS significantly outperforms a roughly equivalent traditional wide-beam satellite, even under the worst-case loading scenario. Another important result here identified and quantified is the trade-off between the average revenue per user (ARPU) and average loading of the satellite and how it is mediated by the downlink speed provided to consumers. This result can be used in different ways, for example, by helping define the boundaries of what is competitively achievable in terms of ARPU and downlink speed offerings. The implications of these results for satellite operators and investor are that they delineate the pathways to financial success or failure and the boundary conditions beyond which an HTS will be value-negative.

TI  - Response Of Ecosystem Service Value To Spatio-Temporal Pattern Evolution Of Land Use In Typical Heavy Industry Cities: A Case Study Of Taiyuan City, China
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecosystem services value (ESV) has been one index of quantitative evaluation for the ecological livability of heavy industry cities in the new era, which is intimately relevant to patterns of spatio-temporal changes in land use. This study aims to reveal the response of ecosystem service value in heavy industrial cities to the spatial-temporal evolution structure of land use and to analyze the cold and hot spots and sensitivity. In this study, Taiyuan was taken as an example, and Landsat images were adopted as the basic data. This study used intensity analysis, revised ESV, fishing nets, sensitivity analysis, and the methods of hotspot analysis and spatial overlay. The results showed as follows, (1) The characteristics of land use structure evolution mainly focus on the increase of construction land in the early and the rapid development stage of heavy industry cities. All land use types were partly transferred to construction land, but farmland was the main source, with the largest change intensity in the rapid development stage in Taiyuan; (2) The low-value zones of ESV were mostly distributed in the main urban area for construction and farmland, while the high-value zones were primarily distributed in the forestland and grassland. They were distributed in the Fenhe River valley, western and northern mountainous and hilly areas of Taiyuan. The total ESV continued to decline from 2003 to 2018, with a loss amount of RMB 29 million; (3) The patches of land use change were more and more broken, and the spatial distribution of the cold and hot spots was more and more dispersed. The cold and hot spots of ESV were concentrated in the eastern main urban area and its surrounding areas and expanded to the north and south; (4) The forestland was the most sensitive land factor of ESV. The study provides a theoretical method for land use planning, environmental governance, and ecological restoration in heavy industry cities in the new era.

TI  - Data Integration For Climate Vulnerability Mapping In West Africa
JO  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
PY  - 2015
AB  - Vulnerability mapping reveals areas that are likely to be at greater risk of climate-related disasters in the future. Through integration of climate, biophysical, and socioeconomic data in an overall vulnerability framework, so-called hotspots of vulnerability can be identified. These maps can be used as an aid to targeting adaptation and disaster risk management interventions. This paper reviews vulnerability mapping efforts in West Africa conducted under the USAID-funded African and Latin American Resilience to Climate Change (ARCC) project. The focus is on the integration of remotely sensed and socioeconomic data. Data inputs included a range of sensor data (e.g., MODIS NDVI, Landsat, SRTM elevation, DMSP-OLS night-time lights) as well as high-resolution poverty, conflict, and infrastructure data. Two basic methods were used, one in which each layer was transformed into standardized indicators in an additive approach, and another in which remote sensing data were used to contextualize the results of composite indicators. We assess the benefits and challenges of data integration, and the lessons learned from these mapping exercises.

TI  - Using Virtual Environments To Improve The Realism Of Choice Experiments: A Case Study About Coastal Erosion Management
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2017
AB  - Choice experiment surveys are commonly used to assess the general public's willingness to pay for different levels of environmental quality. However, respondents need to understand what they are valuing or they will make potentially wrong assumptions based on different experiences and frames of reference. Three-dimensional computer generated models or Virtual Environments (VE) have so far seen little use in economics research, probably due to the complexity and cost of developing and delivering them to study participants. The few studies that have used them find that VE are superior to static image presentations in helping people evaluate complex data. For this study we developed virtual environments for a choice experiment about coastal erosion management using free, easy-to-use software and Google Earth(C) satellite imagery and presented these to respondents as video tours. Our results indicate that the VE treatment reduced choice error, reduced left-right bias and improved respondent engagement and retention when compared with static images. There were also differences in WTP between the two groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - National Indicators For Observing Ecosystem Service Change
JO  - Global Environmental Change
PY  - 2015
AB  - Earth's life-support systems are in rapid decline, yet we have few metrics or indicators with which to track these changes. The world's governments are calling for biodiversity and ecosystem-service monitoring to guide and evaluate international conservation policy as well as to incorporate natural capital into their national accounts. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) has been tasked with setting up this monitoring system. Here we explore the immediate feasibility of creating a global ecosystem-service monitoring platform under the GEO BON framework through combining data from national statistics, global vegetation models, and production function models. We found that nine ecosystem services could be annually reported at a national scale in the short term: carbon sequestration, water supply for hydropower, and non-fisheries marine products, crop, livestock, game meat, fisheries, mariculture, and timber production. Reported changes in service delivery over time reflected ecological shocks (e.g., droughts and disease outbreaks), highlighting the immediate utility of this monitoring system. Our work also identified three opportunities for creating a more comprehensive monitoring system. First, investing in input data for ecological process models (e.g., global land-use maps) would allow many more regulating services to be monitored. Currently, only 1 of 9 services that can be reported is a regulating service. Second, household surveys and censuses could help evaluate how nature affects people and provides non-monetary benefits. Finally, to forecast the sustainability of service delivery, research efforts could focus on calculating the total remaining biophysical stocks of provisioning services. Regardless, we demonstrated that a preliminary ecosystem-service monitoring platform is immediately feasible. With sufficient international investment, the platform could evolve further into a much-needed system to track changes in our planet's life-support systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Statewide Urban Tree Canopy Mapping Method
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - Maps of urban tree canopy are essential to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem services, and to determine who benefits from them. Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m2, three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m2 on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m2, which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5–81%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE)decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block. Our work is comparable to past efforts to map urban tree canopy, and the open source software and use of imagery that is freely available for all cities in the contiguous US make it broadly applicable. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Current Concepts In The Management Of Patients With Melanoma
JO  - American Journal of Clinical Dermatology
PY  - 2002
AB  - Melanoma is a significant health problem. Despite public education and tree cancer screenings, the incidence and mortality of melanoma continues to rise; however, many currently diagnosed melanomas are thin lesions, suggesting that education and awareness is having an impact. In addition, there are still subsets of patients who need increased surveillance in order to increase their survival. Although large congenital nevi may be precursors of melanoma, small and medium congenital nevi have an insignificant risk for melanoma development. Large congenital nevi, which are axial in location, appear to be more likely to develop melanoma and are associated with melanocytosis and melanoma of the CNS, both of which portend a poor prognosis. Recently, the recommended margins of excision have become more conservative so that many of the surgical defects can be closed primarily. Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy have replaced elective node dissections, thus decreasing the morbidity associated with the surgical management of melanoma. Although controversy still exists as to whether or not sentinel lymph node biopsy alters a patient's prognosis, it has been shown to be a powerful prognostic indicator. Although most melanomas are managed by routine surgical excision, other modalities are sometimes employed. For example, cryosurgery or radiation therapy may be indicated in the frail, elderly individual with a large facial lentigo maligna. Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for head and neck melanomas and those located in areas where maximum preservation of tissue is required and for desmoplastic and acral lentiginous melanomas. Much more work remains in the area of adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Dacarbazine remains the drug of choice in disseminated melanoma, but remissions are usually short lived. Interleukin and biochemotherapy has yielded good results but the percentage benefiting is small. Although high dose interferon increases disease-free and overall survival in some patients, it remains a controversial drug which is not easily tolerated. In the new staging system for melanoma, ulceration is second only to Breslow's thickness. In transit (satellite) lesions have also been included m this new system. The new system also recognizes that patients with only microscopic metastatic nodal disease fare better than patients with clinically enlarged metastatic nodes and that it is the number of nodes involved with metastases, not their size, that determines the patient's prognosis. Except for lesions <1mm thick, the Clark s level of invasion has been de-emphasized.

TI  - Synergy Of Vswir (0.4-2.5μm) And Mtir (3.5-12.5μm) Data For Post-Fire Assessments
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2012
AB  - Post-fire effects assessments are crucial to evaluate the impact of fire on ecosystems. They are helpful in planning post-fire rehabilitation and useful for reducing uncertainties in current wildfire emission estimates. We have used MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data over the 2011 Canyon fire in California, USA to evaluate the potential synergy between visible to short-wave infrared (VSWIR, 0.4-2.5μm) and mid to thermal infrared (MTIR, 3.5-12.5μm) data in a post-fire environment. We applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) inputting five endmembers: char, green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), substrate and shadow. Results revealed that fractional cover estimates of char, NPV and substrate are 5-7% better when VSWIR-MTIR data were combined, compared to using only VSWIR data. Combined VSWIR-MTIR imagery will become available at pixel sizes smaller than 100m with future satellite sensors, such as the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI). The MESMA-derived char fractional cover was also shown to be strongly correlated with the Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI, R adj 2=0.82) and the percentage of black trees and shrubs (R adj 2=0.66) measured in the field. SMA-derived char fractions provide quantitative abundance maps which should prove valuable for improving wildfire emission estimates by refining burning efficiency values. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Using Satellite-Based Vegetation Data For Short-Term Grazing Monitoring To Inform Adaptive Management
JO  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - Quantifying rangeland vegetation amounts with remotely sensed satellite data is a proliferating field of study. Yet the resulting datasets are rarely related to use-based monitoring indicators (i.e., utilization or residual biomass), which are critical for adaptive management and to inform the subsequent year's grazing plans. To better assess our ability to use remotely sensed data products for grazing monitoring and adaptive management, we tested the relationships between a variety of vegetation biomass metrics derived from remotely sensed data on a bunchgrass-dominated grassland in northeast Oregon and two common indicators: stocking rate at the pasture scale (40-250 ha; a management indicator) and field-based utilization estimates at the plot scale (25-50 m; a grazing indicator). At the pasture scale, we correlated stocking rate to biomass metrics and found two metrics that had consistent relationships to stocking rate: fall mean biomass (r values range: -0.52 to -0.56; P values < 0.001) and the 10th percentile of the relative difference between summer and fall biomass (r values range: -0.47 to -0.52; P values < 0.01). Scatterplots from these correlations were then evaluated alongside managers' knowledge to interpret why some pastures deviated from the overall pattern. At the plot scale, we correlated infield utilization estimates to biomass metrics and found consistent relationships with fall mean biomass (r values range: -0.32 to -0.47; P values < 0.001) and the relative difference between summer and fall biomass (r value: from -0.20 to -0.62; P values < 0.005). To further visualize the utilization correlations, we classified these two biomass maps into three categories guided by our utilization estimates. Significant changes in biomass due to management and interannual variation in biomass amounts stood out. The results and visualizations demonstrate how remotely sensed data relate to conventional grazing monitoring indicators and exemplify how remotely sensed data can be used to inform adaptive management.

TI  - Examining Aspiration's Imprint On The Landscape: Lessons From Mozambique's Limpopo National Park
JO  - Global Environmental Change
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper explores the role of aspirational capacity, one cognitive dimension of well-being, as a driver of deforestation among rural smallholders living in or near Mozambique's portion of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Integrating analyses of remote sensing, socio-economic, and semi-structured interview data within a theoretical framework drawn from Amartya Sen's capability approach, we examine land use decisions in the context of the available options people have to choose from as well as the factors influencing their ultimate choice. Land change detection analysis indicates that more forest conversion occurs within the park, but rates show considerable variation at the community level. We find no association between economic deprivation and deforestation rates. Limited aspirational capacity, manifested in expressions of helplessness and despair, a lack of perceived choices, and fewer agentive pursuits, is one dimension of poverty that does contribute to cropland expansion. Qualitative findings indicate that a more limited capacity to set, pursue, and achieve aspirational goals perpetuates agricultural land use traps and, consequentially, higher deforestation rates. Higher levels of aspirational capacity also contribute to negative conservation outcomes as people adopt the risky but profitable activity of illegal rhino hunting as a means to obtain other valued capabilities. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Evaluation Of Morphometric Parameters Derived From Cartosat-1 Dem Using Remote Sensing And Gis Techniques For Budigere Amanikere Watershed, Dakshina Pinakini Basin, Karnataka, India
JO  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
PY  - 2017
AB  - The quantitative analysis of drainage system is an important aspect of characterization of watersheds. Using watershed as a basin unit in morphometric analysis is the most logical choice because all hydrological and geomorphic processes occur within the watershed. The Budigere Amanikere watershed a tributary of Dakshina Pinakini River has been selected for case illustration. Geoinformatics module consisting of ArcGIS 10.3v and Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) version 1 of resolution 1 arc Sec (32 m) data obtained from Bhuvan is effectively used. Sheet and gully erosion are identified in parts of the study area. Slope in the watershed indicating moderate to least runoff and negligible soil loss condition. Third and fourth-order sub-watershed analysis is carried out. Mean bifurcation ratio (R (b)) 3.6 specify there is no dominant influence of geology and structures, low drainage density (D (d)) 1.12 and low stream frequency (F (s)) 1.17 implies highly infiltration subsoil material and low runoff, infiltration number (I (f))1.3 implies higher infiltration capacity, coarse drainage texture (T) 3.40 shows high permeable subsoil, length of overland flow (L (g)) 0.45 indicates under very less structural disturbances, less runoff conditions, constant of channel maintenance (C) 0.9 indicates higher permeability of subsoil, elongation ratio (R (e)) 0.58, circularity ratio (R (c)) 0.75 and form factor (R (f)) 0.26 signifies sub-circular to more elongated basin with high infiltration with low runoff. It was observed from the hypsometric curves and hypsometric integral values of the watershed along with their sub basins that the drainage system is attaining a mature stage of geomorphic development. Additionally, Hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral value proves that the infiltration capacity is high as well as runoff is low in the watershed. Thus, these mormometric analyses can be used as an estimator of erosion status of watersheds leading to prioritization for taking up soil and water conservation measures.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations Of Night-Time Lights At Early Stages Of The Covid-19 Epidemic In The United States
JO  - National Remote Sensing Bulletin
PY  - 2022
AB  - The COVID-19 epidemic swept the world and continued to spread. Without effective medical treatments and vaccine during the early stage of the pandemic, local governments in various countries had to lock down cities and adopt non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as the stay-at-home order, social distancing, and so on. NPIs against the COVID-19 epidemic have significantly changed socioeconomic activities in cities. However, characteristics and patterns of urban socio-economic activities under this influence are still unclear. Benefiting from the development of earth observation technologies, such large-scale changes in socioeconomic activities are enough to be captured by satellites through remotely sensed night-time lights (NTL). In this study, we selected 20 major cities in the United States including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles to analyze spatio-temporal variations of NTL caused by the lockdown of cities. The first round of COVID-19 epidemic occurred in the United States in mid-March 2020. Since March 2020, American cities have successively issued stay-at-home orders, but there are differences in the time and strictness of policy implementation. Large cities have a higher population density and a higher intensity of social activities, so they are more susceptible to infectious diseases. The diversity of lockdown dates and strictness of lockdowns in cities in the United States are conducive to investigating the spatio-temporal variations of NTL. We acquired monthly averaged NPP VIIRS products of February, March and April, 2020, which are from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (NPP). We further analyzed the spatial pattern, distance decay and disparities in land use types of changes in NTL. Results show that NTL generally dimmed by 5-8% in U.S. cities caused by the lockdown of cities. There are 6 cities where the luminous brightness has dropped by more than 10%: Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis, and St. Louis. Among them, Minneapolis has the largest decrease in luminous brightness, with a decrease of about 40% in March. The spatial change of NTL shows obvious "core-periphery" pattern that the reduction of NTL declines with the distance from the city center. This is mainly because the central area of the city is a concentrated commercial area. After the closure of the city, commercial activities have dropped significantly, resulting in an obvious reduction in NTL around city centers. The reduction of NTL varies among diverse urban land use types. In New York, NTL decreased the most on land for residence and aviation facilities by 12% and 11%, respectively. In Chicago, NTL generally decreased by 20% in all types of urban land, and NTL recovered after one month of the lockdown of cities in other urban land except sports facilities land. This study only analyzes the spatio-temporal changes of NTL. In the future, it can be combined with multi-source data to explain the driving force of NTL changes.

TI  - Comparative Analysis Of Two Parameter-Dependent Split Window Algorithms For The Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Using Modis Tir Observations
JO  - Journal of Agrometeorology
PY  - 2023
AB  - MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) product is extensively used in agricultural studies like crop health assessment, soil moisture estimation, irrigation management, land use land cover change, air-temperature retrieval and crop water stress detection. Numerous studies have used Split Window (SW) algorithm to retrieve LST from MODIS TIR bands. Among them, some utilize Sensor View Angle Dependent (SVAD) or Columnar Water Vapor Dependent (CWVD) SW algorithm. Present study aims to make use of SVAD and CWVD SW algorithms and compare them to evaluate the LST retrieval accuracy over various land surface type. Theoretical accuracy assessment of the CWVD and SVAD algorithms demonstrates a good accuracy with the an RMSE of 1.09K and 1.42K, respectively. The experimental retrieval of LST achieves exceptionally good accuracy, with a RMSE of 1.45K in the CWVD algorithm and 1.80K in the SVAD algorithm, particularly in heterogeneous regions. In homogeneous regions, the RMSE values are 1.14K in CWVD and 1.10K in SVAD. Both algorithms exhibit satisfactory accuracy; nevertheless, the application of these algorithms may vary in agricultural contexts. Based on the obtained results and the inclusion of required parameters, we have arrived at a conclusion regarding the superior performance of the SVAD compared to the CWVD for LST retrieval. © Author (s).

TI  - Optimisation Of The Resource Of Land-Based Livestock Systems To Advance Sustainable Agriculture: A Farm-Level Analysis
JO  - Agriculture (Switzerland)
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land dedicated to livestock contributes at least 40% of the global agricultural output. While advances in the application of geospatial information systems and remote sensing technologies offer much to agriculture, capturing and using that rich spatial biophysical information is not a feature available in most farm systems models. In this paper, we tackle this gap describing a land-based integrated grazing farm optimisation and resource allocation model (AgInform®) that departs from the use of whole farm and average data, to the integration of biological data obtained directly from each of the land units within the farm. The model allows the exploration of the dynamics of biophysical and financial performance of the farm in a steady-state, single-year approach, where the opening and closing values of the biological elements of the farm system conditions must remain the same (e.g., animal numbers, herbage mass), unless otherwise specified. The user supplies pasture growth rates, minimum and maximum acceptable pasture masses for each land management unit (LMU), differential boundary conditions to deliver defined environmental outcomes, animal performance (sheep, beef and deer), farm costs and market prices. The linear programming (LP) equations formed by AgInform® can be divided into a single objective and constraints (which accommodate the boundaries), including those placed on individual LMUs. The optimization routine uses this information to identify the mix of livestock production enterprises that maximises profit for the business. The model in maintaining the link between available pasture mass and livestock requirements for each LMU throughout all calculations, enables the livestock type and number carried, along with the pasture mass required on each LMU throughout the year to achieve the required animal performance levels to be included as model outputs. A hill land sheep and beef farm consisting of seven distinct LMUs was used as a farm-level case to assess if AgInform® 1) has sufficient flexibility to integrate biological information from each LMU; 2) could use the specified livestock performance targets to derive a feasible livestock policy that optimised resource use and farm returns; 3) can assign each fortnight animal type and number and herbage mass to each LMU; and 4) can mimic reality to produce credible solutions. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - The Pilgrims’ Complaint: A Study Of Popular Thought In The Early Tudor North
JO  - The Pilgrims' Complaint: A Study of Popular Thought in the Early Tudor North
PY  - 2016
AB  - The Pilgrimage of Grace, a popular uprising in the north of England against Henry VIII’s religious policies, has long been recognised as a crucial point in the fortunes of the English Reformation. Historians have long debated the motives of the rebels and what effects they had on government policy. In this new study, however, Michael Bush takes a fresh approach, examining the wealth of textual evidence left by the pilgrimage of grace to reconstruct the wider social, political and religious attitudes of northern society in the early Tudor period. More than simply a reassessment of the events of October 1536, the book examines the mass of surviving evidence - the rebels’ proclamations, rumour-mongering bills, oaths, manifestos, petitions, songs, prophetic rhymes, eye-witness accounts and confessions - in order to illuminate and explore the kind of grass-roots feelings that are often so hard to pin down. He concludes that the evidence points to a much more complex situation than has often been assumed, revealing much more than simply a desire for the country to return to the old religion and familiar ways. Rather, this book demonstrates how the rebels sought to use the language of custom and tradition to bolster their own political and economic positions in a rapidly changing world. It reveals a populace at once conservative and radical, able to judge innovation and change in relation to its own benefit and ultimately able to advance a coherent programme of reform. Whilst this programme was carefully couched in language supportive of the traditional orderly society, it nevertheless carried within it more radical proposals, which proved extremely challenging to the monarchy, government and church, who eventually closed ranks to bring the uprising to an end. As both an exploration of the causes and aims of the pilgrimage of grace, and the wider religious, social and political attitudes of northern England, this book has much to offer the student of the period. © 2009 Michael Bush.

TI  - Estimation Of Pm2.5 Concentration In Sichuan Province Based On Improved Linear Mixed Effect Model And Geo-Intelligent Random Forest
JO  - Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - High-resolution PM2.5 spatial distribution data is of great significance for the dynamic monitoring and control of PM2.5 pollution. Himawari-8 AOD data, ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data, DEM, land-use data, and luminous remote-sensing data were selected as estimating variables, using an improved resampling method for data matching and an improved linear mixed model (iLME) combined with a Geo-intelligent random forest model to build the combined model for estimating PM2.5 concentration. The results showed that: ① Among the estimated variables selected, AOD, SP, TEMP, RH, and BLH were important factors affecting the PM2.5 concentration of Sichuan Province in 2016, and their correlation coefficients were 0.65, 0.58, 0.55, 0.54, and 0.35, respectively. ② The prediction accuracy of the iLME+Geoi-RF model was greatly improved compared to that of other models. The model-fitted R2, RMSR, and MAE were 0.94, 5.72 μg•m-3, and 3.92 μg•m-3, and the cross-validated R2, RMSR, and MAE were 0.82, 10.20 μg•m-3, and 6.44 μg•m-3, respectively. The model can obtain more accurate spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in Sichuan Province and provide a more reasonable scientific reference for regional air quality assessment, human exposure risk assessment, and environmental pollution control. ③ There was a significant seasonal difference in PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province, with the highest concentration of PM2.5 in winter, followed by spring and autumn, with the concentration of PM2.5 in summer being the lowest. In 2016, the monthly average PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province showed a V shape that first decreased and then increased, with the minimum value in June, the maximum value in December, and slight fluctuations in August and November. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration in the eastern area of Sichuan Province was generally higher than that in the west, and the local pollution level was relatively high. The high-valued areas were mainly distributed in the eastern region, where the cities have been developing rapidly and the population was densely distributed, whereas the low-valued areas were mainly distributed in the western region, where it is sparsely populated with backward economic development. ④ Although the overall distribution of PM2.5 concentration estimated by the different models was essentially the same, the iLME+Geoi-RF model could more accurately and effectively estimate the spatial distribution of pollution in this study area. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Using Landscape Ecology To Make Sense Of Australias Last Frontier

PY  - 2007
AB  - Just as the nineteenth century was a period of great biological discovery, driven by exploration and worldwide expansion of Western culture, there is no doubt that the dramatic global environment changes, driven by exploitation and pollution of the biosphere, will characterize the twenty-first century. A spin-off of the expansion of industrial civilization, that is driving the planetary environmental crisis, is the development and widespread availability of powerful digital technologies, such as geographic information systems, global positioning systems, digital aerial photography, and satellite imagery. These technologies provide unique insights into the rate and scale of environmental disturbances at the landscape-scale, which in aggregate drive global change. Natural resource managers and decision-makers tasked to achieve ecological sustainability necessarily focus on the landscape scale. Let us call the science that examines the ecological interaction between humans and landscapes landscape ecology (Naveh and Lieberman 1984). This discipline has the advantage of building on numerous other disciplines, including pure and applied physical and biological sciences and the more ambiguous, nuanced, and subtler fields in the humanities that have a stake in landscapes, including anthropology, environmental history, and various themes of human geography (Head 2001). Such a polyglot and young science is inherently vulnerable to bouts of introspection and anxiety about the conceptual bounds of the discipline and its philosophical roots (Wu and Hobbs 2002). I submit that the strength and utility of the transdisciplinary perspectives for making sense of and responding to global change is provided by landscape ecology. © Cambridge University Press 2007.

TI  - How Do Spatial Patterns Impact Regulation Of Water-Related Ecosystem Services? Insights From A New Town Development In The Yangtze River Delta, China
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Scientists have made efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ecosystem service valuation and mapping; yet little actual implementation of new ecosystem service knowledge has been delivered in practice. We explored this gap by developing a spatially explicit and semi-qualitative evaluation approach to clarify how the spatial patterns of new town developments impact three types of water-related regulating ecosystem services, namely water flow regulation, flooding mitigation, and water quality regulation. Based on peer-reviewed publications, we identified key indicators with spatial characteristics that practitioners care about and have control of. We investigated the case of Lingang, a satellite city of Shanghai in the Yangtze River Delta, and found that (1) 85.30\% of the pre-urban East Lingang with native marshlands performed better holistically while 93.06\% of the post-urban East Lingang using the man-made lakeside model performed poorly; (2) 82.47\% of the double grids model at West Lingang performed poorly in pre-urban time, while some major waterways were improved by the Hydrological Planning; and (3) a major weakness in the planning process was the ignorance in conserving pre-urban ecological resources, preventing the provision of ecosystem services. Finally, four urban design principles of both large-scale land use considerations and finer-scale design implications were proposed.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Wildfires Occurrence In The Mexican State Of Oaxaca
JO  - Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales
PY  - 2022
AB  - In this study, we modelled and analyzed hotspot events recorded by MODIS satellite during the last nineteen years in the Mexican state of Oaxaca using a hierarchical Poisson Bayesian model. Our approach models the number of forest fires in space, time and the interaction of both and considers environmental variables. According to our results, some environmental variables can explain some of the observed Spatio-temporal variations, such as the temperature of the driest quarter, average wind speed, enhanced vegetation index values, and the occurrence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The analysis identified two spatial cluster regions: the first covers the Sierra Juárez up to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and the second covers the Sierra del Sur. Additionally, the temporal term in our model suggests that the number of events has increased by approximately 42.2 % in the last two decades. In conclusion, our results prompt that forest fires increased not only spatially but also in temporarily. These findings are alarm signals because if the trend continues, hundreds of new hectares of forest and its biodiversity will be threatened in the following decades, affecting too economic activities and people's health living in rural and urban areas of Oaxaca. This study can be a primary analysis in designing more efficient fire management programs to mitigate the impacts of altered fire regimes in Oaxaca. © Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales.

TI  - Geo-Spatial Analysis Of Drought In The Gambia Using Multiple Models
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climate change has made The Gambia vulnerable to drought hazard. Variability and negative trends in rainfall quantity and mid-season dry spells mainly attributed to the impacts of climate change. The inadequacy in hydrometeorological information puts the agricultural sector at a high risk which employs over 70\% of the population. The aim of this study was to establish the intensity and spatiotemporal pattern of drought in The Gambia from 2000 to 2020 using multiple drought indices. Rainfall data, satellite images, and government policy documents were analyzed to determine the state of drought in The Gambia. Rainfall data, using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Precipitation Anomaly Percentage (PAP) were calculated and interpolated, and satellite images were processed using Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) to determine drought intensity and spatial distribution. The findings revealed that drought exists in The Gambia at moderate levels of SPI values (- 1.00 to - 1.49), (35\% of PAP), and VCI of no drought intensity of more than 35\%. The most drought prone areas in The Gambia are North Bank Region and Eastern parts of country in both north and south of The Gambia River banks. Recommendations of adaptation practice both on-farm and off-farm such as damming and economic diversification was drawn from other parts of the world, to reduce the negative effects of drought hazard in The Gambia.

TI  - A Novel Two-Stage Destriping Algorithm Based On Mwir Energy Separation And Image Guidance (Mes-Ig)
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands in multispectral datasets are extremely useful in many applications. However, the LWIR bands usually suffer from undesirable stripe noise, which impedes their further application. Compared with emission-dominated LWIR, the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) bands containing both emitted and reflected radiation usually exhibit higher image quality. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage MWIR energy separation and image guidance (MES-IG) algorithm to destripe the LWIR images with the assistance of the MWIR bands. In the first stage, we decompose the MWIR image into the emitted and reflected components by solving a constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we impose the low-rank penalty to enforce the similarities between MWIR and LWIR, and we use the total variation (TV) regularization to exploit the similarities between MWIR and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) images. In the second stage, the obtained emitted component of MWIR is considered as the guidance image to remove the stripes in the LWIR images by adopting the 1-D guided filter algorithm. Numerical experiments on the Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in providing improved LWIR image destriping performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Predicting Soil Erosion Process Based On Rs & Gis: A Case Study
JO  - APWCS 2010 - 2010 Asia-Pacific Conference on Wearable Computing Systems
PY  - 2010
AB  - Soil erosion is becoming more and more serious worldwide in recent decades, and remains a major threat to terrestrial ecosystem and global sustainable development. The loss of topsoil through erosion results in a significant loss in productivity. The subsoil remains is likely to be incapable of supporting viable agricultural enterprises. Runoff from eroding landscapes contains sediment and any nutrients, fertilizers or pesticides that were present in the soil. Assessment on soil erosion hazard is essential for soil conservation plans of a mountainous region for sustainable development. The objective of this study was to predicting soil erosion process and mapping soil erosion hazard of Yizi (Rehe district, Sichuan province, P.R.China) following RS(remote sensing) and GIS based on modeling approach using derived soil, land cover and DEM derived terrain slope map and ancillary data of soil characteristics and rainfall as inputs. Integrated predicting approach resulted in five classes of soil erosion hazard from low to high in this study area with numerical values of the Soil Loss Equation (SLE). The results shows that RS and GLS are indeed valuable tools for predicting soil erosion process and soil erosion hazard mapping by integration of soil erosion controlling parameters.

PY  - 2019
AB  - In cities, green areas are important places providing several physical, social and psychological benefits for people in addition to their ecological functions. For this reason, the amount and quality of green areas are considered as the indicator of civilization and life quality. Countries enact standards for these areas in their planning tasks. In the present study, the distribution, amount, impact area, and adequacy of the active green areas in the city of Nevsehir were determined on whole city and neighborhood scales in line with the predetermined standards. For this purpose, Geographic Information Systems were used in processing and analyzing the data; satellite images were used in determining the green areas; and the Google Earth Street View was used in classifying the data. According to the results of the analyses, it was determined that despite the fact that green areas in Nevsehir are significantly below the standards quantitatively, they had a high level of accessibility in the whole city according to service impact areas. In addition to this, the advantages that were presented by the method that was employed in the present study were evaluated in the analyses of these green areas. © by PSP

TI  - The Identification Of Source Regions Of Black Carbon At A Receptor Site Off The Eastern Coast Of China
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2015
AB  - The black carbon (BC) mass concentration and the particle chemical compositions were continually measured at Changdao Island, which is a regional receptor site off the eastern coast of China. This island is in the transport passage of the continental outflow to the Pacific Ocean when the East Asia monsoon prevails in the winter and spring. The campaign period was for March and April 2011, which corresponded to heating and non-heating periods in northern China. The effect of BC emission source regions on BC measured at Changdao Island between the heating and non-heating periods was determined by integrating the total potential source contribution function (TPSCF) model with the new monthly emission inventory in 2010 and the fire counts retrieved from MODIS during the campaign. BC concentrations were determined to be highest for similar times of day for both the heating and non-heating periods: 4.27μgm-3 at 8:00 AM and 3.06μgm-3 at 9:00 AM, respectively. The probable source regions for BC were primarily located in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces (and in other neighboring provinces) for both periods. However, the source regions for the non-heating period extended more to the north and southwest than those of the heating period. TPSCF values were correlated with the emission rates from residential, industry, transportation, and power plants sources in the anthropogenic emission inventory. This correlation provides an indirect and qualitative process to verify the emission inventory. In the heating period, the predominant source was the residential source in the emission inventory, and this source had a significant effect on the BC concentration. The differing peak concentrations between the two periods may be observed because of the increased residential heating during the heating period, which suggested that the measures employed by the government and environmental managers to reduce the emissions of pollutants should be stricter in the identified source regions during the heating period. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change And It's Impacts On Diurnal Temperature Range Over The Agricultural Pastoral Ecotone Of Northern China
JO  - Land Degradation and Development
PY  - 2018
AB  - The agricultural pastoral ecotone of Northern China (APENC), as a fragile ecological zone, has experienced dramatic land use/land cover changes (LULCC) owing to intensive human disturbances. The understanding of the impacts of LULCC on climate, especially the diurnal temperature range (DTR), is not sufficient in this region. The spatio-temporal processes of LULCC and its impacts on DTR were quantitatively analyzed, using the Terra/Aqua MODIS data (MYD11A2 and MCD12Q1, 2003–2013), on the premise of eliminating or weakening the effects of background climate. Results showed that the areas of croplands, forests, and waterbody increased with the annual rate of 2.84%, 0.95%, and 8.2%, respectively, whereas grasslands and bare land decreased with the annual rate of 0.69% and 7.32%, and built-up remained quite stable during the period of 2003–2013. The annual changing rate of LULC for 2008–2013 was nearly 2.84 times the value for 2003–2008. In general, LULC contributed to a decline of DTR over the whole APENC both at monthly/seasonal timescale. Croplands, forests, and mutual transformation between croplands and grasslands tended to decrease daytime maximum temperature (Tmax), resulting in a decline of DTR. The grasslands could reduce the DTR by decreasing Tmax and increasing nighttime minimum temperature (Tmin). By contrast, the conversion of grasslands into forests tended to increase Tmax and decrease Tmin, thus a rise of DTR for winter, summer, and autumn had observed. These results can assist land resource development and relevant policies making in APENC. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Investigating The Uncertainties Propagation Analysis Of Co2 Emissions Gridded Maps At The Urban Scale: A Case Study Of Jinjiang City, China
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Gridded CO2 emission maps at the urban scale can aid the design of low-carbon development strategies. However, the large uncertainties associated with such maps increase policy-related risks. Therefore, an investigation of the uncertainties in gridded maps at the urban scale is essential. This study proposed an analytic workflow to assess uncertainty propagation during the gridding process. Gridded CO2 emission maps were produced using two resolutions of geospatial datasets (e.g., remote sensing satellite-derived products) for Jinjiang City, China, and a workflow was applied to analyze uncertainties. The workflow involved four submodules that can be used to evaluate the uncertainties of CO2 emissions in gridded maps, caused by the gridded model and input. Fine-resolution (30 m) maps have a larger spatial variation in CO2 emissions, which gives the fine-resolution maps a higher degree of uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the uncertainties of gridded CO2 emission maps, caused by inserting a random error into spatial proxies, were found to decrease after the gridding process. This can be explained by the “compensation of error” phenomenon, which may be attributed to the cancellation of the overestimated and underestimated values among the different sectors at the same grid. This indicates a nonlinear change between the sum of the uncertainties for different sectors and the actual uncertainties in the gridded maps. In conclusion, the present workflow determined uncertainties were caused by the gridded model and input. These results may aid decision-makers in establishing emission reduction targets, and in developing both low-carbon cities and community policies. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Monitoring Thirty-Five Years Of Italian Forest Disturbance Using Landsat Time Series
PY  - 2021
AB  - Forest ecosystems have a crucial role for biodiversity conservation, providing a large set of ecosystem services. Understanding and assessing forest disturbance regimes on a large spatial and temporal scale is a prerequisite setting up sustainable forest management solutions. In this context, Remote Sensing is an efficient tool frequently used in land-use change detection. The present work is aimed at spatially estimating forest disturbing events occurred in Italy in the period 1985-2019. Using Landsat time series and the 3I3D forest disturbance detection algorithm, we analyzed "extreme" forest disturbance patterns and their evolution in the last 35 years. We found a total of 472 events, with the highest incidence (96) in the period 1990 - 1994. The accuracy of the 3I3D algorithm was estimated using a photo-interpreted dataset of nine random-sampled squared cells of 225 km2 each, distributed in the Italian region. Omission error for the 3I3D map ranged from a minimum of 37.43\% to a maximum of 64.62\% (mean value of 47.07\%) while the commission error between 36.80\% and 83.92\%, with an average of 49.60\%. Results suggest that occurrence of severe disturbance events do not seem to increase over time in the study period.

TI  - Engaging The Applications Community Of The Future Surface Water And Ocean Topography (Swot) Mission
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2015
AB  - NASA and the French space agency, CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA) are developing new wide swath altimetry technology that will cover most of the world's ocean and surface freshwater bodies. The proposed Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will have the capability to make observations of surface water (lakes, rivers, wetland) heights and measurements of ocean surface topography with unprecedented spatial coverage, temporal sampling, and spatial resolution compared to existing technologies. These data will be useful for monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and characterizing human impacts on a changing environment. The applied science community is a key element in the success of the SWOT mission, demonstrating the high value of the science and data products in addressing societal issues and needs. The SWOT applications framework includes a working group made up of applications specialists, SWOT science team members, academics and SWOT Project members to promote applications research and engage a broad community of potential SWOT data users. A defined plan and a guide describing a program to engage early adopters in using proxies for SWOT data, including sophisticated ocean and hydrology simulators, an airborne analogue for SWOT (AirSWOT), and existing satellite datasets, are cornerstones for the program. A user survey is in development and the first user workshop was held in 2015, with annual workshops planned. The anticipated science and engineering advances that SWOT will provide can be transformed into valuable services to decision makers and civic organizations focused on addressing global disaster risk reduction initiatives and potential science-based mitigation activities for water resources challenges of the future. With the surface water measurements anticipated from SWOT, a broad range of applications can inform inland and coastal managers and marine operators of terrestrial and oceanic phenomena relevant to their work.

TI  - Analyzing The Variation Of Building Density Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Images: The Example Of Shanghai City
JO  - SENSORS
PY  - 2008
AB  - Building density is an important issue in urban planning and land management. In the article, building coverage ratio ( BCR) and floor area ratio ( FAR) values extracted from high resolution satellite images were used to indicate buildings' stretching on the surface and growth along the third dimension within areas of interest in Shanghai City, P. R. China. The results show that the variation of FAR is higher than that of BCR in the inner circle, and that the newer commercial centers have higher FAR and lower BCR values, while the traditional commercial areas have higher FAR and BCR ratios. By comparing different residential areas, it was found that the historical "Shikumen" areas and the old residential areas built before 1980s have higher BCR and lower FAR, while the new residential areas have higher FAR and lower BCR, except for the villa areas. These results suggest that both older building areas and villa areas use land resources in an inefficient way, and therefore better planning and management of urban land are needed for those fast economic growing regions.

TI  - Assessment Of Wheat Straw Cover And Yield Performance In A Rice-Wheat Cropping System By Using Landsat Satellite Data
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Proper straw cover information is one of the most important inputs for agroecosystem and environmental modeling, but the availability of accurate information remains limited. However, several remote-sensing (RS)-based studies have provided a residue cover estimation and provided spatial distribution mapping of paddy rice areas in a constant field condition. Despite this, the performance of rice crops with straw applications has received little attention. Furthermore, there are no methods currently available to quantify the wheat straw cover (WSC) percentage and its effect on rice crops in the rice-wheat cropping region on a large scale and a continuous basis. The novel approach proposed in this study demonstrates that the Landsat satellite data and seven RS-based indices, e.g., (i) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (ii) Normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI), (iii) Normalized difference index 5 (NDI5), (iv) Normalized difference index 7 (NDI7), (v) Simple tillage index (STI), (vi) Normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), and (vii) Shortwave red normalized difference index (SRNDI), can be used to estimate the WSC percentage and determine the performance of rice crops over the study area in Changshu county, China. The regression model shows that the NDTI index performed better in differentiating the WSC at sampling points with a coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.80) and root mean squared difference (RMSD = 8.46\%) compared to that of other indices, whereas the overall accuracy for mapping WSC was observed to be 84.61\% and the kappa coefficient was kappa = 0.76. Moreover, the rice yield model was established by correlating between the peak NDVI values and rice grain yield collected from ground census data, with R-2 = 0.85. The finding also revealed that the highest estimated yield (8439.67 kg/ha) was recorded with 68\% WCS in the study region. This study confirmed that the NDVI and NDTI algorithms are very effective and robust indicators. Also, it can be strongly concluded that multispectral Landsat satellite imagery is capable of measuring the WSC percentage and successively determines the impact of different WSC percentages on rice crop yield within fields or across large regions through remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques for the long-term planning of agriculture sustainability in rice-wheat cropping systems.

TI  - Global Urban Land Expansion Tends To Be Slope Climbing: A Remotely Sensed Nighttime Light Approach
JO  - EARTHS FUTURE
PY  - 2023
AB  - The slope climbing of urban land expansion (SE) has become an increasingly prevalent phenomenon, and it has resulted in unique characteristics in terms of urban form, landscape, and governance with challenges for sustainable urban development worldwide. However, relatively little concern has been given to the SE with a long time series worldwide. On the basis of urban entities extracted from Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite-like (SNPP-VIIRS-like) data, we attempted to quantify and evaluate global SE with the help of slope spectrum analysis from different scales (e.g., global, continental, national, and city scales) during the period of 2000-2020. Our study proves that urban entities not only identify physical scopes but also reflect the intensity differences of socioeconomic development, which can provide an accurate approach to evaluate the SE. We found that global urban entities increased from 157,733 km(2) in 2000 to 470,632 km(2) in 2020, representing a 1.98-fold increase. The global average slope of urban entities was on an upward trend, from 0.85 degrees by 2000 to 0.96 degrees by 2020, an increase of about 0.11 degrees. Asia, Africa, and South America have experienced an evident SE process, while North America has exhibited a slow SE trend. A remarkable phenomenon has been found in China, where rapid SE has occurred due to the country's unprecedented urbanization process. The change value of the upper limit slope of urban land and the average slope climbing index of urban land have also experienced a volatile growth trend at global, continental, national, and city scales. Our study suggests that sustainable urban development should take the SE phenomenon into considerations, and that reasonable governance policies and strategies should be formulated to address its potential impacts.

TI  - Monitoring Crop Evapotranspiration And Crop Coefficients Over An Almond And Pistachio Orchard Throughout Remote Sensing
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2018
AB  - In California, water is a perennial concern. As competition for water resources increases due to growth in population, California's tree nut farmers are committed to improving the efficiency of water used for food production. There is an imminent need to have reliable methods that provide information about the temporal and spatial variability of crop water requirements, which allow farmers to make irrigation decisions at field scale. This study focuses on estimating the actual evapotranspiration and crop coefficients of an almond and pistachio orchard located in Central Valley (California) during an entire growing season by combining a simple crop evapotranspiration model with remote sensing data. A dataset of the vegetation index NDVI derived from Landsat-8 was used to facilitate the estimation of the basal crop coefficient (K-cb), or potential crop water use. The soil water evaporation coefficient (K-e) was measured from microlysimeters. The water stress coefficient (K-s) was derived from airborne remotely sensed canopy thermal-based methods, using seasonal regressions between the crop water stress index (CWSI) and stem water potential (Psi(stem)). These regressions were statistically-significant for both crops, indicating clear seasonal differences in pistachios, but not in almonds. In almonds, the estimated maximum K-cb values ranged between 1.05 to 0.90, while for pistachios, it ranged between 0.89 to 0.80. The model indicated a difference of 97 mm in transpiration over the season between both crops. Soil evaporation accounted for an average of 16\% and 13\% of the total actual evapotranspiration for almonds and pistachios, respectively. Verification of the model-based daily crop evapotranspiration estimates was done using eddy-covariance and surface renewal data collected in the same orchards, yielding an R-2 >= 0.7 and average root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.74 and 0.91 mm center dot day(-1) for almond and pistachio, respectively. It is concluded that the combination of crop evapotranspiration models with remotely-sensed data is helpful for upscaling irrigation information from plant to field scale and thus may be used by farmers for making day-to-day irrigation management decisions.

TI  - Near-Term Ecological Forecasting For Dynamic Aeroconservation Of Migratory Birds
JO  - Conservation Biology
PY  - 2021
AB  - Near-term ecological forecasting has the potential to mitigate negative impacts of human modifications on wildlife by directing efficient action through relevant and timely predictions. We used the U.S. avian migration system to highlight ecological forecasting applications for aeroconservation. We used millions of observations from 143 weather surveillance radars to construct and evaluate a migration forecasting system for nocturnal bird migration over the contiguous United States. We identified the number of nights of mitigation required to reduce the risk of aerial hazards to 50% of avian migrants passing a given area in spring and autumn based on dynamic forecasts of migration activity. We also investigated an alternative approach, that is, employing a fixed conservation strategy based on time windows that historically capture 50% of migratory passage. In practice, during both spring and autumn, dynamic forecasts required fewer action nights compared with fixed window selection at all locations (spring: mean of 7.3 more alert days; fall: mean of 12.8 more alert days). This pattern resulted in part from the pulsed nature of bird migration captured in the radar data, where the majority (54.3%) of birds move on 10% of a migration season's nights. Our results highlight the benefits of near-term ecological forecasting and the potential advantages of dynamic mitigation strategies over static ones, especially in the face of increasing risks to migrating birds from light pollution, wind energy infrastructure, and collisions with structures. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Drought Risk Assessment And Monitoring Of Ilocos Norte Province In The Philippines Using Satellite Remote Sensing And Meteorological Data
JO  - AGRIENGINEERING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Drought has been known to be a natural hazard reflecting geographic and climatic characteristics. Satellite technology advancements have benefited drought assessment and monitoring to formulate plans for dealing with this slow-onset disaster. However, combining satellite remote sensing (RS) and meteorological data for drought monitoring is lacking in the literature. This study uses satellite RS and meteorological-based drought indicators to assess drought risk in the Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Data analysis included the retrieval of vegetation conditions using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) were calculated to account for climatic variabilities. Results revealed that the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient decreased by -2 dB in the cropland area, indicating crop growth irregularities compared to grassland areas. These irregularities were supported by Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) strong fluctuations during the two-year observation period. A significant coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.60) between the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient and Sentinel-2 NDVI was observed for the study area. On the one hand, only KBDI significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.60) with the cropland area's RS data-derived drought indicators. These results revealed RS data variability for drought risk management but are still valuable for developing an early warning system.

TI  - Structural-Optimized Sequential Deep Learning Methods For Surface Soil Moisture Forecasting, Case Study Quebec, Canada
JO  - NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Surface soil moisture (M-SS) is a key factor governing environmental interactions in any catchment. Energy flux between soil and atmosphere, soil temperature, and heat diffusion in soil are examples of impressible interactions. Consequently, the agriculture sector and its many dependent industries are influenced by this element. Hence, investigating new optimized preprocessing and input selection methods for processing, interpretation, modeling, and prediction of M-SS is necessary to ensure sustainable agriculture. To this end, satellite products were studied for the province of Quebec, Canada. Two overall deep learning (DL) approaches are proposed in this study. The first and most efficient one is extracting meaningful modeling parameters by the time-series structural-analysis-based method, and the second one is using the combination of optimization algorithms and the DL method. The structure of the extracted time series from satellite data was assessed by several tests and an intense periodic pattern was detected. Therefore, additive Holt-Winter's (S-HW), seasonal standardization (S-std), and spectral analysis (S-A) were chosen as preprocessing methods for the structural analysis preprocessing. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model was utilized for short-term forecasting of un-preprocessed and preprocessed M-SS datasets. Along with structural-analysis-based methodology, genetic and teacher-learner-based algorithms (GA and T(L)A) were coupled with LSTM to assess the coupled models' performance for M-SS forecasting for the first time. Based on the structural analysis of data, limited hidden states (h(t)) were selected for modeling \{1, 2, 7, 9, 52\}: network training and forecasts were undertaken according to these hidden states. Since the long-term characteristics of the time series like trend and level are not significant in short-term modeling, the LSTM (S-std, 9), correlation coefficient (R) = 0.970, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.339 outperformed other models, followed closely by LSTM (S-HW, 1), R = 0.922, RMSE = 1.958. Conversely, for long-term forecast, as these attributes impact the structure, LSTM (S-HW, 2), R = 0.922, RMSE = 0.1961 was more successful in the prediction of patterns and fluctuations, followed by LSTM (S-std, 52), R = 0.920, RMSE = 2.064, which was more complicated than the model developed for short-term modeling. GA-LSTM (h(t) = 32, R = 0.930, RMSE = 1.852) and T(L)A-LSTM (h(t) = 37, R = 0.934, RMSE = 1.781) also enhanced the long-term forecasting results. Integration of these two optimization methods had two benefits. First, due to the stochastic nature of optimization algorithms and DL methods, the search space for the optimized parameter (h(t)) was greatly increased and many possibilities were investigated. Second, the LSTM could perform a long-term forecast of the M-SS without preprocessing, which was not possible by structural analysis. On the other hand, these methods were much computationally expensive and the combination of their controlling parameters with other controlling parameters of LSTM created numerous possibilities. However, as TLA is parameter free and much less sophisticated than GA, it is a more computational-effective method, and subsequently a better option than GA.

TI  - Urban Green And Blue Space Changes: A Spatiotemporal Evaluation Of Impacts On Ecosystem Service Value In Bangladesh
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
PY  - 2022
AB  - The rapid decline in urban green (UGS) and blue space (UBS) in developing countries has led to a widespread degradation of available ecosystem services (ES). However, impacts of UGS and UBS changes on ES tend to vary over space and time, and to date these impacts have not been studied in sufficient detail in emerging economies. By comparing UGS and UBS change patterns with multitemporal Landsat data recorded during the past 30 years (1991-2021), this study has examined the impact of several factors on ES in some of the world's climate hotspots. Although obtaining relevant and accurate information on ES is difficult in many parts of the developing world, this work has developed baseline data suitable for assessing ES loss over five densely populated cities in Bangladesh - Dhaka, Chattogram, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet. ES loss was quantified in monetary terms using adjusted value coefficients. The topographic and anthropogenic factors driving spatial differences in ES degradation in these cities were analyzed with a geographical detector. The results indicated that the cities experienced a combined monetary loss of USD 628.58 million as a result of specific ES degradation, primarily due to the decline of UGS and UBS. The value of ES loss was notably higher in Dhaka and Chattogram than in the other cities due to marked differences in anthropogenic activities. Population growth, extensive urban sprawl, and the development of dense road networks were identified as the major causes of urban green and blue space loss and consequent reduction of ES. The findings of this study provide important insights which can be used to support the formulation of public policies and management plans aimed at restoring and maintaining sustainable urban ecosystems.

TI  - Predicting The Geographical Distribution Of <I>Acropora Muricata</I> In Two Lesser-Known Reef Systems Of The Andaman Sea
JO  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Coral reefs are undergoing deterioration worldwide due to climate and anthropogenic stressors, notwithstanding the enormous support they provide to marine biodiversity and the essential services to humans. Knowledge about the extent of hard coral distribution is a key requirement for designing conservation strategies such as Marine Protected Areas(MPA). The transboundary island groups of the Andaman Sea-Andaman, Nicobar and Mergui Archipelagos-are largely underexplored and less managed due to their remoteness and various political constraints. In the present study, we developed a maximum entropy (Maxent) based distribution model for the stony coral Acropora muricata by using records of its occurrence and 14 remotely sensed environmental variables along with bathymetry and distance from the shore as predictors. Our model predicted this species' current distribution, with the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.908. The important predictor variables determining the distribution were bathymetry, distance from the shore, calcite, PAR, and ocean current. Many of the unexplored islands, seamounts and shallow patches of the Andaman Sea such as Cinque Island, Invisible Bank, Batti Malv Island, Tillanchong island, Narcondam, Barren island, Than, Dunkin, Cash Island, the southern tip of Zadetkyi, Bruer, Graham, Clara Island, Buda, Lord Loughborough Island, Quoin Island, Tachai, Koh Bon, Ko Payang and several other unnamed sites were predicted as potential areas of occurrence of A. muricata as per this study. The presence of this species, which is the most common hard coral in the Indo-Pacific, indicates the existence of coral reef ecosystems in these areas. Such habitats and the region's proximity towards the coral triangle imply better chances of connectivity and resilience. This study will contribute toward designing a transboundary conservation network and developing management plans to maintain sustainable fisheries.

TI  - Oceanographic Habitat Of An Endangered Mediterranean Procellariiform:: Implications For Marine Protected Areas
JO  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
PY  - 2006
AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) require ecologically meaningful designs capable of taking into account the particularities of the species under consideration, the dynamic nature of the marine environment, and the multiplicity of anthropogenic impacts. MPAs have been most often designated to protect benthic habitats and their biota. Increasingly, there is a need to account for highly mobile pelagic taxa, such as marine birds, mammals and turtles, and their oceanic habitats. For breeding seabirds foraging from a central place, particular attention should be paid to distant foraging grounds and movement corridors, which can often extend to hundreds of kilometers from breeding colonies. We assessed the habitat use by the most threatened Mediterranean seabird, the Balearic Shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus, using vessel-based surveys during the chick-rearing period (May June). We used a hierarchical modeling approach to identify those environmental variables that most accurately reflected the oceanographic habitat of this species by (1) delineating its foraging range using presence/absence data and (2) identifying important foraging grounds where it concentrates in dense aggregations. The foraging range comprised the frontal systems along the eastern Iberian continental shelf waters (depth < 200 m) and areas close to the breeding colonies in the Balearic Islands. Shearwater's aggregated in productive shelf areas with elevated chlorophyll a concentrations. Following the model of a core-buffer MPA, we envisioned those areas of dense aggregation (i.e., the area of influence of the Ebro River discharge and Cape La Nao regions) as the core regions deserving elevated protection and more stringent management. More diffuse protective measures would be applied within the larger buffer region, delineated by the foraging range of the species. Marine zoning measures can greatly benefit the conservation of the Balearic Shearwater and other far-ranging seabirds by extending protective measures beyond their breeding colonies during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons.

TI  - Flash-Flood Hazard Susceptibility Mapping In Kangsabati River Basin, India
JO  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
PY  - 2022
AB  - Flood-susceptibility mapping is an important component of flood risk management to control the effects of natural hazards and prevention of injury. We used a remote-sensing and geographic information system (GIS) platform and a machine-learning model to develop a flood susceptibility map of Kangsabati River Basin, India where flash flood is common due to monsoon precipitation with short duration and high intensity. And in this subtropical region, climate change's impact helps to influence the distribution of rainfall and temperature variation. We tested three models-particle swarm optimization (PSO), an artificial neural network (ANN), and a deep-leaning neural network (DLNN)-and prepared a final flood susceptibility map to classify flood-prone regions in the study area. Environmental, topographical, hydrological, and geological conditions were included in the models, and the final model was selected based on the relations between potentiality of causative factors and flood risk based on multi-collinearity analysis. The model results were validated and evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), which is an indicator of the current state of the environment and a value >0.95 implies a greater risk of flash floods. The AUC values for ANN, DLNN, and PSO for training datasets were 0.914, 0.920, and 0.942, respectively. Among these three models, PSO showed the best performance with an AUC value of 0.942. The PSO approach is applicable for flood susceptibility mapping of the eastern part of India, a subtropical region, to allow flood mitigation and help to improve risk management in this region.

In this study, we used remote sensing techniques and a geographical information system to extract the land cover categories based on the Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) technique from Landsat TM/ETM/OLI satellite images in the transboundary Karnali River Basin (KRB, China and Nepal) of central Himalayas from 2000 to 2017. Spatio-temporal integrated methodology-Tupu was used to spatially show the LUCC as well as spatial characteristics of the arisen Tupu and shrunken Tupu. In addition, the ecosystem services value (ESV) were obtained and analyzed for each land cover category. In 2017, forest covered the highest area (33.45%) followed by bare area (30.3%), shrub/grassland (18.49%), agriculture (13.12%), snow/ice (4.32%), waterbody (0.3%) and built-up area (0.04%) in the KRB. From 2000 to 2017, the areas of forest, waterbody and snow/ice have decreased by 0.59, 6.14, and 1072.1 km2, respectively. Meanwhile, the areas of shrub/grassland, agriculture, barren land, and built-up categories have increased by 82.21, 1.44, 991.97, and 3.11 km2, respectively. These changes in the land cover have led to an increase in the ESV of the basin, especially the increase in shrub/grassland, agriculture, and water bodies (in the higher elevation). The total ESV of the basin was increased by $1.59 × 106 from 2000 to 2017. Anthropogenic factors together with natural phenomena drive LUCC in the basin and thus the ESV. The findings of this study could facilitate the basin-level policy formulation to guide future conservation and development management interventions. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment Of The Impact Of Typhoon Disturbance On A Japanese Forest Using Satellite Laser Altimetry
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can accurately observe forest parameters, such as canopy height and forest biomass. In this study, we investigated the potential of spaceborne LiDAR to quantify the effects of forest disturbances caused by typhoons on Hokkaido Island, Japan, after typhoon Songda in 2004. We developed a model to estimate canopy height from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) of the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite. GLAS waveforms are broadened by slopes ("pulse broadening"), so we used the lead10 and trail10 values (edge extents referring to 10% and 90% of the cumulative energy returned) to correct for this effect, because they were the parameters most strongly correlated with pulse broadening. We developed the estimation model by dividing GLAS data between gentle and steep slopes, using an empirically determined threshold, and obtained a root-mean-square error of 3.5. m for canopy height. We then applied the model to GLAS data in the area damaged by typhoon Songda to estimate changes in canopy height caused by the typhoon. We used a wind damage map produced in a previous study to identify the damage severity. The model showed that canopy height decreased by an average of 2.7. ±. 1.8. m (95% confidence interval) in heavily damaged areas. The canopy height decreased most in coniferous forests, and especially in Japanese larch forests, that they have very shallow roots. We also assessed the geographic factors that most strongly influenced wind damage risk by means of multivariate analysis. We found serious damage in areas with a gentle slope that sustained strong winds. Understory plants and topography type also affected the risk. Our results show that spaceborne LiDAR can be used to quantify the severity of wind damage caused by forest disturbances, thereby providing guidance for forest management. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Research On Classification Method Of Medium Resolution Remote Sensing Image Based On Machine Learning
JO  - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)
PY  - 2021
AB  - Surface information extraction is an important link in geographic situation monitoring and environmental protection and plays an important role in the global sustainable development strategy. In this paper, the resolution remote sensing image in Landsat8 OLI was selected as the main data source. Aiming at the problem of the lack of classified sample data, the global land cover data in 2015 and 2017 were optimized and treated as the prior knowledge of classification. The maximum likelihood method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) Machine learning methods, as well as deep learning methods based on VGGNET-16 and RESNET-18 models, were used to compare and study surface information extraction methods in the Yellow River Delta region. The results show that the above method is highly feasible. Based on the feature optimization, the overall classification accuracy of RF and SVM models in the machine learning method is high, and the classification accuracy of RF and SVM models is up to 87.3% and 86%. In the deep learning algorithm, the classification accuracy of VGGNET-16 and RESNET-18 models is greatly improved compared with the machine learning method. The classification accuracy of RESNET-18 is up to 94.1%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.91. The research method in this paper has good applicability and popularization value in the classification of medium resolution remote sensing objects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Acacia Decurrens Tree Plantations Brought Land Use Land Cover Change In Northwestern Of Ethiopia
JO  - SN Applied Sciences
PY  - 2023
AB  - Tree plantation-based land use in Ethiopia is a crucial sustainable approach to improving community income and reducing soil resource degradation in highland areas. The study aimed to evaluate land use and cover change and examine factors driving community transition from crop agriculture to tree plantation in Fagita Lekoma district. Landsat 1986, 2002 and 2020 images were used to generate the land use maps by using the maximum likelihood algorithm of supervised classification. This study utilized field observations, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews as crucial data collection tools for socioeconomic analysis. The change detection results show that cultivated land, grassland, and wetlands are significantly declining by 22.6, 20.1, and 63%, respectively. On the contrary, forestland and settlement areas are increasing by 210 and 1,665%, respectively. Forest cover was increased by 210% in the district’s study year, with the highest conversion rate of 15.1% from cultivated land to forest land in the overall study period. As a result, Acacia decurrens forestation is the main cause of the change of use from arable land to forest land systems. This tree plantation-based land use is also the main driving force behind shifting crop farming to tree plantation-based livelihoods because it increases economic benefits and employment opportunities, reduces soil erosion, and increases soil productivity in the area. To limit the negative consequences and raise the beneficial effects of tree plantations, systematic management of tree-based land use systems, integrated advanced land resource management, and increased economic and environmental benefits are suggested for the district. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - Mapping <I>Opuntia Stricta</I> In The Arid And Semi-Arid Environment Of Kenya Using Sentinel-2 Imagery And Ensemble Machine Learning Classifiers
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Globally, grassland biomes form one of the largest terrestrial covers and present critical social-ecological benefits. In Kenya, Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASAL) occupy 80\% of the landscape and are critical for the livelihoods of millions of pastoralists. However, they have been invaded by Invasive Plant Species (IPS) thereby compromising their ecosystem functionality. Opuntia stricta, a well-known IPS, has invaded the ASAL in Kenya and poses a threat to pastoralism, leading to livestock mortality and land degradation. Thus, identification and detailed estimation of its cover is essential for drawing an effective management strategy. The study aimed at utilizing the Sentinel-2 multispectral sensor to detect Opuntia stricta in a heterogeneous ASAL in Laikipia County, using ensemble machine learning classifiers. To illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2, the detection of Opuntia stricta was based on only the spectral bands as well as in combination with vegetation and topographic indices using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the abundance. Study results showed that the overall accuracies of Sentinel 2 spectral bands were 80\% and 84.4\%, while that of combined spectral bands, vegetation, and topographic indices was 89.2\% and 92.4\% for XGBoost and RF classifiers, respectively. The inclusion of topographic indices that enhance characterization of biological processes, and vegetation indices that minimize the influence of soil and the effects of atmosphere, contributed by improving the accuracy of the classification. Qualitatively, Opuntia stricta spatially was found along river banks, flood plains, and near settlements but limited in forested areas. Our results demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors to effectively detect and map Opuntia stricta in a complex heterogeneous ASAL, which can support conservation and rangeland management policies that aim to map and list threatened areas, and conserve the biodiversity and productivity of rangeland ecosystems.

TI  - Long-Term Exposure And Health Risk Assessment From Air Pollution: Impact Of Regional Scale Mobility
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - BackgroundThe negative effect of air pollution on human health is widely reported in recent literature. It typically involves urbanized areas where the population is concentrated and where most primary air pollutants are produced. A comprehensive health risk assessment is therefore of strategic importance for health authorities.MethodsIn this study we propose a methodology to perform an indirect and retrospective health risk assessment of all-cause mortality associated with long-term exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) in a typical Monday to Friday working week. A combination of satellite-based settlement data, model-based air pollution data, land use, demographics and regional scale mobility, allowed to examine the effect of population mobility and pollutants daily variations on the health risk. A Health Risk Increase (HRI) metric was derived on the basis of three components: hazard, exposure and vulnerability, utilizing the relative risk values from the World Health Organization. An additional metric, the Health Burden (HB) was formulated, which accounts for the total number of people exposed to a certain risk level.ResultsThe effect of regional mobility patterns on the HRI metric was assessed, resulting in an increased HRI associated with all three stressors when considering a dynamic population compared to a static one. The effect of diurnal variation of pollutants was only observed for NO2 and O-3. For both, the HRI metric resulted in significantly higher values during night. Concerning the HB parameter, we identified the commuting flows of the population as the main driver in the resulting metric.ConclusionsThis indirect exposure assessment methodology provides tools to support policy makers and health authorities in planning intervention and mitigation measures. The study was carried out in Lombardy, Italy, one of the most polluted regions in Europe, but the incorporation of satellite data makes our approach valuable for studying global health.

TI  - Estimating Grizzly Bear Distribution And Abundance Relative To Habitat And Human Influence
JO  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2004
AB  - Understanding factors that influence and predict grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) distribution and abundance is fundamental to their conservation. In southeast British Columbia, Canada, we applied DNA hair-trap sampling (1) to evaluate relationships of grizzly bear detections with landscape variables of habitat and human activity, and (2) to model the spatial distribution and abundance of grizzly bears. During 1996-1998, we sampled grizzly bear occurrence across 5,496 km(2) at sites distributed according to grid cells. We compared 244 combinations of sampling sites and sessions where grizzly bears were detected (determined by nDNA analyses) to 845 site-sessions where they were not. We tested for differences in 30 terrain, vegetation, land cover, and human influence variables at 3 spatial scales. Grizzly bears more often were detected in landscapes of relatively high elevation, steep slope, rugged terrain, and low human access and linear disturbance densities. These landscapes also were comprised of more avalanche chutes, alpine tundra, barren surfaces, burned forests, and less young and logged forests. Relationships with forest productivity and some overstory species were positive at broader scales, while associations with forest overstory and productivity were negative at the finest scale. At the finest scale, the strong negative association with very young, logged forests and with increasing values of the Landsat-derived green vegetation index became positive when analyzed in a multivariate context. For multivariate analyses, we considered 2 variables together with 11 principal components that describe ecological gradients among 4 variable groupings. We applied multiple logistic regression and used AIC to rank and weight competing subset models. We derived coefficients for interpretation and prediction using multi-model inference. The resulting function was highly predictive, which we confirmed against an independent dataset. We transformed the output using a multi-annual population estimate for the sampling area, and we applied the resulting grizzly bear density and distribution model across our greater study area as a strategic-level planning tool. We discuss conservation applications and design considerations of this DNA-based approach for grizzly bears and other forest-dwelling species.

TI  - Assessing Impact Of Forest Landscape Dynamics On Migratory Corridors: A Case Study Of Two Protected Areas In Himalayan Foothills
JO  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
PY  - 2011
AB  - Contiguity of protected areas (PAs) is a critical factor to promote well being of the native flora, fauna and life support system to humans. Such contiguity cannot be guaranteed without providing a path or 'a corridor' through forested landscapes that includes natural land cover and undisturbed patches. Incidentally, the Himalayan foothills have greater pressure on these landscapes due to high human dependence for livelihood. This pressure is expected to increase in the coming years altering the potential corridors between PAs. The PA managers need flexible processing, modeling and decision tools to propose a range of acceptable corridors between the PAs and ensure their sustainable health. Such flexible tools can be utilized in future to modify for taking decision to conserve the patches connecting patches and adapt as per changing landscapes. This article describes utility of geospatial modeling tools to assess the status of corridors in light of changing landscapes between Rajaji and Jim Corbett National Park, the two most important PAs in the Himalayan foothills. The work has been carried out in four stages, first-using satellite data land use land cover (LULC) maps were prepared for year 1990, 2000 and 2005, second-Land Change Modeler (LCM) was used for LULC change analysis, third-Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) was used to predict the status of LULC for 2015 and 2020, and fourth-using temporal morphology of the areas behaving both as barrier and easiness, friction surface cost was calculated to identify least cost pathways (LCPs)/migratory corridors between the PAs. The LULC maps for 1990, 2000 and 2005 were evaluated using accuracy assessment (80\%) and Khat statistics (> 0.79). The change prediction model was validated by comparing actual LULC of 2005 with predicted LULC of 2005 and the agreement was 71\%. The LCP has shifted with the predicted change in the classes. The corridor has shifted by 0.5-3 km towards the south and has come closer to the agriculture fields and river channels.

TI  - Rice Plant-Hopper Infestation Detection And Classification Algorithms Based On Fractal Dimension Values And Fuzzy C-Means
JO  - Mathematical and Computer Modelling
PY  - 2013
AB  - Rice plant-hopper (RPH) (Nilaparvata lugens, Sogatella furcifera, and Laodelphax striatellus) infestation is considered one of the most serious disasters in rice production in Asia. In order to use visible images to detect stress in rice production caused by RPH infestation, an algorithm based on fractal eigenvalues and fuzzy C-means (FCM) has been developed. First, an experiment was designed and many visible images of rice stems were collected. Based on the pretreatment of these visible images, such as smoothing, denoising, image color space and frequency domain transformation, the relative image fractal eigenvalues were extracted by using a box-counting dimension method, and then the linear regression model and FCM clustering algorithm were developed. Results showed that it is possible to distinguish RPH gathering areas and mouldy gray spots after RPH damage on rice plant stems from healthy rice plant stems using fractal-dimension values. Most of the fractal eigenvalues based on different-sized subregional image blocks have higher correlation coefficient with the RPH quantity, and the Dskewness (skewness), Dmean (mean) and Dmoment (moment), (where Dj is the fractal-dimension value of the j-th subregional image block), based on a 16 × 16 pixel subregional image block, have higher correlation coefficients: 0.803, 0.794, and 0.799 respectively. Using RPH infestation detection and classification based on fractal eigenvalues and the FCM algorithm, the accuracy to differentiate cases in which RPH infestation had occurred or not reached 87%. The accuracy to differentiate four groups was 63.5%. The result is expected to meet the needs of actual rice production: along with the use of a micro-sensor mobile monitoring platform, the visible-image-based method based on fractal eigenvalues and the FCM algorithm can be used to obtain redundancy information for the large area of remote sensing to the stress induced by RPHs, and then to improve the monitoring accuracy in fusion decisions of integrated pest management. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry For Pettimudi (India) Landslide Monitoring Using Sentinel-1a Images
JO  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - The continuous monitoring of land surface movement over time is of paramount importance for assessing landslide triggering factors and mitigating landslide hazards. This research focuses on measuring horizontal and vertical surface displacement due to a devastating landslide event in the west-facing slope of the Rajamala Hills, induced by intense rainfall. The landslide occurred in Pettimudi, a tea-plantation village of the Idukki district in Kerala, India, on August 6-7, 2020. The persistent-scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR) technique, along with the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS), was applied to investigate the land surface movement over time. A stack of 20 Sentinel-1A single-look complex images (19 interfero-grams) acquired in descending passes was used for PSInSAR processing. The line-of-sight (LOS) displacement in long time series, and hence the average LOS velocity, was measured at each measurement-point location. The mean LOS velocity was decomposed into horizontal east-west (EW) and vertical up-down velocity components. The results show that the mean LOS, EW, and up-down velocities in the study area, respectively, range from -18.76 to +11.88, -10.95 to +6.93, and -15.05 to +9.53 mm/y, and the LOS displacement ranges from -19.60 to +19.59 mm. The displacement values clearly indicate the instability of the terrain. The time-series LOS displacement trends derived from the applied PSInSAR technique are very useful for providing valuable inputs for disaster management and the development of disaster early-warning systems for the benefit of local residents.

TI  - Subsea Raw Seawater Injection System - A World First
JO  - SPE Offshore Europe Conference Proceedings
PY  - 2007
AB  - Canadian Natural Resources International (CNR) recognises, for the Columba E development, the benefits of using state of the art subsea technology to enhance production by means of optimising raw seawater. The application of raw sea water injection offers an alternative to conventional topside water injection, minimising many recognised perceived topside challenges; such as topside weight and space constraints, availability of purified water, pipeline transportation from the platform to the satellite and the associated infrastructure installation and commissioning. Subsea raw sea water injection has been developed over the last decade by Framo Engineering using the proven methods within their subsea pumping technology. Whilst a new application, subsea pumping technology is in operation across a number of fields world-wide with proven reliability and runtimes in excess of 700,000 hours. Extensive testing of key elements of the system further enhanced the confidence in the robustness and reliability of the complete system package. The system package included a Pump Control Module topside, umbilical and the Framo Dual Pump Station. This system approach ensured that there were minimal external interfaces and the technology resided as the responsibility on a single supplier. This built confidence for CNR to commit to the world's first raw seawater injection system and that such a project could be delivered in an appropriate manner. Subsea raw seawater injection offered a viable solution, adding significant injection capacity, with a significantly reduced impact to existing production facilities. In addition, the possibility to recover and re-deploy the system later in field life, either on the same development or in another area adjacent to the host adds further to the attraction to the system.

TI  - A Participatory Science Approach To Expanding Instream Infrastructure Inventories
JO  - Earth's Future
PY  - 2020
AB  - Over the past decade, remote sensing data have improved in resolution and become more widely available, bringing new opportunities for its use in environmental science and conservation. One potential application is to identify and map instream infrastructure across the world, with important implications for fisheries, hydrology, flooding, and more. To date, databases of instream infrastructure focus on larger dams with reservoirs that are comparatively easy to detect with remotely sensed imagery. Despite their impact on freshwater ecosystems, smaller infrastructure is often overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we require more systematic approaches, such as the Global River Obstruction Database (GROD) presented here, to map instream infrastructure. We present a participatory approach to identify, map, and validate infrastructure and provide an initial data set for the contiguous United States (n = 4,197). We highlight the value of participatory methods that include the public and suggest ways they could be fused with machine learning for future applications. ©2020 The Authors.

TI  - Predicting The Potential Impact Of Climate Change On Carbon Stock In Semi-Arid West African Savannas
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2018
AB  - West African savannas are experiencing rapid land cover change that threatens biodiversity and affects ecosystem productivity through the loss of habitat and biomass, and carbon emissions into the atmosphere exacerbating climate change effects. Therefore, reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in these areas is critical in the efforts to combat climate change. For such restorative actions to be successful, they must be grounded on a clear knowledge of the extent to which climate change affects carbon storage in soil and biomass according to different land uses. The current study was undertaken in semi-arid savannas in Dano, southwestern Burkina Faso, with the threefold objective of: (i) identifying the main land use and land cover categories (LULCc) in a watershed; (ii) assessing the carbon stocks (biomass and soil) in the selected LULCc; and (iii) predicting the effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of the carbon stock. Dendrometric data (Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and height) of woody species and soil samples were measured and collected, respectively, in 43 plots, each measuring 50 x 20 m. Tree biomass carbon stocks were calculated using allometric equations while soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were measured at two depths (0-20 and 20-50 cm). To assess the impact of climate change on carbon stocks, geographical location records of carbon stocks, remote sensing spectral bands, topographic data, and bioclimatic variables were used. For projections of future climatic conditions, predictions from two climate models (MPI-ESM-MR and HadGEM2-ES) of CMIP5 were used under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and modeling was performed using random forest regression. Results showed that the most dominant LULCc are cropland (37.2\%) and tree savannas (35.51\%). Carbon stocks in woody biomass were higher in woodland (10.2 +/- 6.4 Mg.ha(-1)) and gallery forests (7.75 +/- 4.05 Mg.ha(-1)), while the lowest values were recorded in shrub savannas (0.9 +/- 1.2 Mg.ha(-1)) and tree savannas (1.6 0.6 +/- Mg.ha(-1)). The highest SOC stock was recorded in gallery forests (30.2 +/- 15.6 Mg.ha(-1)) and the lowest in the cropland (14.9 +/- 5.7 Mg.ha(-1)). Based on modeling results, it appears clearly that climate change might have an impact on carbon stock at horizon 2070 by decreasing the storage capacity of various land units which are currently suitable. The decrease was more important under HadGEM2-ES (90.0\%) and less under MPI-ESM-MR (89.4\%). These findings call for smart and sustainable land use management practices in the study area to unlock the potential of these landscapes to sequestering carbon.

TI  - Assessing Hurricane-Induced Tree Mortality In U.s. Gulf Coast Forest Ecosystems
JO  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences
PY  - 2010
AB  - Tropical cyclones disturb forest ecosystems and have the potential to alter forest structure and species composition as well as ecosystem functions including rates of nutrient cycling and biomass accumulation. Quantifying these forest disturbances is necessary to evaluate the extent and severity of damage for estimating biomass loss, developing regional carbon budgets, and making management decisions following hurricanes. In this study, we quantified forest disturbance (downed and dead and snapped trees) produced by hurricanes using a relationship between field-measured tree mortality and Landsat data that can be broadly applied to Gulf Coast forest ecosystems impacted by hurricanes. Field-measured tree mortality data was collected in Gulf Coast forests at 60 inventory plots established to monitor forest disturbance produced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit the region in 2005, and Hurricane Gustav, which hit the region in 2008. Large-scale disturbance estimates were obtained by regressing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data that in turn were associated with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from the U.S. Forest Service. The use of the general relationship produced a biomass loss from dead trees of 43.9 ± 8.4 Tg C for Hurricane Katrina and 37.9 ± 6.4 Tg C for Hurricane Rita, which are near the upper limit of the expected values reported in our previous studies across a number of different forest types. Our results provide an important contribution for reliable assessments of large-scale disturbance produced by hurricanes in forest ecosystems. Improving our ability to accurately assess the impacts of hurricanes on forests and on terrestrial carbon cycles is particularly important given that climate projections suggest that hurricane intensity is likely to increase.

TI  - Systematic Monitoring Of Heathy Woodlands In A Mediterranean Climate - A Practical Assessment Of Methods
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2013
AB  - Practical and useful vegetation monitoring methods are needed, and data compatibility and validation of remotely sensed data are desirable. Methods have not been adequately tested for heathy woodlands. We tested the feasibility of detecting species composition shifts in remnant woodland in South Australia, comparing historical (1986) plot data with temporal replicates (2010). We compared the uniformity of species composition among spatially scattered versus spatially clustered plots. At two sites, we compared visual and point-intercept estimation of cover and species diversity. Species composition (presence/absence) shifted between 1986 and 2010. Species that significantly shifted in frequency had low cover. Observations of decreasing species were consistent with predictions from temperature response curves (generalised additive models) for climate change over the period. However, long-term trends could not be distinguished from medium-term dynamics or short-term changes in visibility from this dataset. Difficulties were highlighted in assessing compositional change using historical baselines established for a different purpose in terms of spatial sampling and accuracy of replicate plots, differences in standard plot methods and verification of species identifications. Spatially clustered replicate plots were more similar in species composition than spatially scattered plots, improving change detection potential but decreasing area of inference. Visual surveys detected more species than point-intercepts. Visual cover estimates differed little from point-intercepts although underestimating cover in some instances relative to intercepts. Point-intercepts provide more precise cover estimates of dominant species but took longer and were difficult in steep, heathy terrain. A decision tree based on costs and benefits is presented assessing monitoring options based on data presented. The appropriate method is a function of available resources, the need for precise cover estimates versus adequate species detection, replication and practical considerations such as access and terrain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Exploring The Relationships Between Tree Canopy Cover And Socioeconomic Characteristics In Tropical Urban Systems: The Case Of Santo Domingo, Dominican
JO  - URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding the distribution of urban tree canopy cover and its relationship with socioeconomic characteristics is critical for informing urban planning and ecological research. However, most knowledge on this topic comes from studies in high-income countries (e.g., North America), and thus, little is known for other cultural, ecological, and political contexts. Here, we derived a high-spatial resolution (1.2 m) land-use/land-cover map for the tropical city of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and examined how socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., population density, socioeconomic status, detached homes, homeownership, and householder's age) relate to residential tree canopy cover at the neighborhood scale. We found that previous theory developed in North American cities applied only partially to Santo Domingo. Of the five socioeconomic variables examined, only two showed relationships with tree canopy consistent with previous findings from North American cities. In particular, socioeconomic status, one of the better-studied correlates of urban tree canopy, was not positively associated with tree canopy cover. At the same time, our new land-use/land-cover map revealed the presence of important areas with low levels of tree canopy cover, which may require additional attention by city planners. Our study reinforces the value of high-spatial resolution satellite data for examining urban areas, and highlights the need for further understanding the characteristics related to the distribution of tree canopy cover outside North America.

TI  - A Geospatial Study Of The Drought Impact On Surface Water Reservoirs: Study Cases From Texas, Usa
JO  - GISCIENCE \& REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2019
AB  - Satellite images have been used historically to measure and monitor fluctuations in the surface water reservoirs. This study integrates remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to investigate the impact of drought on 10 selected surface water reservoirs in San Angelo and Dallas, Texas. Oscillations in summer and winter months throughout the 2005-2016 period were assessed using multispectral images from Landsat-5, -7, and -8, and changes in the reservoirs were characterized and correlated against local climate data of each reservoir. For quantitative comparisons of the time-series measurements, a robust density slicing approach was employed to classify the range of values of the raster cells in the near-infrared band of Landsat images for each lake into three desired classes (deep water, shallow water, and dry area) based on the natural breaks inherent in the dataset. Statistical analysis shows that the overall accuracy of the classification is about 94\%, which demonstrates the efficiency of the density slicer to accurately estimate surface water area changes from an individual Landsat band. Shrinkage in the surface water area over the study period reveals the concrete impact that the drought along with other factors have on the 10 selected lakes. The San Angelo lakes located in west central Texas experienced a nearly consistent pattern of change during most of the study period; whereas the Dallas lakes in northeast Texas followed the oscillating pattern of drought and correlated closely to the local conditions. Shockingly, the extreme drought caused complete vanishing of several lakes, and consequently Texas had to remove them from its recreational plans. Our new findings can certainly help with the water resource management in Texas and our study approach can be adapted for monitoring lake oscillations in other areas across the world. This geospatial study demonstrates the societal benefits from incorporating remote sensing and GIS in investigating geo-environmental problems associated with severe climate changes.

TI  - Hydrogen Isotopes As A Sentinel Of Biological Invasion By The Japanese Beetle, Popillia Japonica (Newman)
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2016
AB  - Invasive species alter ecosystems, threaten native and endangered species, and have negative economic impacts. Knowing where invading individuals are from and when they arrive to a new site can guide management. Here, we evaluated how well the stable hydrogen isotope composition (δ2H) records the recent origin and time since arrival of specimens of the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica Newman) captured near the Portland International Airport (Oregon, U.S.A.). The δ2H of Japanese beetle specimens collected from sites across the contiguous U.S.A. reflected the δ2H of local precipitation, a relationship similar to that documented for other organisms, and one confirming the utility of δ2H as a geographic fingerprint. Within weeks after experimental relocation to a new isotopic environment, the δ2H of beetles changed linearly with time, demonstrating the potential for δ2H to also mark the timing of arrival to a new location. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the recent geographical origin and timing of arrival of each specimen based on its δ2H value. The geographic resolution was broad, with values consistent with multiple regions of origin in the eastern U.S.A., slightly favoring the southeastern U.S.A. as the more likely source. Beetles trapped from 2007-2010 had arrived 30 or more days prior to trapping, whereas the median time since arrival declined to 3-7 days for beetles trapped from 2012- 2014. This reduction in the time between arrival and trapping at the Portland International Airport supports the efficacy of trapping and spraying to prevent establishment. More generally, our analysis shows how stable isotopes can serve as sentinels of biological invasions, verifying the efficacy of control measures, or, alternatively, indicating when those measures show signs of failure. ©2016 Hungate et al.

TI  - Shoreline Mapping From Coarse-Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Of Seberang Takir, Malaysia
JO  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
PY  - 2007
AB  - The coastal zone is under considerable pressure from development and is subject to change. Consequently, shoreline monitoring has grown in importance. Remotely sensed imagery from satellite sensors has been used as an alternative to conventional methods, such as those based on the interpretation of aerial photography and ground-based surveying, for monitoring shoreline position. However, the accuracy of shoreline mapping from satellite sensor imagery has been limited because of the relatively coarse spatial resolution (>10 m) of the sensors commonly used. Because of major practical and financial constraints, very fine spatial resolution (<5 m) data are often impractical for mapping large stretches of shoreline, so refinement of image analysis methods are needed to extract the desired subpixel-scale information from relatively coarse spatial resolution imagery. In this paper, the potential to map the shoreline at a subpixel scale from a soft classification of relatively coarse spatial resolution satellite sensor imagery was evaluated. Unlike conventional approaches, the methods used allowed the shoreline to be mapped within image pixels and have the potential to yield an accurate and realistic prediction of shoreline location. The approach involved the use of a soft image classification to estimate the subpixel-scale thematic composition of image pixels, which were then located geographically through postclassification analysis. Specifically, a contouring and geostatistical method based on a two-point histogram was used to position geographically the shoreline within image pixels. The approach was applied to differently shaped shoreline extracts in imagery at two spatial resolutions. The most accurate prediction of the shoreline position from images with 16- and 32-m spatial resolutions were typically for a simple linear stretch of coast for which the smallest root mean square error values were <= 1.20 m. The shoreline predictions satisfied the map accuracy standards specified for large-scale maps.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation Between Remote Sensor And In Situ Data For Predicting The Trophic State Index From Chlorophyll “A”
JO  - Revista Brasileira de Geografia Fisica
PY  - 2023
AB  - Contamination or water pollution generates several phenomena, one of which is eutrophication. As a result, with the aim of sustainable management of water resources, the Trophic State Index was developed to enable the classification of water resources in different degrees of trophicity, with remote sensing being one of the tools capable of determining such an index. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the trophic levels obtained through remote sensing analyzes with limnological analyzes of Sample of chlorophyll “a” in the laboratory. This research consists of three stages of analysis, first a water sample will be collected along seven points in the bay of Portel-PA, which in turn will be laboratory results, then the collection and treatment of satellite images will be carried out. for the prediction of chlorophyll “a”, and then the qualitative comparison of the values obtained with the previous steps through the IET. The application of the methodology allowed observing that at all points the TSI values verified by remote sensing are close to the analysis carried out in the laboratory, with the predominant classification among the points being mesotrophic. Therefore, spatial analyzes such as this one, demonstrate the importance of remote sensing as a tool for identifying the areas of occurrence of chlorophyll“a”, however, as remote sensing techniques used in this work, they were not able to replace field work. They only allowed a more efficient remote planning and monitoring of the actions to be carried out in the final stage. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping Outburst Floods Using A Collaborative Learning Method Based On Temporally Dense Optical And Sar Data: A Case Study With The Baige Landslide Dam On The Jinsha River, Tibet
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Outburst floods resulting from giant landslide dams can cause devastating damage to hundreds or thousands of kilometres of a river. Accurate and timely delineation of flood inundated areas is essential for disaster assessment and mitigation. There have been significant advances in flood mapping using remote sensing images in recent years, but little attention has been devoted to outburst flood mapping. The short‐duration nature of these events and observation constraints from cloud cover have significantly challenged outburst flood mapping. This study used the outburst flood of the Baige landslide dam on the Jinsha River on 3 November 2018 as an example to propose a new flood mapping method that combines optical images from Sentinel‐2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel‐1 and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). First, in the cloud‐free region, a comparison of four spectral indexes calculated from time series of Sentinel‐2 images indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation flooded area. Subsequently, in the cloud‐covered region, an analysis of dualpolarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel‐1 SAR data were found an apparent response to ground roughness’s changes caused by the flood. We carried out the flood range prediction model based on the random forest algorithm. Training samples consisted of 13 feature vectors obtained from the Hue‐Saturation‐Value color space, backscattering coefficient differences/ratio, DEM data, and a label set from the flood range prepared from Sentinel‐2 images. Finally, a field investigation and confusion matrix tested the prediction accuracy of the end‐of‐flood map. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 92.3%, 0.89 respectively. The full extent of the outburst floods was successfully obtained within five days of its occurrence. The multi‐source data merging framework and the massive sample preparation method with SAR images proposed in this paper, provide a practical demonstration for similar machine learning applications using remote sensing. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Spatial Prediction And Mapping Of Water Quality Of Owabi Reservoir From Satellite Imageries And Machine Learning Models
JO  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Estimation and mapping of surface water quality are vital for the planning and sustainable management of inland reservoirs. The study aimed at retrieving and mapping water quality parameters (WQPs) of Owabi Dam reservoir from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat 8 (L8) satellite data, using random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. Water samples from 45 systematic plots were analysed for pH, turbidity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen. The performances of all three models were compared in terms of adjusted coefficient of determination (R-2.adj), and the root mean square error (RMSE) using repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure. To determine the status of water quality, pixel-level predictions were used to compute model-assisted estimates of WQPs and compared with reference values from the World Health Organization. Generally, all three models produced more accurate results for S2 compared to L8. On average, the inter-sensor relative efficiency showed that S2 outperformed L8 by 67\% in retrieving WQPs of the Owabi Dam reservoir. S2 gave the highest accuracy for RF (R-2.adj = 95-99\%, RMSE = 0.02-3.03) and least for MLR (R-2.adj = 55-9 1\%, RMSE = 0.03-3.14). Compared to RF, SVM showed similar results for S2 but with slightly higher RMSEs (0.03-3.99). The estimated pH (7.06), total dissolved solids (39.19 mg/L) and alkalinity (179.60 mg/L) were within acceptable limits, except for turbidity (33.49 mg/L) which exceeded the reference thresholds. The S2 and RF models are recommended for the monitoring of surface water quality of the Owabi Dam reservoir. (c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Classification Of Typha-Dominated Wetlands Using Airborne Hyperspectral Imagery Along Lake Ontario, Usa
JO  - Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management
PY  - 2021
AB  - Shoreline wetlands along Lake Ontario are valuable, multi-functional resources that have historically provided large numbers of important ecosystem goods and services. However, alterations to the lake's natural hydrologic regime have impacted traditional meadow marsh in the wetlands, resulting in competition and colonization by dense and aggressive Typha angustifolia and Typha x glauca (Cattails). The shift to a Typha-dominated landscape resulted in an array of negative impacts, including increased Typha density, substantial decreases in plant species richness and diversity, and altered habitat and changes in associated ecosystem services. Successful long-term adaptive management of these wetland resources requires timely and accurate monitoring. Historically, wetland landscapes have been surveyed and mapped using field-based surveys and/or photointerpretation. However, given their resource- and cost-intensive nature, these methods are often prohibitively time- and labor-consuming or geographically limited. Other remote sensing applications can provide more rapid and efficient assessments when evaluating wetland change trajectories or analyzing direct and indirect impacts across larger spatial and temporal scales. The primary goal of this study was to develop and describe methodology using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Coastal Mapping Program hyperspectral imagery, light detection and ranging data, and high-spatial resolution true-color imagery to provide updated wetland classifications for Lake Ontario coastal wetlands. This study used existing field-collected vegetation survey data (Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program), ancillary imagery, and existing classification information as training data for a supervised classification approach. These data were used along with a generalized wetland schema (classes based on physical and biological gradients: elevation, Typha, meadow marsh, mixed emergent, upland vegetation) to generate wetland classification data with Kappa values near 0.85. Ultimately, these data and methods provide helpful knowledge elements that will allow for more efficient inventorying and monitoring of Great Lake resources, forecasting of resource condition and stability, and adaptive management strategies.

TI  - Integrated Approach For Prioritizing Watersheds For Management: A Study Of Lidder Catchment Of Kashmir Himalayas
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2014
AB  - The Himalayan watersheds are susceptible to various forms of degradation due to their sensitive and fragile ecological disposition coupled with increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Owing to the paucity of appropriate technology and financial resources, the prioritization of watersheds has become an inevitable process for effective planning and management of natural resources. Lidder catchment constitutes a segment of the western Himalayas with an area of 1,159.38 km(2). The study is based on integrated analysis of remote sensing, geographic information system, field study, and socioeconomic data. Multicriteria evaluation of geophysical, land-use and land-cover (LULC) change, and socioeconomic indicators is carried out to prioritize watersheds for natural resource conservation and management. Knowledge-based weights and ranks are normalized, and weighted linear combination technique is adopted to determine final priority value. The watersheds are classified into four priority zones (very high priority, high priority, medium priority, and low priority) on the basis of quartiles of the priority value, thus indicating their ecological status in terms of degradation caused by anthropogenic disturbances. The correlation between priority ranks of individual indicators and integrated indicators is drawn. The results reveal that socioeconomic indicators are the most important drivers of LULC change and environmental degradation in the catchment. Moreover, the magnitude and intensity of anthropogenic impact is not uniform in different watersheds of Lidder catchment. Therefore, any conservation and management strategy must be formulated on the basis of watershed prioritization.

TI  - Economic Benefits Of Gnss In Transport Applications
JO  - Proceedings of the 18th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of The Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2005
PY  - 2005
AB  - The paper considers three case studies from the aviation, maritime and rail domains, with a particular focus on the benefits of taking up SBAS-based GNSS services. The first case examines the introduction of EGNOS-based non-precision terminal approaches with vertical guidance in Africa. It gives a multi-modal view of benefits and considers the quantitative benefits to aviation. It finds that African stakeholders are drawn to EGNOS for the high integrity it can achieve; such that they may gain safety benefits and cost savings in conventional ground based navigation infrastructure. This study has quantified the benefits arising from reduced diversions and delays in bad weather and the avoided costs of replacing conventional navigation aids. The study has also quantified the safety benefits of reduced accidents in economic terms even if these benefits will never be realised in cash returns. The benefit of improved navigation coverage to areas currently lacking in conventional navaids has been recognised, but not quantified. The second case examines the potential for increasing the traffic capacity of the Suez canal by improving the navigation environment. Currently the Suez Canal is covered by 6 radar-stations, which supervise the traffic and are concentrated at the Vessel Traffic Service centre at Ismailia. Communication is limited to VHF-voice communication ship to shore and shore to ship. This radar-based system is operating at its limits and further improvements will demand extremely high investments. However, a Vessel Traffic Management and Information Service including high accuracy EGNOS positioning and providing the display of all navigational info on a high accuracy electronic chart with real-time data communication can be built nowadays on commercial offthe-shelf PC-networks. The investment should be compared to costs for dredging, improvement of radar and the losses due to poor navigation support (e.g. groundings). In addition, such traffic management system will enable a higher throughput. If the capacity can be optimised by only 1%, it would render additional revenues of US$ 12 M p.a. The investment for EGNOS VTMIS would pay back within very few years. The third case examines the potential to improve safety and capacity of rural railway lines by incorporating a satellite based positioning system to provide position reports from the train to the control centre and to other locomotives to support signalling, transfer data and warn of potential risks. This system would be an overlay system to the current incomplete signalling system on low density railway lines, possibly not equipped with block section control. This study focuses on the cost-effectiveness of an EGNOS-based solution for developing countries, based on inputs from South Africa. The baseline consists of South Africa's current track-side infrastructure along low density lines to meet their safety standards. The costs of an EGNOS-based train supervision system will be analysed, including the costs of equipping the trains and control centres, communications costs, etc., as well as any cost savings that can be obtained by eliminating track-side equipment and reduced maintenance costs (by reducing signal box personnel). In addition, an estimation will be made of the potential increase in capacity on rural lines realised by such an EGNOS-based train control system as a side effect. In each case the sources and mechanisms of benefit are examined together with costs of the required infrastructure, both in the transport network and the vehicle.

AB  - Standard user applications provide a range of cross-cutting interaction techniques that are common to virtually all such tools: selection, filtering, navigation, layer management, and cut-and-paste. We present VisDock, a JavaScript mixin library that provides a core set of these cross-cutting interaction techniques for visualization, including selection (lasso, paths, shape selection, etc), layer management (visibility, transparency, set operations, etc), navigation (pan, zoom, overview, magnifying lenses, etc), and annotation (point-based, region-based, data-space based, etc). To showcase the utility of the library, we have released it as Open Source and integrated it with a large number of existing web-based visualizations. Furthermore, we have evaluated VisDock using qualitative studies with both developers utilizing the toolkit to build new web-based visualizations, as well as with end-users utilizing it to explore movie ratings data. Results from these studies highlight the usability and effectiveness of the toolkit from both developer and end-user perspectives. © 1995-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Seasonal Effects Of Irrigation On Land-Atmosphere Latent Heat, Sensible Heat, And Carbon Fluxes In Semiarid Basin
JO  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
PY  - 2017
AB  - Irrigation, which constitutes similar to 70\% of the total amount of freshwater consumed by the human population, is significantly impacting land-atmosphere fluxes. In this study, using the improved Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) with an active crop model, two high-resolution (similar to 1 km) simulations investigating the effects of irrigation on latent heat (LH), sensible heat (SH), and carbon fluxes (or net ecosystem exchange, NEE) from land to atmosphere in the Heihe River basin in northwestern China were conducted using a high-quality irrigation dataset compiled from 1981 to 2013. The model output and measurements from remote sensing demonstrated the capacity of the developed models to reproduce ecological and hydrological processes. The results revealed that the effects of irrigation on LH and SH are strongest during summer, with a LH increase of similar to 100Wm(-2) and a SH decrease of similar to 60Wm(-2) over intensely irrigated areas. However, the reactions are much weaker during spring and autumn when there is much less irrigation. When the irrigation rate is below 5mmday(-1), the LH generally increases, whereas the SH decreases with growing irrigation rates. However, when the irrigation threshold is in excess of 5mmday(-1), there is no accrued effect of irrigation on the LH and SH. Irrigation produces opposite effects to the NEE during spring and summer. During the spring, irrigation yields more discharged carbon from the land to the atmosphere, increasing the NEE value by 0.4-0.8 gCm(-2) day(-1), while the summer irrigation favors crop fixing of carbon from atmospheric CO2, decreasing the NEE value by similar to 0.8 gCm(-2) day(-1). The repercussions of irrigation on land-atmosphere fluxes are not solely linked to the irrigation amount, and other parameters (especially the temperature) also control the effects of irrigation on LH, SH, and NEE.

TI  - Vehicle Exhaust Remote Sensing Device Method To Screen Vehicles For Evaporative Running Loss Emissions
JO  - Environmental Science and Technology
PY  - 2020
AB  - Vehicle hydrocarbon (HC) emissions can be emitted from either tailpipe or nontailpipe locations, and understanding their fleet apportionment is important for a successful air pollution policy. Vehicles initially misidentified as having elevated tailpipe HC emissions first indicated that roadside exhaust sensors could detect the presence of evaporative HC emissions as increased noise in the HC/carbon dioxide (CO2) correlation measurement. The 90th percentile of the largest residual of the HC/CO2 correlation is defined as a running loss index (RLI) for each measurement. An RLI that is three standard deviations or greater above the instrument noise indicates possible evaporative running loss emissions with the probability increasing with larger RLI values. Two databases of vehicle emission measurements previously collected in West Los Angeles in 2013 and 2015 were screened using this method. The screening estimated that 0.09% (31/33,806) and 0.18% (49/27,413) of the attempted measurements indicated evaporative running loss emissions from a 9-year-old fleet. California LEV I certified vehicles (1994-2003 model years) accounted for the largest age group for both. The minimum detection limits for the instrument used were estimated at 2.8 and 1.6 g/mile on a propane basis for the 2013 and 2015 data, respectively, or 32-56 times the Federal Tier 2 and Tier 3 standards of 0.05 g/mile. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring Of Recessive Degradation For Cultivated Land Productivity And Its Influencing Factors
JO  - Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery
PY  - 2022
AB  - While sticking to the arable-land red line, the recessive degradation of arable land productivity caused by farmers' decisions on the use of cultivated land should not be ignored, such as the reduction of the intensity and efficiency of cultivated land use. Taking permanent cultivated land in Jiangsu Province as an example, remote sensing monitoring and influencing factor analysis of recessive degradation were carried out for cultivated land productivity, based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer(MODIS)remote sensing images from 2001 to 2019. The breaks for additive seasonal and trend algorithm(BFAST)was introduced to model the expected behavior of cultivated land productivity trend in the historical period, in order to identify the recessive degradation of cultivated land productivity in the monitoring period. Based on the Geodetor tool, the dominant influencing factors and factor interaction analysis of the recessive degradation of cultivated land productivity were carried out from three criteria levels and eight index variables. The results indicated that the proportion of recessive degradation for cultivated land productivity in Jiangsu Province was 21.9%, with a significant spatial difference. The highest proportion of recessive degradation of cultivated land productivity appeared in the northwest area, located in Xuzhou and Suqian, which was 47.2% and 43.4%, respectively; besides, their spatial distribution showed aggregation. The recessive degradation rate of cultivated land productivity in Suzhou, Wuxi and Nantong in the southeast region was low, and it was less than 10%. Factor detection analysis showed that the three indicators of population loss, plantation employees and total power of agricultural mechanization had the strongest explanation for recessive degradation of cultivated land production in Jiangsu Province. Through the interaction detector, the explanatory power of population factors and production conditions was improved most significantly. The regional differentiation of recessive degradation for cultivated land production was divided into three types, including production condition constraint, economic benefit constraint and population constraint. The total power of agricultural mechanization, agricultural output value and population loss were the primary factors of the three constraint types respectively. From the perspective of regional space, the population constraint areas accounted for the largest proportion in Jiangsu Province, mainly concentrated in the north. According to different constraints types of recessive degradation for cultivated land production, the corresponding policy suggestions were put forward, such as strengthening the construction of well-facilitated farmland, implementing benefiting-agriculture policies and slowing down the diversion of labor. © 2022, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

TI  - Combining Surveillance And Expert Evidence Of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Freedom: A Decision Science Approach
JO  - Preventive Veterinary Medicine
PY  - 2010
AB  - The ability to combine evidence streams to establish disease freedom or prioritize surveillance is important for the evaluation of emerging diseases, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) IVb in freshwater systems of the United States and Canada. Waterways provide a relatively unconstrained pathway for the spread of VHSV; and structured surveillance for emerging disease in open systems has many challenges. We introduce a decision framework for estimating VHSV infection probability that draws from multiple evidence streams and addresses challenges associated with the assessment of emerging disease. Using this approach, historical and risk-based evidence, whether empirical or expert-derived, supplement surveillance data to estimate disease probability. Surveillance-based estimates of VHSV prevalence were described using beta distributions. Subjective likelihood ratios (LRs), representing contextual risk, were elicited by asking experts to estimate the predicted occurrence of risk factors among VHSV-affected vs. VHSV-unaffected watersheds. We used the odds form of Bayes' theorem to aggregate expert and surveillance evidence to predict the risk-adjusted posterior probability of VHSV-infection for given watersheds. We also used LRs representing contextual risk to quantify the time value of past surveillance data. This evidence aggregation model predicts disease probability from the combined assessment of multiple sources of information. The method also provides a flexible framework for iterative revision of disease freedom status as knowledge and data evolve.

TI  - Tropical Earth Resources Satellite: Is The Investment Warranted?
JO  - Space Policy
PY  - 1985
AB  - All existing and planned Earth observation satellites have near-polar orbits (hence global coverage), but the Tropical Earth Resources Satellite (TERS) will have a true equatorial orbit at 1681 km. The TERS, conceived for the equatorial countries and Indonesia in particular, complements the existing and planned remote sensing satellites and will enable the monitoring of critical processes, such as food production, conservation of the national environment and land usage. The swath-width of the high resolution multispectral instrument can be pointed anywhere between latitude 10°N and 10°S, offering the tropical countries an opportunity to observe any part of their territory four times a day during daylight. A forward looking cloud sensor detects which areas are free of clouds and the pushbroom optical instrument will be pointed to specific clear areas. It is expected that the benefits of the monitoring capability warrant the investment in TERS. © 1985.

TI  - Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Fuzzy-Embedded Hyperbolic Sigmoid Nonlinear Principal Component And Weighted Least Squares Approach
JO  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is one of the significant research topics in the remote sensing community. The high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, the high correlation among pixels, and the availability of fewer numbers of training samples affect the HSI classification accuracy. We propose an approach to extract the best representative bands from the high-dimensional imagery for better classification. Initially, the spectral bands are extracted by re-representing the traditional principal component analysis in terms of Hebbian learning, formulated and solved as a fuzzy optimization problem. Next, a spatial filter is applied to these spectral bands to obtain the smoothed image that preserves the spatial details. Finally, the spectral and spatial features are trained with the nonlinear support vector machine with the radial basis function kernel to obtain the classification map. Performance of the proposed approach is tested by varying different values of the parameters used in our model. The classification accuracy of the proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The proposed approach can be applied in real-world applications, such as food quality, environment change detection, mineralogy, and pharmaceutical drug design.

TI  - Scale- And Region-Dependence In Landscape-Pm2.5 Correlation: Implications For Urban Planning
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2017
AB  - Under rapid urbanization, many cities in China suffer from serious fine particulate matter (PMPM2.5) pollution. As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F_PLAND) and built-up areas (C_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PMPM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PMPM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PMPM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PMPM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F_PLAND and positively to C_PLAND (significance at p < 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PMPM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PMPM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PMPM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.

TI  - Building-Based Damage Detection From Postquake Image Using Multiple-Feature Analysis
JO  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
PY  - 2017
AB  - Damaged building detection from high spatial resolution remote sensing image helps to rapid disaster losses assessment. However, the majority of traditional methods relies on only a single category feature of the damaged building. This letter presents a new strategy for detecting damaged buildings from postquake remote sensing image by multiple-feature analysis, in which the integrity of the building edge and the interior roof was both considered. The intactness of the building edge was assessed by proposing a new feature parameter, edge significance (ES), ES using significance test to quantify the difference between the gradient values on the edge and in the edge buffer. In addition, the gradient orientation inside the building was analyzed and local gradient orientation entropy (LOE) parameter was adopted to determine whether the interior roof was damaged. In general, damaged buildings have lower ES values because of broken edges and higher LOE values owing to debris, final decision was made on the basis of both feature parameters. A Quickbird image of Yushu, China, was used in the experiment and, among a total of 327 buildings, 266 were detected correctly. The overall accuracy was 84.10\%, which is better than traditional methods.

TI  - Hydrological Approach For Flood Overflow Estimation In Buleleng Watershed, Bali
JO  - International Journal of Safety and Security Engineering
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Hydrology of a watershed, encapsulated within the biogeophysical characteristics of upstream, midstream, and downstream regions, governs the peak discharge. Notable flooding issues have been observed in the downstream region of the Buleleng Watershed, largely attributed to land use transitions from vegetative to built-up areas. This study seeks to delineate the flood overflow zone within the Buleleng River Basin, influenced by factors such as rainfall, land use, and soil texture. Data employed in this study encompass land use maps, an 8-meter resolution Digital Elevation Model, annual rainfall records, soil texture information, and river network maps. The adopted methodology involved field survey data collection, satellite image analysis, and hydrological approach computations. Peak discharge values for the Buleleng Watershed, derived for periods of 5, 10, 25, and 5-100 years, were determined to be 426334.44, 568445.88, 603035.31, and 617379 m3/s respectively, set against a river capacity of 312748.13 m3/s. Given the substantial overflow discharge from the Buleleng River, the watershed is susceptible to flooding. The study findings indicate a progressive annual increase in flood overflow predictions, necessitating targeted interventions such as drainage management, surface runoff control, and a review of spatial permits for settlement usage, particularly within watershed conservation areas. © 2023 WITPress.

JO  - Precision Agriculture 2019 - Papers Presented at the 12th European Conference on Precision Agriculture, ECPA 2019
PY  - 2019
AB  - While the agronomic and economic benefits of the adoption of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies have long been established in red winegrape varieties, the spatial variability in water requirements across a vineyard limits its practical application. This study demonstrated an integrated methodology for conducting precision irrigation management in a commercial vineyard through the use of a vine water consumption model and remote sensing imagery. The case study was conducted in a vineyard of 52 irrigation sectors with the varieties Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. This methodology allowed the winery to adopt a RDI strategy, and, despite differences in water requirements between irrigation sectors, vines approached the same pre-defined levels of water stress. Maximum differences in the total amount of water applied between irrigation sectors were 84.1 and 125.9 mm respectively for 2016 and 2017, indicating important water savings compared to the fact that vines had been watered homogeneously. © Wageningen Academic Publishers 2019

TI  - Challenges And Models In Conducting Space Technology Courses With Multi-Ethnic Students Group – Assessment Of International Courses At Iirs & Cssteap
JO  - 38th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing - Space Applications: Touching Human Lives, ACRS 2017
PY  - 2017
AB  - Development of human resources in developing countries assumes importance in applying space science and technology for sustainable development of the region and managing disasters through education and skills development programs. The primary motivation is to impart sufficient knowledge at all levels starting from educators, working professionals and decision making officials to empower them reach their individual potential. This would help these workforces to be self-sufficient without looking forward to other countries, especially during national crisis. The main challenge to the international effort in capacity building to reduce gaps between the developing and developed countries is the large variability in teaching methodologies and medium of instruction. International training programs undertaken at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, India have participants from different regions, thus challenging the trainers to manage multi-cultural and multi-ethnic learning environment. Participants come from different higher education systems each with diverse missions, history, and societal context. How to bridge the differences in culturally dependent learning and teaching styles related to cultural identity and heritage in a time bound training. An effort has been made to develop an approach through a customized survey questionnaire, which brings out pertinent highlights of analysis and review based on feedback through a customised survey conducted from the participants of International courses and training programmes organised at Dehradoon in Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS). The survey questionnaire is divided into broad vertical-themes covering major aspects related to Education, Academic, benefit from the course, amenities-infrastructure, etc. The most important and pivotal part in sample collection is the human-touch given to felicitate participants so that unbiased and open views are received, which includes translating questionnaire to language of participants in case of customised courses for specific countries and then retranslating back in English for deciphering the feedback. Outcome and findings suggests the gap-areas and strengths in the practices being followed for conduction of international courses at IIRS and CSSTEAP in specific, which may also be useful to any organisation conducting international courses with participants form various counties across different continents. © 2017 ACRS.

JO  - NEW SPACE
PY  - 2018
AB  - According to Wikipedia, NewSpace is an umbrella term for a movement and philosophy that is often affiliated with, but not synonymous with, an emergent private spaceflight industry. Specifically, the term is used to refer to a community of relatively new aerospace companies working to develop low-cost access to space or spaceflight technologies and advocates of low-cost spaceflight technology and policy.({*})Although this description may be arguable, the emergence of numerous start-up space ventures within the past 15 years is a fact. These start-ups cover diverse areas such as satellite communications, Earth observation, launchers, manned spaceflight and space tourism, or even energy from space as well as resource gathering in space. Companies have attracted more than \$13.3 billion of investment, including \$5.1 billion in debt financing, since 2000. More than 80 angel- and venture-backed space companies have been founded since 2000. Eight of these have since been acquired, at a total value of \$2.2 billion.(dagger)The NewSpace movement has so far been focused, to a great extent, on the United States, namely the West Coast. Mojave in California has been dubbed the Silicon Valley on NewSpace, being home to several of these commercial space enterprises. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) has launched a study for understanding the driving forces behind the NewSpace ecosystem and related chances and challenges for Germany and Europe.The study, which was conducted by SpaceTec Partners and BHO Legal of Germany, shows that at least four factors are of immanent importance for a NewSpace ecosystem to create market-driven products and services. These factors are related to: (1) Business Philosophycreating and living an entrepreneurial spirit; (2) Financingaccess to early stage risk capital and venture funding; (3) Technology Managementfocus on spinning-in technologies and Information and Communication Technology processes; and (4) Framework Conditionsfavorable political and legal conditions supporting commercialization. This article summarizes the insights gained and the lessons learned from success stories and failures in NewSpace. It presents the recommendations for strategies as to how NewSpace can be successful in Europe and, in particular, in Germany. Given the growing relevance of NewSpace, these insights are of high interest to stakeholders and decision makers worldwide.

TI  - A Pilot Project Combining Multispectral Proximal Sensors And Digital Cameras For Monitoring Tropical Pastures
JO  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2016
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of pasture biomass and ground cover is necessary in livestock production systems to ensure productive and sustainable management. Interest in the use of proximal sensors for monitoring pasture status in grazing systems has increased, since data can be returned in near real time. Proximal sensors have the potential for deployment on large properties where remote sensing may not be suitable due to issues such as spatial scale or cloud cover. There are unresolved challenges in gathering reliable sensor data and in calibrating raw sensor data to values such as pasture biomass or vegetation ground cover, which allow meaningful interpretation of sensor data by livestock producers. Our goal was to assess whether a combination of proximal sensors could be reliably deployed to monitor tropical pasture status in an operational beef production system, as a precursor to designing a full sensor deployment. We use this pilot project to (1) illustrate practical issues around sensor deployment, (2) develop the methods necessary for the quality control of the sensor data, and (3) assess the strength of the relationships between vegetation indices derived from the proximal sensors and field observations across the wet and dry seasons. Proximal sensors were deployed at two sites in a tropical pasture on a beef production property near Townsville, Australia. Each site was monitored by a Skye SKR-four-band multispectral sensor (every 1 min), a digital camera (every 30 min), and a soil moisture sensor (every 1 min), each of which were operated over 18 months. Raw data from each sensor was processed to calculate multispectral vegetation indices. The data capture from the digital cameras was more reliable than the multispectral sensors, which had up to 67\% of data discarded after data cleaning and quality control for technical issues related to the sensor design, as well as environmental issues such as water incursion and insect infestations. We recommend having a system with both sensor types to aid in data interpretation and troubleshooting technical issues. Non-destructive observations of pasture characteristics, including above-ground standing biomass and fractional ground cover, were made every 2 weeks. This simplified data collection was designed for multiple years of sampling at the remote site, but had the disadvantage of high measurement uncertainty. A bootstrapping method was used to explore the strength of the relationships between sensor and pasture observations. Due to the uncertainty in the field observations, the relationships between sensor and field data are not confirmational and should be used only to inform the design of future work. We found the strongest relationships occurred during the wet season period of maximum pasture growth (January to April), with generally poor relationships outside of this period. Strong relationships were found with multispectral indices that were sensitive to the green and dry components of the vegetation, such as those containing the band in the lower shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. During the wet season the bias-adjusted bootstrap point estimate of the R-2 between above-ground biomass and the normalized ratio between the SWIR and red bands (NVI-SR) was 0.72 (95\% CI of 0.28 to 0.98), while that for the percentage of green vegetation observed in three dimensions and a simple ratio between the near infrared and SWIR bands (RatioNS34) was 0.81 (95\% CI of 0.53 to 1.00). Relationships between field data and the vegetation index derived from the digital camera images were generally weaker than from the multispectral sensor data, except for green vegetation observations in two and three dimensions. Our successful pilot of multiple proximal sensors supports the design of future deployments in tropical pastures and their potential for operational use. The stringent rules we developed for data cleaning can be more broadly applied to other sensor projects to ensure quality data. Although proximal sensors observe only a small area of the pasture, they deliver continual and timely pasture measurements to inform timely on-farm decision-making.

TI  - Lulc Change Effects On Environmental Quality And Ecosystem Services Using Eo Data In Two Rural River Basins In Thrace, Greece
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2023
AB  - Rural abandonment and associated rapid urbanization, agricultural intensification, and climate change have been key factors transforming terrestrial landscapes, with significant impacts on the environmental quality and the ecosystem services (ES) provided to human welfare. In this study, two understudied rural river basins located in Thrace, North Greece, were selected to assess changes in landscape pattern, composition, and eco-environmental quality and ecosystem services values (ESV). Cloud-based remote sensing (RS) analyses of multitemporal Landsat imagery in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were applied for multitemporal land use/land cover changes (LULCC) quantification between 1984-2021, along with landscape pattern, eco-environmental quality, and ES assessment. Although ecosystem changes observed were not extensive over this period, eco-environmental quality appeared to be affected due to fragmentation. Preserving the ecosystem's naturalness can enhance cultural ES to avoid further values loss originating from provisioning ES exploitation. This study highlights the strong connection between landscape configuration and eco-environmental quality, emphasizing the strong impact that anthropogenic activities have on the environment. The monitoring of the effects of LULCC on ecosystem health and the economic value of ES is crucial for the introduction of spatial planning and restoration policies.

TI  - Modelling And Accessing Land Degradation Vulnerability Using Remote Sensing Techniques And The Analytical Hierarchy Process Approach
JO  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
PY  - 2022
AB  - Land degradation and desertification have recently become a critical problem in Ethiopia. Accordingly, identification of land degradation vulnerable zonation and mapping was conducted in Wabe Shebele River Basin, Ethiopia. Precipitation derived from Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GMP), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST), topography (slope), and pedological properties (i.e., soil depth, soil pH, soil texture, and soil drainage) were used in the current study. NDVI has been considered as the most significant parameter followed by the slope, precipitation and temperature. Geospatial techniques and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach were used to model the land degradation vulnerable index. Validation of the results with google earth image shows the applicability of the model in the study. The result is classified into very highly vulnerable (17.06\%), highly vulnerable (15.01\%), moderately vulnerable (32.72\%), slightly vulnerable (16.40\%), and very slightly vulnerable (18.81\%) to land degradation. Due to the small rate of precipitation which is vulnerable to evaporation by high temperature in the region, the downstream section of the basis is categorized as highly vulnerable to Land Degradation (LD) and vice versa in the upstream section of the basin. Moreover, the validation using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows an area under the ROC curve value of 80.92\% which approves the prediction accuracy of the AHP method in assessing and modelling LD vulnerability zone in the study area. The study provides a substantial understanding of the effect of land degradation on sustainable land use management and development in the basin.

AB  - With data collected from remote sensing (RS) taken by Landsat TM5/TM8, the hydrological report of the upper reaches of Yangtze River Basin and the local statistical yearbook, 4 periods of vegetation coverage change was analysed. The spatial heterogeneity in functions of ecological services was estimated by differences in the conditions of natural factors and social functions. The results show: (1) The land use change type is mainly forest land, accounting for 53.15\% of the total area of the study area; the area of cultivated land and other land decreased by 29 800 and 4 780 km(2), respectively; (2) The ecological service value of the study area during these four periods are RMB 9.80 billion, RMB 10.25 billion, 10.61 billion, and RMB 11.04 billion, respectively, while the ecological service value of the six tributaries are increasing; (3) Based on the GM (1, 1), the expected ecological service value of the study area are RMB 11.49 billion in 2016, RMB 11.96 billion in 2020, RMB 12.46 billion in 2025 and RMB 12.97 billion in 2030. In addition, ecological service values are on the rise, and the relative error is 4.79\%. The results can better assist decision making regarding ecological compensation.

TI  - Assessment Of The Urban Expansion And Its Impact On The Eco-Environment-A Case Study Of Hefei Municipal Area
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - With the advancement of urbanization, the ecological environmental changes caused by the continuous expansion of cities have become a major concern. Thus, this study is based on a remote sensing image map of Hefei city from 1984 to 2020, which is now in the process of rapid development. We constructed an index system with ecological land, ecosystem service value, ecological environment quality, urban land expansion coefficient, urban heat island rate index, total pollutant emissions, ecological pressure, and ecological deficit, and then evaluated the ecological environment of Hefei city with the help of the entropy weight comprehensive evaluation method. The results show that (1) in the positive evaluation index, the ecological land area was reduced to half of the original area, the ecological service value was reduced by 0.37 times its initial value, and the eco-environmental index was <35 and still decreasing. (2) In the negative evaluation index, the urban heat island ratio index increased by nearly 10 times its initial value, the total emission of various pollutants increased by 6.64 times its initial value, the ecological deficit increased year by year after 1999, and the ecological pressure in 2020 increased to 3 times that in 1999. (3) The overall environmental score of the Hefei urban area has decreased by 48.6 times its initial value. The values of positive evaluation indexes are decreasing, whereas the values of negative evaluation indexes are increasing, and both these items are moving backward, leading to the decrease in the comprehensive ecological environmental score. It can be noticed that the urban expansion of Hefei has had a severe impact on the ecological environment, resulting in the continuous reduction in the ecological land area, a serious urban heat island effect, and continuous weakening of regional ecological service functions. The study results can be used for reference in alleviating the impacts of urban expansion on the environment, promoting the optimization of the urban landscape and the sustainable development of the social economy and environment.

TI  - Ecological Footprint And Total Material Requirement As Environmental Indicators Of Mining Activities: Case Studies Of Copper Mines
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
PY  - 2020
AB  - The production of mineral resources negatively affects the natural environment, which is a topic of urgent discussion in sustainable natural resource use/management. In this study, we explored appropriate environmental indicators of mining activities that might be easy to account for and deemed suitable as a first-order estimation of overall environmental impacts. We distinguish the differential impact between operations rather than providing a strictly estimated integrated single indicator value. Considering the increasing interests in land use change and associated impacts, ecological footprint (EF) was chosen as first indicator, and Total Material Requirement (TMR) was also chosen to complement EF. Both the operational and remote-sensing based satellite data were used in this study by using three copper mines as case studies. The results propose that EF for built-up land works well by showing above the ground impacts for mining activities and TMR complements EF with its ability to reflect the underground activities.

PY  - 1998
AB  - The development of a satellite education partnership between the School of Nursing at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and St Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield, Wisconsin, is reported. The factors which were identified as key to this successful partnership are compared to the antecedent conditions and defining attributes of the concept of collaboration as described by Henneman, Lee and Cohen. These factors include: (a) enlisting organizational support; (b) identifying anticipated benefits to all parties; (c) scrutiny regarding the necessity of the project; (d) communication skills and trust among partners; (e) a contract including not only how to proceed but how to disband; and (f) assessment of the risks of failure and whether they can be endured. The defining attributes of collaboration were met in this satellite baccalaureate programme partnership. The consequences of this collaboration are discussed and support the conceptual literature. The success of this collaboration is evidence that partnerships between nursing service, education and research are not only worth the risks but necessary for our full participation in the health care system.

TI  - Effects Of Nile Perch, <I>Lates Niloticus</I>, On Functional And Specific Fish Diversity In Uganda's Lake Kyoga System
JO  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
PY  - 2006
AB  - The introduction of Nile perch, Lates niloticus, to Lake Victoria, East Africa, interacted with eutrophication to cause a reorganization of the lake's food web and the extirpation of many endemic fishes. The Lake Kyoga satellite system lies downstream from Lake Victoria. It encompasses species-rich lakes where Nile perch are absent or very rare, and low diversity lakes where L. niloticus is abundant. In 1999 we surveyed seven lakes in the Kyoga system using experimental monofilament gill nets (1/4-1 inches variable mesh). At Boston University we assessed delta N-15 signatures of epaxial muscle from subsamples of the catch (n = 361). These signatures are often highly correlated with the near-term mean realized trophic position of an individual organism. A neural network analysis of fish length, species name, trophic level, and lake of origin fish explained 94\% of the sample variance in delta N-15. We analysed statistical patterns in these signatures at a number of spatial scales. The relationship between trophic level and delta N-15 varied greatly among lakes. Higher diversity perch-free lakes had greater variance in delta N-15 values and fish lengths than lower diversity Nile perch lakes, suggesting an important relationship between species diversity and functional diversity. Against expectations, lake size was negatively correlated with delta N-15. Patterns in stable isotope signatures indicated that Nile perch lakes have shorter food chains than perch-free lakes. The results throw up two management problems for the Kyoga system. Impacted lakes need to be studied to understand and ameliorate the community-level effects of Nile perch introduction, whereas the species-rich nonperch lakes, which harbour a large proportion of the remaining diversity of regionally endemic taxa, are in need of conservation planning.

TI  - Long Term Prediction Of Wind Speed With Artificial Neural Networks
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2020
AB  - The paper presents a methodology, based on artificial neural networks, for the offshore wind speed values long-term prediction. One of the most available renewable energy is the wind energy. The offshore wind turbines placement presents some benefits comparing with onshore one, like lower environmental impact and long-term stability of surroundings geometry. Of course, there are also drawbacks, like difficult set-up and maintenance or expensive transmission systems for the converted energy. Over all, the off-shore placement of wind turbines is continuously growing. Taking into account that the wind turbines designing and mounting is an expensive job, the prediction of wind speed value evolution on long-term basis is a must for an efficient investment. Due to the present-day changes of the weather conditions, the estimation of wind speed long-term evolution using mathematical equations is difficult to obtain. On the other hand, there are available large databases with recorded values of wind speed over the years. Based on artificial neural networks, these datasets can be processed and used for long-term predictions, allowing this way a more efficient wind energy extraction in offshore facilities. In the present paper, the values of wind speed recorded in some locations, were processed with an artificial neural network, and some predictions were made. In order to validate the procedure, the obtained results were compared with corresponding measured values. Some long-term predictions are also presented. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference. All rights reserved.

TI  - Marine Heat Waves In The Mediterranean Sea: An Assessment From The Surface To The Subsurface To Meet National Needs
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - In the Mediterranean Sea, marine ecosystems and the resource-based economy are shared among many countries, making this a regional sea of important geopolitical and economic stakes. Over the last decades, marine heat waves (MHWs) in the Mediterranean Sea have caused mass-mortality events in various marine species and critical losses for seafood industries. MHWs are expected to become more intense, longer and more frequent through anthropogenic warming. This study proposes to better understand how much each Mediterranean country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters may be affected by MHW changes, to contribute to decision support for management and adaptation at national scale. The variability of surface and subsurface MHWs is assessed over the 1987-2019 period in the Mediterranean EEZs, which are ocean areas where sovereign states have special rights. Combining high-resolution satellite observations and a regional reanalysis, sea surface temperature and ocean heat content are used to define surface and subsurface MHWs. The MHW characteristics selected in this study highlight the important differences between surface and subsurface extreme events. MHW frequency is higher at the surface than in the subsurface and has significantly increased in most EEZs both at the surface and in the subsurface, while MHW duration is longer in the subsurface than at the surface in all EEZs. MHW intensities decrease with depth, while its increase over time is more disparate throughout the basin. MHW maximum intensity displays significant positive trends with higher surface values in the western Mediterranean Sea, while in the subsurface it reaches its extreme values in the EEZs of the Levantine basin. In contrast, MHW cumulative intensity exhibits its extreme trend values in the eastern Mediterranean Sea both at the surface and in the subsurface. The choice of a "Top-Ten" list of EEZs shows that the impact to EEZs is different depending on the MHW characteristics and the depth, emphasizing the need to consider all MHW characteristics and to avoid focusing only on the surface. Overall, the results highlight the necessity of strengthening surface and subsurface observing systems in most national waters to better establish local-scale risk assessments and to respond to diverse stakeholder needs.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Helicobacter pylori infection is a major cause of peptic ulcer and is also associated with chronic gastritis, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Guidelines have been developed in the United States and Europe (areas with low prevalence) for the diagnosis and management of this infection, including the recommendation to 'test and treat' those with dyspepsia. A group of international experts performed a targeted literature review and formulated an expert opinion for evidenced-based benefits and harms for screening and treatment of H. pylori in high-prevalence countries. They concluded that in Arctic countries where H. pylori prevalence exceeds 60\%, treatment of persons with H. pylori infection should be limited only to instances where there is strong evidence of direct benefit in reduction of morbidity and mortality, associated peptic ulcer disease and MALT lymphoma and that the test- and-treat strategy may not be beneficial for those with dyspepsia.

This data together with GIS and other agriculture and development related information can be moulded into an easily understandable and useful information to farmers. WorldSpace system with its capabilities of audio and data broadcasting to simple receivers provides a very attractive way of making this information reach the farmers even in remote and rural areas. The focus is to develop competencies in these areas which accelerate the development efforts that are undertaken in rural areas by the Governments. The information could include soil conditions, climatic conditions and changes, monsoon forecast, crop patterns, land use pattern, irrigation, farm inputs, records, etc. Agriculture product price information would also add substantial value to the farmer in optimizing his returns.

TI  - Decentralized Water Reuse Planning: Evaluation Of Life Cycle Costs And Benefits
JO  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
PY  - 2019
AB  - The objective of this paper is to comparatively evaluate the life cycle costs and expected monetary benefits of decentralized greywater reuse systems. Specifically, added life cycle costs and estimated life cycle monetary benefits of satellite and onsite greywater reuse systems are evaluated in comparison with the prevailing centralized systems. Centralized systems refer to the traditional form of water delivery where one centralized treatment plant treats and distributes potable water to a large service area through a water distribution network while a sewer network collects used water for treatment at a centralized wastewater treatment plant before the wastewater effluent is disposed into the environment. Satellite greywater reuse systems collect raw greywater at neighborhood or district level for treatment and re-distribution for non-potable uses within the same neighborhood or district. Onsite greywater reuse systems collect raw greywater for treatment on the premises of where it is produced after which it is re-distributed for permitted non-potable use on the same premises. Infrastructure needs and associated life cycle cost information for both types of greywater reuse systems are appropriately modeled or synthesized from literature. The skeletal layout of a real-world water distribution network is adapted for performing the cost-benefit analysis in this study. Finally, sensitivity of the cost-benefit tradeoff associated with satellite and onsite greywater reuse adoption scenarios is evaluated for various uncertainties associated with technological evolution, policy incentives, and planning schemes. Given that several states in the U.S. are expected to face water shortages in the near future, this paper will provide guidance to water utilities and policy makers in planning of future water supply alternatives.

TI  - The Progressing Cavity Pump: A Cost-Effective Multiphase Transfer Solution
JO  - SPE Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference Proceedings
PY  - 1997
AB  - Based on the progressing cavity pump principle, Robbins & Myers, Inc. has developed a surface transfer system for transporting all multiphase fluids produced from the well simultaneously through a single pipeline to a central processing station. It is capable of handling a wide range of flow regimes and gas fractions up to 99%. The system's approach provides optimum pump performance under continuously changing conditions at the wellhead. The data presented in this paper was recorded at an actual field location in Alberta, Canada. A special multiphase progressing cavity pump system was installed at the satellite and resulted in reducing the wellhead pressure. At the same time, a significant increase in overall fluid production was recorded, including a substantial increase in the oil output. This case study describes the problem and the solution, and explains the benefits of the progressing cavity multiphase pump system. A comparative analysis is presented for the production rates before and after the installation of the multiphase pumping system. An economic analysis is also presented to demonstrate the cost-effective advantages of the progressing cavity multiphase pump system, which offers lower capital, installation and operating costs, and an attractive return on investment. © 1997, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.

TI  - Lmorphometric Analysis Of Mandavi River Basin In Rayalaseema Region Of Andhra Pradesh (South India), Using Remote Sensing And Gis
JO  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water conservation and management strategies, play a fundamental role in harnessing surface and subsurface water resources, especially in arid and semiarid regions. The present study deals with morphometric analysis and quantitative analysis of the Mandavi River basin, located in the Rayalaseema region of south India. The study area is mostly covered with crystalline rock terrain and the rainfall is very scanty, hence, drought is very common in every summer season. The watershed area spreads over an area of about 1464.94km(2). In addition to this, the stream orders are mainly controlled by various physiographic conditions, neighbourhood geology and erosion cycles. Dendritic to a sub-dendritic pattern existed on crystalline terrain, which shows the unique lithological nature within the study area. The overall study reveals that the lower stream order, generally subjugated by the basin as well as the rainfall parameter, is more affected by the development of stream segments. The elongation ratio value of 0.06819 is observed over the elongated and moderate altitudes in addition to steep slopes. The observed drainage texture of the basin is 9.30, indicating the existence of a coarse texture. These morphometric parameters were analyzed from two sources of drainage network such as SRTM-30m and LISS IV in the GIS environment. The present results provide characteristics of geo-hydrological behaviourand structural antecedents of the catchment area for better management and developmental planning of water resources.

TI  - Increased Water Use Efficiency In China And Its Drivers During 2000–2016
JO  - Ecosystems
PY  - 2022
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), the carbon uptake per unit of water consumption, is a critical indicator of the coupling between water and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatiotemporal changes in WUE and its drivers is vital for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Herein, we used a remote sensing-driven analytical model to estimate spatiotemporal variations of WUE in China during 2000–2016 and quantified its key drivers. The simulated WUE matched well with the eddy covariance observations across different ecosystems in China, with coefficients of determination of 0.86 and 0.81. The annual WUE increased significantly at a rate of 0.021 g C mm−1 H2O y−1 (P < 0.01), with the mean value of 1.62 g C mm−1 H2O during 2000–2016. Analyses based on a factorial experiment (FE) and the sensitivity method (SE) showed that the increased leaf area index was the largest contributor to the increase in WUE, with contributions of 50.1% and 42.8% determined via FE and SE, respectively. CO2 enrichment was the second largest contributor (FE: 20.7% and SE: 31.4%), followed by the decrease in the vapor pressure deficit (FE: 15.4% and SE: 13.4%). The increased ratio of water loss by canopy interaction had a negative impact on WUE due to the increased non-productive water loss. Although these attributions had some inherent uncertainties, the results highlighted that the significant greening in China, which was mainly caused by human land-use management, and increased CO2 concentrations significantly promoted WUE during the recent 17 years. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Regional Variation In Habitat Matrix Determines Movement Metrics In Baudin's Cockatoos In Southwest Western Australia
JO  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Context. The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology. Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data. Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates. Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape. Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species. Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.

TI  - Success Stories Of Satellite Radar Altimeter Applications
JO  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
PY  - 2022
AB  - For nearly three decades, satellite nadir altimeters have provided essential information to understand primarily ocean but also inland water dynamics. A variety of parameters can be inferred via altimeter measurements, including sea surface height, sea surface wind speeds, significant wave heights, and topography of land, sea ice, and ice sheets. Taking advantage of these parameters with the long record of altimeter data spanning multiple decades has allowed a diverse range of societal applications. As the constellation of altimeter satellites grows, the proven value of the missions to a diverse user community can now be demonstrated by highlighting a selection of verifiable success stories. In this paper, we review selected altimeter success stories that incorporate altimetry data, alone or in conjunction with numerical models or other Earth observations, to solve a key societal problem. First, we define the problem or the key challenge of each use case, and then we articulate the uptake of the successful altimeter-based solution. Our review revealed steady progress by scientific and stakeholder communities in bridging the gap between data availability and their actual uptake to address a variety of applications. Highlighting these altimeter-based success stories can serve to further promote the widespread adoption of future satellite missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission scheduled for launch in 2022. Knowledge of the breadth of current utility of altimeter observations can help the scientific community to demonstrate the value in continuing radar altimeter and similar missions, particularly those with expanded capabilities, such as SWOT.

TI  - Multifunctional Urban Green Infrastructure Development In A Sub-Saharan Country: The Case Of Friendship Square Park, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - The global expansion of urbanization is posing associated environmental and socioeconomic challenges. The capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, is also facing similar threats. The development of urban green infrastructures (UGIs) are the forefront mechanisms in mitigating these global challenges. Nevertheless, UGIs in Addis Ababa are degrading and inaccessible to the city residents. Hence, a 56 km long Addis River Side Green Development Project is under development with a total investment of USD 1.253 billion funded by Chinese government aid. In phase one of this grand project, Friendship Square Park (FSP), was established in 2019 with a total cost of about USD 50 million. This paper was initiated to describe the establishment process of FSP and assess its social, economic, and environmental contributions to the city. The establishment process was described in close collaboration with the FSP contractor, China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC). The land use changes of FSP's development were determined by satellite images, while its environmental benefits were assessed through plant selection, planting design, and seedling survival rate. Open and/or close ended questionnaires were designed to assess the socioeconomic values of the park. The green space of the area has highly changed from 2002 (8.6\%) to 2019 (56.1\%) when the park was completed. More than 74,288 seedlings in 133 species of seedlings were planted in the park. The average survival rate of these seedlings was 93\%. On average about 500 people visit the park per day, and 400,000 USD is generated, just from the entrance fee, per annum. Overall, 100\% of the visitors were strongly satisfied with the current status of the park and recommended some additional features to be included in it. In general, the park is contributing to the environmental and socioeconomic values of the city residents, and this kind of park should be developed in other sub-cities of the city as well as regional cities of Ethiopia to increase the aesthetic, environmental and socioeconomic values of the country, at large.

TI  - The International Federation Of Digital Seismograph Networks (Fdsn): An Integrated System Of Seismological Observatories
JO  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
PY  - 2008
AB  - The International Federation of Digital Seismographic Networks (FDSN) is a non-governmental organization formed by institutions dedicated to seismological research and seismic monitoring. The FDSN is a successful complement to the International Seismological Centre (ISC) in pursuing a more than a century old tradition of global seismic data exchange. The main goal of the FDSN is the production and dissemination of seismic waveform data from high fidelity seismic observatories. The Federation is formed by 65 organizations from 52 countries that contribute data to three main data centers in the United States, Europe, and Japan. A subset of the stations that conform the FDSN send real-time to the Data Management Center (DMC) of the Incorporated Research Institutions of Seismology (IRIS) in the United States. Data from this real-time network is crucial to the determination of the seismic parameters of large earthquakes in a very short time after their occurrence and to support the efforts of institutions that are responsible for disaster relief or prevention. Most notably, Tsunami Warning Centers use this information as a fundamental underpinning to issue warnings and alerts. The FDSN is an early participant of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), contributing high-quality, timely and freely accessible seismic data. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the FDSN from the viewpoint of an integrated system of observatories and to share with other GEOSS networks the successes, challenges and lessons learned by the FDSN in promoting the open and free access of seismological data for the benefit of scientific research and disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - What Technology Does To Translating
JO  - TRANSLATION \& INTERPRETING-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETING
PY  - 2011
AB  - The relation between technology and translating is part of the wider question of what technology does to language. It is now a key question because new translation technologies such as translation memories, data-based machine translation, and collaborative translation management systems, far from being merely added tools, are altering the very nature of the translator's cognitive activity, social relations, and professional standing. Here we argue that technologies first affect memory capacity in such a way that the paradigmatic is imposed more frequently on the syntagmatic. It follows that the translating activity is enhanced in its generative moment, yet potentially retarded in the moment of selection, where the values of intuition and text flow become difficult to recuperate. The redeeming grace of new technologies may nevertheless lie in new modes of opening translation to thespace of volunteer translation, where humanizing dialogue can enter the internal dimension of translation decisions. The regime of the paradigmatic may thus be embedded in new modes of social exchange, where translation becomes one of the five basic language skills.

TI  - Multi-Scale Modeling Of Land-Cover Change And Ecosystem Service Values: A Case Of The Yuzixi Catchment In Sichuan
JO  - Dili Xuebao/Acta Geographica Sinica
PY  - 2006
AB  - The Yuzixi Catchment is located in the core of the Panda Natural Reserves in western Sichuan Province, with an area of 1742 km2. Due to influences of climate change and human activities, the land cover shows marked changes in the last decade. Using the land-cover data obtained from the remote sensing images of two years of 1986 and 1994, this paper developed two models based on the Markov Chain and Patch-dynamics approach, to simulate land-cover changes in the Yuzixi Catchment. Both models were verified using the land-cover data in 2002. Starting from the year 1994, the land-cover of the year 2002 was simulated in a time-step of 1 year and 8 years with these two models, respectively. Compared with the real land-cover data in 2002, it was found that the time scale had a marked effect on the simulation results, and the simulation error varied among different land use types. The simulation error of Patch-dynamics model of cultivated land (-8.2%/-5.6%), forest land (-0.5%/-0.4%), grassland (0.7%/0.4%) and residential area (-29.9%/-16.4%) is bigger based on one-year scale than eight-year scale, and their changing trends are unstable due to the significant effect of anthropogenic factors. By contrast, the simulation error of bush land (-1.5%/-1.7%) and ice land (27.3%/41.9%) is smaller based on one-year scale than eight-year scale, and the changing trends are stable because they are mostly affected by natural factors. The research results also show that the simulation results of Markov Chain model are similar to that of Patch-dynamics model. However, the simulation results of Patch-dynamics model are more stable and reliable.

TI  - Mapping Deforestation And Recovery Of Tropical Montane Forests Of East Africa
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Deforestation poses a major threat to the tropical montane forest ecosystems of East Africa. Montane forests provide key and unique ecological and socio-economic benefits to the local communities and host diverse flora and fauna. There is evidence of ongoing deforestation and forest clearance in these montane forests although estimates diverge among different sources suggesting rates of 0.4\%-3\% yr(-1). Quantifying deforestation rates and forest disturbance is critical to design conservation and sustainable management policies for forest management. This study quantified the rate of deforestation and forest recovery over the last three decades for the Mau Forest Complex and Mount Elgon forests in Kenya and Uganda using Landsat time-series satellite imagery. With the analysis, classification accuracies of 86.2\% and 90.5\% (kappa 0.81 and 0.88) were achieved for the Mau Forest Complex and the Mt Elgon forests, respectively. 21.9\% (88,493 ha) of the 404,660 ha of Mau forest was lost at an annual rate of -0.82\% yr(-1) over the period between 1986 and 2017. More positively, 18.6\% (75,438 ha) of the forest cover that was disturbed during the same period and is currently undergoing recovery. In Mt Elgon forest, 12.5\% (27,201 ha) of 217,268 ha of the forest cover was lost to deforestation at an annual rate of -1.03\% yr(-1) for the period between 1984-2017 and 27.2\% (59,047 ha) of the forest cover disturbed is undergoing recovery. The analysis further demonstrated agriculture (both smallholder and commercial) was the main driver of forest cover loss in Mau forest, accounting for 81.5\% (70,612 ha) of the deforestation, of which 13.2\% was due to large scale and 68.3\% was related to the smallholders. For the Mt Elgon forest, agriculture was also the main driver accounting for 63.2\% (24,077 ha) of deforestation followed by the expansion of human settlements that contributed to 14.7\% (5,597 ha) of forest loss. This study provides accurate and novel estimates of the rate of deforestation for the Mau forest complex and Mt Elgon forest ecosystems. These rates are higher than previously estimated and recent deforestation has been identified, which provides a quantitative basis for forest restoration programs and to design conservation policies.

TI  - A New Look At Pharmacy Services In The Operating Suite And Recovery Room
JO  - Contemporary Pharmacy Practice
PY  - 1980
AB  - Drug control and charging traditionally have been delegated to overburdened physicians and nursing personnel in operating rooms, anesthesiology, and immediate postoperative patient care areas. Better drug control (e.g., charging, intravenous admixture preparation, and narcotic record keeping) in these areas is needed, and a 24-hour satellite pharmacy system is proposed. Revenue production and expense incurred were projected by analyzing drug usage. Responsive drug dispensing and control were evaluated by a 10-day pilot study during which the pharmacy provided the entire drug needs of the patient while in the operating suite. Economic analyses revealed significant 'lost charges' by the automatic replacement system currently in use. Revenue was maintained while providing clearly labeled drugs in a ready-to-use form. Problems with drug inventory and narcotic control were lessened for the nursing and physician staffs during the pilot study. It was concluded that drug distribution and control via a decentralized pharmacy satellite located in the operating room area is a financially viable solution resulting in better patient care.

TI  - Vis‐Nir Spectroscopy And Satellite Landsat‐8 Oli Data To Map Soil Nutrients In Arid Conditions: A Case Study Of The Northwest Coast Of Egypt
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - The mapping of soil nutrients is a key issue for numerous applications and research fields ranging from global changes to environmental degradation, from sustainable soil management to the precision agriculture concept. The characterization, modeling and mapping of soil properties at diverse spatial and temporal scales are key factors required for different environments. This paper is focused on the use and comparison of soil chemical analyses, Visible near infrared and shortwave infrared VNIR‐SWIR spectroscopy, partial least‐squares regression (PLSR), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Landsat‐8 operational land imager (OLI) images, to inexpensively analyze and predict the content of different soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)), pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) in arid conditions. To achieve this aim, 100 surface samples of soil were gathered to a depth of 25 cm in the Wadi El‐Garawla area (the northwest coast of Egypt) using chemical analyses and reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. PLSR was used firstly to model the relationship between the averaged values from the ASD spectroradiometer and the available N, P, and K, pH and SOM contents in soils in order to map the predicted value using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and secondly to retrieve N, P, K, pH, and SOM values from OLI images. Thirty soil samples were selected to verify the validity of the results. The randomly selected samples included the spatial diversity and characteristics of the study area. The prediction of available of N, P, K pH and SOM in soils using VNIR‐SWIR spectroscopy showed high performance (where R2 was 0.89, 0.72, 0.91, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively) and quite satisfactory results from Landsat‐8 OLI images (correlation R2 values 0.71, 0.68, 0.55, 0.62 and 0.7, respectively). The results showed that about 84% of the soils of Wadi El‐Garawla are characterized by low‐to‐moderate fertility, while about 16% of the area is characterized by high soil fertility. © MDPI AG.

TI  - A Low Complexity Convolutional Neural Network For Feature Extraction Of Satellite Images Used In Path Loss Prediction
JO  - AIP Conference Proceedings
PY  - 2023
AB  - Determination of localized path loss values in an environment is vital to the design and upgrade of wireless communications networks. As path loss values depend on environments, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are trained with satellite images to map path loss values with environmental characteristics. Pretrained CNN models are often used, but they take time to get trained and require a large memory size. We developed a deep learning architecture composed of a low complexity CNN to extract features from satellite images and an XGBoost regressor that maps a combination of the extracted features with some numerical features to path loss values. The CNN used for feature extraction is composed of five convolutional layers, with individual number of filters and kernel sizes obtained using Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization. The developed CNN provided an accuracy comparable to the best of the pretrained models based on a significant difference test and better in terms of train time. The single model was developed with a dataset composed of measurements from multiple environments: rural, suburban, urban, and urban highrise, and of multiple frequencies and antenna heights. The model’s prediction error in terms of RMSE was below known standard threshold values at all frequencies and environments. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using Nonparametric Modeling Approaches And Remote Sensing Imagery To Estimate Ecological Welfare Forest Biomass
JO  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
PY  - 2018
AB  - The spatial distribution of forest biomass is closely related with carbon cycle, climate change, forest productivity, and biodiversity. Efficient quantification of biomass provides important information about forest quality and health. With the rising awareness of sustainable development, the ecological benefits of forest biomass attract more attention compared to traditional wood supply function. In this study, two nonparametric modeling approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine were adopted to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) using widely used Landsat imagery in the region, especially within the ecological forest of Fuyang District in Zhejiang Province, China. Correlation analysis was accomplished and model parameters were optimized during the modeling process. As a result, the best performance modeling method RF was implemented to produce an AGB estimation map. The predicted map of AGB in the study area showed obvious spatial variability and demonstrated that within the current ecological forest zone, as well as the protected areas, the average of AGB were higher than the ordinary forest. The quantification of AGB was proven to have a close relationship with the local forest policy and management pattern, which indicated that combining remote-sensing imagery and forest biophysical property would provide considerable guidance for making beneficial decisions.

JO  - 42nd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2021
PY  - 2021
AB  - Manual and uneven distribution of hydro-meteorological stations, offline data, high cost of modeling software and state-owned stations' data, lack of trust in technology, and lack of expert knowledge, are the barriers that exist in most developing countries, which evade inclusion of hydrological modeling approaches for water resources management. As a solution for this, an open sensor network has been deployed in the Deduru Oya river basin of Sri Lanka to utilize open big data in the effective management of water resources. In absence of pre-determined parameter values for the river basin, the sub-catchment level parameter values for both wet and dry periods and daily and hourly time-steps have been estimated through inverse modeling approach, by way of fitting model simulations to observations. The model has been customized to utilize the estimated data of the weather generator to prevent the underutilization of open data in the stage of model stabilization. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Geographical information systems (GIS) are the systems that store location-based data and analyze them. GIS originated from the conventional cartographic techniques of simply drawing maps with a pencil and board. Following the adoption of computer technology, GIS further evolved as a geo-referenced dynamic information system, which can today be considered as a multi-disciplinary instrument that links different disciplines like geography, computer science, remote sensing, civil engineering, statistics, marketing, and other social and behavioral sciences. In this chapter, GIS is defined and its importance and functions are described in detail. Usage of GIS in marketing is explained, especially its development in marketing theory. Also, the value and scope of GIS in tourism management with a view to understand the spread of GIS applications in tourism is explored.

TI  - Analysis Of Forest Landscape Restoration Based On Landscape Connectivity: A Case Study In The Yi River Basin, China, During 2015-2020
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landscape connectivity has widely been recognized as one of the key objectives in studies of forest landscape management, ecological conservation and construction. Protecting virgin forests and afforesting marginal cropland are two long-term ecological projects in China. However, along with rapid urbanization and industrialization in China, the relationship between landscape connectivity and forest landscape restoration (FLR) has not been fully explored. The emergent question concerns whether the connectivity of a restored forest landscape could benefit the local flora and fauna. We evaluated the status of FLR in the Yi River watershed based on remote sensing images during 2015-2020. The forest landscape connectivity (FLC) was investigated using landscape connectivity indicators, applying the theory of landscape connectivity. We also examined the variations of FLC under different landform types (hills and low mountains) according to distance threshold values ranging from 100 m to 20,000 m. The most appropriate distance thresholds for analyzing FLC in hills and low mountains are 500 m and 100 m, respectively. The results showed that in this period, the FLC in low mountains was increased, whereas that of hills was decreased. The contributions for reforested patches on the improvement of the FLC were evaluated. In hills, patches that made "very high" and "high" contributions to improve the FLC occupied 15.6\% of the total reforested area, whereas the proportion in low mountains was 25.5\%. The results indicated that although rainfed cropland patches have been converted to forest patches, some of them have made small contributions to the FLC. Through this case study, we hope to have confirmed that landscape connectivity analysis could be used as a criterion for selecting important patches in the planning of FLR. Moreover, we have introduced this implementable method for future ecological restoration management programs.

TI  - Study On Spatial Pattern Of Land-Use Change In China During 1995-2000
JO  - Science in China, Series D: Earth Sciences
PY  - 2003
AB  - It is more and more acknowledged that land-use/cover dynamic change has become a key subject urgently to be dealt with in the study of global environmental change. Supported by the Landsat TM digital images, spatial patterns and temporal variation of land-use change during 1995-2000 are studied in the paper. According to the land-use dynamic degree model, supported by the 1km GRID data of land-use change and the comprehensive characters of physical, economic and social features, a dynamic regionalization of land-use change is designed to disclose the spatial pattern of land-use change processes. Generally speaking, in the traditional agricultural zones, e.g., Huang-Huai-Hai Plains, Yangtze River Delta and Sichuan Basin, the built-up and residential areas occupy a great proportion of arable land, and in the interlock area of farming and pasturing of northern China and the oases agricultural zones, the reclamation of arable land is conspicuously driven by changes of production conditions, economic benefits and climatic conditions. The implementation of "returning arable land into woodland or grassland" policies has won initial success in some areas, but it is too early to say that the trend of deforestation has been effectively reversed across China. In this paper, the division of dynamic regionalization of land-use change is designed for the sake of revealing the temporal and spatial features of land-use change and laying the foundation for the study of regional scale land-use changes. Moreover, an integrated study, including studies of spatial pattern and temporal process of land-use change, is carried out in this paper, which is an interesting try on the comparative studies of spatial pattern on change process and the change process of spatial pattern of land-use change.

TI  - Subpixel Monitoring Of The Seasonal Snow Cover With Modis At 250 M Spatial Resolution In The Southern Alps Of New Zealand: Methodology And Accuracy Assessment
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2009
AB  - This study describes a comprehensive method to produce routinely regional maps of seasonal snow cover in the Southern Alps of New Zealand (upper Waitaki basin) on a subpixel basis, and with the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The method uses an image fusion algorithm to produce snow maps at an improved 250 m spatial resolution in addition to the 500 m resolution snow maps. An iterative approach is used to correct imagery for both atmospheric and topographic effects using daily observations of atmospheric parameters. The computation of ground spectral reflectance enabled the use of image-independent end-members in a constrained linear unmixing technique to achieve a robust estimation of subpixel snow fractions. The accuracy of the snow maps and performance of the algorithm were assessed carefully using eight pairs of synchronic MODIS/ASTER images. 'Pixel-based' metrics showed that subpixel snow fractions were retrieved with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.8\% at 250 m spatial resolution and 5.1\% after aggregation at 500 m spatial resolution. In addition, a 'feature-based' metric showed that 90\% of the snowlines were depicted generally within 300 m and 200 m of their correct position for the 500-m and 250-m spatial resolution snow maps, respectively. A dataset of 679 maps of subpixel snow fraction was produced for the period from February 2000 to May 2007. These repeated observations of the seasonal snow cover will benefit the ongoing effort to model snowmelt runoff in the region and to improve the estimation and management of water resources.

TI  - Scheduling And Pricing Of Energy Generation And Storage In Power Systems
JO  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
PY  - 2018
AB  - This paper proposes a fundamental model for continuous-time scheduling and marginal pricing of energy generation and storage in day-ahead power systems operation. The paper begins with formulating the economic operation problem of power systems with generating units and energy storage (ES) devices as a continuous-time optimal control problem, where the Lagrange multiplier trajectory associated with the continuous-time power balance constraint is proven to be the marginal price of energy generation and storage. The marginal price is calculated in closed-form, which reveals that in addition to the incremental cost rates of generating units, the marginal price embeds the financial ES charging offers and discharging bids that are defined as incremental charging utility and incremental discharging cost rates. This paper shows that the adjoint function associated with the ES state equation establishes a temporal dependence between the marginal prices during the ES charge and discharge states. A function space-based method is developed to solve the proposed model, which converts the continuous-time problem into a mixed-integer linear programming problem with finite dimensional decision space. The features of the proposed scheduling and pricing models are demonstrated using numerical studies conducted on the IEEE Reliability Test System.

AB  - The river mouth areas, also known as the land-sea transition, occur on all continents of the Earth. When these environments present significant changes of exchange between the sweet and saline waters in the intertopic and subtropical bands, it can be said that there are two distinct ecosystems: marshes and mangroves. They occupy tropical, subtropical, and coastal areas. They go beyond productive ecological functions, shelter zones and animal habitats. Its environmental importance evidences them as a true "nursery" for several species found there, however, alarming rates warn of the suppression of marshes, mangroves and apicums. Such situations require immediate actions in the development of programs capable of encouraging and supporting ecosystemic research, with proposals for management plans, training of technical human resources and administrators, which, in addition to taking care of environmental education in its broadest sense, is also a form conservation of coastal resources. In this way, the importance of the study of mangroves and their features (Mangue and Apicum) can be perceived, since these are considered as important tropical coastal wetlands, since they allow a 8 constant exchange of water, nutrients, sediments and organisms, being this one of ecological value, providing goods and services that directly and indirectly serve human beings and coastal organisms. Recognizing the importance of the dynamics of vegetation destruction in this important ecosystem, we intend to further intensify research and preservation actions in these ecosystems. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

TI  - Sada-Net: A Shape Feature Optimization And Multiscale Context Information-Based Water Body Extraction Method For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
JO  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significance in remote sensing image mapping, and pixel-level representation allows refined results. Due to inconsistencies within a class and different scales of water bodies, the water body mapping has challenges, such as insufficient integrity and rough shape segmentation. To resolve these issues, we proposed an intelligent water bodies extraction method (named SADA-Net) for high-resolution remote sensing images. This method considers multiscale information, context dependence, and shape features. The network framework integrates three critical components: shape feature optimization (SFO), atrous spatial pyramid pooling, and dual attention modules. SADA-Net can accurately extract an extensive range of water bodies in complex scenarios. SADA-Net has certain advantages regarding small and dense water bodies extraction, as the SFO module effectively solves the defects of the unified processing of low-level features in the encoder stage of CNNs, which highlights the shape information of a water body. Two data types (red, green, and blue bands and multispectral images) are employed to verify the performance of the proposed network. The best result achieved an evaluation index F1-Score of 96.14\% in large-scale image segmentation, and the structural similarity index measure reached 94.70\%. Overall, the proposed method achieves the purpose of maximizing the integrity and optimizing the shape of a water body. Additionally, the SADA-Net proposed in this article has a specific reference value for high-resolution remote sensing image water bodies mapping.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Behind the needs of the availability for the mangrove trees biodiversity database are important in promoting coastal area protection, including mangrove forest conservation. This initiative started by mapping mangrove trees distribution by utilizing two different modes of ground detected ranged (GRD) and single look complex (SLC) of Sentinel-l data images. Both are processed to get the backscatter value, dual-polarization radar vegetation index (DpRVI) and polarization decomposition for entropy, alpha, and anisotropy values for each mangrove trees species (MTS) detection that compared with the data field. Besides that, the distribution of each mangrove tree has been conducted based on its genus and species richness that estimated using a random forest (RF) algorithm for nine different combinations, including VV, VH, and VV-VH, entropy, alpha, and anisotropy, DpRVI, and the integration of between backscatter value and polarization decomposition. The result has shown a variation in the level of accuracy ranging from weak to moderate at about 26% to 65%. The combination of VV, VH, VH-VV and DpRVI obtained better accuracy at about 65%. Related to the species of mangrove detected, the Avicennia alba becomes a dominant mangrove tree species grown as much as 60% in the study area. © 2021 IEEE.

TI  - Automated Water Surface Extraction In Satellite Images Using A Comprehensive Water Database Collection And Water Index Analysis
JO  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Monitoring water surface has become one of the most prominent areas of research in addressing environmental challenges. Accurate and automated detection of water surface in remote sensing images is crucial for disaster prevention, urban planning, and water resource management, particularly for a country where water plays a vital role in human life. However, achieving precise detection poses challenges. Previous studies have explored different approaches, such as analyzing water indexes, like normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from satellite imagery's visible or infrared bands and using k-means clustering analysis to identify land cover patterns and segment regions based on similar attributes. Nonetheless, challenges persist, notably distinguishing between water spectral signatures and cloud shadow or terrain shadow. In this study, our objective is to enhance the precision of water surface detection by constructing a comprehensive water database (DB) using existing digital and land cover maps. This database serves as an initial assumption for automated water index analysis. We utilized 1:5,000 and 1:25,000 digital maps of Korea to extract water surface, specifically rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Additionally, the 1:50,000 and 1:5,000 land cover maps of Korea aided in the extraction process. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing a water DB product as our first approach for efficient water surface extraction from satellite images, complemented by our second and third approaches involving NDWI analysis and k-means analysis. The image segmentation and binary mask methods were employed for image analysis during the water extraction process. To evaluate the accuracy of our approach, we conducted two assessments using reference and ground truth data that we made during this research. Visual interpretation involved comparing our results with the global surface water (GSW) mask 60 m resolution, revealing significant improvements in quality and resolution. Additionally, accuracy assessment measures, including an overall accuracy of 90\% and kappa values exceeding 0.8, further support the efficacy of our methodology. In conclusion, this study's results demonstrate enhanced extraction quality and resolution. Through comprehensive assessment, our approach proves effective in achieving high accuracy in delineating water surfaces from satellite images.

TI  - Anthropogenic Threats To Wetland Resources And Its Implication On Carbon Sequestration In Southwestern Ethiopia
JO  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Even though wetlands have been valued for their numerous ecosystem services and hydrological, ecological and habitat functions, its services have been threatened by its sudden losses. Nevertheless, the losses along its driving factors and the effects brought due to the loss have not been scientifically investigated. The study is geared to scrutinize anthropogenic threats to wetland resorces and its implication on carbon sequestration in southwestern Ethiopia. A combination of geospatial and socioeconomic data were utilized to attain the intended objectives. A total of 384 households were selected using simple random sampling technique from sample kebeles to assess the drivers of wetland degradations. Besides, to address the experimental work, the wetland was stratified, and soil samples were taken from three classes of wetlands viz., permanent wetlands (intact wetlands), semi disturbed wetlands and wetlands converted to agricultural land. From the total category of wetlands, 24 composite soil samples in five replications at a depth of 0-20 cm were collected. The result of Landsat imageries revealed that Wichi wetland area has been shrinking. It was 17.4\% of the area in 2001, while it declined to 3.1\% in 2021. The results of One-Way ANOVA indicated that there is a significant mean difference in soil organic carbon and sequestration capacities between different classes of wetlands at p<0.01 significance level.The organic carbon content of soils converted to agricultural land is very low. In intact/undisturbed wetlands, there is better carbon content than other states of wetlands. This triggers the wetlands to lack their pristine nature. To reverse these problems, integrated problem-solving approach through collaboration of stakeholdfrom policy level down to grassroots community is found to be essential for sustainable wetland management in the area.

TI  - Features Of Spatial Snag Distribution In A Beech-Fir Forest
JO  - CROATIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST ENGINEERING
PY  - 2011
AB  - With the participation of about 65\% in the total growing stock of conifers, silver fir is the most important and the best represented conifer species in Croatia. The increasing share of sanitary felling in the annual felling plans demands that special attention be paid to the health status of fir forests and the quantity of unplanned felling. This is the reason why dieback of silver fir in beech-fir forests in the Dinaric Alps is an acute and topical management-ecological problem. In the past 10 years, the share of total unplanned felling in the overall annual felling for fir has amounted to 57\%. Such a high share of unplanned yield (mainly snags) has had a negative effect on sustainable forest management. Determining the spatial distribution of damaged trees and snags, as well as their monitoring is one of the priorities of sustainable management. Hence, it is of utmost importance to detect less healthy stands and apply timely measures for the purpose of maintaining their vitality and productivity at an optimal level. Due to the seriously disturbed stand stability caused by forced canopy opening, which in turn affects the health condition and natural regeneration of the stand, it is necessary not only to detect snags but also determine the causes of dieback. According to the results of past research, increased tree dieback is associated with the impact of different site and stand characteristics (altitude, exposition, slope, soil, structure, etc.), as well as abiotic and biotic factors (fir needle moth, mistletoe); however, the real causes are yet to be discovered. It is difficult to make efficient snag inventories with standard field methods. For large areas, a remote sensing method (the application of CIR aerial photographs) is much more practical, more cost effective and more reliable. All research activities so far have proved that, in terms of accuracy, this method is equal to field working methods, while in terms of speed and objectivity it is far more efficient. Snag inventories by means of CIR aerial photography interpretation and GIS enable efficient enumeration (detection) and spatial distribution (mapping) of snags. The proposed method is highly important not only for the detection and monitoring of the occurrence, distribution and direction of dieback progress, but also for the detection of possible dieback causes, on the basis of which experts will prescribe adequate measures and treatments. The objective of CIR aerial photography interpretation is to determine the current situation and acquire an objective picture of forest condition (database) in as short a period as possible, while mapping on a color infrared digital orthophoto (DOP) is intended to provide the spatial distribution of snags for the surveyed area. An aerial survey of the Lika area with the CIR film (Forest Administration Gospic) was conducted in strips (Fig. 3). The coordinates of the start and finish points of aerial photogrammetric series in the associated zones of the Gauss-Kruger cartographic projection, as well as planned strip lengths, are given in the following survey (Table 1). A total of 88 aerial photographs were taken at an average scale of 1:6000 and longitudinal overlap of 60\%, which allows for the interpretation of individual trees in the stereomodel. As the total length of all the three strips amounted to 40,243 m (40.24 km), an area of 5,548 ha was surveyed. Since aerial photography provided an insight into the condition of the stands in the investigated area, and since the results obtained by photointerpretation of CIR aerial photograph indicated acute fir damage (the average damaged tree is 61.70\%), snag inventory (mapping) was undertaken. In the localities of fir forests, dieback was observed in the form of smaller or bigger groups of trees. Hence, areas of 1 ha (sample plots) were delineated on a random sample in the color infrared DOP (1:5000). All visible snags were then mapped in each area (Fig. 1). The central parts of the images were used to construct a DOP. The pixel size of each orthophoto is 0.5 m. According to the spatial snag distribution, the number of snags (density) per strip ranged between 23 and 105 per ha (Fig. 2). Since the values were not similar for all the plots, all the identified snags were mapped in the color infrared DOP. A total of 17,445 snags were mapped in the study area (Fig. 4). GIS was used to produce a cartographic presentation of spatial snag distribution along the survey strips. In order to produce a digital orthophoto, it was necessary to construct a digital relief model. Data for the DRsM were obtained by vectorizing the contour lines from the associated sheets of the Basic Map of Croatia (BMC) of 1:5000 scale and topographic maps (TM25) at a scale of 1:25000. Since individual tree mortality is a stochastic, rare and irregular event (Eid and Tuhus 2001) and since this is a karst terrain, slope variability in the study area is very high; therefore, it is not advisable to take into account the average slope in an area. As the same was also confirmed by the research of Antonic and Legovic (1999), Pernar (1997), and Bozic et al. (2004), the layers were generated from the DRIVE. Raster-GIS modeling provided the layers of slope and exposition. In this way, the values of altitude (Fig. 5), slope (Fig. 6) and exposition (Fig. 7) obtained by means of the DRM were assigned to every snag, in dependence of the location (position in space). An orthophoto and a digital relief model (DRIVE) were also entered into GIS as one of the layers, which enabled rapid spatial analysis and an efficient access to data (Fig. 8). Next, the obtained results were statistically analyzed and the data of spatial snag distribution and geomorphological features were processed. The most important result ensuing from the presented method of rapid snag inventory is the thematic maps, which present spatial snag distribution for the investigated area. Not only is field work very expensive and long-lasting (Boyle et al., 1998), but it is also extremely difficult in barely accessible terrains or on steep slopes. A method based on remote sensing (aerial or satellite images) considerably contributes to the solution of the afore mentioned problems and provides a more practical, less expensive and more reliable manner of enumerating dry trees and stands over large areas. In combination with GIS technology, the production of a map of spatial snag distribution takes 5-10 minutes per hectare of the inventoried area. Such maps provide an insight into the field condition and spatial snag distribution in a very short time. They can also be used as a basis for the calculation of mean snag density and for conducting a variety of analyses intended to predict efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects. Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution of snags is influenced by geomorphological features (terrain orientation, slope and altitude). Variance nalysis (F=278.79; p<0.001) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the spatial distribution of snags with regard to terrain orientation (exposition) and slope. According to the results, the number of snags increases in accordance with an increase in the slope on the north-eastern and northern exposition (Fig. 9). The Tukey HSD test proved that, in terms of slope, all terrain orientations are clearly differentiated in relation to the occurrence of snags, except the S and SE. This was expected, since the participation of fir in these expositions is lower. As for terrain orientation, there is also a statistically significant difference in terms of altitude (F=102.6; p<0.001). The results show that the number of snags in the E and NE exposition rises with an increase in altitude (Fig. 10). The results of statistical analysis should not be used to make one-sided conclusions based on the correlation between fir snag distribution and mezorelief features. Undoubtedly, however, the spatial distribution (location) of each single snag is conditioned by edaphic and micro-relief site characteristics (soil depth, skeletalness), i.e. total soil capacity for water retention in the rhizosphere zone. Pernar (2001) directly associates the productivity of fir stands with soil depth, while Bigler et al. (2004) use the increment of mature fir trees as a predictor of fir dieback. Research by Certini et al. (2000) also confirms soil depth as a direct and indirect (distribution and virulence of pathogenic fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fries.) Bref.)) factor of fir tree mortality. Taking into account the obtained results, a rapid and economic snag inventory is a must both for the needs of forest management and protection and for the needs of other scientific disciplines. At the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held on 2 October 2003, it was proposed that dry trees should be used as a new indicator of biodiversity, or in other words, that snags should have special ecological significance for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. It is, therefore, predicted that snag inventories will be undertaken with increasing frequency. In accordance with this, the proposed method could become an irreplaceable tool and a complement to standard field method. In addition, it has versatile applications, including national, regional or local forests taxation, certification processes, studies of site quality for animal species which depend on dry trees; classification of older stands, etc. The obtained results not only provided the current forest condition (inventory), but also indicated potential (focal points) and purpose of aerial surveys. Aerial photographs provide a survey of the field condition in a short time period, as well as allow for the possibility of planning efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects and evaluating dieback probability and rate. The results of the analyses enable the study of particular environmental features and their effects on forest dieback, as well as indicate the direction of future multidisciplinary research involving complex analyses of all environmental features. The results of the research are applicable primarily in the field of forest management, protection and harvesting, but they can also provide a basis for interpretations of events occurring in other fields.

TI  - Relationship Between Plant Species Diversity And Aboveground Biomass In Alpine Grasslands On The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau: Spatial Patterns And The Factors Driving Them
JO  - Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
PY  - 2023
AB  - Alpine grasslands are important ecosystems on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and are extremely sensitive to climate change. However, the spatial responses of plant species diversity and biomass in alpine grasslands to environmental factors under the background of global climate change have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, a random forest model was constructed using grassland ground monitoring data with satellite remote sensing data and environmental variables to characterize the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass of grasslands in the Three-River Headwaters Region within the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and analyze spatial variation in the relationship between the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass and their driving factors. The results show that (1) the selection of characteristic variables can effectively improve the accuracy of random forest models. The stepwise regression variable selection method was the most effective approach, with an R2 of 0.60 for the plant species diversity prediction model and 0.55 for the aboveground biomass prediction model, (2) The spatial distribution patterns of the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass in the study area were similar, they were both high in the southeast and low in the northwest and gradually decreased from east to west. The relationship between the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass varied spatially, they were mostly positively correlated (67.63%), but they were negatively correlated in areas with low and high values of plant species diversity and aboveground biomass, and (3) Analysis with geodetector revealed that longitude, average annual precipitation, and elevation were the main factors driving variation in the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass relationship. We characterized plant species diversity and aboveground biomass, as well as their spatial relationships, over a large spatial scale. Our data will aid biodiversity monitoring and grassland conservation management, as well as future studies aimed at clarifying the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

TI  - Mapping Fish Community Variables By Integrating Field And Satellite Data, Object-Based Image Analysis And Modeling In A Traditional Fijian Fisheries Management Area
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2011
AB  - The use of marine spatial planning for zoning multi-use areas is growing in both developed and developing countries. Comprehensive maps of marine resources, including those important for local fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, provide a crucial foundation of information for the planning process. Using a combination of field and high spatial resolution satellite data, we use an empirical procedure to create a bathymetric map (RMSE 1.76 m) and object-based image analysis to produce accurate maps of geomorphic and benthic coral reef classes (Kappa values of 0.80 and 0.63; 9 and 33 classes, respectively) covering a large (>260 km(2)) traditional fisheries management area in Fiji. From these maps, we derive per-pixel information on habitat richness, structural complexity, coral cover and the distance from land, and use these variables as input in models to predict fish species richness, diversity and biomass. We show that random forest models outperform five other model types, and that all three fish community variables can be satisfactorily predicted from the high spatial resolution satellite data. We also show geomorphic zone to be the most important predictor on average, with secondary contributions from a range of other variables including benthic class, depth, distance from land, and live coral cover mapped at coarse spatial scales, suggesting that data with lower spatial resolution and lower cost may be sufficient for spatial predictions of the three fish community variables.

TI  - Environmental And Political Implications Of Underestimated Cropland Burning In Ukraine
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Open burning is illegal in Ukraine, yet Ukraine has, on average, 300 times more fire activity per year (2001-2019) than most European countries. In 2016 and 2017, 47\% of Ukraine was identified as cultivated area, with a total of 70\% of land area dedicated to agricultural use. Over 57\% of all active fires in Ukraine detected using space-borne Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) during 2016 and 2017 were associated with pre-planting field clearing and post-harvest crop residue removal, meaning that the majority of these fires are preventable. Due to the small size and transient nature of cropland burns, satellite-based burned area (BA) estimates are often underestimated. Moreover, traditional spectral-based BA algorithms are not suitable for distinguishing burned from plowed fields, especially in the black soil regions of Ukraine. Therefore, we developed a method to estimate agricultural BA by calibrating VIIRS active fire data with exhaustively mapped cropland reference areas (42 958 fields). Our study found that cropland BA was significantly underestimated (by 30\%-63\%) in the widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based MCD64A1 BA product, and by 95\%-99.9\% in Ukraine's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Although crop residue burns are smaller and emit far less emissions than larger wildfires, reliable monitoring of crop residue burning has a number of important benefits, including (a) improving regional air quality models and the subsequent understanding of human health impacts due to the proximity of crop residue burns to urban locations, (b) ensuring an accurate representation of predominantly smaller fires in regional emission inventories, and (c) increasing awareness of often illegal managed open burning to provide improved decision-making support for policy and resource managers.

TI  - Land-Use Change And Cardiometabolic Risk Factors In An Urbanizing Area Of South India: A Population-Based Cohort Study
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
PY  - 2020
AB  - BACKGROUND: Land-use changes in city fringes due to urbanization can lead to a reduction of greenspace that may reduce its associated health benefits. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association between changes in residential surrounding built-up land use and cardiometabolic risk factors in an urbanizing pen -urban area of south India and explored the mediating roles of air pollution, physical activity, and stress in these associations. METHODS: We analyzed data on 6,039 adults from the third follow-up of the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parent Study (APCAPS) cohort (2010-2012). We generated trajectories of change in residential surrounding built-up land use (buffer areas) from 1995-2009 (stable, slow increase, fast increase) using remote sensing data and image classification methods. We estimated associations between built-up land use trajectories and natural log-transformed blood pressure, waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol using linear mixed models. We accounted for multiple mediators and the multilevel structure of the data in mediation analyses. RESULTS: We observed positive associations between a fast increase in built-up land use within 300 m of the home and all cardiometabolic risk factors. Compared with participants with stable trajectories, those with the largest increase in built-up land use had 1.5\% (95\% CI: 0.1, 2.9) higher systolic blood pressure, 2.4\% (95\% CI: 0.6, 4.3) higher diastolic blood pressure, 2.1\% (95\% CI: 0.5, 3.8) higher waist circumference, and 1.6\% (95\% CI: -0.6, 3.8) higher fasting glucose in fully adjusted models. Associations were positive, but not statistically significant, for triglycerides, fasting glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol. Physical activity and ambient particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) partially mediated the estimated associations. Associations between fast build-up and all cardiometabolic risk factors except non-HDL cholesterol were stronger in women than men. DISCUSSION: Increases in built-up land use surrounding residences were consistently associated with higher levels of cardiometabolic risk factors. Our findings support the need for better integration of health considerations in urban planning in rapidly urbanizing settings.

AB  - A brief summary is presented of a study on Geographic Information Systems; a full report on the study is being published elsewhere. At present, the benefits of satellite remote sensing within the U.K. are largely potential rather than established. A continuing need exists to explore ways of widening the topics to which remote sensing can be applied and to demonstrate the values of remote sensing in enabling existing tasks to be undertaken even more efficiently and cost effectively. Planning, managing and monitoring natural and cultural resources require timely information, the capability to update this information regularly-if not frequently, and the need to interrelate different sets of information for wise and objective decision making. All are prime areas for testing the utility of remote sensing within the operating environment of a geographic information system (GIS). © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Identifying Economically Relevant Forest Types From Global Satellite Data
JO  - Forest Policy and Economics
PY  - 2021
AB  - Satellite data offer a transformative view of global forest resources but observe a highly restricted set of forest attributes, limiting both theoretical and applied research. In response to this problem, we propose the use of ‘economic forests’ as analytical units and show how key characteristics of forests that determine human decision-making can be retrieved by combining open earth observation datasets. To operationalize the economic forest approach, we draw on classical microeconomic theory (von Thünen's land use model) to identify two economically relevant variables (market accessibility and forest productivity) that can be proxied in open earth observation data. We then post-process the Global Forest Change dataset (v1.5) to produce wall-to-wall maps of forest harvest for the period 2000–2015, obtain proxy measures of our two variables for a stratified random sample, and classify the resulting dataset of global forest harvest into categories of economic forest using Gaussian Mixture Models. We map the resulting categories, demonstrating a scalable and low-cost approach to analyzing global forest resources which captures key features that determine economic use. We employ this approach to empirically test Hyde's tripartite typology of global forest resources, circumventing the data challenge posed by the theoretical importance of spatial value functions, and find evidence that an expanded typology is required. We also produce a first approximation of Earth's economically inaccessible forests, drawing on previous mapping of Intact Forest Landscapes. To demonstrate the value of our approach for knowledge-discovery, we allocate FAOSTAT-reported timber supply for 23 European countries to the categories of economic forests we identify and employ these data to analyze the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek relationship in forestry. This exercise reveals plausible and significant relationships between production structure and comparative advantage that are obscured by aggregated data, providing direct evidence of the value of our approach. We conclude by discussing potential applications of the economic forests concept. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote Sensing For Assessing The Zone Of Benefit Where Deep Drains Improve Productivity Of Land Affected By Shallow Saline Groundwater
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2015
AB  - The installation of deep drains is an engineering approach to remediate land salinised by the influence of shallow groundwater. It is a costly treatment and its economic viability is, in part, dependent on the lateral extent to which the drain increases biological productivity by lowering water tables and soil salinity (referred to as the drains' zone of benefit). Such zones may be determined by assessing the biological productivity response of adjacent vegetation over time. We tested a multi-temporal satellite remote sensing method to analyse temporal and spatial changes in vegetation condition surrounding deep drainage sites at five locations in the Western Australian wheatbelt affected by dryland salinity-Morawa, Pithara, Beacon, Narembeen and Dumbleyung. Vegetation condition as a surrogate for biological productivity was assessed by Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the peak growing season. Analysis was at the site scale within a 1000 m buffer zone from the drains. There was clear evidence of NDVI increasing with elevation, slope and distance from the drain. After accounting for elevation, slope and distance from the drain, there was a significant increase in NDVI across the five locations after installation of deep drains. Changes in NDVI after drainage were broadly consistent with measured changes at each site in groundwater levels after installation of the deep drains. However, this study assessed the lateral extent of benefit for biological productivity and gave a measure of the area of benefit along the entire length of the drain. The method demonstrated the utility of spring NDVI images for rapid and relatively simple assessment of the change in site condition after implementation of drainage, but approaches for further improvement of the procedure were identified.

TI  - Air Pollution From Agricultural Fires Increases Hypertension Risk
JO  - Journal of Environmental Economics and Management
PY  - 2022
AB  - In many parts of the developing world, farmers widely use deliberate fires to burn vegetation and clear land to plant crops. These agricultural fires, however, are known to be associated with health costs due to increased air pollution. We contribute to underpinning the associated health cost estimates by studying the effects of these fires on hypertension risk. Despite being one of the leading causes of mortality globally, there is little direct evidence on how hypertension risk changes with exposure to pollution from agricultural fires. To overcome common data and empirical challenges in this setting, we match blood pressure readings from nearly 784,000 individuals across India with satellite data on 1.2 million agricultural fires, wind direction realizations, and local ambient air pollution. We find that the incidence of hypertension increases by 1.8% for each standard deviation increase in the number of upwind fires observed one day before the blood pressure readings. We find that the impact is stronger among older males, smokers, individuals that were already on blood pressure medication, and individuals belonging to socially marginalized groups. Our estimates suggest that agricultural fires in India lead to hypertension-related additional mortality, associated with USD 9 billion annually in costs. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Evapotranspiration Of Winter Wheat Estimated With The Fao 56 Approach And Ndvi Measurements In A Temperate Humid Climate Of Nw Europe
JO  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2017
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is the dominant user of global freshwater resources and improvements in water management are considered key to simultaneously enhance food production and to secure regional water resources. Irrigation management requires reliable estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ETa) which can be derived from tabulated crop coefficients and estimates of phenological stage lengths or alternatively from remotely sensed canopy data. In order to compare both approaches under sufficient nitrogen and water supply, field trials with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were performed in 2013/14 and 2014/15 at Duelmen, Germany. Crop growth dynamics were measured by a handspectrometer and leaf canopy analyzer, and phenological stages were recorded. ETa was calculated in two different ways: Firstly based on tabulated crop coefficients (K-c) and stage durations (FA-approach) and secondly based on remotely sensed K-c-values (NDVI-approach). Both approaches were used to calculate a daily field water balance (FWB) and compared with measured (FDR-techniques) dynamics of soil water content. Both ETa estimates predicted seasonal dynamics of the FWB reasonably good RMSE: 0.7, 0.6 (FA-approach); 0.6, 0.8 (NDVI-approach) in 2014 and 2015, respectively. ETa estimates of the FA approach for 2014 and 2015 were 403 mm and 430mm and exhibited larger between-year variation when the NDVI approach was used (377 mm and 463 mm). Agronomic water-use efficiencies varied between 1.93-2.76 g/I. The relevance of reliable in-field estimates of Kc-values and stage lengths was quantified with a sensitivity analysis. The results indicate that NDVI-based estimates of ETa can be used instead of ET., estimates which are based on tabulated Kc values and estimates of growth stage length. The use of NDVI-based estimates of ETa enables to apply irrigation water more site-specific. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Model-Data Synthesis In Terrestrial Carbon Observation: Methods, Data Requirements And Data Uncertainty Specifications
JO  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
PY  - 2005
AB  - Systematic, operational, long-term observations of the terrestrial carbon cycle (including its interactions with water, energy and nutrient cycles and ecosystem dynamics) are important for the prediction and management of climate, water resources, food resources, biodiversity and desertification. To contribute to these goals, a terrestrial carbon observing system requires the synthesis of several kinds of observation into terrestrial biosphere models encompassing the coupled cycles of carbon, water, energy and nutrients. Relevant observations include atmospheric composition (concentrations of CO2 and other gases); remote sensing; flux and process measurements from intensive study sites; in situ vegetation and soil monitoring; weather, climate and hydrological data; and contemporary and historical data on land use, land use change and disturbance (grazing, harvest, clearing, fire). A review of model-data synthesis tools for terrestrial carbon observation identifies 'nonsequential' and 'sequential' approaches as major categories, differing according to whether data are treated all at once or sequentially. The structure underlying both approaches is reviewed, highlighting several basic commonalities in formalism and data requirements. An essential commonality is that for all model-data synthesis problems, both nonsequential and sequential, data uncertainties are as important as data values themselves and have a comparable role in determining the outcome. Given the importance of data uncertainties, there is an urgent need for soundly based uncertainty characterizations for the main kinds of data used in terrestrial carbon observation. The first requirement is a specification of the main properties of the error covariance matrix. As a step towards this goal, semi-quantitative estimates are made of the main properties of the error covariance matrix for four kinds of data essential for terrestrial carbon observation: remote sensing of land surface properties, atmospheric composition measurements, direct flux measurements, and measurements of carbon stores.

TI  - Landscape Resistance Index Aiming At Functional Forest Connectivity
JO  - Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
PY  - 2023
AB  - Resistance models may quantify the ability of the landscape to impede species’ movement and represent suitable habitats. Moreover, the performance of resistance models parameterized by land-use/land cover attributes evidence that the integrity of the environments subject to urban sprawl is poorly understood. In this sense, the study assumed we could identify the forest functional connectivity in a landscape considering the disparity in the landscape mosaic. In this context, we sought to develop a landscape resistance index through structural equation modeling (SEM), supported by the criteria of heat emission, biomass, and anthropogenic barriers, obtained by remote sensing, called observed variables. The landscape studied in the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve of São Paulo has significant remnants of the Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot. However, our results indicated criteria variability in the landscape modeled through the SEM, obtaining a significant adjustment of the landscape resistance index, with comparative fit index (CFI) of 1.00 and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.00. The index reflects the resistance levels of the land use/land cover, expressed by the class interval, ranging from 0% (1.73) to 100% (493.88), with the highest values associated with the anthropized uses and forest isolation. Thus, our index based on environmental attributes reflects the structure of functional forest connectivity and offers a framework to design forest corridors across landscapes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Thermal And Economic Modeling And Optimization Of Solar-Assisted Underfloor Heating System Considering Hourly Analysis
JO  - Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry
PY  - 2022
AB  - In this paper, a new configuration for heating of the space based on solar energy is introduced. To have an efficient system as well as a space with more comfort, underfloor heating is suggested and source of heat for the underfloor system is provided by solar thermal collectors. For more accuracy, both heating system and space are modeled and hourly analysis during a year is performed. To have an economic configuration, total annual cost (TAC) of the system is minimized by adjusting seven design parameters including number of underfloor panels, tube length, inside radius of the tube, volume flow rate, storage tank capacity, solar collector surface area, and capacity of auxiliary heater. The optimum results show that the volume flow rate of working fluid and inside tube radius in each panel selected at the upper bound of their range. Hourly analysis shows that because of lowest solar radiation in December, the maximum fluctuation in auxiliary heating is observed which leads to the higher operational cost. The optimum TAC is obtained at 11,173 $/year which can be performed in ordinary buildings. Finally, the proposed solar underfloor heating system shows a 39.55% reduction in annual cost as compared with the conventional heating system which is significant. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability In White Shark (<I>Carcharodon Carcharias</I>) Movement Ecology During Residency And Migration Phases In The Western North Atlantic
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2021
AB  - Understanding how mobile, marine predators use three-dimensional space over time is central to inform management and conservation actions. Combining tracking technologies can yield powerful datasets over multiple spatio-temporal scales to provide critical information for these purposes. For the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), detailed movement and migration information over ontogeny, including inter- and intra-annual variation in timing of movement phases, is largely unknown in the western North Atlantic (WNA), a relatively understudied area for this species. To address this need, we tracked 48 large juvenile to adult white sharks between 2012 and 2020, using a combination of satellite-linked and acoustic telemetry. Overall, WNA white sharks showed repeatable and predictable patterns in horizontal movements, although there was variation in these movements related to sex and size. While most sharks undertook an annual migratory cycle with the majority of time spent over the continental shelf, some individuals, particularly adult females, made extensive forays into the open ocean as far east as beyond the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Moreover, increased off-shelf use occurred with body size even though migration and residency phases were conserved. Summer residency areas included coastal Massachusetts and portions of Atlantic Canada, with individuals showing fidelity to specific regions over multiple years. An autumn/winter migration occurred with sharks moving rapidly south to overwintering residency areas in the southeastern United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, where they remained until the following spring/summer. While broad residency and migration periods were consistent, migratory timing varied among years and among individuals within years. White sharks monitored with pop-up satellite-linked archival tags made extensive use of the water column (0-872 m) and experienced a broad range of temperatures (-0.9 - 30.5 degrees C), with evidence for differential vertical use based on migration and residency phases. Overall, results show dynamic inter- and intra-annual three-dimensional patterns of movements conserved within discrete phases. These results demonstrate the value of using multiple tag types to track long-term movements of large mobile species. Our findings expand knowledge of the movements and migration of the WNA white shark population and comprise critically important information to inform sound management strategies for the species.

TI  - An Integrated Approach Of Machine Learning And Remote Sensing For Evaluating Landslide Hazards And Risk Hotspots, Nw Himalaya
JO  - Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment
PY  - 2024
AB  - Landslides have become more frequent in the last decade in the NW Himalayan region, threatening people and damaging infrastructure. The study presented here aims to identify landslide hazards and risk hotspots in the NW Himalaya. The area is strategically important due the many holy pilgrimage sites and major hydropower projects. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) was used to generate the landslide susceptibility map, which was combined with the rainfall intensity map to create the hazard map. To determine the spatial landslide vulnerability, land use and land cover components were taken into account with their respective monetary values. The landslide risk map is the combination of landslide hazard and vulnerability maps, showing that ∼5% of the area falls in high and very high-risk zones, ∼6% in moderate, ∼47% in low, and ∼42% in very low landslide risk zones. High to very high landslide risk zones are mainly confined to Uttarkashi and its surroundings in the southwestern part of the study area, as well as the Tehri, Karanprayag, and Pithoragarh regions in the southern area. Societal risk was also analyzed and revealed that ∼53% of the human population resides in high to very high landslide risk-prone areas. The findings of this study will be beneficial for promoting sustainable development and safe urbanization in the Himalayan region, if used for planning. © 2024

TI  - Economic Impact Of Plantain Ripening: A Case Study Among Plantain Traders In Accra
JO  - International Journal of Fruit Science
PY  - 2023
AB  - Over 70% of plantain produced in Ghana is traded along the fresh market which is a hotspot for postharvest loss. This study sought to assess the economic impact of plantain ripening among traders in three satellite markets of Accra. Using the interview technique, primary data was obtained from 320 respondents within 3 satellite markets. Ripening was found to increase the market value of plantain whereas over-ripening reduced the market value of plantain. Money to the tune of over two million cedis (one hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars) was lost by weekly plantain retailers and suppliers in the three satellite markets. Poor road network and market environment were the key causes of postharvest of plantain amongst traders in the 3 satellite markets. Two identified solution gaps that can curb the accrued loss along the plantain supply chain include the provision of tailored business development services to plantain traders and the development of marketable food applications of over-ripe plantain that advances the circular economy agenda. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - The Study Of Depopulated Historical Ensembles In The Province Of Teruel: A Tool To Map, Protect And Conserve Their Vernacular Heritage And Identity
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2020
AB  - There are 23 rural historical ensembles listed as BIC in the province of Teruel, one of the most depopulated areas in Spain. On the one hand, the lack of economic and demographic pressure in this region has made it possible to preserve many of the typological features of their vernacular architecture. On the other hand, the loss of permanent inhabitants and skilled craftsmanship practitioners has led to a worrying lack of maintenance and abandonment, which threatens their future conservation. The Cultural Heritage Department (Gobierno de Aragón) has been promoting several studies aimed at the protection of 6 different listed case-studies (Albalate del Arzobispo, Calaceite, Rubielos de Mora, Mirambel, Beceite and Teruel). Despite being very small, municipalities are the only competent bodies for the elaboration of the Special Protection master plans of each HE, according to Urban Planning and Cultural Heritage legislation. Hence, the primary purpose of these studies is to support them by analysing their heritage significance and singularities so they can use them as the base for master plans. They will also help raise awareness of their cultural values among local communities, while avoiding the mere conservation of empty urban and rural landscapes. The methodology comprises the identification, analysis and diagnosis of the heritage values that build their identity, thanks to a thorough inventory of all the vernacular constructive techniques, components and zones with a distinguishable character within the urban tissue and its environment. © Authors 2020.

TI  - Toward A Carbon Neutral Campus: A Scalable Approach To Estimate Carbon Storage And Biosequestration, An Example From University Of Michigan
JO  - International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education
PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose: The University of Michigan (U-M) is planning its course toward carbon neutrality. A key component in U-M carbon accounting is the calculation of carbon sinks via estimation of carbon storage and biosequestration on U-M landholdings. Here, this paper aims to compare multiple remote sensing methods across U-M natural lands and urban campuses to determine the accurate and efficient protocol for land assessment and ecosystem service valuation that other institutions may scale as relevant. Design/methodology/approach: This paper tested three remote sensing methods to determine land use and land cover (LULC), namely, unsupervised classification, supervised classification and supervised classification incorporating delineated wetlands. Using confusion matrices, this paper tested remote sensing approaches to ground-truthed data, the paper obtained via field-based vegetation surveys across a subset of U-M landholdings. Findings: In natural areas, supervised classification incorporating delineated wetlands was the most accurate and efficient approach. In urban settings, maps incorporating institutional knowledge and campus tree surveys better estimated LULC. Using LULC and literature-based carbon data, this paper estimated that U-M lands store 1.37–3.68 million metric tons of carbon and sequester 45,000–86,000 Mt CO2e/yr, valued at $2.2m–$4.3m annually ($50/metric ton, social cost of carbon). Originality/value: This paper compared methods to identify an efficient and accurate remote sensing methodology to identify LULC and estimate carbon storage, biosequestration rates and economic values of ecosystem services provided. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Cubesat-Derived Detection Of Seagrasses Using Planet Imagery Following Unmixing-Based Denoising: Is Small The Next Big?
PY  - 2017
AB  - Seagrasses are one of the most productive and widespread yet threatened coastal ecosystems on Earth. Despite their importance, they are declining due to various threats, which are mainly anthropogenic. Lack of data on their distribution hinders any effort to rectify this decline through effective detection, mapping and monitoring. Remote sensing can mitigate this data gap by allowing retrospective quantitative assessment of seagrass beds over large and remote areas. In this paper, we evaluate the quantitative application of Planet high resolution imagery for the detection of seagrasses in the Thermaikos Gulf, NW Aegean Sea, Greece. The low Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), which characterizes spectral bands at shorter wavelengths, prompts the application of the Unmixing-based denoising (UBD) as a pre-processing step for seagrass detection. A total of 15 spectral-temporal patterns is extracted from a Planet image time series to restore the corrupted blue and green band in the processed Planet image. Subsequently, we implement Lyzenga's empirical water column correction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to evaluate quantitative benefits of denoising. Denoising aids detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass species by increasing its producer and user accuracy by 31.7\% and 10.4\%, correspondingly, with a respective increase in its Kappa value from 0.3 to 0.48. In the near future, our objective is to improve accuracies in seagrass detection by applying more sophisticated, analytical water column correction algorithms to Planet imagery, developing time-and cost-effective monitoring of seagrass distribution that will enable in turn the effective management and conservation of these highly valuable and productive ecosystems.

TI  - The Eu And Esa Rules On Public Procurement
JO  - Routledge Handbook of Commercial Space Law
PY  - 2023
AB  - Activities in the space sector are often still the domain of states. Despite the growth of privately funded space endeavours and the growing commercialisation of the sector, frequently described as NewSpace, major space projects continued to be procured by public entities or intergovernmental organisations in order to implement public space policies. For over 35 years, ESA mainly performed this task for its Member States with the exception of purely national, often military, programmes. As direct benefit for their financial contributions, ESA Member States received a “fair return” in the form of contracts awarded by ESA to national industries of the member states participating in the organisation’s optional programmes. Today more than ever space projects constitute an important tool for implementing political and socio-economic goals and policies. Already in the beginning of the new millennium the EU realised the potential of space activities with regard to the implementation of numerous policies of the Union. The development of an EU space policy was the decisive step that elevated space projects to a new economic level in the Union. With their growing economic importance space projects came to share the fate of most other subjects of public procurement: public procurement regulations. Under the traditional ESA procurement rules the most dominant aspect of procurement was the implementation of the required geographical return quota. With the EU stepping onto the stage, procurement in space projects is, however, now subjected to the strict EU procurement regime. The first project to come into contact with such procedures was Galileo – Europe’s highly ambitious undertaking to establish its own independent global satellite navigation system. The Galileo procurement process may well be the most complicated procurement undertaking one could possibly envisage as the premiere for applying EU procurement rules to space projects. This premiere heralded a new era for public procurement in the space sector. With it grew the understanding that a number of aspects well established on ESA level for many years may indeed prove useful also for the EU projects, however mostly in view of the contractual terms, not subject to this chapter, such as conditional stage payment contracts, rather than the core procurement process which still has to follow the EU Financial Regulation as main legal basis. Accordingly, for economic operators to successfully play an active role in space projects they more than ever have to understand the intricacies of the procurement regulations they have to operate under. This chapter sets out the two international procurement regimes of importance for companies intending to participate in Europe’s public space projects. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Lesley Jane Smith, Ingo Baumann, and Susan-Gale Wintermuth; individual chapters, the contributors.

TI  - Eucalyptus Forest Plantation Assessment Of Vegetation Health Using Satellite Remote Sensing Techniques
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Early examination of the water condition of the plants utilizing remote sensing technology can be used to assess the health of the vegetation in the Eucalyptus forest plantation. To preserve a sustainable wood supply and wooded region that is necessary to human life and vital wood supplies, the forested region should be protected from disease and environmental damage. Disease and environmental impacts are two of the most critical challenges in Eucalyptus forest management. To calculate the vegetation index and identify land cover in the research region, remote sensing with Catalyst Professional software based on Object Analyst (OBIA) tools was utilized. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a valuable index for assessing early vegetation health. For atmospheric correction and haze removal, the image was first pre-processed with ATCOR tools. Second, the image was converted to NDVI using algorithm library tools. In addition, for land cover classification in the area, an OBIA based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized, followed by an accuracy assessment. Using ArcGIS software, zonal statistics were used to calculate the NDVI value for each land cover category. According to the method, the map produced roads, plantations, buildings, low-density vegetation, oil palm, and open area classifications. Based on accuracy assessment in OBIA, plantation, oil palm, and open area were all 100% accurate, whereas low-density vegetation and oil palm were 100% accurate according to the user. Producer accuracy was lowest on roads, whereas user accuracy was lowest in open areas. Non-vegetated land is difficult to classify at this site, according to the accuracy assessment results. The map improved accuracy since the study used a lower segmentation scale factor of 50, which produced fine vectors ascribed for classification. The average NDVI for oil palm area was 0.71, and 0.69 for plantation. Because it was difficult to classify open areas and roads, the NDVI for the class was low, at 0.37 and 0.22, respectively. From land use classification, the plantation was classified (37%), low-density vegetation area (28%), and oil palm (21%). Others make up only 2 to 7% of the site's overall area. According to the study, NDVI is a useful indicator for assessing the health of vegetation in areas where NDVI values are larger than 0.70 and presents pf mixed landscape and non-vegetated features. A higher NDVI value implies that the plant is in good enough shape to conduct photosynthetic activities thus producing biomass for sustaining vegetation health. This type of inquiry can forecast more indices to produce higher accuracy of land use maps for the Eucalyptus plantation. At the same time, this type of research can assist forest managers in detecting large areas in their plantation for vegetation health assessment such as for early disease detection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Economic Evaluations Of Commonly Used Structured Psychotherapies For Major Depressive Disorder And Generalized Anxiety Disorder: A Systematic Review
JO  - Canadian Psychology
PY  - 2018
AB  - Face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are time-limited, structured psychotherapies recommended for the management of adult major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the reporting and methodological quality, and cost-effectiveness of economic evaluations that examined these two thoroughly researched psychotherapies. Economic studies were retrieved through systematic searches of bibliographic databases (e.g., Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO: January 2000 to February 2018) and grey literature. The reporting and methodological quality of the studies was independently evaluated by two reviewers using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist and Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) tool. The cost-effectiveness results were qualitatively synthesized. Fifteen out of 161 identified economic evaluations were included: 14 examined CBT and one IPT. None was conducted in Canada. Based on the CHEERS criteria, overall reporting quality of the included studies was good. Eighty-seven percent of the included studies were of high quality based on the QHES criteria. Most of these studies examined the cost-effectiveness of individually delivered CBT (alone or with pharmacotherapy) over a short time horizon. CBT represented good value for money at different country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds. The cost-effectiveness of IPT was uncertain. In conclusion, the quality of economic analyses examining structured psychotherapies is good. Face-to-face CBT represents good value for money in the management of adult MDD and GAD though no study was done in Canada. The long-term cost-effectiveness of the group versus individual format remains unclear and warrants further research. © 2018 Canadian Psychological Association.; La thérapie interpersonnelle (IPT) et la thérapie cognitivocomportementale (CBT) face à face sont des psychothérapies structurées et limitées dans le temps pour la gestion des troubles dépressifs graves (MDD) et les troubles d'anxiété généralisés (GAD). Nous avons effectué un examen systématique pour évaluer la qualité des méthodologies et des rapports ainsi que la rentabilité des évaluations économiques portant sur ces deux psychothérapies abondamment étudiées. Les études économiques ont été retrouvées grâce à des recherches systématiques des bases de données bibliographiques (p. ex., Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO: janvier 2000 à février 2018) et de la littérature grise. La qualité des méthodologies et des rapports a été évaluée de façon indépendante par deux examinateurs au moyen de la liste de contrôle Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) et de l'outil Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES). La synthèse des résultats de rentabilité était de nature qualitative. Quinze des 161 évaluations économiques identifiées ont été incluses: 14 ont examiné la CBT et une a évalué la IPT. Aucune des études n'a été réalisée au Canada. En se basant sur les critères CHEERS, la qualité générale des rapports des études incluses était bonne. Quatrevingt- sept pour cent des études incluses étaient de haute qualité en se basant sur les critères QHES. La majorité de ces études examinaient la rentabilité des CBT administrées individuellement (seules ou avec pharmacothérapie) sur une courte période. La CBT représente un bon rapport qualité-prix à différents seuils de disposition à payer, spécifiques à chaque pays. La rentabilité de la IPT s'est révélée incertaine. En conclusion, la qualité des analyses économiques examinant les psychothérapies structurées est bonne. La CBT face à face revêt un bon rapport qualité-prix pour ce qui est de la gestion de la MDD et de la GAD chez les adultes, bien qu'aucune n'ait été réalisée au Canada. La rentabilité à long terme du groupe versus le format individuel demeure obscure et nécessiterait des recherches plu poussées. © 2018 Canadian Psychological Association.

TI  - Multiband Sar Data For Rangeland Pasture Monitoring
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2016
AB  - Rangelands in Australia cover approximately 80 percent of the continent and include a diverse group of relatively undisturbed ecosystems such as tropical savannas, woodlands, shrublands and grasslands. It is important to monitor and understand change in the rangelands so that effective actions can be taken to maintain ecological, economic and social values in Australia. Efficient use of feed resources in the livestock industries of Australia is a major factor in determining farm profitability and sustainability. With limited information, many producers forego potential production because of ineffective management of their feed resources. Further, poor management can also lead to environmental degradation. Therefore, CSIRO have invested to investigate, develop and validate new methodologies for integration of remote sensing data with in-situ field measurements, in order to map the dynamics in aboveground plant biomass in forests, crops, grassland and rangelands of Australia. Pasture biomass mapping is a main component of this project given rangelands the majority of Australia. Due to good sensitive to diverse rangelands in tropical and subtropical regions, multi-band SAR data for pasture mapping are investigated in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Monitoring Hydrological Patterns Of Temporary Lakes Using Remote Sensing And Machine Learning Models: Case Study Of La Mancha Humeda Biosphere Reserve In Central Spain
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2016
AB  - The Biosphere Reserve of La Mancha Humeda is a wetland-rich area located in central Spain. This reserve comprises a set of temporary lakes, often saline, where water level fluctuates seasonally. Water inflows come mainly from direct precipitation and runoff of small lake watersheds. Most of these lakes lack surface outlets and behave as endorheic systems, where water withdrawal is mainly due to evaporation, causing salt accumulation in the lake beds. Remote sensing was used to estimate the temporal variation of the flooded area in these lakes and their associated hydrological patterns related to the seasonality of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images for the reference period 2013-2015 were jointly used with ground-truth datasets. Several inverse modeling methods, such as two-band and multispectral indices, single-band threshold, classification methods, artificial neural network, support vector machine and genetic programming, were applied to retrieve information on the variation of the flooded areas. Results were compared to ground-truth data, and the classification errors were evaluated by means of the kappa coefficient. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the genetic programming approach yielded the best results, with a kappa value of 0.98 and a total error of omission-commission of 2\%. The dependence of the variations in the water-covered area on precipitation and evaporation was also investigated. The results show the potential of the tested techniques to monitor the hydrological patterns of temporary lakes in semiarid areas, which might be useful for management strategy-linked lake conservation and specifically to accomplish the goals of both the European Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive.

TI  - Movements Of Satellite Tracked Magellanic Penguins (<I>Spheniscus Magellanicus</I>) In A Wintering Area In Southern Brazil
JO  - OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Food availability and oceanographic conditions drive the distribution and movement of marine vertebrates. Tracking efforts towards seabirds usually focus on their breeding period, tagging adults in colonies. In this study, we tracked four juvenile and one adult Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) with satellite transmitters. These individuals were caught incidentally in gillnets and were tagged at sea, with the exception of the adult that was rehabilitated and released on the beach. The penguins were tracked in their wintering grounds, where behavior and oceanographic characteristics of the area used were determined. All five birds remained along the coast of southern Brazil and Uruguay in neritic waters up to 10 km offshore and 50 m in depth. The four juveniles used a mean area of 1,426 km(2), travelling on average at 7.4 km/h. The high turning angles observed and mean sinuosity of 2.46 indicated that the penguins were foraging. The adult penguin covered an area of 1,033 km(2), at a mean speed of 4.6 km/h, and with low sinuosity (0.43), which is suggestive of either travelling movements or an experienced hunter who needs a few turning angles to forage. The adult travelled 538 km in total, reaching a maximal distance of 465 km. Locations were obtained over a period of 7-10 days, and all five penguins remained in waters of the coastal branch of the Malvinas Current, an area characterized by cold sea surface temperatures (SST, mean = 13.4 ?) and high primary productivity. Salinity values (34.06 PSU) were also typical of the Malvinas Current and were influenced by the La Plata River plume, whose waters are low in salinity and nutrient rich. All five penguins remained near the coast probably because these waters are rich in nutrients, and carry the penguins' main prey, the Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita). Regarding conservation concerns involving these penguins, we highlight the current management of the anchovy fisheries and the development of offshore windfarms that could potentially cause major disturbances to the penguins' foraging habitat. The establishment of the Albarda \& SIM;o National Park in the nearshore area used by the penguins is highly desirable for the protection of the species and their feeding resources.

TI  - Monitoring Atmospheric Effects Of Hydraulic Fracturing Using Remote Sensing: Tracking Fracking
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2015
AB  - Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is an unconventional gas extraction technique that enables the exploitation of new gas and oil reserves in subterranean shale deposits. Increasing energy demands in the developed and developing countries, improvements of extraction techniques, and the emphasis on national energy independence have driven the growth of hydraulic fracturing worldwide. In 2009, the United States (U.S.) became the world's leading producer of natural gas from its steady increase in shale resource exploitation. The environmental effects of unconventional oil and gas extraction are the subject of an emotional debate among local citizens, legislators, government regulatory bodies, and the oil and gas industry. Claims that hydraulic fracturing causes harmful atmospheric emissions, groundwater and soil pollution, and earthquakes have not been decisively addressed because of the absence of systematic analysis and monitoring of hydraulic fracturing impacts. Natural gas is known as a clean fuel, emitting fewer greenhouse gases than alternatives such as coal. However, unmonitored methane leakage from hydraulic fracturing sites may counteract the benefits of natural gas use. This paper provides an approach for monitoring the atmospheric effects of the hydraulic fracturing process. We focus on methane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone, and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and we use the state of Ohio as a test case. We propose a multi-platform monitoring system using existing and future satellite instrumentation, which can be implemented anywhere on Earth, and a roadmap to guide rollout of the proposal. When our proposed monitoring system is implemented, citizens and decision makers will have access to accurate data to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of hydraulic fracturing.

TI  - Land Use Change Assessment And Water Quality Of Ephemeral Ponds For Irrigation In The North West Province, South Africa
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
PY  - 2018
AB  - In the semi-arid environments of the North West province of South Africa the amount, timing, and distribution of rainfall is irregular, while water accessibility is a key factor in production. In line with this, a study was conducted to assess the impact of land use change on water quality and water depth within the sub-catchment areas of ephemeral ponds. To determine land use dynamics, 2004 and 2013 Landsat images were classified using maximum likelihood algorithm. Pond water quality was analysed for physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters using standard the American Public Health Association (APHA) methods. Multiple linear regression models were computed to determine relationships between land use changes and water quality parameters. Results revealed a reduction in grass cover, whereas built-up areas increased at the expense of bare land. All the values for the physical characteristics were higher than the recommended Department of Water Affairs (DWAF) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) limits, but chemical parameters, except cadmium, were within limits. Regression showed that bare areas have a positive effect on Escherichia coli (E. coli) in ephemeral pond water. The study highlights the suitability of pond water for irrigation to increase crop production and the effects of land use changes on ecosystems as critical for proper catchment planning, water resource management, and food security.

TI  - A System For Household Enumeration And Reidentification In Densely Populated Slums To Facilitate Community Research, Education, And Advocacy
JO  - PLoS ONE
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: We devised and implemented an innovative Location-Based Household Coding System (LBHCS) appropriate to a densely populated informal settlement in Mumbai, India. Methods and Findings: LBHCS codes were designed to double as unique household identifiers and as walking directions; when an entire community is enumerated, LBHCS codes can be used to identify the number of households located per road (or lane) segment. LBHCS was used in community-wide biometric, mental health, diarrheal disease, and water poverty studies. It also facilitated targeted health interventions by a research team of youth from Mumbai, including intensive door-to-door education of residents, targeted follow-up meetings, and a full census. In addition, LBHCS permitted rapid and low-cost preparation of GIS mapping of all households in the slum, and spatial summation and spatial analysis of survey data. Conclusion: LBHCS was an effective, easy-to-use, affordable approach to household enumeration and re-identification in a densely populated informal settlement where alternative satellite imagery and GPS technologies could not be used. © 2014 Thomson et al.

TI  - The Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring Sites: A Utility Assessment
JO  - International Journal of Global Environmental Issues
PY  - 2003
AB  - Ecological research sites generate data which are potentially useful at the national, regional and global scales. However, most of the data remain embedded in local, project-specific research programmes. The primary role of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) is to act as a data broker and bring researchers and modellers together in order to better understand global change processes in areas such as climate change and biodiversity. The Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring Sites (TEMS) database is a GTOS-led effort to enhance the ability of sites to collaborate and provide a framework for researchers, resource managers and decision makers who seek data to support their efforts at the regional and global levels. Early in 2002, a user survey was carried out to assess the use of the TEMS database, the adequacy of geographic coverage and identify future user requirements. The survey also assessed the utility of specific features within the website such as the environmental variables methodology sheets, the search engines and the dynamic map interface. The results confirmed that TEMS contains useful information which can be easily accessed. The registered sites are under-represented, on both an eco-regional and continental basis, in all geographic areas except for Europe and Northern America. Data sharing, including satellite imagery, was indicated to be of high priority; however, free access to data remains a constraint in some regions. Finally, a focus on electronic solicitation and outreach should be continued.

TI  - Health Care And The Transcendent
JO  - Death Studies
PY  - 1989
AB  - This paper examines the values implicit in health care providers serving dying persons. It studies why providers should form a relationship with the dying person that is more human, less mechanistic, and less directed to that person as an economic unit or as a “case” of this or that disease. Much of the literature on the dying makes such suggestions but without providing a sound foundation for them. This paper uses a suggestion made by William F. May, who argued that health care providers’ relationships with those they serve ought not to be thought of as purely contractual or purely philanthropic, but rather as covenantal (i.e., as a mutual exchange of giving). He believes that such a view makes sense only if we providers see our lives as being themselves gifts-acts of grace by the Transcendent. But it may be difficult to hold on to a covenantal relationship in this sense when there is no prior sense of having already received a gift from the Transcendent. In a culture in which religious belief is often not central to the lives of many people, an appeal to God (as a symbol for the Transcendent) may not be of much help. I suggest that healthcare providers must be able to found our covenant relationships in some other language and symbols. The latter part of this paper presents an attempt to found covenant relationships with the dying in the Transcendent, without using the symbol “God.”. © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - An Analysis Of The Human Activities Impact On Water Quantity In The Jequitinhonha Valley, Mg/Brazil
JO  - Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the changes of the characteristics of the study area caused by human influence and the reduction of flow rates with time, in Água Limpa stream basin, Jequitinhonha Valley of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: The study area is a typical arid zone in the northeast of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Field observations, collection and analyses of precipitation, evaporation, temperature and flow rate data were the main approaches used in this study. The data cover the last 50 years, including aerial photographs and satellite images of different dates. The stream flow rate has decreased in the region of the Jequitinhonha valley in the last decades, in particular during draught periods (base flows), with serious social-economic and environmental consequences. The increase in stream intermittence is responsible for rural exodus to other parts of the country, mainly to São Paulo state. The study presented provides decision makers with important information that can assist them in making objective decisions relational this problem. Findings: The research shows that the forest cover has declined, the agricultural and pasture cover have decreased and the deforestation areas have grown. These changes resulted in a spatially diverse landscape with implications in the flow rate, and consequently, in the social-economic condition of the region considering the high rate of emigration. Practical implications: The expected results of this study will be of great importance, because the clarification of the factors addressed in this project will allow progress in the understanding of the reduction of flow rates. This reduction has been occurring in the Jequitinhonha Valley and also in almost all Brazilian rivers. Originality/value: This paper is original and reports the main causes for decreasing of the stream flow rate in the region of the Jequitinhonha valley in Brazil. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Temporal And Spatial Variability Of Daytime Land Surface Temperature In Houston: Comparing Discover-Aq Aircraft Observations With The Wrf Model And Satellites
JO  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
PY  - 2016
AB  - Based on a semiempirical diurnal temperature cycle model and aircraft observations taken at different times of the day, daytime land surface temperature (LST) is derived at six locations in the Greater Houston area on the least cloudy day during NASA's DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) field campaign in September 2013. The aircraft-derived daytime LSTs show ranges (max-min) of 11-25 degrees K varying by location, with the daily maxima occurring near 1300-1400 local time. Two Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations that were configured differently are compared with these aircraft-derived LST, indicating location- and time-dependent performance. The NOAA GOES geostationary satellite observed similar LST spatial patterns in Houston to those in finer resolution from two polar-orbiting satellite instruments (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), and it provided useful information of the LST temporal variability missing from the polar-orbiting satellite products. However, spatial- and time-varying discrepancies are found among LSTs from these various platforms, which are worth further evaluation in order to benefit model evaluation and improvement. The aircraft and satellite LSTs are overall anticorrelated with satellite vegetation indexes. This emphasizes the importance of vegetation cover in urban planning due to its cooling effect and further impact on biogenic emissions and regional air quality. The approaches shown in this study are also suitable for applications under cloudless conditions at other locations and times, such as during the remaining DISCOVER-AQ deployments conducted in three other populated regions with diverse land uses.

TI  - Monitoring Wind Farms Occupying Grasslands Based On Remote-Sensing Data From China's Gf-2 Hd Satellite—A Case Study Of Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, China
JO  - Resources, Conservation and Recycling
PY  - 2017
AB  - Wind power is a clean and renewable resource, and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer. However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km2 per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m2 of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m2 and 2496 m2, respectively. Approximately 2.44 km2 of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. In this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

JO  - 2011 International Conference on Remote Sensing, Environment and Transportation Engineering, RSETE 2011 - Proceedings
PY  - 2011
AB  - In the paper, we studied the effect of different factors involving Beijing economic indices on carbon dioxide emission using gray relation analysis, which included GDP, the value-added of the secondary industry, fixed asset investment, household consumption, net exports, energy consumption, household population and the value-added of the tertiary industry. Our results showed that energy consumption, population size and the value-added of the secondary industry were the most important factors affecting carbon dioxide emission, while net exports and the value-added of the tertiary industry had a little effect on the carbon dioxide emission in Beijing. On the base of the results, we gave suggestions about how to reduce the carbon dioxide emission in Beijing. © 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Monitoring Metropolitan Growth Dynamics For Achieving Sustainable Urbanization (Sdg 11.3) In Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - The mass accumulation of population in the larger cities of India has led to accelerated and unprecedented peripheral urban expansion over the last few decades. This rapid peripheral growth is characterized by an uncontrolled, low density, fragmented and haphazard patchwork of development popularly known as urban sprawl. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) has been one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in India and is experiencing rampant suburbanization and peripheral expansion. Hence, understanding urban growth and its dynamics in these rapidly changing environments is critical for city planners and resource managers. Furthermore, understanding urban expansion and urban growth patterns are essential for achieving inclusive and sustainable urbanization as defined by the United Nations in the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., SDGs, 11.3). The present research attempts to quantify and model the urban growth dynamics of large and diverse metropolitan areas with a distinct methodology considering the case of KMA. In the study, land use and land cover (LULC) maps of KMA were prepared for three different years (i.e., for 1996, 2006, and 2016) through the classification of Landsat imagery using a support vector machine (SVM) classification approach. Then, change detection analysis, landscape metrics, a concentric zone approach, and Shannon’s entropy approach were applied for spatiotemporal assessment and quantification of urban growth in KMA. The achieved classification accuracies were found to be 89.75%, 92.00%, and 92.75%, with corresponding Kappa values of 0.879, 0.904, and 0.912 for 1996, 2006, and 2016, respectively. It is concluded that KMA has been experiencing typical urban sprawl. The peri-urban areas (i.e., KMA-rural) are growing rapidly, and are characterized by leapfrogging and fragmented built-up area development, compared to the central KMA (i.e., KMA-urban), which has become more compact in recent years. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Estimating Topsoil Texture Fractions By Digital Soil Mapping - A Response To The Long Outdated Soil Map In The Philippines
JO  - Sustainable Environment Research
PY  - 2019
AB  - Digital soil mapping for soil texture is mostly an understanding of how soil texture fractions vary in space as influenced by environmental variables mainly derived from the digital elevation model (DEM). In this study, topsoil texture models were generated and evaluated by multiple linear regression (MLR), ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging (SK) and universal kriging (UK) using free and open-source R, System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses, and QGIS software. Comparing these models is the main objective of the study. The study site covers an area of 124 km2 of the Municipality of Barili, Cebu. A total of 177 soil samples were gathered and analyzed from irregular sample points. DEM derivatives and remote sensing data (Landsat 8) were used as environmental variables. Exploratory analyses revealed no outlier in the data. Skewness and kurtosis values of the untransformed data vary greatly between – 3.85 to 7.20 and 1.8 to 70.7, respectively; an indication that variables are highly skewed with heavy tails. Thus, Tukey’s ladder of powers transformation was applied that resulted to normal or nearly normal distribution having skewness values close to zero and kurtosis values have lighter tails. All data analysis from MLR modeling, variography, kriging, and cross-validations of models were implemented using the transformed data. Forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise selection methods were adapted for predictors selection in MLR. The MLR, OK, SK, and UK were applied and cross validated for topsoil texture prediction. Likewise, exponential, Gaussian, and spherical models were fitted for the experimental variograms. Backward elimination method for clay, sand, and silt have the lowest MAE and highest R2 in MLR. The UK fitted with exponential variogram model has the highest R2 of 0.878, 0.821, and 0.893 for clay, sand, and silt, respectively. These models can be adapted as a decision support for agricultural land use planning and crop suitability development in the area. © The Author(s).

TI  - Radar Imaging Mechanism Of Marine Sand Waves At Very Low Grazing Angle Illumination Caused By Unique Hydrodynamic Interactions
JO  - Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans
PY  - 2006
AB  - The investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004 during six field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for coastal management (OROMA) project aimed to improve the effectiveness of new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as shipborne imaging radars in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, is based on a Kelvin Hughes RSR 1000 X band (9.42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have been taken at very low grazing angles ≤2.6° of flood and ebb tide-oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest ≤0.6 m s-1 have been measured at wind speeds ≤4.5 m s-1 and water depths ≤25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb tide - oriented sand wave is 27%. For the flood tide - oriented sand wave, a difference of 21% has been calculated. The difference between the minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide - oriented sand wave is 10%, and for the flood tide - oriented sand wave, a value of 43% has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a first-order theory.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing Of Active Fires: History And Current Status, Applications And Future Requirements
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landscape fire is a widespread, somewhat unpredictable phenomena that plays an important part in Earth's biogeochemical cycling. In many biomes worldwide fire also provides multiple ecological benefits, but in certain circumstances can also pose a risk to life and infrastructure, lead to net increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and to degradation in air quality and consequently human health. Accurate, timely and frequently updated information on landscape fire activity is essential to improve our understanding of the drivers and impacts of this form of biomass burning, as well as to aid fire management. This information can only be provided using satellite Earth Observation (EO) approaches, and remote sensing of active fire is one of the key techniques used. This form of EO is based on detecting the signature of the (mostly infrared) electromagnetic radiation emitted as biomass burns. Since the early 1980's, active fire (AF) remote sensing conducted using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has been deployed in certain regions of the world to map the location and timing of landscape fire occurrence, and from the early 2000's global-scale information updated multiple times per day has been easily available to all. Geostationary (GEO) satellites provide even higher frequency AF information, more than 100 times per day in some cases, and both LEO-and GEO-derived AF products now often include estimates of a fires characteristics, such as its fire radiative power (FRP) output, in addition to the fires detection. AF data provide information relevant to fire activity ongoing when the EO data were collected, and this can be delivered with very low latency times to support applications such as air quality forecasting. Here we summarize the history of achievements in the field of active fire remote sensing, review the physical basis of the approaches used, the nature of the AF detection and characterization techniques deployed, and highlight some of the key current capabilities and applications. Finally, we list some important developments we believe deserve focus in future years.

TI  - Stable Forest Cover Under Increasing Populations Of Swidden Cultivators In Central Laos: The Roles Of Intrinsic Culture And Extrinsic Wildlife Trade
JO  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
PY  - 2009
AB  - Swidden agriculture, or shifting cultivation, is variously viewed as a great environmental threat or a sustainable system of land use. In Laos, swidden has long been considered the primary driver of forest loss nationwide, but the assessment is based exclusively on studies from the north of country, where deforestation is most severe. National policies to control swidden have percolated down to management of one of the largest nature reserves in the region, Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area (NNT NPA) in the Annamite Mountains of central Laos. In NNT NPA, swidden's presumed unsustainability and deleterious impact on forest cover is an untested assumption. We tested it by methods of historical ecology, tracing the patterns of NNT's forest cover and human settlement over the past several decades. Principal sources of data were topographical maps dating to 1943, and Landsat images from 1976, 1989, and 2001. The analysis shows that, although NNT has been inhabited by swidden cultivators for hundreds of years, it retained more than 95\% forest cover until the 1960s-early 1970s. Subsequently, a post-Vietnam War release of human population, possibly coupled with government encouragement of agricultural expansion, precipitated a decline in forest of 0.5\%/year until the 1980s. Curiously, this was followed by stability or an increase (ca. 0.3\%/year) in forest cover into the current century, even as NNT's human population continued to grow and as forest declined in Laos overall at 1.7\%/year, and in two protected areas near NNT at more than 3\%/year. A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors probably account for the stability of NNT's forest cover despite recent population growth. First are cultural propensities for sedentariness and livelihoods with relatively low environmental impact among the ethnic groups inhabiting NNT. Since at least the 1940s, there have been remarkably few changes in the number or location of villages in NNT ( and despite upheavals during the Vietnam War). Clearly, "shifting cultivation" is not equivalent to shifting populations. The extent of cleared forest in NNT has remained almost entirely within a swidden-forest mosaic whose boundaries date back at least to the 1960s. Second, the last 20 years have seen an explosion in wildlife trade in the region, particularly of animals valued in traditional medicine. Income earned from wildlife trade may have allowed NNT's residents to purchase rice to feed growing populations, instead of clearing more forest to grow it. The situation presents a dilemma for conservationists-attempts to control local wildlife trade could push NNT's villagers to clear more forest swiddens, and vice versa. Controlling both simultaneously would probably have a negative impact on villagers' standard of living. As wildlife trade is a greater threat to NNT's biodiversity values than local systems of rotational swidden, management should focus first on reducing wildlife trade. In any case, forest conservation (and villagers' welfare) will benefit more from alleviation of of NNT's human population growth than control of its traditional agriculture; it was primarily a shift in demography, not in agricultural practices, that precipitated the post-war period of forest loss. Finally, attempts to reduce local access to swidden land should come only after better understanding of the current swidden systems is achieved, and proven alternatives have been established.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Monitoring Of Postfire Vegetation Dynamics In The Greater Hinggan Mountain Range Based On Long Time-Series Data: Analysis Of The Effects Of Six Topographic And Climatic Factors
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - The frequency of forest fires is increasing under global climate change, and forest fires can cause devastating disturbances to forest systems and varying degrees of recovery of forest ecosystems after a disaster. Due to the different intensity of forest fires and forest systems, and in particular the fact that forest ecological recovery is influenced by many topographical and climatic factors, the process of postfire vegetation recovery is unclear and must be studied in depth. In this study, the Greater Hinggan Mountain Range was taken as the study area. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat time-series images acquired from 2000 to 2018, this study used the spatiotemporal data fusion method to construct reflectance images of vegetation with a relatively consistent growth period to study the vegetation restoration after forest fires. The vegetation restoration was characterized by disturbance index (DI) values, which eliminated phenological influence. Six types of topography and climatic factors (elevation, aspect, slope; temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) were coupled with DI. Through single-factor analysis of variance and multiple comparison statistical methods, it was found that there was a significant relationship between the six factors and DI, which indicated those factors had a significant impact on the restoration of forest vegetation in burned areas. The results will be useful as a reference for future monitoring and management of forest resources.

TI  - Distribution Modelling Of Vegetation Types Based On Area Frame Survey Data
JO  - Applied Vegetation Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Aim: Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location: Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km2. Methods: We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km2. Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m × 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results: Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions: Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Smart Environment Through Smart Tools And Technologies For Urban Green Spaces: Case Study: Chandigarh, India
JO  - Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements
PY  - 2020
AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGS) are an integral part of urban environment and act as lungs for rejuvenating the urban environment and improving the quality of life and health of residents. UGS assist in regulating urban microclimate, biodiversity conservation, alleviating floods, enhancing air quality, and also promotes physical and mental wellbeing of urban populace. They also provide spaces for improved social environment and are considered highly beneficial for physical, social and cognitive development of urban children. UGS exists in diverse shape, size, vegetation cover and types and includes parks, gardens, railway corridors, road side green, derelict monument sites, etc. [1] defined UGS as urban land that consists of unsealed, permeable, soft surfaces such as soil, grass, shrubs and trees. Chandigarh is the first planned city of modern India and is known for its uniformly distributed and ample UGS within its boundaries. However, only quantification of amount of UGS is not sufficient to harness the full range of benefits from UGS for smart urban environment. The UGS should be accessible, uniformly distributed and maintained for its daily use by urban population. Although, there are restrictions on development within the Chandigarh, the high pace of urbanization, population increase and economic development in surrounding area is creating a pressure on infrastructure of Chandigarh as well. Chandigarh is also facing the issues of traffic congestion, air pollution and environmental degradation which were unheard before. The multi-faceted issues and benefits of UGS call for smart approaches for their effective utilization and management. Geospatial technologies integrated with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools provide a useful and smart tool in the hand of planners for quantification, assessment and evaluation of UGS for smart management. They can help in identifying the vulnerable areas as well as to assess the accessibility and distribution of UGS. They can be used for quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of UGS by applying a range of remote sensing data sets and geo-analysis. Many indices have been developed using these datasets for evaluation and monitoring of UGS. With the growing technological advancements in smart web-based tools, these technologies can also be used effectively for monitoring and management of UGS through integration of ICT tools and citizen centric services. This study demonstrates various innovative geospatial and ICT tools for evaluation and monitoring of UGS. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Mangrove Vulnerability Modelling In Parts Of Western Niger Delta, Nigeria Using Satellite Images, Gis Techniques And Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (Smca)
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2011
AB  - Mangroves are known for their global environmental and socioeconomic value. Despite their importance, mangrove like other ecosystems is now being threatened by natural and human-induced processes that damage them at alarming rates, thereby diminishing the limited number of existing mangrove vegetation. The development of a spatial vulnerability assessment model that takes into consideration environmental and socioeconomic criteria, in spatial and non-spatial formats has been attempted in this study. According to the model, 11 different input parameters are required in modelling mangrove vulnerability. These parameters and their effects on mangrove vulnerability were selected and weighted by experts in the related fields. Criteria identification and selection were mainly based on effects of environmental and socioeconomic changes associated with mangrove survival. The results obtained revealed the dominance of socioeconomic criteria such as population pressure and deforestation, with high vulnerability index of 0.75. The environmental criteria was broadly dispersed in the study area and represents vulnerability indices ranging from 0.00-0.75. This category reflects the greater influence of pollutant input from oil wells and pipelines and minimal contribution from climatic factors. This project has integrated spatial management framework for mangrove vulnerability assessment that utilises information technology in conjunction with expert knowledge and multi-criteria analysis to aid planners and policy/ decision makers in the protection of this very fragile ecosystem.

TI  - A New Differential Protection Scheme For Microgrid Using Hilbert Space Based Power Setting And Fuzzy Decision Processes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Nowadays, the use of a distributed generation (DG) has increased because of the benefits such as increased reliability, reduced losses, and improvement in the line capacity and less environmental pollution. The protection of microgrids, which consists of generation sources, it is one of the most crucial concerns of basic distribution operators. One of the key issues in this field is the protection of microgrids against permanent and temporary failures by improving safety and reliability of the network. The traditional method that was used has a number of disadvantages. The proposed protection scheme develops power differential protection (PDP) using the fuzzy rule approach for intelligent protection of microgrids. This paper proposes the development of a new algorithm to improve the differential protection performance by using fuzzy processes with Hilbert space based power theory (FHSP). The protection can be obtained in a novel way based on this theory. An advantage of this algorithm is that the protection system operates in less than two cycles after the occurrence of the fault. Another advantage is that the error detection is not dependent on the selection of threshold values, and all types of internal fault can identify and show that the algorithm operates correctly for all types of faults whilst preventing unwanted tripping, even if the data has been distorted by current transformer (CT) saturation or by data mismatches.

TI  - Coupling Remote Sensing With <I>In Situ</I> Surveys To Determine Reef Fish Habitat Associations For The Design Of Marine Protected Areas
JO  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
PY  - 2018
AB  - Nearshore fish populations are in decline in the main Hawaiian Islands, and effective, sustainable management is needed. There has been increasing emphasis on the value of eco-system-based management and the conservation of essential fish habitat, but policy is encumbered by a lack of supporting information. This study uses science and technology to support traditional knowledge in identifying juvenile fish habitats, providing a basis for effective resource management in a rural Hawaiian community. Building on existing local knowledge of nearshore resources, we quantitatively assessed juvenile fish-habitat associations. We conducted fine-scale in situ ecological surveys of juvenile reef fishes and their habitats, and produced detailed benthic habitat maps using GIS and interpretation of satellite imagery, from which we extracted multiscale seascape variables. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess fish-habitat relationships at multiple scales. Depth, coral cover, structural complexity, scattered rock and coral habitat, and distance to shore emerged as primary factors associated with juvenile reef fish abundance. We identified the habitat associations of 2 important food resource species in the study area of H (a) over bar' ena, Kaua'i: the convict tang Acanthurus triostegus sandvicensis, an endemic subspecies, and the redlip parrotfish Scarus rubroviolaceus. Results from this study played an important role in the successful approval of the H (a) over bar' ena community-based fishery management plan by the state governing agency. We argue that an ecosystem-based co-management approach, informed by conventional survey methods, remote sensing technology, and traditional knowledge, can help to ensure the sustainability of fisheries worldwide.

TI  - A New Generation Of Tabs Ii Buoy For The Texas Automated Buoy System
JO  - Proceedings of MTS/IEEE OCEANS, 2005
PY  - 2005
AB  - The year 2005 marks the tenth anniversary of the Texas Automated Buoy System (TABS). The buoy network was developed for the Texas General Lands Office (TGLO) in support of oil spill modeling, mitigation and response in the Gulf of Mexico. The government of Texas, and in particular the TGLO have supported the TABS program since its inception in 1995 at seven locations in the Gulf of Mexico. The program currently has nine locations with the two additional sites receiving support through a joint industry project supported by a consortium of oil companies operating in the Flower Garden Banks region of the gulf. The initial buoy systems were developed by the Geochemical and Environmental Research Group (GERG) of Texas A&M University (TAMU) with the Woods Hole Group (WHG) of Falmouth, MA to measure and report near real time surface currents through cellular and satellite telemetry. Since the initial development in 1995, the buoy systems have evolved to include additional sensors such as ADCP's, CTD's, optical sensors, meteorological sensors, GPS, various means of telemetry and most recently, seafloor mounted sensors. In early 2003, GERG began to explore the means by which the TABS network could accommodate additional sensors to expand and enhance the data capability and data value to the end users, increase reliability, provide a faster turn around time during routine servicing and provide modularity in terms of both hardware and software. Because the TABS buoys are a spar design with limited power and space, choice of the right controller was critical. The TABS controller hardware was upgraded from a Motorola 68332 processor based system, to a more powerful PC104 computer system operating at 100 MHz, with 12 serial ports, 16 analog ports, 24 digital I/O's, 2 USB ports and fast Ethernet. The computer and peripherals operate at approximately 3 watts on a 12 volt supply making it suitable for long term deployments with a solar charging system. The CPU runs on a Linux operating system with high level software written Perl and modular sensor support written in C. The new buoys offer much greater flexibility in terms of the type and quantity of sensors the buoy can support, overall processing speed and capability, internal diagnostic capability, as well as the ability to safely handle remote software upgrades without danger of catastrophic failure if the upgrade is corrupted through telemetry. In February 2005 the first of the new generation buoys was deployed off of San Louis Pass located south west of Galveston, Texas. During this deployment new systems and sensors were tested including the ability of a TABS buoy to acoustically collect processed wave data from a bottom mounted wave gauge ADCP. The recent addition of wave capability to the TABS network enhances the data currently available to the end users of the TABS observing network.

TI  - Leaf Spectral Reflectance For Nondestructive Measurement Of Plant Nutrient Status
JO  - HORTTECHNOLOGY
PY  - 2005
AB  - The ability to monitor plant nutrient status of high value horticultural crops and to adjust seasonal nutrient supply via fertilizer application has economic and environmental benefits. Recent technological advances may enable growers and field consultants to conduct this type of monitoring nondestructively in the future. Using the perennial crop apple (Malus domestica) and the annual crop potato (Solanum tuberosum), a hand-held leaf reflectance meter was used to evaluate leaf nitrogen (N) status throughout the growing season. In potato, this meter showed good correlation with leaf blade N content. Both time of day and time of season influenced leaf meter measurement, but leaf position did not. In apple, three different leaf meters were compared: the leaf spectral reflectance meter and two leaf greenness meters. Correlation with both N rate and leaf N content were strongest for the leaf reflectance meter early in the season but nonsignificant late in the season, whereas the leaf greenness meters gave weak but significant correlations throughout the growing season. The tapering off of leaf reflectance values found with the hand-held meter is consistent with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values calculated from satellite images from the same plots. Overall, the use of leaf spectral reflectance shows promise as a tool for nondestructive monitoring of plant leaf status and would enable multiple georeferenced measurements throughout a field for differential N management.

TI  - Evolution Characteristics And Driving Mechanism For The Spatiotemporal Pattern Of Sloping Farmland In Chongqing Based On Geodetector
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2022
AB  - Sloping farmland has been one of the most important parts of cultivated land in the hills and mountains areas. It is a high demand to clarify the evolution characteristics and driving factors of the temporal and spatial pattern of sloping farmland, in order to rationally utilize resources and ecological functions. This study aims to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics and driving factors of sloping farmland in Chongqing City in southwest China. The aspects covered the temporal and spatial change characteristics, cold and hot spot patterns, as well as the driving factors of sloping farmland. Firstly, the local spatial autocorrelation (LISA) and cold hot spot were selected to determine the local spatial agglomeration characteristics of sloping farmland using the remote sensing data from 2000 to 2018. Secondly, the transfer of land use was obtained to overlay the land use data of each period. A transfer matrix of land use was then used to determine the transfer direction of sloping farmland. Finally, four dimensions were selected as the indicators, including the natural environment foundation, social living conditions, economic development level, as well as policy and institution. A geodetector was then used to determine the driving mechanism of sloping farmland change. The results showed that: 1) The area of sloping farmland decreased by 2.40% and 22 300 km2 in 2018, accounting for 59.35% of the cultivated land, compared with 2000. The average annual change dynamic degree of sloping farmland was greater than 1% in the six districts and counties (Yuzhong, Jiangbei, Jiangjin, Nan'an, Dadukou, and Shizhu). There was an outstandingly different change trend of sloping farmland areas in the different districts and counties. 2) Sloping farmland was significantly transferred from the forest land, grassland, paddy field, and construction land, where the transfer out and transfer in were generally balanced during the 18 years. The sloping farmland returning to the forest land was mainly concentrated in the regions of Shizhu, Wulong, Fengdu, and Yunyang counties in the Qin-Daba and Wuling Mountainous Areas. The area of sloping farmland showed a small decrease trend in the process of land use transfer. 3) There was significant heterogeneity of local spatial autocorrelation in the sloping farmland. The area of sloping farmland in most regions was in the state of high-high and low-low aggregation. The hot spots were concentrated in the northeast of the study area, whereas, the cold spots were distributed in the west and the main urban areas. 4) The factors in the forestry output value, per capita net income of rural residents, grain yield, rural employees, agriculture, forestry, and water expenditure greatly contributed to the slope farmland change, most of which were nonlinear and two-factor enhancement. Among them, the interactive driving factors with the greater explanatory power were the grain yield/slope (2005, 0.927), and per capita net income of rural residents/resident population (2018, 0.910). The leading factors of spatiotemporal characteristics were ranked as economic development, policy regulation, farmers' income, urban expansion, and socio-economic factors. A relatively less impact on the sloping farmland was found in the natural factors, including the altitude and rainfall. The findings can provide a scientific basis for the protection and pattern optimization of slope farmland in the mountainous and hilly areas of southwest China. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - A Contribution To The Investigations Of Wind Power To Hydrogen Along The Mauritanian Coast
JO  - International Journal of Renewable Energy Research
PY  - 2021
AB  - The contribution to the investigations of the Wind-Power-to-Hydrogen (WP2H2) potential is encouraging Mauritania to join the world of power to X. The aim is obtaining the economic profitability for a system of wind turbines coupled to a hydrogen electrolyzer. The country’s coastal regions are very windy but disturbed by the movements of the dunes during the year. The latter has a roughness from north to south that goes from category four to category one, and the wind potential goes from excellent to very medium. So the geographical conditions besides the climatological conditions to motivate the current work. The wind data used from Merra-data satellites verified and compared with those measured on the ground by the national meteorological office for ten years. In the last step of the analysis, the commercial costs involved in producing H2 are presented, by assessing the economic indicators kies LCO(Eol) and the LCO(Elz). So, the satellite time-series data set has shown a tolerable average deviation. Besides, the proportionality of the commercial hydrogen conversion cost with wind power cost is the apparent characteristic. Despite the disturbed of the dunes’ movement in the coastal northern regions, windpower to-producing is estimated at around 3.59 $/kgH2, whereas the south assessed at 6.78 $/Kg H2. This study’s results may encourage the Mauritanian government to invest in this project, leading to an excellent economic take-off. © 2021,International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.All Rights Reserved

TI  - House Building Extraction From High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based On Ieu-Net
JO  - National Remote Sensing Bulletin
PY  - 2021
AB  - House buildings, as the main place for human activities, can be rapidly and accurately extracted from high-resolution remote sensing images, which is of great significance for promoting remote sensing information in disaster prevention and mitigation and town management. On the basis of deep learning, this paper proposes a pixel-level accurate extraction method for house buildings by using high-resolution remote sensing images.First, in consideration of the lack of pixel features at the edge of a sample image, an IEU-Net model is proposed on the basis of the U-Net model. A new ignore-edges categorical cross entropy function, IELoss, is designed as a loss function. Dropout and BN layers are added to help improve the speed and robustness of model training while fitting. Second, to solve the problem of limited feature richness of the model, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) is introduced into the classification process of the model, together with the remote sensing image RGB band. Lastly, when ignoring the edge prediction method, the best building extraction results can be obtained in the model prediction that corresponds to the IEU-Net model. The remote sensing image data used in this study are 0.8 m true color and infrared band data obtained by multispectral and panchromatic fusion from the GF-2 satellite of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. A label image is obtained by visually interpreting the images by using ArcGIS software and performing a feature-to-raster transformation on the obtained vector file. Then, a ground truth image of the location of houses and buildings in the remote sensing image is recorded. The MBI and RGB bands are fused, and the corresponding label images are randomly cropped to obtain 500 pieces of 256×256 training data and 100 pieces of 256×256 verification data. Regarding the IEU-Net model r value of 0.5 and the training data as the model input and using the Adam optimization algorithm for back propagation iteration for 100 times help achieve the optimal parameter results.The Overall Accuracy (OA) is 91.86%, and the kappa value is 0.802. To verify the effectiveness of IELoss in the IEU-Net model and the ignore-edges prediction method relative to CELoss and the ordinary prediction method in solving the problem of insufficient edge pixel features, this study continues the comparison by using the values of r of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6 (when r is 1.0, IELoss is equivalent to CELoss, and the ignore-edges prediction method is equivalent to the ordinary prediction method). The results show that the OA of the model using IELoss and the ignore-edges prediction method is 5.03% higher than that of the model using CELoss and the ordinary prediction method, and the kappa value is 0.165 higher. To verify the effectiveness of adding MBI to the training data of the model, a comparative experiment is performed by using RGB three-band data as the training set. The prediction result obtained using the MBI-added data set is 1.55% higher than the OA of the RGB band data set. The kappa value is increased by 0.009.The experimental results show that the IEU-Net model effectively solves the problem of insufficient edge pixel features and achieves house and building extraction accuracy with high OA and kappa values. The addition of MBI data can overcome the influence of roads and house building shadows to a certain extent and accurately extract the edge information of house buildings. Therefore, if significant vegetation exists near the houses and buildings in our area of interest, we can consider adding the normalized difference vegetation index to the training set to reduce the impact of the vegetation. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Inverted Algorithm Of Groundwater Storage Anomalies By Combining The Gnss, Grace/Grace-Fo, And Gldas: A Case Study In The North China Plain
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - As the largest groundwater drainage region in China, the per capita water resources in the North China Plain (NCP) account for only one-seventh of the country's available water resources. Currently, the NCP is experiencing a serious water shortage due to the overexploitation of groundwater resources and a subsequent series of natural disasters. Thus, accurate regional assessments and effective water resource management policies are of critical importance. To accomplish this phenomenon, the daily terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) over the NCP is calculated from the combination of the GNSS vertical deformation sequences (seasonal items) and GRACE (trend items). The groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) in the NCP is obtained by subtracting the canopy water, soil water, and snow water equivalent components from the TWSA. The inversion results of this study are verified by comparisons with the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data products. The elevated annual amplitude areas are located in Beijing and Tianjin, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between the two GWSA results are 0.67, 4.01 cm, and 0.61, respectively. This indicates that the methods proposed in this study are reliable. Finally, the groundwater drought index was calculated for the period from 2011 to 2021, and the results showed that 2019 was the driest year, with a drought severity index value of -0.12, indicative of slightly moderate drought conditions. By calculating and analyzing the annual GWSA, this work shows that the South-North Water Transfer Project does provide some regional drought mitigation.

TI  - High-Resolution Super-Multitemporal Monitoring: Two-Day Time Series For Precision Agriculture Applications
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2014
AB  - Water management systems used in crop irrigation can greatly benefit from high-quality and high-frequent geo-information. Reliable data matched with timely delivering can lead to large water savings and better yields. Sentinel-2 5-day global revisit or Landsat-8 16-day global revisit, shall acquire high-frequent, high-resolution time series that will greatly benefit agriculture worldwide. But, some applications like irrigation management still demand an even higher observation frequency, both to increase the precision of the control loop, and thus its savings. At the same time, high-frequent data is needed to avoid unwanted data gaps by mitigating the effects of clouds. The DEIMOS-1 satellite, owned and operated by ELECNOR DEIMOS IMAGING (Spain), was launched in 2009 and provides 22m, 3-band imagery with a very wide (650-km) swath. It has been specifically designed to assure very-high-frequent revisit on large areas (every 3 days on average for any mid-latitude region), with precision agriculture applications in mind. In cooperation with its twin satellite, DMCii's UK-DMC2, Elecnor Deimos has carried out a monitoring campaign over North Texas (USA), aiming to achieve the maximum possible revisit frequency over a region with a high density of corn and soya crop plots. The purposes of this campaign were the acquisition and fast delivery of orthorectified imagery, to be used as an input for the control and monitoring of irrigation practices in the study area, determining irrigation recommendations. The campaign was conducted from June to September 2013; 72 images of both satellites were captured (one every 1.7 days on average), being 63 of them valid for the study. All products were delivered, ortho, within 24 hours from acquisition, thus feeding an early warning irrigation control system. The combination of such very-high-frequency revisit with the fast delivery of products, which we have called super-multitemporal monitoring, was the key to optimising irrigation recommendations, which led to improved crop productivity, reduced the irrigation costs, and helped achieving a more appropriate and sustainable water management. The 2-day-revisit monitoring with DEIMOS-1 and UK-DMC2 is a unique service, which is already operational and which can be used worldwide. This paper describes the 2-day-revisit monitoring campaign in North Texas in 2013, detailing its main results and achievements, describes the super-multitemporal monitoring service and its main products and reports on the status of the monitoring campaign in 2014 in North Texas.

TI  - Remote Sensing Gis-Based Landslide Susceptibility \& Risk Modeling In Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya Together With Fem-Based Slope Stability Analysis Of The Terrain
JO  - NATURAL HAZARDS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya is performed by integrating 28 causative factors on C-28(28) combinations on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the terrain is classified into 'None' (with: 0.0 < LSI <= 0.17), 'Low' (with: 0.17 < LSI <= 0.34), 'Moderate' (with: 0.34 < LSI <= 0.51), 'High' (with: 0.51 < LSI <= 0.68),'Very High' (with: 0.68 < LSI <= 0.85) and 'Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of 0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like population density, number of households, building types, building height and building density has demarketed approximately 21\% of the region under 'Very High' to 'Severe' socioeconomic risk zone while about 36\% area are classified under 'Very High' to 'Severe' structural risk zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region. Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in the 'Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the 'Low to Moderate' landslide susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the 'High' landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the 'Very High to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2) and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the 'High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones.

TI  - Cross-Jurisdictional Monitoring For Nonnative Plant Invasions Using Ndvi Change Detection Indices In Walnut Canyon National Monument, Arizona, Usa
JO  - The Colorado Plateau VI: Science and Management at the Landscape Scale
PY  - 2015
AB  - Nonnative invasive plants pose a significant threat to native biodiversity on National Park Service (NPS) and other public lands, which is a fact that prompts active federal prevention and control programs. Within the NPS, park units are assisted by the inventory and monitoring networks whose role is to provide long-term monitoring and limited research support to individual park management efforts. The Southern Colorado Plateau Inventory and Monitoring Network (SCPN) is currently testing methods for selecting monitoring locations to a sist in the early detection and rapid control of priority nonnative plant species including areas where there is a cross-jurisdictional threat to park resources. In response to SCPN research needs, we sought to find out if the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is capable of detecting locations invaded by nonnative plants across a landscape with diverse ownership and management regimes. We compared nonnative species richness and nonnative community composition to NDVI values and disturbance types with the expectation that high numbers of nonnative plants would indicate disturbed locations that are a high monitoring priority. We hypothesized that sites with negative NDVI values would correspond to areas with increased nonnative species richness and that disturbances resulting in decreased plant cover would be greatest in those locations. Using difference maps (DMs) derived from Landsat 5 TM images, we classified five NDVI change value categories in GIS (Geographic Information System). Using NDVI classes to stratify plots and delineate categories for statistical comparison, we collected nonnative invasive plant community data and disturbance types in 150 Ã- 150 m plots. We then used plot data collected in 2008 and 2009 to test the application of NDVI for the detection of gradients of disturbance and nonnative invasive species richness at Walnut Canyon National Monument, a SCPN unit in Northern Arizona. In addition we compared three different analysis techniques (image subtraction, difference from average, and single-year image dates temporally proximal to field data collection) and seasonally different image dates (August vs. October) to find which method and season had the best modeling potential. Multiresponse permutation procedures and analysis of variance showed that NDVI DM change values were sensitive to differences in nonnative species richness, nonnative species community composition, disturbance type, and land ownership. Ordinary least quares regression analysis demonstrated that the October, 2008, NDVI image dates had the best fit to field data among the three analytical methods and the two different months. Though our expectation that negative NDVI values would correspond to disturbed areas with high invasive species richness was incorrect, the correlation between NDVI change values, management jurisdiction, disturbance, and nonnative species richness indicates that satellite-derived vegetation indices have potential applications for locating sites at high risk to nonnative invasion and for improving control efforts. Our research also demonstrated that collaboration between stakeholders is necessary to effectively meet the objectives of NPS nonnative monitoring and control efforts. © 2015 The Arizona Board of Regents All rights reserved.

TI  - Canopy Detection Over Roads Using Mobile Lidar Data
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - A high percentage of forest fires take place around roads. These infrastructures provide an escape route for the population in case of fire. Optimization of forest management in the surroundings of roads is a necessary task in terms of wildfires prevention and mitigation of their effects. Therefore, it is essential to avoid the horizontal continuity of vegetation across roads. A methodology for the measurement of canopy area over roads is developed and based on mobile LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds. The acquisition of LiDAR data is done by Lynx Mobile Mapper System from the University of Vigo. The methodology is automated using LiDAR data processing (M-estimator Sample Consensus and near neighbour algorithms) and image processing techniques (rasterization and binarization). The developed algorithms are tested on a study area, the DP-3606 road (Spain). Results are compared with ground truth data of the canopy projected on the road. The best obtained results present a mean geometric error of 2.82% for 0.25 m resolution and 104.02% for 2 m resolution. Furthermore, the higher the pixel size, the greater the error was obtained with a linear correlation value of 0.99. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Multi-Air Pollution Risk Assessment In Southeast Asia Region Using Integratedremote Sensing And Socio-Economic Data Products
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - Air pollution has massive impacts on human life and poor air quality results in three million deaths annually. Airpollution can result from natural causes, including volcanic eruptions and extreme droughts, or human activities,including motor vehicle emissions, industry, and the burning of farmland and forests. Emission sources emit multiplepollutant types with diverse characteristics and impacts. However, there has been little research on the risk of multipleair pollutants; thus, it is difficult to identify multi-pollutant mitigation processes, particularly in Southeast Asia, whereair pollution moves dynamically across national borders. In this study, the main objective was to develop a multi-airpollution risk index product for CO, NO2, and SO2based on Sentinel-5P remote sensing data from 2019 to 2020The risk index was developed by integrating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure analyses. Hazard analysis considersair pollution data from remote sensing, vulnerability analysis considers the air pollution sources, and exposure analysisconsiders the population density. The novelty of this study lies in its development of a multi-risk model that considersthe weights obtained from the relationship between the hazard and vulnerability parameters. The highest air pollutionrisk index values were observed in urban areas, with a high exposure index that originates from pollution caused byhuman activity. Multi-risk analysis of the three air pollutants revealed that Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippineshad the largest percentages of high-risk areas, while Indonesia had the largest total high-risk area (4361 km2).Using thefindings of this study, the patterns and characteristics of the risk distribution of multiple air pollutants inSoutheast Asia can be identified, which can be used to mitigate multi-pollutant sources, particularly with respect tosupporting the clean air targets in the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Trends In Farmland Tree Stocks In The Agroforestry Landscape Of Northern Nigeria: Reconciling Scientific And Stakeholder Perceptions
JO  - Journal of Rural Studies
PY  - 2019
AB  - A previous study indicated at least a doubling of farmland tree densities over five decades in the agroforestry landscape surrounding Kano, the largest city in savanna Africa. This increase, observed from field and remote sensing surveys, is surprising in the face of unprecedented population growth and availability of cheap manufactured substitutes for tree products. It also conflicts with the regional narrative for West Africa, derived mainly from observations and farm questionnaires, which suggests deforestation and reduced tree densities. This mismatch has previously resulted in failed initiatives to combat ecological crises, as extension services conceived at national and international level have met with little support and non-implementation at household level. To investigate the apparent mismatch we administered on-farm questionnaires in 55 villages. Open questions about trends in farmland tree stocks over several decades indicated declining tree stocks, but closed questions requiring tree enumeration and counting, indicated increase. Responses indicated difficulty in distinguishing between concepts of ‘tree numbers’ and ‘tree species’ as declining tree species diversity was reported by almost all responses, resulting from fuel wood demand and market trends towards a cash economy. This lack of distinction between tree species and tree numbers appears due to the traditional place occupied by farm trees in Hausa culture, where a tree species is inseparable from its use, combined with a deep sense of unease at the loss of cultural values. The study indicates that, despite more trees, the wide range of ‘hungry foods’ available from tree products, may no longer be available to alleviate future droughts, as during the 1970s and 80s, when productivity of agricultural and woody biomass plunged. However, initiatives to improve rural livelihoods may need to balance empirical observation against understanding of the complexity of stakeholder perceptions, as in this case overall tree stocks appear healthy, and the decline in species diversity is of greater concern. © 2019

TI  - Land Degradation Monitoring In The Ocnele Mari Salt Mining Area Using Satellite Imagery
PY  - 2011
AB  - Mining is an important activity contributing to the economic development with long lasting environmental impacts. A major disaster took place in 2001 in Ocnele Mari salt mining area located in the central-south part of Romania when the artificial lake brine was poured in rural areas, devastating homes and polluting the Olt River. Towards a sustainable and harmonious development of the Ocnele Mari area, the Romanian Authorities decided to ecology and rehabilitate it. This ongoing project is focused on land degradation monitoring from 2001 disasters until now. High Resolution Spotlight TerraSar-X synthetic aperture radar data acquired within TerraSAR-X proposal LAN0778 are used to analyze terrain deformation by interferometric techniques knowing the mine subsidence is not constant; periods of relative stability are followed by quick deformation. The rocks forming in the region situated above the salt cushion have very low mechanical resistance and high intergranular fissured permeability so the hill's slopes are affected by landslides which are reactivated periodically. Additionally, analysis of the vegetation coverage (leaf area index and normalized difference vegetation index) from the optical data gathered by different sensors such as LANDSAT and MODIS combined with the meteorological data (temperature, wind speed, humidity and solar radiation) provide indicators for the land degradation. The results will be validating on ancillary data. Satellite derived information in conjunction with in-situ measurements can provide valuable information for existing conservation development models for defining the essential elements of a planning process designed to maximize the values provided by salt ponds from Ocnele Mari.

TI  - Is There Sustainability For “Satellite” Ornamental Fishing Regions? A Case Study Of Guamá River Basin- Pará -Brasil
JO  - Fisheries Research
PY  - 2020
AB  - Ornamental fisheries and socio-economic aspects of fishermen in the major fishing regions in Brazil such as the Xingu River have been well studied. However, there is lack of information about the sustainability of “satellites” (auxiliary) fishing areas, which contribute towards supplying fish for exportation centers as Belém, the Capital of Pará state-Brazil. The ornamental fishery in the Guamá River basin is an example of an important activity that supports the families along the river, but it has low social returns and its sustainability is consequently in jeopardy without government aid. We collected fish samples and environmental data to evaluate the market chain aspects, fishery tools and techniques, fish handling and environmental issues of the region. We observed a reduction in numbers of families involved in the ornamental fishery over time. The intensification of anthropogenic impacts reduced the environmental integrity degree of fishing sites have resulted in lower fish diversity. The fishery was characterized by capture of a limited number of loricariids fish where the small ones are preferred. Thus the fishing is more selective and consequently an environmental issue. Economically, income is directly associated to the exportation market, consequently the US dollars value influences the species and quantity of the traded fish. Most of the fishermen work on an informal basis and have no intention to continue in this activity due to the low profits reflected by presence of middlemen which concentrates the profit. Therefore, without a management plan for improvement of fishing, environmental and fish quality, the activity presents risks of unsustainability. Suggestions to ensure the perpetuation of this activity are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Identification Of Dominant Factors Affecting Soil Erosion And Water Yield Within Ecological Red Line Areas
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Soil conservation and water retention are important metrics for designating key ecological functional areas and ecological red line (ERL) areas. However, research on the quantitative identification of dominant environmental factors in different ecological red line areas remains relatively inadequate, which is unfavorable for the zone-based management of ecological functional areas. This paper presents a case study of Beijing's ERL areas. In order to objectively reflect the ecological characteristics of ERL areas in Beijing, which is mainly dominated by mountainous areas, the application of remote sensing data at a high resolution is important for the improvement of model calculation and spatial heterogeneity. Based on multi-source remote sensing data, meteorological and soil observations as well as soil erosion and water yield were calculated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Combining the influencing factors, including slope, precipitation, land use type, vegetation coverage, geomorphological type, and elevation, a quantitative attribution analysis was performed on soil erosion and water yield in Beijing's ERL areas using the geographical detector. The power of each influencing factor and their interaction factors in explaining the spatial distribution of soil erosion or water yield varied significantly among different ERL areas. Vegetation coverage was the dominant factor affecting soil erosion in Beijing's ERL areas, explaining greater than 30\% of its spatial heterogeneity. Land use type could explain the spatial heterogeneity of water yield more than 60\%. In addition, the combination of vegetation coverage and slope was found to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of soil erosion (>55\% in various ERL areas). The superposition of land use type and slope explained greater than 70\% of the spatial distribution for water yield in ERL areas. The geographical detector results indicated that the high soil erosion risk areas and high water yield areas varied significantly among different ERL areas. Thus, in efforts to enhance ERL protection, focus should be placed on the spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion and water yield in different ERL areas.

TI  - Glacier Retreat And The Value Of Ecosystem Services Associated With Water Resources In The Paron Basin-Huascaran National Park (Cordillera Blanca), 2009-2018
JO  - Tecnologia y Ciencias del Agua
PY  - 2023
AB  - Tropical glaciers are sensitive indicators of climate change. The loss of the volume of tropical glaciers in the Paron basin (Cordillera Blanca, Peru), is an example of this at a global level and these changes are expected to affect ecosystem services that are unique and irreplaceable. This study estimated the economic value of ecosystem services associated with water resources impacted by glacial retreat in the Paron basin - Huascaran National Park (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) between the years 2009 and 2018. The methodology started by mapping glaciers from 2009 to 2018 using high-resolution satellite images taken during the dry season. Then, the 3D surfaces of the glaciers were reconstructed using the GLABTOP tool to calculate the volume. With the data obtained, the value of the Tourism and Recreation ecosystem service, provision of Water Flow, was calculated. The results indicate that the glaciers of the Paron basin have been reduced by ~1.82% of the glacial area and at a maximum deglaciation rate of 0.08 (km2/year). The results of the 3D reconstruction show 1.8% more thickness between 40 and 60 m with an ice loss of 1.02 km3, at a maximum rate of 0.14 km3/year. The present monetary values of the services from 2009 to 2018 were estimated at $52 029.34 for the tourism and recreation service and $3 213 258.21 for the water flow provision service, calculated at 8% discount rate. Therefore, it is recommended that investment in programs on the Paron watershed water network, such as increased services, population or industrial use, should be increased. © 2023 Instituto Mexicano de Tecnologia del Agua.

TI  - Contrasting Approved Uses Against Actual Uses At La Restinga Lagoon National Park, Margarita Island, Venezuela. A Gps And Gis Method To Improve Management Plans And Rangers Coverage
JO  - Journal of Coastal Conservation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Protected areas are the core of efforts to conserve biological diversity and zoning uses, and they are used as a tool for their management. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) have been used to evaluate conflicts between approved uses and actual uses in La Restinga Lagoon National Park in Venezuela (LRLNP). The park (188.6 km 2), covers various ecosystems such as coastal lagoons, marine waters and xerophytic vegetation, it is visited by up to 260,000 people visit per year. A GIS, using a base map compiled from 1:25,000 maps was developed. Natural cover was mapped from LANDSAT VII TM images, orthophotomaps and aerial photographs. Spatial use data was collected by field GPS location of any use inside the park during 2 years. Thematic vector maps for each land cover, zoning area, and observed use were created. Maps of zoning and uses were overlapped and new maps for each use-zoning crossing were created. The park contain nine different zoning areas wherein 28 different uses were identified, 18 of them were direct consumptive and non-consumptive uses, occurring on 54% of the park. Tourism transit areas were the most used zones. More than 5,000 people use the park during a high season day. Superimposition of zoning maps with actual use data produced 13 uses taking place in not allowed areas (46% of park area). Most common prohibited use was commercial net fishing, occurring in nearly 40% of the park area. Therefore, identifying human use conflicts and its geographical distribution is a key issue to improve Management Plans as well as identifying hot sites. The GPS-GIS methodology presented here allows Park Rangers to select those areas which could benefit from enhanced supervision with the limited budget available. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Monthly Burned-Area Mapping Using Multi-Sensor Integration Of Sentinel-1 And Sentinel-2 And Machine Learning: Case Study Of 2019'S Fire Events In South Sumatra Province, Indonesia
JO  - Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - Indonesia has experienced massive historical land and forest fire events, creating transnational environmental and socioeconomic issues. The extent of burned areas (BAs) is one of many indicators that reflect the magnitudes and impacts from fire events, and such information is also used for planning the response and recovery steps after the fire events. This information is usually derived using remote sensing (RS) data. However, the assessment on the performance using available RS data, possible RS data combinations, and existing methods is needed to regularly monitor the BA extent. This study aims to assess the performance from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar polarization (Pol.) and gray-level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features and the integration with Sentinel-2 spectral data (Spec.) for the monthly mapping of BA extent using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). The study took place in the parts of Ogan Komering Ilir Regency and Banyuasin in South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. This area has complex land-use classes, such as natural vegetation and plantations (pulpwood and oil palm), which were affected by the 2019's fire events. Our study demonstrated that the combination between Pol. from Sentinel-1 and spectral data from Sentinel-2 (Diff.Pol + Spec.) yielded the best classification accuracy with the overall accuracy (OA) values ranging from 91.80% (XGB) to 95.80% (RF) with the producer's accuracy (PA) from 73.33% to 97.66% and user's accuracy (UA) from 76.69% to 89.80% for the BA class. The integration of spectral data using Sentinel-2 reduced the source of misclassification of BAs from false detection from the non-fire-related land-cover conversion, such as logging activities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

JO  - HAIHE River Basin Research and Planning Approach - Proceedings of 2009 International Symposium of HAIHE Basin Integrated Water and Environment Management
PY  - 2009
AB  - In order to estimate the potential performance of agricultural real water-saving in the Tongzhou district of Beijing, this paper constructed a distributed hydrological model application tool based on the SWAT(Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. The proposed model was calibrated and validated by comparing the calculated evapotranspiration (ET) values with the remote sensing ET data. The comparison results show that the coefficients of the determination R2 of calibration and validation are 0.619 and 0.674 respectively, which is verified to be within the acceptable level. This paper also carried out three scenario analyses by changing the agricultural management modes and analyzed the variation of simulated ET under the scenarios of different crop planting structures and corresponding irrigation methods. It is found that practices of changing crop planting structure and strengthening agricultural management can control ET effectively, which provides a powerful tool for managing the water resources of Tongzhou district, Beijing.

TI  - Trials Of Implantable Monitoring Devices In Heart Failure: Which Design Is Optimal?
JO  - Nature Reviews Cardiology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Implantable monitoring devices have been developed to detect early evidence of heart failure (HF) decompensation, with the hypothesis that early detection might enable clinicians to commence therapy sooner than would otherwise be possible, and potentially to reduce the rate of hospitalization. In addition to the usual challenges inherent to device trials (such as the difficulty of double-blinding and potential for bias), studies of implantable monitoring devices present unique difficulties because they involve assessment of therapeutic end points for diagnostic devices. Problems include the lack of uniform approaches to treatment in study protocols for device alerts or out-of-range values, and the requirement of levels of evidence traditionally associated with therapeutic devices to establish effectiveness and safety. In this Review, the approaches used to deal with these issues are discussed, including the use of objective primary end points with blinded adjudication, identical duration of follow-up and number of encounters for patients in active monitoring and control groups, and treatment recommendations between groups that are consistent with international guidelines. Remote monitoring devices hold promise for reducing the rate of hospitalization among patients with HF. However, optimization of regulatory approaches and clinical trial design is needed to facilitate further evaluation of the effectiveness of combining health information technology and medical devices. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Mapping High Temperature Damaged Area Of Paddy Rice Along The Yangtze River Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Data
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - The subtropical high temperature anomaly of 2013 in China, adversely affected paddy rice physiology, especially at the heading, flowering and grain filling stages, and left untold damage and significant rice yield reductions in that year. Considering the importance of data on crop failure induced by abnormal meteorological events, in understanding the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security, and in support of crop insurance policies, the current study employs satellite remote sensing data to map and estimate the areal extent of high-temperature-induced damage on paddy rice in 2013, along the Yangtze River, a major rice producing area in China. In this regard, the daily mean and maximum air temperatures were first estimated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) products, MODIS Vegetation Indices (VI) products, altitude information from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and air temperature measurements at meteorological stations located within the Yangtze River Basin from 2000 to 2016, to derive fully covered mean and maximum daily air temperatures. Paddy rice cultivated areas were then identified based on the seasonal profiles of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in 2013, and map errors at provincial scales were no more than 8.7\%. Finally, paddy rice growth characteristics were combined with MODIS VI products to identify heading and flowering stages, and the time series of daily mean and maximum air temperatures, paddy rice phenology and cultivated area, were integrated to map and estimate the rice crop area damaged by the anomalous high temperature. Our results show that all provinces along the Yangtze River, this study investigated, recorded a substantial damaged rice crop area, following the 2013 subtropical temperature high, and Anhui Province was the hardest hit with a damaged rice area of 63.6\%. For the entire study area, a damage extent of about 5,656,000 ha, accounting for 35.9\% of total paddy rice planted area, was recorded. This indicates a significant agro-meteorological disaster, and in an era of increasing climate variability and weather extremes, studies of this nature would greatly benefit global food security planning and management policies.

TI  - Land Use Change And Impact On Groundwater In A Southern Neighborhood Of Tandil City, Buenos Aires, Argentina
JO  - AUGMDOMUS
PY  - 2013
AB  - This work analyzes the changes in land use from 2003 to 2011 in a peripheral sector of 79, 62 hectares located at the Southern hilly area of Tandil city and its connection with groundwater quality and availability. The comparison and mapping of satellite images of the study area showed changes in land use from non-defined land uses and crop lands to tourist-commercial and residential utilization. However, this sector does not have drinking water and sewer systems. People use domiciliary boreholes to exploit phreatic aquifer for human and recreational consumption and they dispose their effluents in cesspits. Several problems related to groundwater use were found such as borehole drying, need to make them deeper, water quality disturbances, groundwater shortage in summer mainly for swimming pools, clogged cesspits due to extreme rains. Phreatic levels were measured and groundwater samples were taken in 2008 and 2011 to determine electrical conductivity (EC) and nitrate levels. Groundwater flew to the north and phreatic levels decreased in 2011. EC varied between 480 and 1400 mu S.cm(-1), showing local contamination in the most populated area. Nitrates showed the same pattern varying from 6 to 85 mg.L-1, including a site with more than 200 mg.L-1. The sector with the highest values is located downstream from groundwater flow. These alterations are mainly caused by local disposition of domiciliary effluents generating a half-closed cycle of groundwater disposition, transport and exploitation. The lack of both landuse planning from an environmental perspective and sanitary services together with recharge zone urbanization poses a risk to groundwater quality and availability as well as to human health.

TI  - So You Want To Buy A Space Company?
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2018
AB  - In 2017, more than $3.9 billion of private capital was invested in commercial space companies. This is represents, in a single year, more than half of the total amount of private investment during the preceding five years. The private space sector has also witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of investor participants. The industry continues to expand and analysts predict that it will grow to a multi-trillion dollar industry in the next two decades. The industry is also witnessing rapidly falling launch prices - and as launch prices drop, the barrier to enter space also decreases. In addition to facilitating the expansion of existing space-based businesses, such as telecommunications and Earth observation, greater access to outer space opens the door for new entrants into fields such as space manufacturing, mining and tourism. Almost half of all investment in space companies since the year 2000 has been from venture capital firms, with the vast majority of these investments being made in the last six years. VC investors seek eventually to monetize their investment by exiting through a sale of the company to a third party (usually an existing space industry player, but sometimes to another financial buyer) or through an initial public offering. Acquisitions by industry competitors are particularly common in the satellite sector, where established incumbents often look for outside innovation (for example, Skybox's sale to Planet or DigitalGlobe's sale to MDA). Furthermore, space activities are very costly, but benefit from economies of scale - evidenced by joint ventures between Lockheed and Boeing (United Launch Alliance) and between Airbus and Safran. In light of the increasing frequency of mergers and acquisitions (â€œM&Aâ€) deal making in the space industry, this paper will examine publicly disclosed acquisition agreements governing certain prior deals in the industry in order to draw conclusions about the unique risks faced by commercial space acquirers and how they have sought to mitigate such risks. From diligence considerations to key terms of the acquisition agreements (such as the representations and warranties), this paper will provide practical insight into the most important considerations for private deals in this growing and rapidly changing industry. © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

TI  - Regionalization Of Coarse Scale Soil Moisture Products Using Fine-Scale Vegetation Indices-Prospects And Case Study
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a critical role in many hydrological, biological and biogeochemical processes. It is relevant to farmers, scientists, and policymakers for making effective land management decisions. However, coarse spatial resolution and complex interactions of microwave radiation with surface roughness and vegetation structure present limitations within active remote sensing products to directly monitor soil moisture variations with sufficient detail. This paper discusses a strategy to use vegetation indices (VI) such as greenness, water stress, coverage, vigor, and growth dynamics, derived from Earth Observation (EO) data for an indirect characterization of SSM conditions. In this regional-scale study of a wetland environment, correlations between the coarse Advanced SCATterometer-Soil Water Index (ASCAT-SWI or SWI) product and statistical measurements of four vegetation indices from higher resolution Sentinel-2 data were analyzed. The results indicate that the mean value of Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) correlates most strongly to the SWI and that the wet season vegetation traits show stronger linear relation to the SWI than during the dry season. The correlation between VIs and SWI was found to be independent of the underlying dominant vegetation classes which are not derived in real-time. Therefore, fine-scale vegetation information from optical satellite data convey the spatial heterogeneity missed by coarse synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived SSM products and is linked to the SSM condition underneath for regionalization purposes.

AB  - Xinjiang is a coal-rich region with many bare rocky and gravelly areas with a delicate and fragile ecology. What is the ecological impact of mining activities? In this study, the Salinity Index (SI-T), New Gravel Land Index (NGLI), and Land Deterioration Index (LD) were used to establish an improved remote sensing ecological index (IRSEI) for the HongShaQuan open-pit coal mine (HSQ). The spatial and temporal evolution of the ecological environment of the HSQ was revealed by IRSEI and unary linear regression analysis. Moreover, the influence of mining on the ecological environment of the Gobi mining area was quantitatively evaluated by the random forest model (RF) and difference-in-difference (DID) approach. The results indicated that the value of IRSEI in HSQ had typically decreased over the last 30a. The ecological environment in most areas of the study area was poor and fair levels. The ecological environment of the whole study area showed a decreasing pattern from southeast to northwest. The proportion of degraded area (52.33 %) was much higher than that of improved area (0.39 %). The average residual before and after mining in HSQ were -0.1011 and -0.2323, respectively, which were much higher than that of the whole study area (‐0.0330 and -0.0658, respectively), indicating that the mining activities in HSQ harmed the ecological environment and aggravated the degradation of the ecological environment. The impact of mining activities on the ecological environment from 2000 to 2021 was ‐0.138 using DID. The results from the multiple regression model (MR), RF, and DID during the pre-mining period (2000−2011) were -0.0709, -0.1011, and -0.1345, respectively, while they became -0.1765, -0.2323, and -0.1963 during the post-mining period (2012−2020), respectively. The latter was worse than the former, all showing that the mining activities of HSQ had resulted in a negative effect on the ecological environment. It also demonstrated that the negative value of mining from the MR, RF, and DID have a very similar change trend and was near in value. This verified the feasibility of DID and RF in quantitative analysis of the ecological environment. The ecological environment quality of HSQ was mainly affected by climate change, and less influenced by mining, the contribution rates of both in the IRSEI improved area were 88.48 % and 11.52 %, respectively; and in the degraded area were 69.45 % and 30.55 %, respectively. Therefore, the Gobi mining area should pay attention to the protection of the ecosystem while developing coal. Planting vegetation can promote the governance and restoration of the ecological environment in the mining area. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detectability Of Rainfall Characteristics Over A Mountain River Basin In The Himalayan Region From 2000 To 2015 Using Ground- And Satellite-Based Products
JO  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
PY  - 2022
AB  - Spatial variability in catchment processes is crucial for hydrologic and water resources planning and management. The spatial density of ground-based rain gauge (GRG) observations is often limited. These limitations are more pronounced in the Himalayan region. The rainfall variability is one of the primary factors affecting the water-energy cycle and is often poorly captured by the GRG observations in mountain terrain. This study evaluates the applicability of four satellite-based products (i.e., CHIRPS, MSWEP, PERSIANN, and TMPA) in capturing the rainfall characteristics across a mountain river basin in the Himalayan region. We used rainfall observations from 44 GRG locations located at different physiographic and hydroclimatic areas as a reference for systematic comparison. The comparison was able to discriminate and highlight the benefits and pitfalls of selected satellite-based rainfall estimates (SREs) and rank them based on performance metrics for rugged topography. Monotonic trends based on both ground- and satellite-based products were computed. This study finds that SREs did not well capture short-duration rainfall extremes. Different SREs exhibit a different level of performance (under- to overestimation) for both rainfall frequency and amount. A general tendency of the south to north (S-N) decreasing rainfall amount and their temporal variations are well captured in the study area by the SREs. This study reinforces the idea that several SREs are applicable for water balance and hydrologic regime analysis with local bias correction for analyzing hydroclimatic extremes.

TI  - Machine Learning Simulation Of Land Cover Impact On Surface Urban Heat Island Surrounding Park Areas
JO  - Sustainability (Switzerland)
PY  - 2021
AB  - The urban heat island effect has been studied extensively by many researchers around the world with the process of urbanization coming about as one of the major culprits of the increasing urban land surface temperatures. Over the past 20 years, the city of Dallas, Texas, has consistently been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and has faced rapid urbanization and great amounts of urban sprawl, leading to an increase in built-up surface area. In this study, we utilize Landsat 8 satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, land use/land cover (LULC) data, and a state-of-the-art methodology combining machine learning algorithms (eX-treme Gradient Boosted models, or XGBoost) and a modern game theoretic-based approach (Shap-ley Additive exPlanation, or SHAP values) to investigate how different land use/land cover classi-fications impact the land surface temperature and park cooling effects in the city of Dallas. We con-clude that green spaces, residential, and commercial/office spaces have the largest impacts on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) as well as the Park’s Cooling Intensity (PCI). Additionally, we have found that the extent and direction of influence of these categories depends heavily on the surrounding area. By using SHAP values we can describe these interactions in greater detail than pre-vious studies. These results will provide an important reference for future urban and park place-ment planning to minimize the urban heat island effect, especially in sprawling cities. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Distribution Research Of Evapotranspiration In Hairiver Basin Based On Remote Sensing
JO  - 2011 International Conference on Remote Sensing, Environment and Transportation Engineering, RSETE 2011 - Proceedings
PY  - 2011
AB  - Evaportranspiration is the general name of surface evaporation and plant transpiration, which reflects the condition of "Actual Water Consumption" in regional water resource development. Researching the spatial and temporal distribution of ET and its main influence factors has great significance for water resource management. The remote sensing retrieval has been widely used in obtaining regional ET informations due to its advantage of real-time performance and globe ability. The monthly ET data of Haihe river basin from 2002 to 2005, which were provided through remote sensing model named ETwatch, was used as basic data to describe the characters of ET distribution in this paper. The Haihe river basin had been divided into 4738 units according to administrative division combined with water resource division and land use information, then statistic of ET value was completed for each unit by using ARCGIS software platform. On the base of the analyzing the Haihe river basin ET dataset created above, the general spatial distribution and temporal trend of ET, as well as the influence to ET by land use type in Haihe river basin were described. As the study emphasis, the features of ET of farmland system, construction land system and the forest-grass land system were identified respectively in detail. © 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Phase-Space Function Recovery For Moving Target Imaging In Sar By Convex Optimization
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging
PY  - 2021
AB  - In this paper, we present an approach for ground moving target imaging (GMTI) and velocity recovery using synthetic aperture radar. We formulate the GMTI problem as the recovery of a phase-space reflectivity (PSR) function which represents the strengths and velocities of the scatterers in a scene of interest. We show that the discretized PSR matrix can be decomposed into a rank-one, and a highly sparse component corresponding to the stationary and moving scatterers, respectively. We then recover the two distinct components by solving a constrained optimization problem that admits computationally efficient convex solvers within the proximal gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers frameworks. Using the structural properties of the PSR matrix, we alleviate the computationally expensive steps associated with rank-constraints, such as singular value thresholding. Our optimization-based approach has several advantages over state-of-the-art GMTI methods, including computational efficiency, applicability to dense target environments, and arbitrary imaging configurations. We present extensive simulations to assess the robustness of our approach to both additive noise and clutter, with increasing number of moving targets. We show that both solvers perform well in dense moving target environments, and low-signal-to-clutter ratios without the need for additional clutter suppression techniques. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Applications And Research Using Remote Sensing For Rangeland Management
JO  - Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2003
AB  - Rangelands are grasslands, shrublands, and savannas used by wildlife for habitat and livestock in order to produce food and fiber. Assessment and monitoring of rangelands are currently based on comparing the plant species present in relation to an expected successional end-state defined by the ecological site. In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion. The value of remote sensing for rangeland management depends in part on combining the imagery with other spatial data within geographic information systems. Finally, ARS scientists are developing the knowledge on which future rangeland assessment and monitoring tools will be developed.

TI  - Ecosystem Services Of Lake-Wetlands Exhibit Significant Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity And Scale Effects In A Multi-Lake Megacity
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic disturbances are altering global lake-wetlands (LWs) and their ecosystem services (ESs), posing a threat to sustainable development. Understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and scale effects of LWESs has risen to be a critical concern in the sustainable management of wetlands. Although the LWESs of large lakes or at the macro-region are well documented, their complexity in urbanizing areas remains to be further addressed. Here we aim to reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and scale effects of LWESs under the coinciding effects of wetland conservation and urbanization through a study in Wuhan, a multi-lake city of central China. The LWESs and their spatiotemporal variations from 1999 to 2019 were characterized by nine indicators based on time-series remote-sensing images and statistical data. A V-shaped trend was observed in the area of the LWs over time, which decreasing by 8.12\% in 1999-2010 while recovering by 9.57\% in 2010-2019. The LW loss in the main urban area (MA) was mainly encroached by construction lands, while the restoration of croplands to LWs in the rural area (RA) completely offsets the loss of LWs. We found that the change rates of most LWESs were more severely degraded along a rural-urban gradient, except for cultural services. Specifically, the water supply (-57.39\%), flood regulation (-34.19\%), climate regulation (-31.36\%), and biodiversity conservation (-62.13\%) services were the most severely damaged in LWs in the MA. However, the carbon sink services of LWs in the RA suffer the most severe degradation. Not only with spatiotemporal heterogeneity but LWESs also showed obvious scale effects. The larger the LWs, the higher the ES capacity tends to be. Smaller LWs were heavily encroached, with the worst ES capacities. These results highlight that LW conservation should no longer be homogeneous, but should combine indicators of scale effects and spatial heterogeneity. Due to land resource constraints, those close to urban center should improve regulating and supporting service capacities, while further away, improvements in area and LWESs can be pursued to balance the demand growth. Further, it is important to conserve existing and small LWs from over-encroachment.

TI  - Evaluation Of The Utilization Potential Of High-Resolution Optical Satellite Images In Port Ship Management: A Case Study On Berth Utilization In Busan New Port
JO  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Over the past 20 years, Korea's overall import and export cargo volume has increased at an average annual rate of approximately 5.3\%. About 99\% of the cargo is still being transported by sea. Due to recent increases in maritime cargo volume, congestion in maritime logistics has become challenging due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts. Continuous monitoring of ports has become crucial. Various ground observation systems and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data have been utilized for monitoring ports and conducting numerous preliminary studies for the efficient operation of container terminals and cargo volume prediction. However, small and developing countries' ports face difficulties in monitoring due to environmental issues and aging infrastructure compared to large ports. Recently, with the increasing utility of artificial satellites, preliminary studies have been conducted using satellite imagery for continuous maritime cargo data collection and establishing ocean monitoring systems in vast and hard-to-reach areas. This study aims to visually detect ships docked at berths in the Busan New Port using high-resolution satellite imagery and quantitatively evaluate berth utilization rates. By utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery from Compact Advanced Satellite 500-1 (CAS500-1), Korea Multi-Purpose satellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3), PlanetScope, and Sentinel 2A, ships docked within the port berths were visually detected. The berth utilization rate was calculated using the total number of ships that could be docked at the berths. The results showed variations in berth utilization rates on June 2, 2022, with values of 0.67, 0.7, and 0.59, indicating fluctuations based on the time of satellite image capture. On June 3, 2022, the value remained at 0.7, signifying a consistent berth utilization rate despite changes in ship types. A higher berth utilization rate indicates active operations at the berth. This information can assist in basic planning for new ship operation schedules, as congested berths can lead to longer waiting times for ships in anchorages, potentially resulting in increased freight rates. The duration of operations at berths can vary from several hours to several days. The results of calculating changes in ships at berths based on differences in satellite image capture times, even with a time difference of 4 minutes and 49 seconds, demonstrated variations in ship presence. With short observation intervals and the utilization of high-resolution satellite imagery, continuous monitoring within ports can be achieved. Additionally, utilizing satellite imagery to monitor changes in ships at berths in minute increments could prove useful for small and developing country ports where harbor management is not well-established, offering valuable insights and solutions.

TI  - Meso-Scale Modelling Of Runoff And Water Balances Using Remote Sensing And Other Gis Data
JO  - Hydrological Sciences Journal
PY  - 1994
AB  - For about two decades remote sensing (RS) data in the form of multi-spectral air photography, ground based weather radar as well as geostationary and polar orbiting satellite data have been available for use in hydrology. It is the intention of this paper to advocate the use of RS data in the field of hydrological modelling. It is shown that the main field of application of RS data in hydrological modelling lies in the meso-scale. The potential of RS in the framework of GIS is shown along with three examples. The first example shows the use of RS data for rainfall/runoff modelling in the lower meso-scale. A model was developed which used the high spatial resolution of Landsat polar orbiting satellites (30m × 30 m) for model parameter estimation. The second example shows the use of geostationary satellite data for the computation of long time series of monthly runoff values in the upper meso-scale. It was applied in West Africa for the purpose of water resources planning. In the third example, a water balance model in the upper meso-scale is presented which computes daily values for all the variables in the water balance equation along with an example of the model's application in the international Mosel River basin. Here also the detection of land use changes by multi-temporal satellite imagery and their impact on hydrological parameters is discussed. In this example, emphasis is put on the combination of RS data with other information, such as digital elevation models or digitized maps, all within the framework of GIS. In conclusion, not only the potential but also the limitations of the use of RS in hydrological modelling are discussed. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Mangroves and seagrass contribute to people’s quality of life, taking an important place in the Blue Economy context. Activities such as fishing contribute to the national economies of many developing nations. Carbon sequestration in these systems is considered among the most effective among ecosystem types-even including terrestrial systems-and helps mitigate climate change impacts. Nature-based tourism activities, including in mangrove and seagrass systems, add to the conservation values of these systems, engaging both stakeholders and local commu-nities and generating income through these activities. Biotechnology research and new studies continually reveal the potential of these blue systems for discovery of marine natural products that could be important for medicine, cosmetics, and other products. Despite their importance and potential, mangrove and seagrass systems are under-considered by decision-makers as vulnerable environments, faced by several threats, which has led to decreased areas of these systems. For our future and better exploration of their potential in the blue economy context, mapping Blue Carbon Ecosystems, implementation of restoration programs, and incorporating the ecosystem services they provide into financial valuation frameworks need to be urgent priorities all over the world, especially in developing countries. © The Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM SandT Centre) 2022.

PY  - 2001
AB  - NOAA/NESDIS has initiated a program called the Alaska SAR Demonstration with the goal of demonstrating the utility of RADARSAT-1 C-band SAR imagery to provide useful, timely environmental and resource management information to users in Alaska. One product generated under the program is a list of ship locations. This paper describes the algorithm developed to generate this product by automatically detecting ships based on changes in the local statistics. Using low resolution imagery (100 metres sample spacing) it is shown that ships of lengths greater than 35 metres can be detected (representing 105 ships out of a total of 272 in the test set) with a false alarm rate of 0.01% for a single detection. With high-resolution imagery (50 metres sample spacing) ships of lengths greater than 32 metres can be detected (representing 124 ships out of 272) with a false alarm rate of 0.002% for a single detection. The algorithm is completely automated and takes approximately 10 minutes of elapsed time to run on a ScanSAR Wide B Mode image. © Canadian Journalof Remote Sensing/Journal canadien de teledetection.

TI  - The Evolution Of Irrigation Effects On Agricultural Drought Mitigation In North China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - Drought is one of the most common natural threats to agricultural production worldwide. Few studies have studied the effects of agricultural practices on drought mitigation at a regional scale over a long period. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics in the agricultural drought-affected area change index (ADAC), which was developed to assess the drought mitigation. The linear regression method was used to investigate the impact factors on the change of ADAC in the three main winter wheat provinces of northern China. The results showed that the average ADAC during the main growing season in the study area was approximately -61.5\% over the past 38 years, which indicated a great decrease of the agricultural drought-affected area. The significant decreasing trends of ADAC values across the study area during 1981-2000 could be explained by the area percentage equipped for irrigation (APEI) by 49.2-89.7\%. There was a lack of pronounced change trends of ADAC during 2001-2018, implying that the positive effects of irrigation infrastructure in the plain area might reach a plateau under the constraints of available water resources, and other agricultural practices need to be investigated in the future. This research provides helpful decision information on drought adaptation management and water conservation project planning.

TI  - The Value Of Rapid Damage Assessment For Efficient Earthquake Response
JO  - SAFETY SCIENCE
PY  - 2011
AB  - Every year earthquakes cause substantial economic losses and loss of life in many parts of the world. Earth observations may provide valuable information on spatial damage distribution and through that increase the efficiency of rapid response actions, finally resulting in reduction of earthquake induced losses. However, a methodology for quantitative assessment of the potential value of information in such a context has not yet been developed. That knowledge would be of high importance for planning and development of Earth observation systems on both regional and international levels when aiming at sustainable development goals. In this paper we suggest a stochastic modeling approach to assess the value of information for earthquake rapid response. Our analysis is focused on a rather short time interval after an earthquake occurrence (order of several hours) when there is a maximum need for urgent help to the earthquake victims. We use rescue efficiency as a performance measure of earthquake response actions; this efficiency is described in terms of timely arrival of rescue teams at places, where their help is mostly needed. We quantify the benefit of using spatial damage distribution information in terms of cost reduction/rescue efficiency gains. We intentionally conduct our analysis at a methodological level and do not go deeper into case studies to keep general conclusions traceable. The modeling exercise we present in the paper is a first step towards a more detailed and integrated approach that could contribute to better systematic understanding of earthquake response actions and ultimately improve their efficiency.

TI  - Identifying Important Connectivity Areas For The Wide-Ranging Asian Elephant Across Conservation Landscapes Of Northeast India
JO  - Diversity and Distributions
PY  - 2021
AB  - Aim: Connectivity is increasingly important for landscape-scale conservation programmes. Yet there are obstacles to developing reliable connectivity maps, including paucity of data on animal use of the non-habitat matrix. Our aim was to identify important connectivity areas for the endangered Asian elephant Elephas maximus across a 21,210 km2 region using empirical data and recently developed animal movement models. Location: Northeast India. Methods: We interviewed 1,184 respondents, primarily farmers, residing across our study region, to collect crowd-sourced data on elephant use of the matrix. We generated a classified land use/land cover map and collated remotely sensed data on environmental and anthropogenic covariates. We used logistic regression to estimate the influence of these covariates on resistance, based on elephant detections recorded via interviews. We modelled elephant movement within the randomised shortest path framework, which allows for scenarios ranging from optimal movement with complete information on the landscape to random movement with no information on the landscape. We calculated the passage of elephants through pixels in our study region, a parameter that denotes the expected number of elephant movements through a particular pixel across movement routes. We overlaid linear infrastructure sourced from secondary data, and human–elephant conflict hotspots generated from our interview data, on passage maps. Results: Elephants preferred locations with high vegetation cover, close to forests and with low human population density. We mapped important connectivity areas across the study region, including in three important conservation landscapes. Whilst forests facilitated connectivity, the matrix also played an important contributory role to elephant dispersal. Incorporating information on environmental and anthropogenic drivers of elephant movement added value to connectivity predictions. Main conclusions: Fine-scale mapping of connectivity, using empirical data and realistic movement models, such as the approach we use, can provide for informed and more effective landscape-scale conservation. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - European Copernicus Services To Inform On Sea-Level Rise Adaptation: Current Status And Perspectives
JO  - Frontiers in Marine Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Sea-level rise is a direct consequence of climate change. Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Union’s Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public. Here, an overview of the Copernicus products and services to inform on sea level rise adaptation is provided. Perspectives from Copernicus services on future evolutions to better inform on coastal sea level rise, associated risks, and support adaptation are also discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Melet, Buontempo, Mattiuzzi, Salamon, Bahurel, Breyiannis, Burgess, Crosnier, Le Traon, Mentaschi, Nicolas, Solari, Vamborg and Voukouvalas.

TI  - Marine Ecotourism Development In South Sulawesi, Indonesia
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecotourism is a fast growing tourism industry. Ecotourism is superior to other tourism because it can give economic benefits and preserve natural resources. The potential of Indonesian ecotourism, especially South Sulawesi has not been optimally utilized; therefore it is necessary to study its development potential. This study aims to analyze the potential and problems in marine ecotourism development in South Sulawesi. The study was done at Selayar Regency, Takalar Regency, Makassar City, and Pangkep Regency. The area of mangrove, coral reefs and sea grass ecosystem was estimated by using Landsat 7 Image and ArcView program. Other data were collected by using survey, census, interviews, and questionnaire. The parameters observed were coastal ecosystem resources; socio-economic; infrastructure; policy; and micro, small, medium business and co-operative. SWOT analysis was used to analyze the strategic condition; and Analysis Hierarchy Process was used to analyze the interaction between the priorities level. The study revealed that marine ecotourism development problems were low capacity resources management, low local community participation, limited infrastructure availability, weak capacity of local community institutions, and insufficient local community support or contribution. Marine ecotourism development in South Sulawesi should be focused on tools improvement of sustainable use, infrastructure development, socioeconomic strengthening, and consistent policy implementation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Reconstructing Monthly Ecv Global Soil Moisture With An Improved Spatial Resolution
JO  - Water Resources Management
PY  - 2018
AB  - Remote sensing techniques have provided global covered soil moisture at high temporal resolution, however, the coarse spatial resolution and the data gaps have greatly reduced their potential values in large numbers of practical and regional applications. This study proposed a two-steps reconstruction approach for reconstructing satellite-based soil moisture products (ECV) at an improved spatial resolution. The reconstruction model implemented the Random Forests (RF) regression algorithm to simulate the relationships between soil moisture and environmental variables, and takes advantages of the high spatial resolution of optical remote sensing products: the data gaps of ECV soil moisture products were firstly filled by the estimation model trained using available pixels of the ECV products and corresponding environmental variables; then a spatial downscaling was carried out to the gap-filled ECV products to obtain the reconstructed soil moisture with fine spatial resolution (0.05°). As a result, the reconstructed soil moisture well fill the data gaps of the original ECV products and nicely reproduced the original soil moisture values (R2 > 0.98). The spatial resolution and variation details of the soil moisture products were also improved significantly. Validation results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture showed comparable good performance (average R2 = 0.66) as the original ECV products (average R2 = 0.65) and nicely reflect the temporal behavior of ground-based measurements. As a result, the reconstructed soil moisture well filled the data gaps and greatly improved the spatial resolution of ECV products. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Evaluation Of Flood Control And Inundation Conservation In Cambodia Using Flood And Economic Growth Models
JO  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper evaluates the optimal spatial flood protection for people living with the threat of floods in the lower Mekong River region with respect to hydrology and economics. A hydrological numerical simulation contributes to an understanding of the relationship between flood control policy and inundation areas. The numerical simulation consists of a dynamic wave model in channels and a non-Uniform flow model in inundation areas, which estimate the temporal and spatial dynamic distributions of water depth. In economics, an overlapping generations model expresses the economy's growth process considering flood magnitude and flood protection. This economic model is composed of industrial and agricultural production functions which are affected by flood control policies. The hydrological and economic models are verified by remote sensing images and data from the economic development of Thailand, respectively. Combining these two models, we call identify the area to protect and accept floods for regional development. Wide areas along the rivers should be flooded due to the benefits from fertilization for inundation agriculture in Cambodia. The conservation area should be about 2000 km(2), and the spatial distribution of flooding should be identified. In the beginning of an economic growth period, there is little difference in the production of all inundation area in the range of 0-2000 km(2). As the inundation area becomes larger, the production rate is larger in the stable growth period. This study explains that inundation agriculture should be maintained in riverside areas which supply much of the agricultural production in Cambodia. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

TI  - A New Pattern To Quantitatively Evaluate The Value Of Ecosystem Services In The Large-Scale Open-Pit Coal Mining Area
JO  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
PY  - 2023
AB  - IntroductionOpen-pit coal mining could disrupt the ecosystem and lead to the loss of service values for the ecosystem through direct occupation or indirect impacts on adjacent ecosystems. MethodsIn this research, we combined a new accounting system, gross ecosystem product (GEP), with spatial-temporal analyses to quantify the ecological variation and explore its driving factors in Pingshuo, a large-scale open-pit coal mining area in China. GEP is an aggregate accounting system that can summarize the value of provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services (ES) in a single monetary metric. The spatial-temporal approaches used in our study were known as exploratory spatial data analyses and interpretable models in machine learning. Both spatial and non-spatial data, including remote sensing images, meteorological data, and official statistics, were applied in the research. ResultsThe results indicated the following: (i) From 1990 to 2020, the annual average growth rates of GEP decreased from 30.78 to 9.1\%. Furthermore, the classified results of GEP revealed that the regions with rich ES quality rapidly reduced from 51.90 to 32.18\%. (ii) Spatial correlation of GEP was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the mining areas. Moreover, the mining areas also continually presented concentrated high-density and hot spot areas of GEP changes. (iii) The spatial-temporal effects were notable in the relationship between GEP and three socioeconomic factors, i.e., the mining effects, human activity intensity, and gross domestic product (GDP). (iv) The win-win development for both the economy and ecological environment in Pingshuo could be realized by restricting the annual growth rate of mining areas to between 4.56 and 5.03\%. DiscussionThe accounting results and spatial-temporal analyses of GEP will contribute to the future regional sustainable development and ecosystem management in Pingshuo.

TI  - Acquisition Of Earth Science Remote Sensing Observations From Commercial Sources: Lessons Learned From The Space Imaging Ikonos Example
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2003
AB  - Over the last decade, NASA and other federal agencies have been increasingly encouraged to explore commercial sources of land remote sensing data rather than pursuing government-funded sources of these measurements (prior to U.S. Commercial Executive, 2003. U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy. White House, Washington, DC). The science and applications users have been skeptical of this move to commercial sources of observations both because of uncertainty over the capabilities of the private sector and the unsatisfactory outcomes of previous efforts to commercialize satellite-acquired land remote sensing observations. In an effort to more fully explore the potential of commercial remotely sensed land data sources, the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) implemented an experimental Scientific Data Purchase (SDP) that solicited bids from the private sector to meet ESE-user data needs. The SDP activity spanned nearly 5 years and supplied many US and international researchers with sources of land remote sensing observations that had not been previously available. The images from the Space Imaging IKONOS system provided a particularly good match to the current ESE missions such as Terra and Landsat 7 and therefore serve as focal point in this analysis. Throughout the SDP process, there have been many lessons learned concerning interactions between US industry, government agencies and the science user community. The specifies of the Space Imaging IKONOS experience under the NASA SDP are most valuable with respect to possible future uses of commercial vendors to supply NASA ESE user needs for space-acquired land observations. Areas where valuable lessons were learned included the technical, scientific, proprietary and management aspects of the interactions. As this activity has evolved, user confidence in the technical and scientific qualities of the IKONOS measurements has increased substantially. There are still areas where further progress could be achieved, with respect to proprietary and management aspects of scientific commercial data buys. To date, the NASA scientific and applications users who have examined the IKONOS imagery have found the data to be of high quality, providing substantial value to their specific pursuits. They have found that the novel attributes of IKONOS, particularly in the spatiotemporal domain have introduced new analysis challenges not previously experienced with EOS sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. The technical qualities of the observations have been substantially improved during the SDP activity as a result of independent validation and verification by the Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) of the IKONOS observations. The experience gained from the Space Imaging IKONOS SDP activity, suggests that US private sector is technically capable of meeting the needs of NASA ESE science and application users. The future success of such interactions between industry, government and users appears to be far more dependent on the organizational and legal aspects of such arrangements than technical capabilities of the data providers.

TI  - Gis-Based Landslide Spatial Modeling In Ganzhou City, China
JO  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2016
AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping is among the first works for disaster management and land use planning activities in a mountain area like Ganzhou City. The aims of the current study are to assess GIS-based landslide spatial modeling using four models, namely data-driven evidential belief function (EBF), frequency ratio (FR), maximum entropy (Maxent), and logistic regression (LR), and to compare their performances. At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared according to aerial photographs, satellite images, and extensive field surveys. In total, 3971 landslide events were recognized in the study area that used 2979 landslides (75 \%) for modeling and 992 landslide events (25 \%) for validation. In the next step, the landslide-conditioning factors, namely slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope-length (LS), lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance from rivers, distance from faults, distance from roads, and rainfall, were derived from the spatial database. Finally, landslide susceptibility maps of Ganzhou City were mapped in ArcGIS based on EBF, FR, Maxent, and LR approaches and were validated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC plot assessment results showed that in the landslide susceptibility maps using the EBF, FR, Maxent, and LR models, the area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.7367, 0.7789, 0.7903, and 0.8237, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that all four models have AUC values of more than 0.70 and can be used in landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area. Also, the LR model had the best performance in the current study. Meanwhile, the mentioned models (EBF, FR, Maxent, and LR) showed almost similar results. The resultant susceptibility maps produced in the current study can be useful for land use planning and hazard mitigation purposes in the study area.

TI  - Towards An Environmental Classification Of Lentic Aquatic Ecosystems In The Mcmurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest single ice-free area in Antarctica, and of considerable scientific and conservation value as an extreme polar desert. This is recognised through the McMurdo Dry Valleys Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), where management's goals focus on protection of its unique features, while facilitating science access. Using a mix of remote sensing and existing cartography, we have identified over 6000 lakes and ponds in the ASMA. This study develops a classification of those aquatic ecosystems to provide a framework for management. It uses a limited top-down, hierarchical classification to define 13 class separations based on physical attributes that could largely be ascribed from existing databases or remotely sensed information. The first hierarchical level was based on landscape position, separating coastal kettle holes (reflecting recent glacial history), from other "topographic" water bodies. The second level was based on endorheic vs exorheic drainage, the third on mid-summer ice condition (no-ice cap; ice capped; frozen to base) and the fourth on source of inflow (glacial or non-glacial). Kettles were sub-classed by mid-summer ice only. Classes were tested against a set of field observations and an expert workshop validation process considered management implications for the ASMA. This study shows how the classification assists our understanding of Dry Valley landscapes and addresses management issues faced by researchers, environmental managers and policy makers. The approach to classification, rather than the detailed classes that may be specific to the Dry Valleys, has potential for wider use in other polar landscapes.

TI  - An Improved Remote Sensing Based Approach For Predicting Actual Evapotranspiration By Integrating Lidar
JO  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - Spatially distributed information of actual Evapotranspiration (ET) is essentially required for various applications in agriculture, as well as studies related to water balance. An Energy Balance model that uses optical and thermal remote sensing datasets is appropriate for the spatially distributed estimation of ET, which is primarily controlled by local environmental conditions. In this study, we use the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), which is an Energy Balance model, to estimate an improved actual ET, by integrating canopy height information obtained from ICESat/GLAS, the first space-borne LiDAR satellite. Our model estimates latent heat flux (LE) as a residual of energy balance, while sensible heat flux (H) is estimated based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The spatial variability of H and LE estimated from Landsat TM/ETM+ images were compared with eddy covariance (EC) based in situ flux tower observations, in order to document the SEBS model uncertainties in three forest sites in the East and Southeast Asian ecosystem. We identified that canopy height (h(c)) is one of the critical parameters that can induce uncertainties in SEBS model estimations. Therefore, h(c) obtained from LiDAR was introduced in parameterization of the roughness length for momentum transfer (z(0m)). In situ based h(c) obtained from flux tower stations, and the normalized difference vegetation index based formulation of h(c) proposed by Su (2001), were also introduced in the SEBS z(0m) parameterization. Root mean square error of LiDAR integrated SEBS (SEBSLiDar) for estimated H values reduced by (20, 45, and 23)\% compared to Landsat integrated SEBS (SEBSLandsat), and (18, 7, and 9)\% com-pared to In situ integrated SEBS (SEBSInsitu) at the three selected forest sites (SMC, QYZ, and SMF), respectively, while the mean coefficient of determination values for the estimated LE improved by (9.09 and 5.88)\% compared to SEBSLandsat and SEBSInsitu, respectively, with reference to ground-based flux tower observations. Our analysis reveals that LiDAR-based parameterization of z(0m) can significantly increase the accuracy of estimated roughness lengths within an ET model, which can therefore improve the accuracy of the estimated turbulent heat fluxes. SEBSLiDAR was further evaluated for the spatially distributed mapping of actual ET. We have observed that ET estimated by SEBSLandsat overestimated in forest sites compared to EC observations; however, LiDAR-integrated SEBS marginally improved the accuracy of ET, thereby leading to an improvement in the mean correlation value of 0.87 and mean normalized standard deviation value of 0.93 approaching unity based on Taylor diagram, which more closely approximates the actual ground-based measurements. The proposed methodology overcomes the current limitation in the energy balance models in estimating roughness lengths, by providing accurate formulation of h(c) by specifically incorporating LiDAR mea-surements in areas of tall vegetation canopies. The operational improvement in roughness lengths by next-generation SEBSLiDAR model provides an opportunity to improve the estimation accuracy of water and energy fluxes, specifically ET. Overall, our proposed SEBSLiDAR model provides a benchmark that is useful to policy makers and water resource managers in devising a plan for sustainable use of water resources in the East Asian region, as well as other similar ecosystems.

TI  - Analyzing Seasonal Variation In The Vegetation Cover Using Ndvi And Rainfall In The Dry Deciduous Forest Region Of Eastern India
JO  - Forest Resources Resilience and Conflicts
PY  - 2021
AB  - Ecological viability of the environment has been crucially dependent on the vegetation status of the region across the globe. Climate parameters, namely, rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, evapotranspiration, etc., play essential roles in maintaining the health of the vegetation. Thus analyzing the influence of climate parameters on vegetation is essential to maintain their potentiality and sustainability. In the present study the relationship between rainfall and vegetation status was analyzed in Bankura district of West Bengal. Rainfall data from 1901 to 2018 has been collected from six stations located in the study area using CRU and Swat datasets. Trend-Free Pre-whitening (TFPW) Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen’s slope test were employed in the RStudio to examine the rainfall variability at different stations. Normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI) for different seasons were prepared from Landsat 8 OLI data of 2019. The association between NDVI and TFPW-MK values of rainfall was analyzed through regression to assess the influence of rainfall on vegetation. Results indicated a strong increasing trend in rainfall at an annual scale as well as during monsoonal months and post-monsoonal months. Neither a decreasing nor an increasing trend in rainfall was observed during the summer and winter seasons. Significant variability in vegetation was also identified from the seasonal analysis while a relationship was identified between rainfall and vegetation status indicating the influence of rainfall on vegetation in the study area. The approach used here will be instructive for formulating effective management strategies for planning in the forest-dominated region at various scales. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Sustainable Silt Management In The Lower Kosi River, North Bihar, India: Demand Assessment, Investment Model And Socio-Economic Development
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Kosi River, draining through Nepal and north Bihar, India, has been known for excessive sediment (commonly called silt) deposition-a primary cause of several hazards. However, there are still no good estimates of the volume of silt accumulated in the Kosi River channel, which makes removal and utilization of silt a major challenge, both technically as well as economically. In this work, we first present a novel method to estimate sediment volume on a reach scale using hydrological and channel planform data mapped from satellite images. We then identify various commercial uses of the Kosi River sediments such as embankment construction, backfilling, land reclamation, landscaping, agricultural applications, industrial applications, and geotextile silt walls. In consultation with various stakeholders, backfilling and embankment construction were identified as potentially the best solutions shortlisted for the development of a business case and investment model. Therefore, we prepared an investment model based on economic viability, cost-to-benefit ratio, and stakeholder consultations for two districts. We performed a SWOT analysis by breaking down the opportunities and risks into political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (PEST-EL) factors to identify the pros and cons within the sector and of the ecosystem in which the stakeholders operate.

TI  - Kapur's Entropy For Color Image Segmentation Based On A Hybrid Whale Optimization Algorithm
JO  - Entropy
PY  - 2019
AB  - In this paper, a new hybrid whale optimization algorithm (WOA) called WOA-DE is proposed to better balance the exploitation and exploration phases of optimization. Differential evolution (DE) is adopted as a local search strategy with the purpose of enhancing exploitation capability. The WOA-DE algorithm is then utilized to solve the problem of multilevel color image segmentation that can be considered as a challenging optimization task. Kapur's entropy is used to obtain an efficient image segmentation method. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, different images are selected for experiments, including natural images, satellite images and magnetic resonance (MR) images. The experimental results are compared with state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms as well as conventional approaches. Several performance measures have been used such as average fitness values, standard deviation (STD), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), feature similarity index (FSIM), Wilcoxon's rank sum test, and Friedman test. The experimental results indicate that the WOA-DE algorithm is superior to the other meta-heuristic algorithms. In addition, to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, the Otsu method is used for comparison. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Gully Erosion Susceptibility Mapping Based On Bayesian Weight Of Evidence
PY  - 2020
AB  - Identifying gully erosion susceptibility in cultivated region is important for the manager and decision makers. The present study demonstrated the application of the weight of evidence (WoE) model (a Bayesian probability model) for gully erosion susceptibility mapping using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) tools in the southwestern part of West Bengal, India. Eight gully erosion conditioning geo-environmental factors were considered for the susceptibility analysis, such as lithology, geomorphology, soil type, land use, slope, slope length (LS), stream power index (SPI), and wetness index (WI). Tests of conditional independence were performed for the selection of eight gully conditioning factors. Finally, gully erosion susceptibility map was prepared using the ratings of each gully conditioning factor. The resultant susceptibility map was validated using the area under the curve (AUC) method. The results indicated that the WoE model had an AUC value of 67.8\%. Therefore, the WoE model is useful in gully erosion susceptibility mapping and helps decision makers in land-use planning.

TI  - Identifying Priorities For The Joint Conservation Of Maritime Built Heritage And Marine Biodiversity: An Assessment Of Shoreline Engineering On The Isles Of Scilly, Uk, Using Historical Datasets
JO  - OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - Growing concern over the ecological impact of maritime structures has led to increasing attempts to quantify the extent of marine human development. However, maritime heritage assets (i.e., historic structures of cultural significance, such as decommissioned quays) are often missing in these assessments as many of these structures are not recorded in conventional datasets of maritime infrastructure, instead featuring exclusively in heritage registers. At the same time, heritage assets may provide unintentional ecological benefits to marine wildlife due to their age, traditional construction, and protected status, and as such, comprehensive assessments of marine human development cannot be achieved without the inclusion of historical data. Using the Isles of Scilly as a geographically confined case study, we present a novel methodology for quantifying the full extent of marine engineering structures (including heritage assets) at a regional scale, and for identifying priority structures for joint biodiversity and heritage conservation. Historical datasets were considered alongside remote sensing data and records of modern coastal defences in a rapid desk-based assessment to create a full inventory of marine structures along the entire coastline of the Isles of Scilly. In total, 68 structures were recorded, totalling 6180 m in length. By evaluating the ecological potential and heritage value of each structure using a novel scoring system that was verified in the field, priorities for conservation and other managed interventions are identified. This includes (1) listed buildings and scheduled monuments that due to their construction features and shore position are most likely to support diverse marine assemblages, and (2) modern structures where eco-enhancement adaptations may be favourable.As demonstrated here, combined ecological-heritage evaluations allow for the identification of structures with the greatest potential for the joint conservation of built heritage and marine wildlife. Research is now needed to develop this method further and test its application in other geographical locations and at varying spatial scales.

TI  - Opportunities To Leverage World Heritage Sites For Local Development In The Alps
JO  - ECO MONT-JOURNAL ON PROTECTED MOUNTAIN AREAS RESEARCH
PY  - 2016
AB  - In recent years research within the EU project CHERPLAN and the Global Regions Initiative studied a total of 33 natural and cultural heritage sites in South-Eastern Europe and the Alpine Space with over-used and unused development opportunities. The key success factors analysis was applied to nine pilot sites in the CHERPLAN project to better understand the opportunities and bottle necks of heritage sites, to contribute to local and regional development and to create benefit for local communities. A follow-up study extended the investigations to 24 World Heritage (WH) properties within the Alpine Space, based on the WH Convention's nomination files, management plans and the documents of the Periodic Reporting 2nd cycle (2013 / 2014). The studies evaluated the key success factors and the potential to use heritage sites as resources for local development. The studies focuses on identifying the state-of-the art, bottlenecks and solutions to optimize impact and to contribute to sustainable development processes in and around heritage sites. The four historic centres and the five serial nominations of the Alpine Space in the WH list are situated on the rim of the Alpine Convention area and, because of their particular characteristics, have little impact on local development and create limited added value for local communities. The other 15 sites are situated in rural and remote areas and present considerable unused development opportunities. All the WH sites have very high Natural and Cultural Capital and its Accessibility due to their Outstanding Universal Value, their uniqueness, accessibility and the established education and research facilities. The sites in the high Alps perform rather less well in terms of Limits and Pre-requisites for Development, either because of the remote location and difficult environmental conditions or because of limited marketing and promotion prospects of their brands. The main weaknesses and opportunities emerged in the third key factors group Strategy, Cooperation and Sustainability: lack of public private cooperation, strategic planning, integrated management plans, sustainable development concepts and involvement of stakeholders. The holistic development approach, targeted at sustainable growth and benefit for local people, and stakeholders involvement, is not yet considered adequately in WH strategies and in the Periodic Reporting.

TI  - Short-Term Evaluation Of The Retreating Cliffs Of Tibau Do Sul Brazil
JO  - Revista de Geociencias do Nordeste
PY  - 2021
AB  - The objective of this article was to employ geotechnology tools, such as the Digital Image Processing (DIP) of the QUICKBIRD high-resolution satellite, spatial analysis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environments and the statistics modules of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), to identify the coastal sectors containing cliffs in Tibau do Sul, Rio Grande do Norte (RN) state, Brazil, and quantify the retreat rates between 2003 and 2013. The results showed that about 34% of the shoreline of Tibau do Sul, dominated by cliffs, has retreated significantly. The greatest cliff retreat occurred in subsectors N2, C3 and S2, with a decrease of 1.5, 1.71 and 1.9m, respectively. The constant value (LR²) was unchanged in all cases and greater than 0.75, suggesting a linear erosive process throughout the decade analyzed. Thus, the tools and methods used are essential subsidies for identifying coastal erosive processes and developing instruments for the control and environmental management of the coastal zone. © 2021, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

TI  - Assessment Of Remote Sensing-Based Indices For Drought Monitoring In The North-Western Region Of Bangladesh
JO  - HELIYON
PY  - 2023
AB  - Drought is a widespread hazard that can tremendously affect the biodiversity, habitat of wild species, and ecosystem functioning and stability, especially in the dry region. Due to its geographic location, the north-western region of Bangladesh has a comparatively arid climate which is very much susceptible to drought occurrence and is marked as a red zone. Despite the growing evidence of the impact of drought on food security and ecosystem functioning, little effort has been paid to mitigate the drought in this region. The present study aimed to assess the drought condition of the north-western region of Bangladesh using earth observation techniques. For this purpose, Landsat data from 1990 to 2020 was used to determine various vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Index (NDWI), Moisture Index (NDMI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), along with Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results show that the depletion of forests (2832 km2) and water bodies (6773 km2) resulted from the expansion of settlement (6563 km2) and agricultural land (1802 km2) for the period 1990-2020. Examination of the temporal changes of vegetation indices and LST showed that the values of all indices decreased while the LST increased. The negative correlation between NDVI value and LST indicates that the vegetation in our study was subject to drought-induced shocks. This study reveals the current situation of the vegetation health in the north-western region of Bangladesh in relation to the drought conditions. The findings of this study have practical implications for the policymakers in implementing necessary measures for agriculture, forests, water development, and economic zone planning.

TI  - Dianchi Lake Watershed Impervious Surface Area Dynamics And Their Impact On Lake Water Quality From 1988 To 2017
JO  - Environmental Science and Pollution Research
PY  - 2018
AB  - The relationships between impervious surface area (ISA) patterns and characteristics have long been studied to examine the impacts of hydrological cycles, water management, surface energy balances, and biodiversity. This study assessed the Dianchi Lake watershed as a case study area to illustrate ISA change characteristics and their impacts on Dianchi Lake water quality. More than 200 Landsat images (from 1988 to 2017) were first downloaded through the US Geological Survey (USGS) online portal. Then, a series of ISA maps of the Dianchi Lake watershed at an annual resolution were built using a robust method we proposed. Then, the change characteristics of main water quality parameters were analyzed from spatial-temporal viewpoints. Finally, correlations between ISA and Lake water quality were made. The research results indicated that the ISA proportion of the Dianchi Lake watershed rapidly increased (from 1.84% in 1988 to 34.32% in 2017), the annual ISA total growth rate exceeded 21 km2/year, and the urban area encircled Dianchi Lake. The Dianchi Lake watershed has begun to adopt the “Rashly Advancing” and “Great Leap Forward” strategies of urbanization. Chlorophyll a (Chla), dissolved oxygen (DO), and transparency (Trans) showed significantly changing tendencies, whereas the values of pH, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus stayed relatively constant. The polynomial regression models and corresponding R2 values indicated strong correlations between ISA and three water quality parameters (Chla, DO, and Trans). The development of better strategies for the control and reduction of water pollution without optimizing ISA spatial distribution is essential for Kunming’s continued urbanization. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Evaluation Of Two Surface Scattering Models Within The Water Cloud Model Over An Agricultural Area In Mexico And Synergistic Use Of Sentinel-1 And Sentinel-2 Images
JO  - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
PY  - 2023
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical parameter that is relevant to several activities such as agriculture and disaster management (e.g., drought, floods, water stress periods, etc.) [1]. Thus, it has a considerable impact on life on Earth. Recently, researchers are counting on the advanced development of remote sensing (RS) technologies for soil moisture retrieval. RS techniques provided amounts of free high, spatial, and time series images that serve soil moisture retrievals at the agricultural field scale such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Therefore, this work aims at evaluating the impact of different formulations to represent the soil contribution using synergistically both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. This evaluation will reveal the impact of the different soil formulations to represent the backscatter from the ground within the Water Cloud Model (WCM). The formulations representing the soil contribution in this work are the linear equation and the Oh model. The evaluation experiments are set based on in-situ data collected from different fields in Huamantla, Central Mexico. The statistical evaluation of the different formulations of the soil contribution in the total backscatter from the WCM is obtained by comparing the simulations with satellite observations over the complete period. The best results of the evaluated formulations are recorded by the Oh model in the Alvaro site with bias and root mean squared difference (RMSD) values equal -0.0002 dB and - {1.49_{x{{10}^{ - 6}}}} dB for VV polarization and, 0.0011dB, and {8.1452_{x{{10}^{ - 6}}}} dB for VH polarization. In contrast, the best results obtained by the linear equation are obtained in the Macario site with bias and RMSD values equal to 0.6622 dB and -0.724dB, for VV polarization and 1.2990 dB, and 1.2994 dB for VH polarizations. On the other hand, the total backscatter from the WCM combined with the Oh model outlined the highest accuracy during the vegetated period. In the Palafox-2 site, the combined model obtained a correlation coefficient (r), bias, and RMSD up to 0.965 dB and, -0.107 dB and 0.494 dB for VV polarization, respectively, and 0.916 dB, 0.572 dB, and 1.655 dB for VH polarization, respectively. The slight differences between the two surface scattering models within the WCM suggest that both formulations could be suitable to be implemented in a retrieval process, depending upon the available ancillary information. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - What Has Driven Deforestation In Developing Countries Since The 2000s? Evidence From New Remote-Sensing Data
JO  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2017
AB  - Using newly-released and globally available high-resolution remote sensing data on forest loss, we update the assessment of the cross-country determinants of deforestation in developing countries. We validate most of the major determinants found in the previous literature, generally based on earlier time-periods, except for the role of institutional quality. Agricultural trade, hitherto relatively neglected, is found to be one of the main factors causing deforestation. Focusing on the effect of international trade, we show that countries with different levels of relative forest cover react differently to a shock in agricultural exports' value. We also emphasize that taking countries' development into account may be critical in assessing global deforestation trends. The impact of trade is high in countries still endowed with a large proportion of forest cover while it is lower in countries with smaller remaining forest cover. We finally estimate, through a simple calibration exercise, the requirements for a cost-effective REDD+ policy for compensating trade losses in an open economy exporting agricultural commodities and endowed with tropical forests. We conclude that, in a world with increasing global demand, it might be costly to compensate totally and thus to offer the right incentives for developing countries to limit deforestation.

TI  - Evaluation Of Factors Affecting Gully Headcut Location Using Summary Statistics And The Maximum Entropy Model: Golestan Province, Ne Iran
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - Gully erosion is an important soil degradation process, which under climate changes is projected to increase. Therefore, better understating of factors controlling gully erosion and prediction of gully headcuts' (GHs) location is still highly relevant. This study aimed to examine the spatial distribution of GHs and to assess the importance of pedological (i.e. aggregate stability, organic matter, bulk density, silt, clay, and sand content) and topographical factors (i.e. altitude, slope length, gradient, and aspect) using summary statistics and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The study was conducted in the loess-covered region of NE Iran. The highly precise data of 287 GHs locations were obtained by extensive fieldwork and the interpretation of UAV images. The spatial distribution of GHs was evaluated by univariate pair correlation function and O-ring statistics. The spatial effect of GHs density controlling factors was assessed by the cumulative density correlation function Cm,K(r). Variable importance was analyzed using the MaxEnt model, which was also for the susceptibility modelling of GHs. The results of univariate tests showed the aggregated distribution of GHs. The Cm,K(r) analyses indicated that the areas characterized by higher values of bulk density, aggregate stability, and organic matter content have lower GHs density, whereas the areas with high silt content and higher slope gradient have higher GHs density. According to the MaxEnt, there is no one single factor responsible for GHs location, but rather the combination of topographical and pedological factors with the predominance of slope gradient (0.86) and silt content (0.57). The MaxEnt modelling of GHs susceptibility has revealed that the best accuracy (0.958) is given when all pedological and topographical factors are used in the model. The susceptibility maps prepared in the study can be used for soil conversation and land use planning and, consequently, for sustainable development in the region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Human-Centred Assessment Framework To Prioritise Heat Mitigation Efforts For Active Travel At City Scale
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2021
AB  - Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Supporting Rehabilitation Training Of Copd Patients Through Multivariate Sensor-Based Monitoring And Autonomous Control Using A Bayesian Network: Prototype And Results Of A Feasibility Study
JO  - Informatics for Health and Social Care
PY  - 2010
AB  - Repeated endurance training supervised by an expert is one of the most effective rehabilitation methods for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to improve physical function. Monitoring of vital signs in combination with an automatic intelligent training control and emergency detection facilitates supervised training without the physical presence of an expert as well as training optimisation through individualisation. The aim of this study is the development of a suitable analysis and control method for this purpose. Healthy volunteers and patients with COPD were equipped with body sensors during ergometer training to enable measuring their vital signs continuously. Depending on these values, the exercise load of the ergometer was controlled automatically using a Bayesian network. The network, trained with expert knowledge and training data, is embedded in our system by using Java application programming interface. Extensive tests in a laboratory setting have proved safe usage of our prototype. In a case study, evaluation during training sessions with patients with COPD took place. Due to the automatic control the patients' vital signs ranged inside the predefined optimal thresholds for at least 95 of the time. Furthermore, our results suggest an increase of the training efficiency compared with the conventional method (constant exercise load). © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

TI  - An Integrated Approach For Tactical Monitoring And Data-Driven Spread Forecasting Of Wildfires
JO  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
PY  - 2017
AB  - In recent times there have been increasing efforts to integrate technology into wildfire management, especially in the fields of tactical monitoring and simulation. On the one hand, thermal infrared imaging (TIR) systems have been installed aboard surveillance aircraft including unmanned systems (UAS). On the other, there exists a variety of models and simulators able to forecast the fire spread. However, both fields currently present significant limitations. While relevant information is still extracted manually from aerial thermal imagery and is most times merely qualitative, simulators' accuracy on fire spread prediction has proved insufficient. To solve these issues, this article presents a twofold methodology to couple meaningful automated wildfire monitoring with accurate fire spread forecasting. The main goals are to, firstly, automatically process aerial TIR imagery so that valuable information can be produced in real time during the event and, secondly, use this information to adjust a Rothermel-based simulator in order to improve its accuracy on-line. The fire perimeter location is tracked automatically through an unsupervised edge detector. Afterwards, an assimilation module uses the remotely sensed data to optimise the simulator's fuel and wind parameters, which are assumed to remain constant for a certain period of time. Subsequently, the optimum parameters' values are used to issue a fire evolution forecast. All outputs are projected onto the corresponding Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for visualization. The global system was validated using two large-scale experiments. If these algorithms can be applied to a sufficiently rich and varied set of experimental data and further developed to cope with more complex scenarios, they could eventually be incorporated into a fire management decision support system.

TI  - Ravæn: Unsupervised Change Detection Of Extreme Events Using Ml On-Board Satellites
JO  - Scientific Reports
PY  - 2022
AB  - Applications such as disaster management enormously benefit from rapid availability of satellite observations. Traditionally, data analysis is performed on the ground after being transferred—downlinked—to a ground station. Constraints on the downlink capabilities, both in terms of data volume and timing, therefore heavily affect the response delay of any downstream application. In this paper, we introduce RaVÆn, a lightweight, unsupervised approach for change detection in satellite data based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), with the specific purpose of on-board deployment. RaVÆn pre-processes the sampled data directly on the satellite and flags changed areas to prioritise for downlink, shortening the response time. We verified the efficacy of our system on a dataset—which we release alongside this publication—composed of time series containing a catastrophic event, demonstrating that RaVÆn outperforms pixel-wise baselines. Finally, we tested our approach on resource-limited hardware for assessing computational and memory limitations, simulating deployment on real hardware. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Automatic Building Extraction From Image And Lidar Data With Active Contour Segmentation
JO  - Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Automatic building extraction is an important topic for many applications such as urban planning, disaster management, 3D building modeling and updating GIS databases. Its approaches mainly depend on two data sources: light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud and aerial imagery both of which have advantages and disadvantages of their own. In this study, in order to benefit from the advantages of each data sources, LiDAR and image data combined together. And then, the building boundaries were extracted with the automated active contour algorithm implemented in MATLAB. Active contour algorithm uses initial contour positions to segment an object in the image. Initial contour positions were detected without user interaction by a series of image enhancements, band ratio and morphological operations. Four test areas with varying building and background levels of detail were selected from ISPRS’s benchmark Vaihingen and Istanbul datasets. Vegetation and shadows were removed from all the datasets by band ratio to improve segmentation quality. Subsequently, LiDAR point cloud data was converted to raster format and added to the aerial imagery as an extra band. Resulting merged image and initial contour positions were given to the active contour algorithm to extract building boundaries. In order to compare the contribution of LiDAR to the proposed method, the boundaries of the buildings were extracted from the input image before and after adding LiDAR data to the image as a layer. Finally extracted building boundaries were smoothed by the Awrangjeb (Int J Remote Sen 37(3): 551–579. https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.1131868, 2016) boundary regularization algorithm. Correctness (Corr), completeness (Comp) and accuracy (Q) metrics were used to assess accuracy of segmented building boundaries by comparing extracted building boundaries with manually digitized building boundaries. Proposed approach shows the promising results with over 93% correctness, 92% completeness and 89% quality. © 2018, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.

TI  - A Framework To Integrate Innovations In Invasion Science For Proactive Management
JO  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
PY  - 2022
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a rising threat to biodiversity, national security, and regional economies, with impacts in the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars annually. Proactive or predictive approaches guided by scientific knowledge are essential to keeping pace with growing impacts of invasions under climate change. Although the rapid development of diverse technologies and approaches has produced tools with the potential to greatly accelerate invasion research and management, innovation has far outpaced implementation and coordination. Technological and methodological syntheses are urgently needed to close the growing implementation gap and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and synergy among evolving disciplines. A broad review is necessary to demonstrate the utility and relevance of work in diverse fields to generate actionable science for the ongoing invasion crisis. Here, we review such advances in relevant fields including remote sensing, epidemiology, big data analytics, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, genomics, and others, and present a generalized framework for distilling existing and emerging data into products for proactive IAS research and management. This integrated workflow provides a pathway for scientists and practitioners in diverse disciplines to contribute to applied invasion biology in a coordinated, synergistic, and scalable manner.

TI  - Integrated Remote Sensing Of Bathymetry And Onshore Topography For Asset Inspection, Hydrology Modelling And Hazard Assessment
JO  - IAHS-AISH Publication
PY  - 2012
AB  - Recent integration of multibeam bathymetric sonar and mobile laser scanning (LiDAR) have opened the door to a versatile and cost-effective method for remote sensing bathymetry, with riparian and onshore topographic features at the same time. These advances have made it possible to build a dataset that extends from the bed of a watercourse through the riparian zone and even into the flood plain from a single waterborne sensor platform. This is a major milestone for practical and cost-effective evaluation of both anthropogenic and natural waterways, as well as near-shore coastal regions. Such evaluations include accurate flood inundation modelling, environmental studies, geohazards identification, silt/sediment dynamics (scour and accumulation), slope stability/landslide investigation (including seamless evaluation of subaerial and underwater slope failure features) and bottom surface material hardness and classification.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing And Gis Techniques For Effective Watershed Management: A Case Study Of Wadi Al-Naft Basins In Diyala Governorate, Iraq, Using Alos Palsar Digital Elevation Model
JO  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - The study used remote sensing and GIS techniques for defining the watershed and computing various morphometric characteristics of the Wadi Al-Naft Basins in Diyala Governorate, Iraq. The findings reveal the existence of two sub-basins, each of which was found to have four streams order. The drainage density, a measure of the stream length per unit area, was found to be 0.19 and 0.16 km/km2, respectively. They found 153 streams, categorized into different orders based on size and connectivity. First-order streams were found to be 882.71 km in length, totalling 128, while second-order streams totalling 533.12 km in length. Third-order streams numbered 4 with a total length of 199.9 km, while there were two fourth-order streams with a total length of 57 km. These results may be utilised to examine water flow patterns in the area and are crucial for understanding the hydrological features of the Wadi Al-Naft Basin. To effectively manage water resources, the research underlines the value of GIS in obtaining data on water resources, including a range of morphometric factors. A valuable tool for water resource management, the paper outlines a systematic process for identifying and characterising watersheds that may be used in a case study.

TI  - Mosaics Of Fire And Water: The Co-Emergence Of Anthropogenic Landscapes And Intensive Seed Exploitation In The Australian Arid Zone
JO  - AUSTRALIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
PY  - 2017
AB  - In arid Australia, the antiquity, role and ecological contexts of 'firestick' farming in seed-based foraging economies remain unclear. We use Landsat imagery to analyse effects of contemporary Martu hunting fires on seed-bearing grasses and forbs. Today, Martu rarely harvest wild seeds but inadvertently foster patches of grass when they burn to hunt burrowing monitor lizards. Therefore, anthropogenic seed patches need only be by-products of fires set to achieve other goals rather than the intended crop of firestick farming. Nonetheless, sustained burning over the long-term creates and maintains closely juxtaposed mosaics of seed and small game patches. We use the marginal value theorem (MVT) to model how pre-contact foragers may have used seed patches within such mosaics in response to climate change and population growth. We show that seeds would have been reliably available to foragers in anthropogenic patches whenever small game hunting returns were low and travel distances to new hunting patches long. Such circumstances probably occurred during the middle to late Holocene when population growth filled better-watered habitats of arid Australia, and climatic variability associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) reduced the number of water sources that could support foraging. Prolonged occupation around the water sources that remained triggered the emergence of fine-grained, anthropogenic fire mosaics. If so, the late Holocene proliferation of formalised seed milling equipment closely followed the emergence of firestick farming and signalled the consequent development of seed-based foraging economies, further fuelling population growth and social complexity when more mesic climatic conditions returned. Earlier milling technology during the Pleistocene and early Holocene probably accommodated seed distributions created in fire regimes other than the mosaic burning conducted by Martu today.

TI  - Soil Classification Based On Physical And Chemical Properties Using Random Forests
JO  - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Soil classification is a method of encoding the most relevant information about a given soil, namely its composition and characteristics, in a single class, to be used in areas like agriculture and forestry. In this paper, we evaluate how confidently we can predict soil classes, following the World Reference Base classification system, based on the physical and chemical characteristics of its layers. The Random Forests classifier was used with data consisting of 6 760 soil profiles composed by 19 464 horizons, collected in Mexico. Four methods of modelling the data were tested (i.e., standard depths, n first layers, thickness, and area weighted thickness). We also fine-tuned the best parameters for the classifier and for a k-NN imputation algorithm, used for addressing problems of missing data. Under-represented classes showed significantly worse results, by being repeatedly predicted as one of the majority classes. The best method to model the data was found to be the n first layers approach, with missing values being imputed with k-NN (&#x0024;&#x0024;k=1&#x0024;&#x0024; ). The results present a Kappa value from 0.36 to 0.48 and were in line with the state of the art methods, which mostly use remote sensing data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

TI  - Towards An Operational Irrigation Management System For Sweden With A Water-Food-Energy Nexus Perspective
JO  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
PY  - 2022
AB  - The 2018 drought in Sweden prompted questions about climate-adaptation and -mitigation measures - especially in the agricultural sector, which suffered the most. This study applies a water-food-energy nexus modelling framework to evaluate drought impacts on irrigation and agriculture in Sweden using 2018 and 2019 as case studies. A previous water-food-energy nexus model was updated to facilitate an investigation of the benefits of data-driven irrigation scheduling as compared to existing irrigation guidelines. Moreover, the benefits of assimilating earth observation data in the crop model have been explored. The assimilation of leaf area index data from the Copernicus Global Land Service improves the crop yield estimation as compared to default crop model parameters. The results show that the irrigation water productivities of the proposed model are measurably improved compared to conventional and static irrigation guidelines for both 2018 and 2019. This is mostly due to the advantage of the proposed model in providing evapotranspiration in cultural condition (ETc)-driven guidelines by using spatially explicit data generated by mesoscale models from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. During the drought year 2018, the developed model showed no irrigation water savings as compared to irrigation scenarios based on conventional irrigation guidelines. Nevertheless, the crop yield increase from the proposed irrigation management system varied between 10\% and 60\% as compared to conventional irrigation scenarios. During a normal year, the proposed irrigation management system leads to significant water savings as compared to conventional irrigation guidelines. The modelling results show that temperature stress during the 2018 drought also played a key role in reducing crop yields, with yield reductions of up to 30\%. From a water-food-energy nexus, this motivates the implementation of new technologies to reduce water and temperature stress to mitigate likely negative effects of climate change and extremes. By using an open-source package for Google Earth (R), a demonstrator of cost-effective visualization platform is developed for helping farmers, and water- and energy-management agencies to better understand the connections between water and energy use, and food production. This can be significant, especially during the occurrence of extreme events, but also to adapt to the negative effects on agricultural production of climate changes.

TI  - Systematic Review Of Gis And Remote Sensing Applications For Assessing The Socioeconomic Impacts Of Mining
JO  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT \& DEVELOPMENT
PY  - 2023
AB  - As the mining industry expands, a comprehensive understanding of its socioeconomic risks and benefits is urgently needed. This paper systematically reviews 71 studies (1996-2021) that utilized spatially integrated approaches to evaluate socioeconomic mining impacts. The number of studies that utilize geographic information systems and remote sensing to study mining impacts increased from 2014 onwards. A framework was used to classify the mining impacts studied in the literature and all eight framework categories - Environment, Land, People, Community, Culture, Livelihoods, Infrastructure and Housing - were captured by the literature though Culture was least studied. Coal mining, active mining phase, Landsat data and classic remote sensing algorithms were most highlighted. Future research should focus on advancing geospatial technology like artificial intelligence (AI) to better capture intangible socioeconomic impacts, under-researched minerals and long-term mine lifecycle components. Spatially referenced social data can improve stakeholder involvement and support spatially explicit planning to ensure sustainability.

TI  - Disaggregating Sdg-6 Water Stress Indicator At Different Spatial And Temporal Scales In Tunisia
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - The recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encompasses a specific goal for water (SDG-6). The target 6.4 deals with water scarcity and refers to two main indicators: water use efficiency and water stress (WS), monitored by the UN statistical services yearly at the country level. Yet, for more efficient development planning, indicators should also be provided with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This study presents a data-driven method allowing to disaggregate the WS indicator at higher spatial and temporal resolution. We applied the method for the Medjerda catchment in Tunisia, known as being severely water-stressed. We disaggregated the WS indicator from the overall catchment to the administrative regional level at yearly and monthly scales. In order to overcome poorly documented irrigation water withdrawals, two approaches were adopted: 1) we used yearly governmental data at both catchment and regions scales; 2) we replaced governmental irrigation data by remote sensing-based irrigation estimation. First Order Uncertainty Analysis (FOUA) was performed to characterize the uncertainty associated with the assessment of WS. Results reveal that the WS at the scale of the catchment increases considerably in recent years, exceeding 50\% from 2005 and surpassing the 100\% threshold in 2015 and 2016 (102\%, 108\% respectively). The two adopted approaches result in similar WS trends. However, the second approach yields higher WS values compared to the first approach (144\% versus 108\% in 2016). The monthly-disaggregated WS at catchment scale exhibits a similar increasing trend. The highest WS values are at the end of the fall and during the summer season, which is mainly due to the increasing demand for irrigation and drinking water. Siliana region is the most affected by WS, while Beja is the least affected. The FOUA shows that the integration of remote sensing-based irrigation data reduces the WS uncertainty.

JO  - Technological and Economic Development of Economy
PY  - 2007
AB  - Intelligent housing is a novelty in Lithuania yet. Such housing is not popular in our country. Specialists of automation claim that such situation occurred not only because people lack knowledge but also because the concept of intelligent housing is interpreted erroneously (most people think that remotely controlled door of garage, for instance, makes their housing intelligent). Intelligent helpers started to emerge in households only recently. Intelligent ambient assisted environment model, created by authors, helps to evaluate intelligent ambient assisted environment by social, cultural, political, legal, economical, technological and environmental factors analysis. Basing on this model also ambient assisted environment supply and demand as well as various criteria evaluation, the system able to select the best intelligent devices alternatives accordingly to each family needs was created.Through analysis of separate parts of an existing household, it is possible to distinguish intelligent devices that I study, ie intelligent lock, intelligent robot-cleaner, intelligent infant respiratory monitor, intelligent sentinel and intelligent keyboard. Users of intelligent devices are families of young people, who want to save time and who appreciate convenience and innovations. Advantages and benefits of devices used by families of young people are being analysed. In order to provide the best guarantee for rational selection of variants of intelligent devices, decisions must be based on the system of criteria which describes variants of intelligent devices, the decision support system must reflect consumer requirements to the best possible extent, and the data provided in the system must be real and updated easily. Computer and internet technologies, multi-variant evaluation methods as well as principles and requirements applicable to favourable residential environment are combined to achieve this goal.

TI  - Identifying And Mapping Individual Plants In A Highly Diverse High-Elevation Ecosystem Using Uav Imagery And Deep Learning
JO  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2020
AB  - The identification and counting of plant individuals is essential for environmental monitoring. UAV based imagery offer ultra-fine spatial resolution and flexibility in data acquisition, and so provide a great opportunity to enhance current plant and in-situ field surveying. However, accurate mapping of individual plants from UAV imagery remains challenging, given the great variation in the sizes and geometries of individual plants and in their distribution. This is true even for deep learning based semantic segmentation and classification methods. In this research, a novel Scale Sequence Residual U-Net (SS Res U-Net) deep learning method was proposed, which integrates a set of Residual U-Nets with a sequence of input scales that can be derived automatically. The SS Res U-Net classifies individual plants by continuously increasing the patch scale, with features learned at small scales passing gradually to larger scales, thus, achieving multi-scale information fusion while retaining fine spatial details of interest. The SS Res U-Net was tested to identify and map frailejones (all plant species of the subtribe Espeletiinae), the dominant plants in one of the world's most biodiverse high-elevation ecosystems (i.e. the paramos) from UAV imagery. Results demonstrate that the SS Res U-Net has the ability to self-adapt to variation in objects, and consistently achieved the highest classification accuracy (91.67\% on average) compared with four state-of-the-art benchmark approaches. In addition, SS Res U-Net produced the best performances in terms of both robustness to training sample size reduction and computational efficiency compared with the benchmarks. Thus, SS Res U-Net shows great promise for solving remotely sensed semantic segmentation and classification tasks, and more general machine intelligence. The prospective implementation of this method to identify and map frailejones in the paramos will benefit immensely the monitoring of their populations for conservation assessments and management, among many other applications.

TI  - Aerosol Analysis Of China’s Fenwei Plain From 2012 To 2020 Based On Omi Satellite Data
JO  - Atmosphere
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Fenwei Plain plays an essential role for China’s three-year action plan to protect the air environment. At present, the high-value area and maximum value of atmospheric aerosol have been effectively controlled, but the governance situation is not stable. Therefore, based on the daily ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) data retrieved by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from 2012 to 2020, combined with precipitation and temperature and air pressure and lifting index data, this paper analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and some influencing factors of UVAI in the Fenwei Plain. The results show that the overall trend of the annual average UVAI value of the Fenwei Plain in 9 years showed two “peaks” in 2013 and 2018, respectively. The high UVAI values are mainly concentrated in the southwest and central areas of the Fenwei Plain. In the study area, UVAI was highest in winter, followed by autumn and spring, and lowest in summer. There were significant negative correlations between precipitation and UVAI and between temperature and UVAI. There were significant positive correlations between air pressure and UVAI and between lifting index and UVAI. According to the backward trajectory clustering results, during the autumn and winter seasons in this area, due to the sand and dust brought by the northwest and the input of aerosols in the coal-producing area and coal-fired heating area, the UVAI value of this time period is higher. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Monitoring Vegetation Change And Dynamics On U.s. Army Training Lands Using Satellite Image Time Series Analysis
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2015
AB  - Given the significant land holdings of the U.S. Department of Defense, and the importance of those lands to support a variety of inherently damaging activities, application of sound natural resource conservation principles and proactive monitoring practices are necessary to manage military training lands in a sustainable manner. This study explores a method for, and the utility of, analyzing vegetation condition and trends as sustainability indicators for use by military commanders and land managers, at both the national and local levels, in identifying when and where vegetation-related environmental impacts might exist. The BFAST time series decomposition method was applied to a ten-year MODIS NDVI time series dataset for the Fort Riley military installation and Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in northeastern Kansas. Imagery selected for time-series analysis were 16-day MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1 Collection 5) composites capable of characterizing vegetation change induced by human activities and climate variability. Three indicators related to gradual interannual or abrupt intraannual vegetation change for each pixel were calculated from the trend component resulting from the BFAST decomposition. Assessment of gradual interannual NDVI trends showed the majority of Fort Riley experienced browning between 2001 and 2010. This result is supported by validation using high spatial resolution imagery. The observed versus expected frequency of linear trends detected at Fort Riley and KPBS were significantly different and suggest a causal link between military training activities and/or land management practices. While both sites were similar with regards to overall disturbance frequency and the relative spatial extents of monotonic or interrupted trends, vegetation trajectories after disturbance were significantly different. This suggests that the type and magnitude of disturbances characteristic of each location result in distinct post-disturbance vegetation responses. Using a remotely-sensed vegetation index time series with BFAST and the indicators outlined here provides a consistent and relatively rapid assessment of military training lands with applicability outside of grassland biomes. Characterizing overall trends and disturbance responses of vegetation can promote sustainable use of military lands and assist land managers in targeting specific areas for various rehabilitation activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An Omni-Directional Assessment Of Theos Operational Projects
JO  - 31st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing 2010, ACRS 2010
PY  - 2010
AB  - Thailand's activities and interest on space and space-related technologies have been increasing rapidly over the past decades. This has led to the birth of THEOS, the very first remote sensing satellite of Thailand. THEOS products assist in the development of natural resources, environmental monitoring and many others remote sensing applications. The main objective is to provide earth observation based total solution, which is applicable not only for Thailand but also for other countries. Two years of operation after its launch in 2008, GISTDA is moving forward to maximize the utilization of resources available. GISTDA aims to extend the services already available by adding further functionality such as ortho-rectification, mosaic and elevation editing to fulfill the needs of cartography applications. This has created value added service such as the use of THEOS' image data for the Rice Pricing Guarantee, one recent project in which THEOS' images has contributed greatly. THEOS products and services have also assisted Thai's Government in Agricultural Assessment and Management. In this age of high-speed information, it is obvious that web-based applications are essential. Ongoing projects aims to make all THEOS' imagery available online whereby users may browse conveniently through the online catalog, initiate and complete the process of images ordering. This can be achieved through the THEOS' online services, which will add ease of use to end-users and image distributors. In addition to existing domestic channels of distribution, GISTDA is on its way to enter the worldwide market. With the ortho-products soon to be available, GISTDA aims to be one of the key providers in the Satellite Imagery industry. This is further enhanced by the establishment of two additional Image Ground Stations for THEOS outside Thailand and the contract with polar station for additional satellite commanding. Furthermore, all three GISTDA's offices will soon be connected to the UniNet, a Government portal cum gateway that provides hi-speed information network linked to universities, institutes, and campuses with more than 200 sites across Thailand as well as overseas countries. Consequently, linking GISTDA to Thailand's educational network and the international research network, which will allow students and researchers from all over the world to be able to access to GISTDA's database and resources. Uninet will also provide a high-speed communication channel for GISTDA, which enhance the competency of the service to the greater level.

TI  - Toward A More Socially Equitable Stormwater Management Fee: The Case Of Corpus Christi In Texas, Usa
JO  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - This study evaluates a popular approach to assessing stormwater utility fees in the context of social equity. Analyses are based on comparing single-family land parcels in different neighborhoods of Corpus Christi, a U.S. city in the state of Texas that recently introduced a stormwater fee program. The stormwater fees are based on the same stormwater runoff factor for all single-family residential land parcels. We instead derive stormwater runoff estimates from parcel-scale impervious area measurements through the application of a machine-learning model to high-resolution remote sensing data. The difference between the official runoff factor and our estimate tends to be larger among land parcels in census tracts with proportionally more low-income and Hispanic households. This finding at odds with the ability-to-pay principle is attributable to the association of different neighborhoods' sociodemographic compositions with their housing development patterns. Our work not only contributes to the design of a stormwater fee program that better characterizes the generation of stormwater runoff but it also helps city officials alleviate social inequity for homeowners in economically disadvantaged communities.

TI  - Data Governance And Sovereignty In Urban Data Spaces Based On Standardized Ict Reference Architectures
JO  - Data
PY  - 2019
AB  - European cities and communities (and beyond) require a structured overview and a set of tools as to achieve a sustainable transformation towards smarter cities/municipalities, thereby leveraging on the enormous potential of the emerging data driven economy. This paper presents the results of a recent study that was conducted with a number of German municipalities/cities. Based on the obtained and briefly presented recommendations emerging from the study, the authors propose the concept of an Urban Data Space (UDS), which facilitates an eco-system for data exchange and added value creation thereby utilizing the various types of data within a smart city/municipality. Looking at an Urban Data Space from within a German context and considering the current situation and developments in German municipalities, this paper proposes a reasonable classification of urban data that allows the relation of various data types to legal aspects, and to conduct solid considerations regarding technical implementation designs and decisions. Furthermore, the Urban Data Space is described/analyzed in detail, and relevant stakeholders are identified, as well as corresponding technical artifacts are introduced. The authors propose to setup Urban Data Spaces based on emerging standards from the area of ICT reference architectures for Smart Cities, such as DIN SPEC 91357 “Open Urban Platform” and EIP SCC. In the course of this, the paper walks the reader through the construction of a UDS based on the above-mentioned architectures and outlines all the goals, recommendations and potentials, which an Urban Data Space can reveal to a municipality/city. Finally, we aim at deriving the proposed concepts in a way that they have the potential to be part of the required set of tools towards the sustainable transformation of German and European cities in the direction of smarter urban environments, based on utilizing the hidden potential of digitalization and efficient interoperable data exchange. © 2019 by the authors.

A number of erroneous elements have been identified in this report leading to the conclusion in this paper that the spectrum requirements for IMT are greatly overestimated. The mobile industry, supported by some national administrations, has formally proposed the estimated amount of spectrum in the Report ITU-R M.2290 to be allocated to mobile services at the WRC-15. No cost/benefit analysis and no impact assessment on the existing spectrum users have been provided to support this proposal. If the WRC-15 decides to satisfy these requirements, the incumbent users of the affected frequency bands will have to be displaced. This would most certainly have an adverse impact on terrestrial broadcasting, satellite services, the cultural and content industries, and society in general.

TI  - Maritime Trials In Europe And Africa Using Gnss-Based Enhanced Systems
JO  - 29th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS 2016
PY  - 2016
AB  - The increasing global maritime traffic requires innovative solutions to optimize routes and resources to provide an efficient and safe navigation and minimize the impact of maritime traffic on the environment. Not only GNSS systems like GPS or the future Galileo can enhance maritime navigation either in open sea, inland waterways and harbour entrances and approaches; but positioning based on GNSS technology can be used for a wide range of maritime applications. These include, but are not limited to: traffic management, traffic surveillance, search and rescue, fishing, marine engineering, oceanography, port operations, and oil and gas exploitation. Some GNSS-based technologies are being promoted at international level such as the e-Navigation initiative from the International Maritime Organization (IMO), as well as the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) used by fishing authorities, or the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as EGNOS in Europe, WAAS in North America, MSAS in Japan and GAGAN in India can enhance core GNSS constellation's performances, with special focus on accuracy, availability, continuity and integrity. In particular, the integrity feature has been traditionally associated to Safety-of-Life applications, mainly for aviation. However, in the recent years integrity has also been identified as an added value for many other GNSS application fields given that it increases safety and can be used for certified services. On the other hand, not only many GNSS devices installed on leisure vessels already integrate SBAS corrections but also SBAS information can be integrated in already existing maritime systems and AIDS to navigation infrastructure such as in AIS and DGNSS, therefore, making the maritime sector one of the relevant fields for the SBAS adoption. In this context, GMV has developed magicVRS as an example of how GNSS technology can enhance maritime navigation. This tool takes as input SBAS corrections which are translated into differential corrections that will be redirected to an AIS base station and then broadcast to a GNSS device on-board. These SBAS corrections can be received either from the internet using ESA's SISNeT protocol or from a devoted receiver connected to magicVRS. To demonstrate the performance benefits derived from this tool, a series of maritime trials have been launched in the Guadalquivir River (Spain) and in Cape Town (South Africa) using two types of SBAS data: • nominal SBAS messages were obtained in Spain from EGNOS through ED AS service (Spain). • the SBAS messages were coming from the SBAS testbed deployed in South Africa within the SBAS Africa project led by AVANTI. Both trials took advantage of the large GMV experience in developing SBAS algorithms through magicSBAS tool so magicVRS was fed with SBAS messages produced by magicSBAS in real-time, broadcasting optimized information for being applied to maritime applications. magicSBAS is an SBAS demonstrator that collects multi-constellation GNSS data (measurements and ephemeris) from a regional network of reference stations, computes satellite orbits and clocks corrections and ionospheric and integrity information in accordance with ICAO SARPS standards. In previous papers presented at ION-GNSS it has been demonstrated how GMV's low latitude ionospheric algorithms can enhance SBAS performance on Equatorial regions [1]. During the last year, internal research has been performed at GMV to provide improved accuracy and integrity performances for maritime applications, and these improved algorithms were used in the maritime trials in Europe and Africa, whose results are summarized in this paper. magicSBAS can also be complemented with magicGNSS suite, in particular to magicODTS to provide precise orbit determination and time synchronization of GNSS satellites that enhances even more the SBAS corrections assessment. The SBAS-Africa project, led by AVANTI, in partnership with GMV, NSL, Pildo Labs, TAS UK, the South African National Space Agency (SANSA), Ghana Council for Scie tific and Industrial Research and the Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA), delivered a live SBAS signal in space serving the southern part of the African continent. The system generates SBAS messages using GMV's magicSBAS tool suite with input data from a network of GPS ground monitoring stations developed by NSL which are deployed across South Africa and neighbouring countries. The messages are broadcast via the ARTEMIS GEO satellite originally an ESA EGNOS satellite now owned by Avanti. The system provides an immediate improvement of GPS accuracy having far-reaching benefits across a range of user communities and applications, such as precision agriculture or general aviation. The paper will analyse the combined use of magicSBAS improved algorithms for maritime applications and magicODTS to determine the accuracy and integrity improvement derived from the use of these algorithms, and how this improvement could positively impact achieved performance in maritime applications. The results of these maritime trials in Europe and Africa and the comparison of the different technologies will also be provided in this paper as well as a presentation of the benefits of using enhanced GNSS systems for maritime navigation.

TI  - Lake Nasser Evaporation Reduction Study
JO  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH
PY  - 2010
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the reduction of evaporation of Lake Nasser's water caused by disconnecting (fully or partially) some of its secondary channels (khors). This evaluation integrates remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, aerodynamic principles, and Landsat7 ETM+ images. Three main procedures were carried out in this study; the first derived the surface temperature from Landsat thermal band; the second derived evaporation depth and approximate evaporation volume for the entire lake, and quantified evaporation loss to the secondary channels' level over one month (March) by applied aerodynamic principles on surface temperature of the raster data; the third procedure applied GIS suitability analysis to determine which of these secondary channels (khors) should be disconnected. The results showed evaporation depth ranging from 2.73 mm/day at the middle of the lake to 9.58 mm/day at the edge. The evaporated water-loss value throughout the entire lake was about 0.86 billion m(3) /month (March). The analysis suggests that it is possible to save an approximate total evaporation volume loss of 19.7 million m(3) / month (March), and thus 2.4 billion m(3) /year, by disconnecting two khors with approximate construction heights of 8 m and 15 m. In conclusion, remote sensing and GIS are useful for applications in remote locations where field-based information is not readily available and thus recommended for decision makers remotely planning in water conservation and management.

TI  - Multi-Point Hybrid Model Based On Pso-Svm For Concrete Arch Dam Deformation Monitoring
JO  - Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Xinxi Kexue Ban)/Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University
PY  - 2023
AB  - Objectives: It is difficult for the single-point deformation monitoring model for concrete arch dam to reasonably characterize the cooperative response characteristics of the arch dam spatial deformation field, and the traditional regression method has obvious limitations to interpret the complex function relationship between environmental quantity and dam deformation. Methods: On the basis of the analysis of traditional single-point deformation monitoring model construction method,a multi-point hybrid model based on support vector machine-particle swarm optimization(PSO-SVM) for concrete arch dam deformation monitoring is proposed by introducing spatial coordinates, and using the finite element method to calculate the water pressure component. SVM optimized by PSO is used for analysis and prediction of dam deformation sequence with the aid of PSO-SVM’s good nonlinear processing capabilities. Thus, a multi-point hybrid model based on PSO-SVM for concrete arch dam deformation monitoring is established. Results: To verify the effectiveness of the proposed PSO-SVM-based multi-point hybrid model, a single-point statistical model, and an SVM-based multi-point hybrid model are established at the same time. The mean absolute error and root mean square error values of the established model are lower than those of other models, and the determination coefficient R2 is closer to 1. Conclusions: The engineering example analysis shows that the proposed model has better ability to analyze the deformation performance of multi-point, and has better fitting and prediction accuracy than the statistical model of single-point, and can effectively reflect the overall behavior of the dam. The proposed theory and method can be generalized and applied to other dam behavior safety monitoring models. © 2023 Wuhan University. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating Vegetation Biomass And Cover Across Large Plots In Shrub And Grass Dominated Drylands Using Terrestrial Lidar And Machine Learning
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2018
AB  - Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has been shown to enable an efficient, precise, and non-destructive inventory of vegetation structure at ranges up to hundreds of meters. We developed a method that leverages TLS collections with machine learning techniques to model and map canopy cover and biomass of several classes of short-stature vegetation across large plots. We collected high-definition TLS scans of 26 1-ha plots in desert grasslands and big sagebrush shrublands in southwest Idaho, USA. We used the Random Forests machine learning algorithm to develop decision tree models predicting the biomass and canopy cover of several vegetation classes from statistical descriptors of the aboveground heights of TLS points. Manual measurements of vegetation characteristics collected within each plot served as training and validation data. Models based on five or fewer TLS descriptors of vegetation heights were developed to predict the canopy cover fraction of shrubs (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7\%), annual grasses (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 21\%), perennial grasses (R-2 = 0.36, RMSE = 12\%), forbs (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 6\%), bare earth or litter (R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 19\%), and the biomass of shrubs (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 175 g) and herbaceous vegetation (R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 99 g) (all values reported are out-of-bag). Our models explained much of the variability between predictions and manual measurements, and yet we expect that future applications could produce even better results by reducing some of the methodological sources of error that we encountered. Our work demonstrates how TLS can be used efficiently to extend manual measurement of vegetation characteristics from small to large plots in grasslands and shrublands, with potential application to other similarly structured ecosystems. Our method shows that vegetation structural characteristics can be modeled without classifying and delineating individual plants, a challenging and time-consuming step common in previous methods applying TLS to vegetation inventory. Improving application of TLS to studies of shrub steppe ecosystems will serve immediate management needs by enhancing vegetation inventories, environmental modeling studies, and the ability to train broader datasets collected from air and space.

TI  - Predicting Gully Rejuvenation After Wildfire Using Remotely Sensed Burn Severity Data
JO  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
PY  - 2007
AB  - The loss of surface vegetation and reduced infiltration caused by wildfires can trigger gully rejuvenation, resulting in damage to downstream aquatic resources and risk to human life and property. We developed a spatially explicit metric of burn severity - the Burn Severity Distribution Index (BSDI) - and tested its ability to predict post-fire gully rejuvenation in 1st and 2nd order basins burned in the 2000 Valley Complex fires in the Sapphire Mountains of western Montana. The BSDI was derived from burn severity data interpreted from Landsat 7 satellite imagery using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) method, and ranged from 0.0 for completely unburned basins to 4.0 for basins burned entirely at high severity. In July 2001 rainstorms with peak. 30-minute intensities of up to 17 turn h(-1) triggered gully rejuvenation in 66 of the 171 basins examined. The frequency of gully rejuvenation was higher in basins with higher BSDI values, increasing from zero for basins with a BSDI less than 1.3 to 67\% for basins with a BSDI greater than 3.0. Binary logistic regression indicated that BSDI was a more significant predictor of gully rejuvenation than basin morphometric variables. The absence of gully rejuvenation in several basins with a high BSDI was attributed to low gradient, dense riparian vegetation, or concentration of high burn severity at lower elevations in the basin. The presence of gully rejuvenation in several basins with a low BSDI was associated with false negative NBR classification errors in northwest aspects, and concentration of severe burn impacts in the drainage headslopes. BSDI is a useful metric for predicting gully rejuvenation after wildfire. The use of the BSDI in Burned Area Emergency Response team assessments could improve the planning, implementation, and monitoring of burned area recovery treatments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Preparing Turbidity And Aquatic Vegetation Inventory For Waterlogged Wetlands In Lower Barpani Sub-Watersheds (Assam), India Using Geospatial Technology
JO  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
PY  - 2017
AB  - Wetlands play a significant role in maintaining environmental stability. These have a complex of values like food storage, water quality maintenance, livelihood and support species diversity, etc. Wetlands inventory is the pre-requisite process for conservation and management practices. The study makes an attempt to delineate wetlands and prepare inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation in Lower Barpani sub-watersheds (Assam), India. The study utilized Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data during pre-and post-monsoon seasons, 2014. Wetlands during pre-and post-monsoon were delineated using supervised classification and threshold method. Wetland inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation was prepared during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. Single-band turbidity retrieval algorithm and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to assess the level of turbidity and aquatic vegetation in GIS environment. The study revealed that the variation in the extent of water logged wetlands in sub-watersheds was due to water spread variation during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. All the sub-watersheds were characterized by medium turbidity which was attributed to sediments and silts brought with runoff in wetlands. Aquatic vegetation showed variation in its distribution across subwatersheds. High vegetation indicated high turbidity and presence of nutrients. The study shows usefulness of remote sensing data in mapping and characterization of wetlands for preparing inventory and monitoring seasonal variation.

PY  - 2021
AB  - Precision agriculture allows to gain efficiency, sustainability and profitability, since it provides great benefits in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture, economic risks and at the same time contributes to controlling the vigor of crops and improving the quality of their yield. The objective of this research is to discriminate weeds within the corn crop, based on their spectral response. For this, the advanced EBEE SQ agricultural drone was used, with which multispectral images were captured through its Parrot Sequoia camera. The images were processed with software in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). With the multispectral bands, different vegetation indices were calculated such as NDVI, NDVIAS, NGRDI, NDRE, GNDVI, using map algebra tools in specialized programs. A supervised classification was applied to the different indices to discriminate the different land covers, which obtained a precision of 93% and a Kappa index of 0.93. The results allowed to clearly differentiate the coverage of crops, weeds and bare soil. The data showed that both early-growing and developed weeds occupy 38% of the crop area. With this information, it is possible to improve the planning of agronomic practices, adding the herbicide at the specific site of the weeds. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation Method Of Ecological Water Demand Threshold Of Natural Vegetation In Arid-Region Inland River Basin Based On Satellite Data
JO  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
PY  - 2023
AB  - The ecological water demand (EWD) of natural vegetation is a key issue in regional water resource allocation and ecosystem management. Although the evaluation of the EWD of vegetation has been emphasized in numerous studies, research on the threshold EWD of vegetation, including the minimum and optimum EWD, as well as an effective quantitative analysis framework, are still lacking. Therefore, in this study, the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation in the plain area of the Tarim River Basin over the last22 years was estimated based on remote sensing image data. Additionally, the multi-year dynamics of the EWD of natural vegetation were analyzed. In this study, the concept of "latitude" was adopted from studies of ecosystem resilience, to propose a novel analytical framework to measure the minimum and optimal EWD of natural vegetation in inland arid areas. The results show that the average minimum and optimum EWD of natural vegetation is105.45 and 135.53 mm, respectively. The average minimum EWD of woodland and high-and low-coverage grassland is 129.13, 284.38, and 111.40 mm, respectively, and the mean value of the optimum EWD is 152.96, 382.05, and 141.16 mm, respectively. The novel approach of this study is simple and easy to use, and provides an effective method for quantitative evaluation of the EWD threshold of natural vegetation.

TI  - Enhancing Catch-And-Release Science With Biotelemetry
JO  - FISH AND FISHERIES
PY  - 2008
AB  - Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is widely practised by anglers and is a common fisheries management strategy or is a by-product of harvest regulations. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research that examines not only the mortality associated with C\&R, but also the sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences. Biotelemetry offers a powerful means of remotely monitoring the behaviour, physiology and mortality of fish caught and released in their natural environment, but we contend that its usefulness is still underappreciated by scholars and managers. In this study, we review the applications of biotelemetry in C\&R science, identify novel research directions, opportunities and challenges. There are now about 250 C\&R studies but only one quarter of these utilize biotelemetry. In fact, almost all of the C\&R studies that have used biotelemetry have been conducted within the last decade. We found that the majority of C\&R telemetry studies used either radio or acoustic telemetry, while comparatively few studies have used satellite technologies. Most C\&R biotelemetry studies have been used to assess mortality rates, behavioural impairments or to evaluate the effects of displacement on fish. A small fraction of studies (< 8\%) have used physiological sensors despite the fact that these tools are highly applicable to understanding the multiple sublethal consequences of C\&R and are useful for providing mechanistic insights into endpoints such as death. We conclude that C\&R science has the potential to benefit greatly from biotelemetry technology, particularly with respect to providing more robust short-term and delayed mortality estimates and adopting a more integrative and comparative approach to understanding the lethal and sublethal impacts of C\&R. However, there are still a number of challenges including (i) the need for appropriate controls and methodological approaches, (ii) the need for accounting for tagging and handling stress and mortality, and (iii) the need for certainty in assessing mortality. However, the benefits associated with C\&R biotelemetry outweigh its disadvantages and limitations and thereby offer C\&R researchers a suite of new tools to enhance fisheries management and conservation.

TI  - Multi-Stage Sampling For Large Scale Natural Resources Surveys: A Case Study Of Rice And Waterfowl
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2006
AB  - Large-scale sample surveys to estimate abundance and distribution of organisms and their habitats are increasingly important in ecological studies. Multi-stage sampling (MSS) is especially suited to large-scale surveys because of the natural clustering of resources. To illustrate an application, we: (1) designed a stratified MSS to estimate late autumn abundance (kg/ha) of rice seeds in harvested fields as food for waterfowl wintering in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV); (2) investigated options for improving the MSS design; and (3) compared statistical and cost efficiency of MSS to simulated simple random sampling (SRS). During 2000-2002, we sampled 25-35 landowners per year, 1 or 2 fields per landowner per year, and measured seed mass in 10 soil cores collected within each field. Analysis of variance components and costs for each stage of the survey design indicated that collecting 10 soil cores per field was near the optimum of 11-15, whereas sampling > 1 field per landowner provided few benefits because data from fields within landowners were highly correlated. Coefficients of variation (CV) of annual estimates of rice abundance ranged from 0.23 to 0.31 and were limited by variation among landowners and the number of landowners sampled. Design effects representing the statistical efficiency of MSS relative to SRS ranged from 3.2 to 9.0, and simulations indicated SRS would cost, on average, 1.4 times more than MSS because clustering of sample units in MSS decreased travel costs. We recommend MSS as a potential sampling strategy for large-scale natural resource surveys and specifically for future surveys of the availability of rice as food for waterfowl in the MAV and similar areas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Digital Therapeutics: Emerging New Therapy For Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
JO  - Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology
PY  - 2023
AB  - The increased prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) worldwide is particularly worrisome, as no medication has been approved to treat the disease. Lifestyle modifications aimed at promoting weight loss and weight maintenance remain the current first-line treatment for NAFLD. However, due to the lack of standard and scientific guidance and out-of-hospital supervision, long-term outcomes of lifestyle interventions for patients with NAFLD are often unsatisfactory. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated this dilemma. At the same time, digital therapeutics (DTx) are expected to be a new method for the convenient management and treatment of patients with NAFLD and are attracting a great deal of attention. DTx, which provide evidence-based medicine through software programs for remote intervention in preventing, treating, or managing diseases, overcome the drawbacks of traditional treatment. The efficacy of the approach has already been demonstrated for some chronic diseases, but DTx have not been fully developed for NAFLD. This study reviews the concepts, clinical value, and practical applications related to DTx, with an emphasis on recommendations based on unmet needs for NAFLD. A better understanding of the current state will help clinicians and researchers develop high-quality, standardized, and efficient DTx products, with the aim of optimizing the prognosis of patients with NAFLD. © 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Beyond The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi): Developing A Natural Space Index For Population-Level Health Research
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
PY  - 2017
AB  - Background: Natural spaces can provide psychological benefits to individuals, but population-level epidemiologic studies have produced conflicting results. Refining current exposure-assessment methods is necessary to advance our understanding of population health and to guide the design of health-promoting urban forms. Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive Natural Space Index that robustly models potential exposure based on the presence, form, accessibility, and quality of multiple forms of greenspace (e.g., parks and street trees) and bluespace (e.g., oceans and lakes). Material and methods: The index was developed for greater Vancouver, Canada. Greenness presence was derived from remote sensing (NDVI/EVI); forms were extracted from municipal and private databases; and accessibility was based on restrictions such as private ownership. Quality appraisals were conducted for 200 randomly sampled parks using the Public Open Space Desktop Appraisal Tool (POSDAT). Integrating these measures in GIS, exposure was assessed for 60,242 postal codes using 100- to 1,600-m buffers based on hypothesized pathways to mental health. A single index was then derived using principal component analysis (PCA). Results: Comparing NDVI with alternate approaches for assessing natural space resulted in widely divergent results, with quintile rankings shifting for 22-88\% of postal codes, depending on the measure. Overall park quality was fairly low (mean of 15 on a scale of 0-45), with no significant difference seen by neighborhood-level household income. The final PCA identified three main sets of variables, with the first two components explaining 68\% of the total variance. The first component was dominated by the percentages of public and private greenspace and bluespace and public greenspace within 250 m, while the second component was driven by lack of access to bluespace within 1 km. Conclusions: Many current approaches to modeling natural space may misclassify exposures and have limited specificity. The Natural Space Index represents a novel approach at a regional scale with application to urban planning and policy-making.

TI  - Large-Area Mapping Of Canadian Boreal Forest Cover, Height, Biomass And Other Structural Attributes Using Landsat Composites And Lidar Plots
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the ~ 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a > 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on > 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs. © 2017

TI  - What Is The Threshold Elevation At Which Climatic Factors Determine Snow Cover Variability? A Case Study Of The Keriya River Basin
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climate and topography are pivotal factors influencing snow cover variation, highlighting the significance of investigating the altitudinal response of snow cover to climate change. This study adopted a new MODIS snow cover extent product over China, reanalysis climate data, and digital elevation model (DEM) data to analyze the variation characteristics of snow cover frequency (SCF) and climatic factors with elevation in the Keriya River Basin (KRB) during the hydrological years from 2000 to 2020. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method was utilized to explore the elevation-based relationships between SCF and climatic factors. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) The SCF exhibited an "increasing-decreasing-increasing-decreasing" pattern intra-annually, with insignificant monthly inter-annual variations. Only November, January, April, and May demonstrated upward trends, whereas October and December remained relatively stable, and other months exhibited declines. (2) Vertical variations in SCF and climatic factors revealed fluctuating upward trends in SCF and wind speed. On the other hand, the air temperature consistently decreased at a lapse rate ranging from 0.60 to 0.85 degrees C/100 m. Precipitation demonstrated "rising-falling" or "rapidly rising-slowly rising" patterns, bounded by 3821 m (range 3474-4576 m). (3) A new decision scheme, which took into account the alteration of the primary SCF controlling factors and shifts between positive and negative impacts caused by these factors, was used to determine five threshold elevation zones: 2585 m (range 2426-2723 m), 3447 m (range 3125-3774 m), 4251 m (range 4126-4375 m), 5256 m (range 4975-5524 m), and 5992 m (range 5874-6425 m). These threshold elevation zones were evident in spring, with four of these appearing in autumn (excluding 4251 m) and summer (excluding 2585 m). Only two threshold elevation zones were observed in winter with elevation values of 3447 m and 5992 m, respectively. Our findings are crucial for a deeper understanding of snow cover variation patterns at different elevations and offer essential insights for the responsible management of regional water resources.

TI  - Model For Estimation Of Total Nitrogen Content In Sandalwood Leaves Based On Nonlinear Mixed Effects And Dummy Variables Using Multispectral Images
JO  - CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS
PY  - 2019
AB  - Fertilizer overuse is a common phenomenon in global agroforestry production, and this overuse causes ecological destruction. The ability to accurately estimate the nutrient content of plant leaves in real-time would be a wonderful solution to reduce the degree of environmental damage. in recent years, remote sensing technology has been widely used in the diagnosis of crop nutrition in many countries. Most studies focus on optimal band selection or create new vegetation indices, but these studies have ignored the random impact of natural environmental factors on the estimated results. This paper proposed an estimation model of total nitrogen content (TNC) in sandalwood leaves that takes sampling season and site conditions as the dummy variable and random effect, respectively. Three forestry farms with different locations and site conditions were selected as study areas to enhance the universality of this model. Multispectral images of leaves were obtained using a low-cost five-band camera (RedEdge3, MicaSense, USA), and the experimental results indicate the following: (1) the growth of the tree height, crown width and stem effectively increased under the medium gradient level (N2), whereas a high gradient level (N3) significantly promoted all aspects except tree height; (2) the mean and variance of some image texture features of the G, RE and NIR band were significantly correlated with TNC at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, and the texture mean value index (TMVI) proposed in this paper can improve the correlation with TNC; and (3) the results obtained using the nonlinear mixed-effects model with dummy variables improved the fitting degree and estimation accuracy compared with results of SVR and BPNN. This study demonstrates the advantages of using the nonlinear mixed-effects model with dummy variables to obtain a more reliable estimation model for the nutritional diagnosis of rare tree species.

JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2020
AB  - International Space University (ISU) is a world-leading non-for-profit education institution. Supported by the space sector's foremost experts and organisations, ISU runs several interdisciplinary programs annually around the world to foster the field of space exploration and support the development of humanity using space knowledge and space activities. In 2020, ISU supported a small group of alumni to administer a first of its kind professional and community-centred event in Adelaide, Australia. The ISU Adelaide Conference was established to discuss and communicate the benefits which space activities provide to society, and to do so through building connections between the diverse international community of ISU and the strong capabilities of Australia's space sector. The central theme of the inaugural session in 2020 explored solutions for environmental monitoring and disaster management, with a particular focus on wildfires. The event received great interest and important participation from Australian and international leaders in remote sensing and emergency services. Activities in the conference programme included industry tours and briefings from Australia's leading industry, government and research organisations. The weekend registration was open to ISU alumni, professionals and enthusiasts from the wider space industry. To meet the conference outreach goals, the programme encouraged the public and community stakeholders to attend the conference's Gala Dinner and the distinguished speaker event. This unique mix of the ISU environment, established space players, emerging space organisations and the stakeholders benefited by space solutions created the integral dynamic for this non-traditional event. The ISU Adelaide Conference was considered a success insofar as the post-event support from attendees, sponsors and collaborators encouraging future sessions take place. This success was achieved not least due to the strong sponsorship, collaborative efforts and in-kind support received from government, research, industry and space community organisations. This paper will provide an overview of the conference objectives, the programme and the outcomes to demonstrate how this new ISU forum contributes to space education and outreach. © 2020 by DLR-SART.

TI  - Methods For Estimating The Amount Of Vernal Pool Habitat In The Northeastern United States
JO  - WETLANDS
PY  - 2008
AB  - The loss of small, seasonal wetlands is a major concern for a variety of state, local, and federal organizations in the northeastern U.S. Identifying and estimating the number of vernal pools within a given region is critical to developing long-term conservation and management strategies for these unique habitats and their faunal communities. We use three probabilistic sampling methods (simple random sampling, adaptive cluster sampling, and the dual frame method) to estimate the number of vernal pools on protected, forested lands. Overall, these methods yielded similar values of vernal pool abundance for each study area, and suggest that photographic interpretation alone may grossly underestimate the number of vernal pools in forested habitats. We compare the relative efficiency of each method and discuss ways of improving precision. Acknowledging that the objectives of a study or monitoring program ultimately determine which sampling designs are most appropriate, we recommend that some type of probabilistic sampling method be applied. We view the dual-frame method as an especially useful way of combining incomplete remote sensing methods, such as aerial photograph interpretation, with a probabilistic sample of the entire area of interest to provide more robust estimates of the number of vernal pools and a more representative sample of existing vernal pool habitats.

JO  - The Future of National Infrastructure: A System-of-Systems Approach
PY  - 2016
AB  - Introduction: Digital communications and information systems infrastructure is comprised of a variety of communication and computation systems which provide the transmission, processing and storage of digital information. This includes: (i) legacy and fibre-optic cable networks; (ii) mobile, satellite and wireless networks; and (iii) data storage and processing centres. The acronym ICT is often used to describe these systems, though in other contexts ICT can refer to a much broader class of information and communications technologies. Here we use the shorthand ICT to refer to digital communications and information infrastructure systems. In comparison to other physical infrastructure sectors, ICT is relatively new and very rapidly evolving, so is less completely understood from a system-of-systems perspective. ICT infrastructure has become increasingly embedded in nearly all economic and social activities, including for operation of other infrastructure networks. Because of the complexity and rapid innovation in ICT systems, their future is highly uncertain and analysing the systems’ prospective direction is challenging. Yet, issues surrounding digital connectivity are high on the global policy agenda. In many advanced economies in Europe, North America and beyond, significant increases in ICT capacity have been delivered by inducing competition within industry combined with a light-touch, market-led regulatory approach. Innovation has provided new technologies and has helped serve growing consumer demand, which is itself largely driven by innovations in consumer technologies and business practices. Globally, the telecommunications sector has increased dramatically over the past decade to serve almost three billion Internet users, amounting to over 40% of the world's population (ITU, 2014a). Investment in competitive markets by network operators is underpinned by analysis comparing prospective revenues with investment costs (Tselekounis and Varoutas, 2013) so is determined by population density, topology and the capital cost of new technologies (Gotz, 2013). Population density is an important factor in serving local telecommunication markets because, like other infrastructure systems, large fixed-capital investments need to be spread over many consumers with the purchasing power to acquire service subscriptions. However, if left to its own devices the market would likely be considered to be socially unjust and not provide all the potential welfare benefits, as the majority of investment would likely flow into pockets of dense, wealthy and well-educated urban areas. This would particularly leave remote rural or other uneconomically viable locations at a severe disadvantage. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

TI  - Mission Control System For Earth Observation Missions Based On Scos-2000
PY  - 2005
AB  - As part of the CryoSat and GOCE Mission Control Systems (MCS), GMV S.A. is currently developing the MCS kernel for the European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Observation missions. The first intention is to customize the ESA's SCOS-2000 system {[}1] for the support of the missions belonging to the ESA Earth Explorer programme, although the idea can be extended to a wider scope. This kernel is a step forward in developing cost effective mission control systems. It provides generic support for the most of the common requirements in earth observation missions, such as pass-based operations, control of the on board execution of command timelines, on board software management for platform and payload, interface with the ground segment systems, and near-real time distribution of data to external entities. The system also provides an extensive support of the most common ESA Packet Utilization Standard (PUS) services {[}2]. This generic support can be applied to many other missions that share the same concept of operations, even outside the earth observation context. Some of the features will be repatriated into SCOS-2000, and the core has already been extensively reused in other missions, such as the Galileo GSTB-V2. One of the main issues solved has been how a single mission control system software can be applied to several missions in a efficient way, handling mission specific features and configuration, but without compromising the safety of each particular mission. The result of the project will provide the following benefits to the SCOS-2000 community: A fully proven approach to support several missions using common software, providing a significant reduction in the costs for the development of mission control systems. A set of generic features that can be extensively reused in several environments, which share a common operations approach, mainly based on visibility passes.

AB  - Mao, D.; Fu, X.; Wang, J., and Guo, R., 2019. Assessment of flood vulnerability of the Dongting Lake Area in China with regard to land use/cover change. In: Guido-Aldana, P.A. and Mulahasan, S. (eds.), Advances in Water Resources and Exploration. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 93, pp. 388-396. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. A flood vulnerability comprehensive evaluation model (FVCEM) was established by interpreting remote sensing (RS) image data for 1987, 1998, and 2008 using Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) software and a geographical information system (GIS), as well as analysing historical disaster maps and statistical yearbook data regarding flood disasters in the Dongting Lake Area in China. Using the method of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) etc., the influence of land use/cover change on flood vulnerability was studied. The vulnerability of the local population and economy to flooding was assessed by means of FVCEM. The results showed that the vulnerability parameters of hazard-affected bodies were different for different land use types, which influenced the subsequent flood vulnerability. The flood vulnerability value over the period of 1987-2008 exhibited an increasing trend, with obvious spatial heterogeneity. The hinterland of the Dongting Lake Area was found to be susceptible to flood hazard. The flood risk regionalization and risk management should be carried out urgently by local government according to the temporal and spatial vary characteristics of flood vulnerability, land use model suitable for these characteristics should be constructed timely by residents. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.

TI  - Agronomic Performance And Remote Sensing Assessment Of Organic And Mineral Fertilization In Rice Fields
JO  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Introduction: Rice heavily relies on nitrogen fertilizers, posing environmental, resource, and geopolitical challenges. This study explores sustainable alternatives like animal manure and remote sensing for resource-efficient rice cultivation. It aims to assess the long-term impact of organic fertilization and remote sensing monitoring on agronomic traits, yield, and nutrition.Methods: A six-year experiment in rice fields evaluated fertilization strategies, including pig slurry (PS) and chicken manure (CM) with mineral fertilizers (MIN), MIN-only, and zero-fertilization. Traits, yield, spectral responses, and nutrient content were measured. Sentinel-2 remote sensing tracked crop development.Results: Cost-effective organic fertilizers (PS and CM) caused a 13\% and 15\% yield reduction but still doubled zero-fertilization yield. PS reduced nitrogen leaching. Heavy metals in rice grains were present at safe amounts. Organic-fertilized crops showed nitrogen deficiency at the late vegetative stages, affecting yield. Sentinel-2 detected nutrient deficiencies through NDVI.Discussion: Organic fertilizers, especially PS, reduce nitrogen loss, benefiting the environment. However, they come with yield trade-offs and nutrient management challenges that can be managed and balanced with reduced additional mineral applications. Sentinel-2 remote sensing helps manage nutrient deficiencies. In summary, this research favors cost-effective organic fertilizers with improved nutrient management for sustainable rice production.

TI  - Community Perceptions And Attitudes Towards Conservation Of Wildlife In Uganda
JO  - Journal of Wildlife and Biodiversity
PY  - 2022
AB  - Community perceptions and attitudes towards the parks and wildlife in Kibale and Queen Elizabeth Conservation Areas, Uganda are explored. We determined local community perceptions and attitudes through a household survey from May 2018 to April 2019 using literature review, focused group discussions, Geographical Information System/remote sensing, and semi-structured interviews from 208 respondents randomly selected from local communities living adjacent to the wildlife-protected areas. Socio-demographic factors mainly gender, age, education level, and distance of household from the park boundary influence (at α=0.05 and 0.001) local community perceptions and attitudes towards wildlife conservation. Local community perceptions of the park and wildlife were influenced (at α=0.05 and 0.001) by community knowledge and awareness of the existence and importance of the park, its attributes, wildlife resources, and benefits. Local community attitudes were influenced (at α=0.05 and 0.001) by the level of conservation education and awareness, resource access and use, handling of victims of illegal entry into the parks, and the costs incurred from invasion by wild animals. We conclude that socio-demographic factors, community knowledge and awareness of the existence of the park, its attributes and resources, community benefits, and costs incurred by the community as a result of invasion by wild animals and vermin, influence community perceptions and attitudes towards conservation of parks and wildlife. The wildlife agency should integrate local community perceptions and attitudes into the park management plans, intensify wildlife conservation education and awareness programs, and provide incentives to local communities to improve community perceptions and attitudes towards the park and wildlife. © 2022, Department of Environmental Sciences, Arak University.

TI  - Space For Development: A Policy Perspective
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC
PY  - 2012
AB  - Developed countries are increasingly relying on their technology advancement and financial means to pursue their socio-economic development and ensure their security using space applications (e.g. in defence, human and environment security). In developing countries, space-based services could provide the same benefits and support global development policies such as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. They could have a tangible impact for improving the living conditions of the poorest, giving for instance access to better health care, education and ensuring food security. The availability of space-based data and/or technology could also enable economic growth through the development of efficient communication and transport networks, of a service industry and a better use of natural resources. Moreover, space has proved to be a crucial tool for disaster and crisis management and for delivering humanitarian aid. The full potential of space for the benefit of developing countries, however, is still hindered by different factors. These include the fragmentation and an insufficient level of cooperation efforts at international and regional levels, difficult access to funding, lack of infrastructure, expertise and education. The paper analyses these issues from a policy perspective at various levels (international, regional and national). The role, efficiency and gaps of existing international and national initiatives will be analysed. The paper eventually formulates policy recommendations and proposes elements for a way forward at policy level for national, regional and international authorities and organizations.

TI  - Estimation Of No<Sub>2</Sub> Emission Strengths Over Riyadh And Madrid From Space From A Combination Of Wind-Assigned Anomalies And A Machine Learning Technique
JO  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
PY  - 2023
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution provides valuable information for quantifying NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions and exposures. This study presents a comprehensive method to estimate average tropospheric NO2 emission strengths derived from 4-year (May 2018-June 2022) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations by combining a wind-assigned anomaly approach and a machine learning (ML) method, the so-called gradient descent algorithm. This combined approach is firstly applied to the Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh, as a test site, and yields a total emission rate of 1:09 x 1026 molec. s(-1). The ML-trained anomalies fit very well with the wind-assigned anomalies, with an R-2 value of 1.0 and a slope of 0.99. Hotspots of NO2 emissions are apparent at several sites: over a cement plant and power plants as well as over areas along highways. Using the same approach, an emission rate of 1 :99 x 10(25) molec. s(-1) is estimated in the Madrid metropolitan area, Spain. Both the estimate and spatial pattern are comparable with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. Weekly variations in NO2 emission are highly related to anthropogenic activities, such as the transport sector. The NO2 emissions were reduced by 16\% at weekends in Riyadh, and high reductions were found near the city center and in areas along the highway. An average weekend reduction estimate of 28\% was found in Madrid. The regions with dominant sources are located in the east of Madrid, where residential areas and the Madrid-Barajas airport are located. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the NO2 emissions decreased by 21\% in March-June 2020 in Riyadh compared with the same period in 2019. A much higher reduction (62 \%) is estimated for Madrid, where a very strict lockdown policy was implemented. The high emission strengths during lockdown only persist in the residential areas, and they cover smaller areas on weekdays compared with weekends. The spatial patterns of NO2 emission strengths during lockdown are similar to those observed at weekends in both cities. Although our analysis is limited to two cities as test examples, the method has proven to provide reliable and consistent results. It is expected to be suitable for other trace gases and other target regions. However, it might become challenging in some areas with complicated emission sources and topography, and specific NO2 decay times in different regions and seasons should be taken into account. These impacting factors should be considered in the future model to further reduce the uncertainty budget.

TI  - Validation Of Timi And Grace Acute Coronary Risk Scores In Alexandria Governorate And Their Role In The Comparison Of Quality Of Care Between Hospitals
JO  - JOURNAL OF THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION
PY  - 2010
AB  - Background: Risk stratification in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) aims to identify those patients who might benefit prognostically from further investigation and treatment. In addition, risk stratification models have been used by health authorities and hospitals in quality management activities. Aim: The present study aimed at validating the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores for prediction of mortality in patients with ACS in Alexandria governorate. In addition, the study aimed also at using one of the validated risk scores to compare risk adjusted mortality among participating hospitals. Material and Methods: The study was conducted at hospitals belonging to 3 different health care organizations in Alexandria. All admitted patients with the diagnosis of ACS throughout a period of 6 months were included in the study (n=606). Discriminatory capacity and calibration of the TIMI and GRACE risk scores for detection of in-hospital mortality and mortality within six months of index admission were assessed. Results: The study showed that both TIMI and GRACE risk scores had high c statistics of 0.70 or higher. GRACE scores showed equal or higher c statistics than TIMI scores denoting better discriminatory capacity. TIMI risk score showed good calibration while GRACE risk score showed lower calibration capacity with certain patient categories. The GRACE risk score was used to calculate the standardized in-hospital mortality ratio which was higher than 1 for all participating hospitals indicating higher than expected mortality for ACS patients in these hospitals. Conclusions and recommendations: GRACE risk score showed good discriminatory capacity, suggesting that it is suitable for clinical use among ACS patients in Alexandria governorate. It was recommended to use GRACE risk score for risk adjustment in quality management activities.

TI  - A High-Performance Convolutional Neural Network For Ground-Level Ozone Estimation In Eastern China
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - Having a high-quality historical air pollutant dataset is critical for environmental and epidemiological research. In this study, a novel deep learning model based on convolutional neural network architecture was developed to estimate ground-level ozone concentrations across eastern China. A high-resolution maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) surface ground ozone concentration dataset was generated with the support of the total ozone column from the satellite Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, meteorological data from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System, and simulations of the WRF-Chem model. The modeled results were compared with in situ measurements in five cities that were not involved in model training, and the mean R2 of predicted ozone with observed values was 0.9, indicating the good robustness of our model. In addition, we compared the model results with some widely used machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest) and recently published ozone datasets, showing that the accuracy of our model is higher and that the spatial distributions of predicted ozone are more coherent. This study provides an efficient and exact method to estimate ground-level ozone and offers a new perspective for modeling spatiotemporal air pollutants. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Climate Change: Vegetation And Phenological Phase Dynamics
JO  - International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management
PY  - 2020
AB  - Purpose: The ecological environment of the Loess Plateau, China, is extremely fragile under the context of global warming. Over the past two decades, the vegetation of the Loess Plateau has undergone great changes. This paper aims to clarify the response mechanisms of vegetation to climate change, to provide support for the restoration and environmental treatment of vegetation on the Loess Plateau. Design/methodology/approach: The Savitsky–Golay (S-G) filtering algorithm was used to reconstruct time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 13A2 data. Combined with trend analysis and partial correlation analysis, the influence of climate change on the phenology and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) during the growing season was described. Findings: The S-G filtering algorithm is suitable for EVI reconstruction of the Loess Plateau. The date of start of growing season was found to gradually later along the Southeast–Northwest direction, whereas the date of the end of the growing season showed the opposite pattern and the length of the growing season gradually shortened. Vegetation EVI values decreased gradually from Southeast to Northwest. Vegetation changed significantly and showed clear differentiation according to different topographic factors. Vegetation correlated positively with precipitation from April to July and with temperature from August to November. Originality/value: This study provides technical support for ecological environmental assessment, restoration of regional vegetation coverage and environmental governance of the Loess Plateau over the past two decades. It also provides theoretical support for the prediction model of vegetation phenology changes based on remote sensing data. © 2020, Yang Li, Yaochen Qin, Liqun Ma and Ziwu Pan.

TI  - Towards An Indian Land Data Assimilation System (Ildas): A Coupled Hydrologic-Hydraulic System For Water Balance Assessments
JO  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
PY  - 2024
AB  - Effective management of water resources requires reliable estimates of land surface states and fluxes, including water balance components. But most land surface models run in uncoupled mode and do not produce river discharge at catchment scales to be useful for water resources management applications. Such integrated systems are also rare over India where hydrometeorological extremes have wreaked havoc on the economy and people. So, an Indian Land Data Assimilation System (ILDAS) with a coupled land surface and a hydrodynamic model has been developed and driven by multiple meteorological forcings (0.1 degrees, daily) to estimate land surface states, channel discharge, and floodplain inundation. ILDAS benefits from an integrated framework as well as the largest suite of observation records collected over India and has been used to produce a reanalysis product for 1981-2021 using four forcing datasets, namely, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), ECMWF's ERA-5, and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded precipitation. We assessed the uncertainty and bias in these precipitation datasets and validated all major components of the terrestrial water balance, i.e., surface runoff, soil moisture, terrestrial water storage anomalies, evapotranspiration, and streamflow, against a combination of satellite and in situ observation datasets. Our assessment shows that ILDAS can represent the hydrological processes reasonably well over the Indian landmass with IMD precipitation showing the best relative performance. Evaluation against ESA-CCI soil moisture shows that MERRA-2 based estimates outperform the others, whereas ERA-5 performs best in simulating evapotranspiration when evaluated against MODIS ET. Evaluations against observed records show that CHIRPS-based estimates have the highest performance in reconstructing surface runoff and streamflow. Once operational, this system will be useful for supporting transboundary water management decision making in the region.

TI  - Identification Of Likely Foraging Habitat Of Pelagic Loggerhead Sea Turtles (Caretta Caretta) In The North Atlantic Through Analysis Of Telemetry Track Sinuosity
JO  - Progress in Oceanography
PY  - 2010
AB  - Changes in the behavior of individual animals in response to environmental characteristics can provide important information about habitat preference, as well as the relative risk that animals may face based on the amount of time spent in hazardous areas. We analyzed movement and habitat affinities of ten loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) tagged with satellite transmitters in the spring and fall of 1998 near Madeira, Portugal for periods of 2-10 months. We analyzed the behavior of these individuals in relation to the marine environment they occupied. As a measure of behavior we calculated the straightness index (SI), the ratio of the displacement of the animal to the total distance traveled, for individual weekly segments of the 10 tracks. We then extracted information about chlorophyll a concentration, sea-surface temperature (SST), bathymetry, and geostrophic current of the ocean in a 20-km buffer surrounding the tracks, and examined their relationship to the straightness index using generalized linear models. Chlorophyll a value, bathymetry and SST were significantly related to the straightness index of the tracks of all ten animals, as was the circular standard deviation of the geostrophic current (Wald's test: p= 0.001, p= 0.008, p= 0.025, and p= 0.049, respectively). We found a significant negative relationship between straightness index and chlorophyll, and positive relationships with ocean depth and SST indicating that animals are spending more time and searching more thoroughly in areas with high chlorophyll concentrations and in areas that are shallower, while moving in straight paths through very warm areas. We also found a positive relationship between straightness index and the circular standard deviation of surrounding geostrophic currents suggesting that these turtles are more likely to move in a straight line when in the presence of diffuse, less-powerful currents. Based on these relationships, we propose that conservation planning to reduce overlap of turtles with fishing operations should take into account the locations of bathymetric features such as seamounts and upwelling locations where chlorophyll concentrations are high. This analysis is an effective way to characterize areas of high-use habitat for satellite-tagged marine vertebrates, and allows for comparisons of these characteristics between species and among individuals. © 2010.

TI  - Validation Of The Global Registry Of Acute Coronary Event (Grace) Risk Score For In-Hospital Mortality In Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome In Canada
JO  - American Heart Journal
PY  - 2009
AB  - Background: The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Event (GRACE) risk score was developed in a large multinational registry to predict in-hospital mortality across the broad spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Because of the substantial regional variation and temporal changes in patient characteristics and management patterns, we sought to validate this risk score in a contemporary Canadian population with ACS. Methods: The main GRACE and GRACE2 registries are prospective, multicenter, observational studies of patients with ACS (June 1999 to December 2007). For each patient, we calculated the GRACE risk score and evaluated its discrimination and calibration by the c statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, respectively. To assess the impact of temporal changes in management on the GRACE risk score performance, we evaluated its discrimination and calibration after stratifying the study population into prespecified subgroups according to enrollment period, type of ACS, and whether the patient underwent coronary angiography or revascularization during index hospitalization. Results: A total of 12,242 Canadian patients with ACS were included; the median GRACE risk score was 127 (25th and 75th percentiles were 103 and 157, respectively). Overall, the GRACE risk score demonstrated excellent discrimination (c statistic 0.84, 95% CI 0.82-0.86, P < .001) for in-hospital mortality. Similar results were seen in all the subgroups (all c statistics ≥0.8). However, calibration was suboptimal overall (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .06) and in various subgroups. Conclusions: GRACE risk score is a valid and powerful predictor of adverse outcomes across the wide range of Canadian patients with ACS. Its excellent discrimination is maintained despite advances in management over time and is evident in all patient subgroups. However, the predicted probability of in-hospital mortality may require recalibration in the specific health care setting and with advancements in treatment. © 2009 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Effect Of Recent Controls On Emissions And Aerosol Pollution At City Scale: A Case Study For Nanjing, China
JO  - Atmospheric Environment
PY  - 2021
AB  - We selected a typical developed city in east China, Nanjing, to evaluate the effect of recent national and local policies of air pollution control on emissions and air quality at city scale. Using a bottom-up methodology, the annual emissions of SO2, NOX, CO, NH3, primary fine particle matters (PM2.5), black carbon, and organic carbon were estimated to decline 70%, 22%, 49%, 72%, 64%, 65%, and 86%, respectively, while a slight increase was found for the non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during 2012–2016. The inter-annual change in NOX emissions was consistent with that in tropospheric NO2 column from satellite observation. Using air quality modeling (AQM), the city-scale emission inventory was further evaluated through comparisons between the simulated and observed concentrations of selected species. For SO2, NO2 and PM2.5, the normalized mean bias (NMB) and normalized mean errors (NMEs) for most cases were within 20% and 50% respectively, implying the reliability of the emission inventory. Regarding chemistry species, the modeling performance was better for sulfate and black carbon than nitrate and ammonium. From 2012 to 2016, the average of monthly PM2.5 concentrations for January, April, July, and October in Nanjing was found to decline 28% and 25% with AQM and ground observation, respectively, implying the benefit of emission control on aerosol pollution. Extra simulations with fixed emissions or meteorology conditions for 2012 and 2016 were conducted to understand the effects of emission control and meteorology variation on the reduced aerosol pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Cultivated Land Use Zoning Based On Soil Function Evaluation From The Perspective Of Black Soil Protection
JO  - LAND
PY  - 2021
AB  - Given that cultivated land serves as a strategic resource to ensure national food security, blind emphasis on improvement of food production capacity can lead to soil overutilization and impair other soil functions. Therefore, we took Heilongjiang province as an example to conduct a multi-functional evaluation of soil at the provincial scale. A combination of soil, climate, topography, land use, and remote sensing data were used to evaluate the functions of primary productivity, provision and cycling of nutrients, provision of functional and intrinsic biodiversity, water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and regulation of cultivated land in 2018. We designed a soil function discriminant matrix, constructed the supply-demand ratio, and evaluated the current status of supply and demand of soil functions. Soil functions demonstrated a distribution pattern of high grade in the northeast and low grade in the southwest, mostly in second-level areas. The actual supply of primary productivity functions in 71.32\% of the region cannot meet the current needs of the population. The dominant function of soil in 34.89\% of the area is water purification and regulation, and most of the cultivated land belongs to the functional balance region. The results presented herein provide a theoretical basis for optimization of land patterns and improvement of cultivated land use management on a large scale, and is of great significance to the sustainable use of black soil resources and improvement of comprehensive benefits.

JO  - REVISTA ELETRONICA EM GESTAO EDUCACAO E TECNOLOGIA AMBIENTAL
PY  - 2012
AB  - Several environmental impacts such as deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution and chaotic urban occupation are related to lack of planning in land use in watersheds. For proper planning and management of water resources is critical to proper delineation of watersheds. Thus, this study aimed to analyze a methodology for automatic delineation of watersheds in the basin of the creek Corupa, Rio Grande do Sul/RS, Brazil, using design data Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and compare with the values obtained in the area of manual scanning with based on topographic maps with scale of 1: 50 000. For this, the data were integrated and processed using the software ArcGIS 9.2 (ESRI, 2006). The methodology used in this process was divided into six stages, as follows: filling depressions("fill sinks"), flow direction ("flow direction"), accumulated flow ("flow accumulation"), extraction of drainage ("conditional - > con "), linking crossing stream ("stream link ") and delineation of watersheds ("watershed"). The basin area delimited from the contours of the topographical was 29.162,4 ha and for the automatic delineation met total area of 28.472,2 ha, representing a difference of 2,4\% of total area 690,2 ha. The results show very close values confirming be advantageous to automate the delineation of watersheds by several factors such as gratuity, the SRTM data accuracy and the great coverage of available data, since not all regions are data availability and the cartographic results may vary according to the human perception.

TI  - Establishing A Robotic, Leo-To-Geo Satellite Servicing Infrastructure As An Economic Foundation For Exploration
JO  - AIAA SPACE Conference and Exposition 2010
PY  - 2010
AB  - The strategy for accomplishing civilian exploration goals and objectives is in the process of a fundamental shift towards a potential new approach called "Flexible Path." This paper suggests that a government-industry or public-private partnership in the commercial development of low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit (LEO-to-GEO (LTG)) space, following or in parallel with the commercialization of Earth-to-LEO and International Space Station (ISS) operations, could serve as a necessary, logical step that can be incorporated into the flexible path approach. A LEO-to-GEO satellite-servicing infrastructure and architecture concept is discussed within this new strategic context. The concept consists of a space harbor that serves as a transport facility for a fleet of specialized, fully- or semi-autonomous robotic servicing spacecraft. The baseline, conceptual system architecture is composed of a space harbor equipped with specialized servicer spacecraft; a tri-satellite command, communication, and control system; a parts station; a fuel station or depot; and a fuel/parts replenishment transport. The commercial servicer fleet would consist of several types of spacecraft, each designed with specialized robotic manipulation subsystems to provide services such as refueling, upgrade, repair, inspection, relocation, and removal. The space harbor is conceptualized as an ISS-type, octagonal truss structure equipped with radiation tolerant subsystems. This space harbor would be primarily capable of serving as an operational platform for various commercially owned and operated servicer spacecraft positioned and docked symmetrically on four of the eight sides. Several aspects of this concept are discussed, such as: system-level feasibility in terms of ISS-truss-type infrastructure and subsystems emplacement and maintenance between LEO and GEO; infrastructure components assembly in LEO, derived from ISS assembly experience, and transfer to various higher orbital locations; the evolving Earth-to-orbit (ETO) capability to deliver humans and cargo to LEO for assembly purposes; system architectural definition, optimal orbital parameters, mass estimations, delta velocity (ΔV) estimations, power and propulsion options, and assessments of various critical technologies. Large-scale, robotic, LTG satellite servicing is considered as an essential economic pre-condition and next parallel or sequential step on the road toward exploration beyond LEO. Such a step might produce the necessary pre-requisite economic value that can be used by future decision makers to justify further investment in exploration beyond LEO.

JO  - Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, and Communications Technology, IAICT 2023
PY  - 2023
AB  - The contemporary drought monitoring approaches are bounded by the need for greater visibility toward potentially hazardous scenarios. Hence, a temporal predictive analysis is aimed in this paper, which will be highly advantageous in subsequent planning for catastrophe mitigation and for presaging the vegetative health or probable drought event. Furthermore, the well-established Machine Learning (ML) models, comprising Random Forest and Ridge regressor, in addition to Deep Learning (DL) models, such as Multilayer Perceptron, 1D-CNN, and Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks (P2P), are implemented across several timeframes of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Also, the ML/DL models are trained by utilizing the Vegetative Health Index (VHI) values derived from NOAA/AVHRR satellite data from 1981 to 2022, with the Indian state of Karnataka conforming as the research region. In addition to generating temporal forecasts, the P2P model is further executed to perform an annual seasonal analysis that depicts the variations in dryness over time, Subsequently, the prediction performance is assessed through Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2) scores. The pattern of prediction accuracy annotated demonstrates more accurate forecasts for durations of one month (short term) with the best R2 score, MSE and MAE notching up to 0.88, 0.009, and 0.055, respectively; consequently, as hypothesized, escorted by a decline with widening temporal gaps for future projections such as the yearly level (long term) where the R2 score, MSE, and MAE reduced up to 0.60, 0.030 and 0.114 respectively. Also, the seasonal analysis delivered valuable insights into the influences of various climatic factors on the dryness level of the landmass, which will act conducive to better future planning and preparation. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Environmental Protection And The Circular Economy; A New Economic System For Society And A Business Strategy - The Case Study Of The Republic Of Serbia
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2020
AB  - The traditional 'linear' path of business doing must be changed according to the new principles of circularity, because the circular economy is considered to be a new economic system for society and economies at a macro level. At a micro level, the circular economy represents the ultimate business strategy. The circular economy eliminates the concept of waste, because waste is conceptualized as a resource. The mission of the circular economy as a new philosophy is to change the production of global economies, as well as consumption. By this concept, the ecosystem will circulate value. The paper is focused on the perception of the tripartite nature of the circular economy and its multidisciplinary feature. On the one hand, its affects world and national economies; on the other, it affects consumers; and then, again, it concerns (business and other) organizations. Following the “What's in it for me?” model, each participant of the economic (business) and social systems must find their own interest in leaving the linear “take, make, waste” model. The participants of the social system will become aware of the significance of the circular economy for the protection of the living environment, economic growth and the creation of new jobs (governments and economic policymakers), the source of innovations and competitive advantage, a rational use of resources (companies), then the protection of the living environment and health (citizens). The circular economy is a broad platform that includes all social actors in solving ecological problems and ensures benefits for them. The role of innovation and the importance of information technology are emphasized. In the paper, the institutional efforts of the Republic of Serbia in building the circular economy are considered, the most significant projects of the circular and green economies, as well as their respective potentials, including also the observed weaknesses with respect to the bad management of waste, the uncontrolled import of internal and hazardous waste, and the inefficient consumption of energy (which on its part generates big quantities of carbon-dioxide) are presented. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

TI  - Developing The Health Effect Assessment Of Landscape (Heal) Tool: Assessing The Health Effects Of Community Greenspace Morphology Design On Non-Communicable Diseases
JO  - Landscape and Urban Planning
PY  - 2024
AB  - Neighborhood greenspace benefits health, yet few tools are available for estimating the health consequences of community greenspace design alternatives, especially prior to the implementation of a landscape design plan. Herein we present a machine learning based tool for predicting the prevalence of non-communicable diseases based on landscape design maps at the community scale. We achieve this based on data collected in five major metropolises in the United States. By using high-resolution satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies, landscape spatial design characteristics were extracted through spatial pattern analysis, allowing the measurement of verdancy, fragmentation, connectedness, aggregation, and shape of greenspaces. We established a model to estimate the prevalence of poor mental health, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and physical inactivity at the census tract level by adopting a combination of random forest decision tree algorithm and spatial Gaussian process models. Model accuracy was found to be significantly higher than ordinary regression models. The model accounted for very high levels of variance in the specified morbidities; viz., poor mental health (97%), heart disease (93%), stroke (93%), diabetes (95%), COPD (94%), and physical inactivity (98%). This tool is implemented using a freely available programming language (R), and we offer the model accessible to the public. This tool enables urban planners and landscape designers to assess and compare the health effects of different greenspace design plans prior to implementation, thus providing policymakers and designers with evidence-rich alternatives during the health-promoting greenspace planning process. © 2023 The Authors

TI  - Mapping Robinia Pseudoacacia Forest Health Conditions By Using Combined Spectral, Spatial, And Textural Information Extracted From Ikonos Imagery And Random Forest Classifier
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2015
AB  - The textural and spatial information extracted from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery provides complementary information for applications in which the spectral information is not sufficient for identification of spectrally similar landscape features. In this study grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures and a local statistical analysis Getis statistic (Gi), computed from IKONOS multispectral (MS) imagery acquired from the Yellow River Delta in China, along with a random forest (RF) classifier, were used to discriminate Robina pseudoacacia tree health levels. Specifically, eight GLCM texture features (mean, variance, homogeneity, dissimilarity, contrast, entropy, angular second moment, and correlation) were first calculated from IKONOS NIR band (Band 4) to determine an optimal window size (13 × 13) and an optimal direction (45°). Then, the optimal window size and direction were applied to the three other IKONOS MS bands (blue, green, and red) for calculating the eight GLCM textures. Next, an optimal distance value (5) and an optimal neighborhood rule (Queen's case) were determined for calculating the four Gi features from the four IKONOS MS bands. Finally, different RF classification results of the three forest health conditions were created: (1) an overall accuracy (OA) of 79.5% produced using the four MS band reflectances only; (2) an OA of 97.1% created with the eight GLCM features calculated from IKONOS Band 4 with the optimal window size of 13 × 13 and direction 45°; (3) an OA of 93.3% created with the all 32 GLCM features calculated from the four IKONOS MS bands with a window size of 13 × 13 and direction of 45°; (4) an OA of 94.0% created using the four Gi features calculated from the four IKONOS MS bands with the optimal distance value of 5 and Queen's neighborhood rule; and (5) an OA of 96.9% created with the combined 16 spectral (four), spatial (four), and textural (eight) features. The most important feature ranked by RF classifier was GLCM texture mean calculated from Band 4, followed by Gi feature calculated from Band 4. The experimental results demonstrate that (a) both textural and spatial information was more useful than spectral information in determining the Robina pseudoacacia forest health conditions; and (b) the IKONOS NIR band was more powerful than visible bands in quantifying varying degrees of forest crown dieback. © 2015 by the authors.

TI  - Gis-Based Flood Risk Model Evaluated By Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fahp)
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering
PY  - 2016
AB  - Over the last 2-3 decades, the economy of many countries around the world has been developed rapidly but it was unbalanced development because of expecting on economic growth only. Meanwhile it lacked of effective planning in the use of natural resources. This can significantly induce climate change which is major cause of natural disaster. Hereby, Thailand has also suffered from natural disaster for ages. Especially, the flood which is most hazardous disaster in Thailand can annually result in the great loss of life and property, environment and economy. Since the flood management of country is inadequate efficiency. It is unable to support the flood analysis comprehensively. This paper applied Geographic Information System and Multi-Criteria Decision Making to create flood risk model at regional scale. Angthong province in Thailand was used as the study area. In practical process, Fuzzy logic technique has been used to improve specialist's assessment by implementing with Fuzzy membership because human decision is flawed under uncertainty then AHP technique was processed orderly. The hierarchy structure in this paper was categorized the spatial flood factors into two levels as following: 6 criteria (Meteorology, Geology, Topography, Hydrology, Human and Flood history) and 8 factors (Average Rainfall, Distance from Stream, Soil drainage capability, Slope, Elevation, Land use, Distance from road and Flooded area in the past). The validity of the pair-wise comparison in AHP was shown as C.R. value which indicated that the specialist judgment was reasonably consistent. FAHP computation result has shown that the first priority of criteria was Meteorology. In addition, the Rainfall was the most influencing factor for flooding. Finally, the output was displayed in thematic map of Angthong province with flood risk level processed by GIS tools. The map was classified into: High Risk, Moderate Risk and Low Risk (13.20%, 75.58%, and 11.22% of total area). © 2016 SPIE.

TI  - Exploring Hard Samples In Multiview For Few-Shot Remote Sensing Scene Classification
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2023
AB  - Few-shot remote sensing scene classification (RSSC) is of high practical value in real situations where data are scarce and annotated costly. The few-shot learner needs to identify new categories with limited examples, and the core issue of this assignment is how to prompt the model to learn transferable knowledge from a large-scale base dataset. Although current approaches based on transfer learning or meta-learning have achieved significant performance on this task, there are still two problems to be addressed: 1) as an essential characteristic of remote sensing (RS) images, spatial rotation insensitivity surprisingly remains largely unexplored and 2) the high distribution uncertainty of hard samples reduces the discriminative power of the model decision boundary. Stimulated by these, we propose a corresponding end-to-end framework termed a hard sample learning and multiview integration network (HSL-MINet). First, the multiview integration (MI) module contains a pretext task introduced to guide the knowledge transfer and a multiview-attention mechanism used to extract correlational information across different rotation views of images. Second, aiming at increasing the discrimination of the model decision boundary, the hard sample learning (HSL) module is designed to evaluate and select hard samples via a classwise adaptive threshold strategy and then decrease the uncertainty of their feature distributions by a devised triplet loss. Extensive evaluations on NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19, and UCM datasets show that the effectiveness of our HSL-MINet surpasses the former state-of-the-art approaches. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Evaluation Of Urbanization Dynamics And Its Impacts On Surface Heat Islands: A Case Study Of Beijing, China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2017
AB  - As the capital of China, Beijing has experienced a continued and rapid urbanization process in the past few decades. One of the key environmental impacts of rapid urbanization is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). The objective of this study was to estimate the urbanization indexes of Beijing from 1992 to 2013 based on the stable nighttime light (NTL) data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Line Scanner System (DMSP/OLS), which has became a widely used remote sensing database after decades of development. The annual average value nighttime light Digital Number (NTL-DN), and the total lit number and urban area proportion within Beijing's boundary were calculated and compared with social-economic statistics parameters to estimate the correlation between them. Four Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images acquired in 1995 and 2009 were applied to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized land surface temperature (LSTnor), and spatial correlation analysis was then carried out to investigate the relationship between the urbanization level and NDVI and LSTnor. Our results showed a strong negative linear relationship between the NTL-DN value and NDVI; however, in contrast, a strong positive linear relationship between existed between the NTL-DN value and LSTnor. By conducting a spatial comparison analysis of 1995 and 2009, the vegetation coverage change and surface temperature difference were calculated and compared with the NTL-DN difference. Our result revealed that the regions of fast urbanization resulted in a decrease of NDVI and increase of LSTnor. In addition, choropleth maps showing the spatial pattern of urban heat island zones were produced based on different temperatures, and the analysis result indicated that the spatial distribution of surface temperature was closely related with the NTL-DN and NDVI. These findings are helpful for understanding the urbanization process as well as urban ecology, which both have significant implications for urban planning and minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization in Beijing.

TI  - Factors Associated With Self-Reported Health Among New Zealand Military Veterans: A Cross-Sectional Study
JO  - BMJ OPEN
PY  - 2022
AB  - Objective To identify factors associated with better or poorer self-reported health status in New Zealand military Veterans. Design A cross-sectional survey. Participants The participants of interest were the 3874 currently serving Veterans who had been deployed to a conflict zone, but all Veterans were eligible to participate. Study variables The EQ-5D-5L, asking about problems across five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression), with five levels of severity (eg, no, slight, moderate, severe or extreme problems), also containing a Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) to self-assess health state, scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) imagined health. Hypothetical relationships with better health were positive social support, sleep and psychological flexibility; with poorer health, post-traumatic stress, exposure to psychological trauma, distress and hazardous drinking. Results The EQ5-D-5L was completed by 1767 Veterans, 1009 serving, a response rate of 26\% from that group, 1767 completing the EQ5-D, 1458 who had deployed, 288 who had not and the 21 who did not provide deployment data. Of these, 247 were not used in the analysis due to missing values in one or more variables, leaving 1520 for analysis. A significantly higher proportion of Veterans reported 'any problems' rather than 'no problems' with four EQ-5D dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain or discomfort, but no difference in anxiety or depression. Age, length of service, deployment, psychological flexibility and better sleep quality were associated with higher EQ-VAS scores; distress with lower EQ-VAS scores. Conclusion In this sample of New Zealand Veterans, psychological flexibility and good sleep are associated with better self-rated health, and distress and poor sleep with diminished health. These factors might be used as sentinel health indicators in assessing Veteran health status, and cognitive-behavioural therapy encompassing these domains may be useful in improving the health of New Zealand Veterans.

TI  - Notice Of Retraction: Evolution Of The Channel Geomorphology And Flood Management Countermeasures Of The Middle And Lower Yangtze River
JO  - 2010 2nd Conference on Environmental Science and Information Application Technology, ESIAT 2010
PY  - 2010
AB  - River channel geomorphologic evolution is the basis of flood control and regulation. With the information of satellite images and field investigation, the article emphatically analyzes the geomorphologic evolution characteristics and stability of meandering channels and gooseneck-bifurcated channel, both of which are the most typical and unstable types in the middle and lower Yangtze River. Evolution of meandering channels has characteristics of periodicity and length constraint. The fractal dimension of Lower-lingjiang is between l.078 and l.23. When it reaches a value between l.19 and l.23, river channel goes to an unstable status, in that case the fractal dimension will have mutation from big to small, because of the channel cutoff. Stone serving as node, heart-shape beach, branch inflow are the main conditions of the forming of gooseneck-bending channel. Most gooseneck-bifurcated channel has the characteristics of periodicity integer nested translation. Recently most of the left branches are at the stage of bankrupt-siltation-bank combined. Lower-lingjiang meandering channel has the characteristics of variability at the transverse direction and linkage at the vertical direction, so river regulation should be based on the whole part of the river. Bifurcated channel below Chenglingji should be governed from different units according to the node. More branches, more unstable the channel will become, besides, the branch also has the characteristics of linkage, and so all branches should be treated as an entirety when having the river regulation. ©2010 IEEE.

TI  - Complementing Satellites And Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Rangeland Assessment In Patagonia
JO  - Ecologia Austral
PY  - 2019
AB  - Rangelands assessment in arid and semiarid regions is a key tool both for livestock management planning and environmental diagnoses. Even though there is a consensus on the utility of such tools, rangeland assessment with high detail (grain) while covering large areas or landscapes (extension) is too costly. Then, the compatibility between the resolution and quality of information and the spatial extent required to make decisions in livestock systems is still an operational challenge that has not found an effective solution. Thus, the use of satellite images for rangeland assessments in different environments has been growing steadily in the last two decades. The developments associated with the capture of images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would offer many advantages as a complement to information, since they increase the spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to classify rangeland environments using satellite and UAV images and compare their respective contributions for rangeland assessments in Patagonia. In particular, spatial resolution of an unsupervised classification of rangeland environments using SPOT 7 satellite images and images captured by an optical sensor mounted on an UAV were compared. Rangeland assessment can be potentiated by the use of different sources of information in a more complementary and accessible way for environmental monitoring, and for a pastoral management planning in highly heterogeneous environments from arid and semiarid regions of Patagonia, Argentina. © 2019, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

TI  - Analysis Of Oil Palm Tree Recognition Using Drone-Based Remote Sensing Images
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2020
AB  - The oil palm tree, or scientifically called as Elaeis guineensis is native to West Africa, where it grows in the wild, transformed into a crop that later was introduced to Malaysian industry. The cultivation of oil palm improved rapidly under the agricultural sector causes degradation, particularly when the oil palm plantation goes uncontrolled. Tree plantation identification is very important for plantation management, environmental management, biodiversity monitoring and many other applications. Accurate inventories and monitoring oil palm estates can be a challenge and critical towards the plantation management and plant area expansion. Managing oil palm estate manually can almost be impossible, so do the tree counting. Manual field-based tree counting is time-consuming and high cost. Conventional method for tree counting can be carried out by manually marked on images or carry out field surveying using GPS to collect the positions of oil palm trees and display their position on image. Developing easier, simpler and cheaper method for tree counting is needed. The aim of this study is to analyse oil palm trees using drone-based remote sensing images. The algorithms used in this research study including Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), wavelet transform and template matching. The database of oil palm tree been developed with a total of 131 oil palm trees and 161 of non-oil palm trees have been collected. The window size of oil palm tree been analysed where 250 x 250 pixels which GLCM showed the best overall accuracy of 73.10% for both oil palm and non-oil palm. In this specific window, the oil palm crown can be covered and the result given is more accurate compared to other window sizes. The resulting analysis shows that wavelet transform algorithm gives the highest overall accuracy value which is 82.07%. The other eight statistic parameters can also used to modify the GLCM in order to observe the accuracy and identify which give the best classification accuracy. The availability and ubiquity of drone technologies with high resolution images and regular basis monitoring, new techniques in image and pattern recognition using drone-based remote sensing images let the idea of high accuracy oil palm tree detection become a reality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Identifying Suitable Bioeconomic Cluster Sites—Combining Gis-Mcda And Operational Research Methods
JO  - Environmental Modeling and Assessment
PY  - 2020
AB  - A transition to a bioeconomy implies an increased focus on efficient and sustainable use of biological resources. A common, but often neglected feature of these resources is their location dependence. To optimize their use, for example in bioeconomic industrial clusters, this spatial aspect should be integrated in analyses. Optimal design and localization of a bioeconomic cluster with respect to the various biological and non-biological resources required for the cluster, the composition of industrial facilities in the cluster, as well as the demands of the outputs of the cluster, is crucial for profitability and sustainability. We suggest that optimal design and location of bioeconomic clusters can benefit from the use of a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research modeling. The integration of MCDA and GIS determines a set of candidate locations based on various criteria, including resource availability, accessibility, and usability. A quantitative analysis of the flow of resources between and within the different industries is then conducted based on economic Input-Output analysis. Then, the cluster locations with the highest potential profit, and their composition of industrial facilities, are identified in an optimization model. A case study on forest-based bioeconomic clusters in the Østfold county of Norway is presented to exemplify this methodology, the expectation being that further implementation of the method at the national level could help decision makers in the planning of a smoother transition from a fossil-based economy to a bioeconomy. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - The Value Of Satellite Rainfall Estimates In Agriculture And Food Security
JO  - Advances in Global Change Research
PY  - 2020
AB  - Agriculture needs to produce more and more food not only to satisfy the current needs, but also to cope with the demand from the increasing population on the planet. However, agriculture today faces multiple challenges. Climate change and variability (extremes) feature at the top of these challenges because agriculture is particularly dependent on the climate. Stability of the food supply system as well as people’s livelihoods could be disrupted by climate shocks such as droughts and floods. Stability of food production and people’s livelihoods would require making agriculture resilient to climate trends and shocks through adaptation to climate change and finding effective ways to combat uncertainties associated with climate extremes such as droughts and floods. This, in turn, would require effective use of climate information that would enable agricultural practitioners to make better informed decisions at national, institutional and community levels. Provision of weather and climate information will depend on the availability of climate data. Rainfall is one of the major climatic parameters that has a major influencing factor in agriculture. However, rainfall measurements from station observations are inadequate over many parts of the world, and particularly over Africa, due to sparse or non-existent station networks. Satellite-based rainfall products have been used increasingly to complement or replace station observations. The main strength of satellite rainfall estimates is that they provide good spatial coverage, including remote areas, and are freely available. Satellite rainfall estimates are being used to support climate services for agriculture and food security in many different ways. This paper presents some specific examples that include a participatory planning process that is helping farmers in Rwanda to manage climate risks, and weather-based index insurance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

TI  - Early Identifying And Monitoring Landslides In Guizhou Province With Insar And Optical Remote Sensing
JO  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
PY  - 2021
AB  - The topography and landforms of Guizhou Province in China are complicated, and the climatic conditions of heavy precipitation make landslide disasters in Guizhou Province occur frequently. To avoid damage to people's lives and economic property caused by disasters, a reliable early landslide identification method and landslide monitoring method are urgently needed. Traditional landslide identification and monitoring methods have limitations. InSAR technology has unique advantages in large-scale landslide identification and monitoring, but landslide identification results based on a single deformation value are one-sided. Therefore, this paper uses Sentinel-1A radar satellite image data and uses InSAR technology and optical remote sensing technology to carry out large-scale surface deformation monitoring and identification of dangerous deformation areas in Liupanshui City, Tongren City, Guiyang City and other regions in Guizhou Province. The potential landslide identification methods based on the time series normalized difference vegetation index and landslide development environment elements are combined to investigate hidden landslide hazards in the study area. In this paper, time series InSAR technology is used to monitor three key landslides in Jichang Town, Yujiaying and Fana, to grasp the movement status of the landslide in time. The method of landslide identification and monitoring in this paper is of great significance for disaster prevention and management in Guizhou Province.

JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2019
AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique superiority has provided various opportunities in agricultural studies mainly on crop monitoring and management. This has resulted in many different investigations and improvements in crop growth monitoring, crop disaster prediction and providing accurate information to precise farming. In this study, a time-series of Sentinel-1 SAR images were acquired throughout the agricultural season synchronously with the field measurements to investigate the temporal backscatter changes for different crop types. From the backscattering analysis, it was observed that each similar crop type in different test fields due to the distinct methods of irrigation and fertilization has shown different intensity values. However, they all follow a roughly identical backscattering trend during growing stages of the crop and useful information can be extracted, such as estimating irrigation and harvesting time according to the changes made in backscatters. In comparing with ascending orbit in VH and VV polarizations it has indicated that the homogeneity between SAR backscatters is high for each field with the same crop type in descending pass direction with VH polarization. In contrary, high-intensity values are recorded in VV polarization for entire crop types. It is also observed that polarimetric composite images for a different date are useful to roughly identify crop types, and validated with the application of classification methods in the study area. As preliminary results, it is demonstrated that SAR data provide useful information about crops status. Hence, Sentinel-1 SAR data are ideal preference due to its free availability and constant long-term data archive. © 2019 R. Nasirzadehdizaji et al.

AB  - French Guiana forests cover 8 million hectares. With 98\% of emerged land covered by forests, French Guiana is the area with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. These forests are home to an exceptionally rich and diverse wealth of biodiversity that is both vulnerable and under threat due to high levels of pressure from human activity. As part of the French territory, French Guiana benefits from determined and continuous national efforts in the preservation of biodiversity and the environmental functionalities of ecosystems. The loss and fragmentation of forest cover caused by gold mining (legal and illegal), smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation, are considered as small-scale disturbances, although representing strong effects to vulnerable natural habitats, landscapes, and local populations. To monitor forest management programs and combat illegal deforestation and forest opening near-real time alerts system based on remote sensing data are required. For this large territory under frequent cloud cover, Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data appear to be the best adapted. In this paper, a method for forest alerts in a near-real time context based on Sentinel-1 data over the whole of French Guiana (83,534 km2) was developed and evaluated. The assessment was conducted for 2 years between 2016 and 2018 and includes comparisons with reference data provided by French Guiana forest organizations and comparisons with the existing University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Forest Alerts datasets based on Landsat data. The reference datasets include 1,867 plots covering 2,124.5 ha of gold mining, smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation. The validation results showed high user accuracies (96.2\%) and producer accuracies (81.5\%) for forest loss detection, with the latter much higher than for optical forest alerts (36.4\%). The forest alerts maps were also compared in terms of detection timing, showing systematic temporal delays of up to one year in the optical method compared to the SAR method. These results highlight the benefits of SAR over optical imagery for forest alerts detection in French Guiana. Finally, the potential of the SAR method applied to tropical forests is discussed. The SAR-based map of this study is available on http://cesbiomass.net/.

TI  - Utility Of Data Remote Sensing For Urban Dynamics Indicator Creation
PY  - 2015
AB  - The goal of the regional policy in the wider context is to assure the balance between different areas and locations. There are no objective and politically or "expertly" influenced tool till today, which help us monitor the urban processes and independently to know the statement of urban changes in the area e.g. the tool for urban dynamics measurement during the time. The paper is focused on adjustment of such monitoring and creation of data set and urban dynamics indicator from validated data set based on Earth remote sensing of the Earth as simple and non-influenced tool for urban dynamics monitoring and measurement during the time. The main goal of the paper is to show how luminance data from the Earth remote sensing in the regions can monitor changes in the area e.g. how is possible to create urban dynamics indicator.

TI  - Using Satellite Observations For Air Quality Assessment With An Inverse Model System
PY  - 2011
AB  - The EURAD-IM chemistry transport model and its 4d-var inverse model extension is applied to one summer and one winter episode: in order to identify the benefit of tropospheric NO2 column retrievals for estimating near-surface nitrogen dioxide concentrations. Initial values and emission rates are jointly optimised by assimilating tropospheric NO2 data from the OMI. while European ground based observations are used for impact. evaluation. Results show a moderate improvement, of surface level nitrogen dioxide estimates during the summer episode, successfully sustained after the assimilation period through emission adjustments. In the winter case, the OMI data is of limited value due to lower boundary layer heights and thus smaller impact. on emission rates.

TI  - A High-Precision Water Body Extraction Method Based On Improved Lightweight U-Net
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - The rapid, accurate extraction of water body information is critical for water resource management and disaster assessment. Its data foundation was mostly provided by remote sensing images through deep learning methods. However, the methods still require the improvement of recognition accuracy and reduction of model size. As a solution, this paper proposed a new high-precision convolutional neural network for water body extraction. This network's structural design is based on the assumption that the extraction effect of a convolutional neural network is independent from its parameters number, thus the recognition effect could be effectively improved through reasonable adjustment of the network structure according to characteristics of water bodies on high-resolution remote sensing images. It brings two critical improvements. Firstly, the number of downsampling layers was reduced to adapt to the low resolution of remote sensing imagery. Secondly, the bottleneck structure has also been updated to fit the decoder-encoder framework. The improved bottleneck structures were nested to ensure the transmission of water characteristics information in the model. In comparison with the other five commonly used networks, the new network has achieved the best results (average overall accuracy: 98.31\%, parameter benefit value: 0.2625), indicating the extremely high practical value of this approach.

TI  - Climate Change Planning: Soil Carbon Regulating Ecosystem Services And Land Cover Change Analysis To Inform Disclosures For The State Of Rhode Island, Usa
JO  - LAWS
PY  - 2021
AB  - The state of Rhode Island (RI) has established its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals, which require rapidly acquired and updatable science-based data to make these goals enforceable and effective. The combination of remote sensing and soil information data can estimate the past and model future GHG emissions because of conversion of "low disturbance" land covers (e.g., evergreen forest, hay/pasture) to "high disturbance" land covers (e.g., low-, medium-, and high-intensity developed land). These modeled future emissions can be used as a predevelopment potential GHG emissions information disclosure. This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for RI by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. Obtained results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions and show their patterns which are often associated with existing urban developments. These remote sensing tools could be used by the state of RI to both understand the nature of land cover change and likely GHG emissions from soil and to institute mandatory or voluntary predevelopment assessments and potential GHG emissions disclosures as a part of a climate mitigation policy.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithm
JO  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
PY  - 2022
AB  - Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005 Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These machine learning models are innovative and can assess environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI, Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5\%), 0.893 (89.3\%), and 0.790 (79.0\%), respectively. Based on the three machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895, and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers. Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and infrastructural areas.

TI  - Improvement Of Human-Induced Wildfire Occurrence Modeling From A Spatial Variation Of Anthropogenic Ignition Factor In The Clm5
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Wildfire is an essential form of natural disturbance for the Earth system, and it is challenging for the current numerical models to accurately retrieve the spatiotemporal distributions of wildfire occurrence. One of the deficiencies could result from the parameterization of anthropogenic impact on wildfire occurrences. This study develops an approach to advance human-induced wildfire modeling by calibrating the parameter of human ignition count (HIC) in the fire module of the Community Land Model version 5. This study modifies the source code to allow a grid-scale variation of HIC. Sensitivity experiments with different grid-uniform HIC values are conducted to quantify the model biases with satellite-based observation data as the reference. The theoretically optimal HIC for each grid is obtained by linear rescaling the HIC based on the model biases in the sensitivity tests. The model evaluation takes place in southwest China where there is complex terrain and land use/land cover features. The involvement of grid-scale HIC significantly reduces the model bias in the climatology of wildfire occurrence. The pattern correlation coefficient increases from 0.57 to 0.78, and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreases from 0.58 to 0.18. The correlation coefficient of the annual sums of wildfire occurrences increases from 0.69 to 0.77, and the RMSE decreases from 560.8 to 146.4. A global-scale test verifies that such an approach can be extended to multiple regions with a reasonable scale of population density and economy.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution And Driving Mechanism Of Aerosol Optical Depth In The Ebinur Lake Basin
JO  - Huanjing Kexue/Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the attenuation of light by aerosols and reflects the degree of regional air pollution to some extent. This study was based on the data from the long-term sequence MOD09A1 from 2000 to 2015 and the generation of a lookup table using the deep blue algorithm (DB) to perform AOD remote sensing estimation on the Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data from the Ebinur Lake Basin to analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of AOD in the Ebinur Lake Basin and to perform an AOD prediction and factor contribution ranking using the random forest model (RF) combined with environmental variables. The results showed that: ① AOD of Ebinur Lake Basin has significant seasonal variation characteristics, and the AOD values were spring (0.414)>summer (0.390)>autumn (0.287), with the largest variation in spring. ② The AOD average of the Ebinur Lake Basin was 0.374, and the interannual variation as a whole showed an upward trend. However, the AOD increased rapidly during 2010-2015, with an interannual increase of 32.32%, which indicated increasing air pollution in the basin over the past 15 years, especially the past five years. ③ The spatial distribution of AOD in the Ebinur Lake Basin was stepped up from the north to the south of Lake Ebinur. In this area, the pollution in Jinghe County was the most prominent, and the AOD value reached 0.483. ④ The RF model had a good predictive effect on AOD, R2=0.866, RMSE=0.042, and evapotranspiration had the most significant effect on AOD in the Ebinur Lake basin. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Evaluating Algeria’s Social And Economic Development Using A Series Of Night-Time Light Images Between 1992 To 2012
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - After social and economic problems, Algeria regained its night-time light (NL) brightness as this analysis of space-borne images shows. We evaluate the advancement of artificial light sources and the socioeconomic development between 1992 to 2012 for all 48 provinces. Image calibration improved the consistency and comparability of the DMSP-OLS data. Light detected from gas flaring has been separated to focus on light from human settlements. We then estimated the relationship between night-time light and selected socioeconomic parameters (SEP). Night-time light growth (NLG) and night-time light annual growth (NLAG) indices are calculated at the national, regional and provincial level. Considering the Oil price crash and the Algerian Civil Concord, we take a detailed look at these historic events in Algeria. Our main findings are: (A) The total night-time light (TNL) for human settlements grew nationwide by 128%, (B) night-time light data correlates with socioeconomic parameters such as population, and electric power consumption, (C) the oil price crash resulted in slower night-time light growth, while the Algerian Civil Concord and the end of the crises led to increased TNL, (D) because of government investment, the High Plateaus are the fastest growing region since the end of the crises, (E) space-borne night-time light data can consistently fill the information gap when data from official sources are not available. Government and policy-making bodies may benefit from the presented findings allowing them to oversee and address provincial inequalities and economic development. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Geostatistical Approach To Assess Mangrove Spatial Variability: A Bi-Decadal Scenario Over Raigarh Coast Of Maharashtra
JO  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
PY  - 2021
AB  - The present study aims at assessing the bi-decadal scenario related to the spatial variability of Mangroves over Raigarh district by adopting Geostatistical approach. Landsat TM/OLI data for the year 2000 and 2019 were employed for the study. Methodology adopted, involve computation and plotting of Semi-variogram (in 'R') with NDVI data, which was extracted for 28 homogeneous mangrove patches. These patches, based on similarity of Semi-variogram components, were further classified into clusters. Semi-variogram pattern for the year 2000 revealed a low range and high sill, indicating greater variation in the dataset that was correlated for a shorter distance. While in the year 2019, the Semi-variogram obtained for the same mangrove patches, exhibited high range and low sill. This clearly indicates a high spatial correlation associated with relatively low variation within the data. During the year 2019, some patches have shown evidences of exponential growth of mangroves that were represented by higher NDVI values, which were more similar, correlated and dependent. Overall rise in NDVI value indicates that the health status of mangroves has increased in 2019 along with natural expansion of mangrove colony. Over bi-decadal time span, mangrove ecology has also improved corresponding to higher NIR reflectance. The present research can be implemented to mangrove management and conservation purpose as this technique reveals the spatial dependency in the dataset.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Landslides are one of the most frequent natural disasters in Kodaikkanal, India, triggered by the heavy rainfall in the region. There are many techniques to assess landslide susceptibility. This study uses a bivariate probabilistic analysis and entropy index to assess the susceptibility of landslides in the study area using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remotely sensed data. Tevankarai stream sub-watershed of Kodaikkanal is delineated to apply the model and study the influence of various environmental factors on landslide susceptibility. Six environmental factors - slope, aspect, curvature, weathering, soil and land use are extracted from the spatial database constructed using remotely sensed data and topographic maps. These factors are analyzed in relation to the existing landslide database and weight for each factor is determined using the entropy values and information coefficient. The landslide susceptibility map, prepared using this technique is reclassified into five classes showing very low to very high susceptibility classes for planning purposes. This map is validated using a temporal landslide data-set. Landslide density index (R index) increases with the increase in the susceptibility class indicating the acceptability of the landslide susceptibility map generated using this technique. Very high susceptible class pictures the strain of rapid urbanization.

TI  - Analysis Of Regional Economic Development Based On Remote Sensing Images
PY  - 2018
AB  - As the carrier of economic activities, land resource is an indispensable production factor of economic development. Economic growth leads to increased demand for land and changes in land utilization form. Therefore, changes in land use and land cover can reflect regional economic development situations to some extent. This paper proposed a method to predict regional economic situations based on remote sensing images, in which land use and land cover data is extracted by remote sensing images classification. Taking Zhoushan City as study area, the land use and land cover information from 2000 to 2015 was obtained through Landsat satellite images and then was used to construct regional economic development prediction models for 7 economic indexes. The results showed that the prediction errors of gross domestic product, products of primary industry, products of secondary industry, products of tertiary industry, fixed assets investment, gross output value of fisheries, and total tourist income are 7.8\%, 9.11\%, 6.93\%, 7.74\%, 15.31\%, 7.29\%, 11.76\%, respectively.

TI  - Remote Sensing Of Chlorophyll-A Concentrations In Coastal Oceans Of The Greater Bay Area In China: Algorithm Development And Long-Term Changes
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Extensive human activities and climate change in recent decades have triggered severe eutrophication problems in the coastal oceans in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China. However, a comprehensive characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns of chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha, a major indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in this region is not available. Our study attempts to fill this gap by using long-term satellite observations. With massive in situ datasets from underway sampling systems, we developed a novel hybrid Chl-alpha retrieval algorithm combining the recalibrated OC3 and line-height-based (BL443) algorithms for waters with different turbidity levels. Satellite-retrieved Chl-alpha values with the hybrid algorithm agreed well with in situ measurements, with an uncertainty level of 33.8 \%. Long-term analysis revealed significant decreasing trends over the inner Pearl River Estuary (averaged at 0.054 mu g/L yr(-1)), while significant increasing trends were found in eastern Daya Bay (averaged at 0.035 mu g/L yr(-1)). The developed algorithm is expected to aid routine Chl-alpha monitoring in the adjacent oceans of the GBA, and the long-term datasets here can serve as critical information for further coastal conservation and management efforts.

TI  - Mapping The Location And Extent Of 2019 Prevent Planting Acres In South Dakota Using Remote Sensing Techniques
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - The inability of a farmer to plant an insured crop by the policy's final planting date can pose financial challenges for the grower and cause reduced production for a widely impacted region. Prevented planting is primarily caused by excess moisture or rainfall such as the catastrophic flooding and widespread conditions that prevented active field work in the midwestern region of United States in 2019. While the Farm Service Agency reports the number of such "prevent plant" acres each year at the county scale, field-scale maps of prevent plant fields-which would enable analyses related to assessing and mitigating the impact of climate on agriculture-are not currently available. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a method for mapping likely prevent plant fields based on flood mapping and historical cropland maps. We focused on a study region in eastern South Dakota and created flood maps using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 images from 2018 and 2019. We used automatic threshold-based change detection using NDVI and NDWI to accentuate changes likely caused by flooding. The NDVI change detection map showed vegetation loss in the eastern parts of the study area while NDWI values showed increased water content, both indicating possible flooding events. The VH polarization of Sentinel 1 was also particularly useful in identifying potential flooded areas as the VH values for 2019 were substantially lower than those of 2018, especially in the northern part of the study area, likely indicating standing water or reduced biomass. We combined the flood maps from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 to form a complete flood likelihood map over the entire study area. We intersected this flood map with a map of fallow pixels extracted from the Cropland Data Layer to produce a map of predicted prevent plant acres across several counties in South Dakota. The predicted figures were within 10\% error of Farm Service Agency reports, with low errors in the most affected counties in the state such as Beadle, Hanson, and Hand.

TI  - Association Between Canine Malignant Lymphoma, Living In Industrial Areas, And Use Of Chemicals By Dog Owners
JO  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE
PY  - 2001
AB  - A case-control study was carried out to determine whether residential exposure to environmental pollutants increased risk for canine lymphoma in pet dugs. One hundred one cases with cyctologically or histologically confirmed lymphoma diagnosed at a veterinary teaching hospital between the middle of 1996 and the middle of 1998 were examined. Controls were obtained by choosing twice the number of dogs without neoplastic disease. with overlapping distributions of province of residence, age, sex. and breed. Information regarding animal management. residence type, professional or hobby use of chemicals by owners, and treatment with herbicides or other pesticides in the area li frequently visited by the dogs was obtained with a multiple-choice questionnaire by telephone interview. Two variables were positively and independently associated with the disease. namely residency in industrial areas (odds ratio {[}OR]: = 8.5: 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]. 2.3-30.9) and use of chemicals by owners, specifically paints or solvents (OR = 4.6: 95\% CI. 1.7-12.6). A significantly lower value of the mean apr of disease onset was found in the group of dogs at risk in comparison with the group of all other dogs (6.1 +/- 0.4 years, n = 36 versus 7.5 +/- 0.4 years. n = 65, respectively; P = .008). Variables describing animal care and pesticide use were either not associated with the disease or were uninformative. We suggest that canine lymphoma may be considered a sentinel of potentially hazardous situations for humans, because of the relatively short latency between exposure and disease onset.

TI  - Evaporative Fluxes And Surface Soil Moisture Retrievals In A Mediterranean Setting From Sentinel-3 And The “Simplified Triangle”
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2020
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) makes it possible to obtain information on key parameters characterizing interactions among Earth’s system components, such as evaporative fraction (EF) and surface soil moisture (SSM). Notably, techniques utilizing EO data of land surface temperature (Ts) and vegetation index (VI) have shown promise in this regard. The present study investigates, for the first time, the accuracy of one such technique, known as the “simplified triangle”, using Sentinel-3 EO data, acquired for 44 days in 2018 at three savannah FLUXNET sites in Spain. The technique was found to be able to predict both EF and SSM with reasonable accuracy when compared to collocated ground measurements. Comparisons performed for all days together showed relatively low Root Mean square Difference (RMSD) for both EF (0.191) and SSM (0.012 cm3 cm−3) and good correlation coefficients (R) of 0.721 and 0.577, respectively. Both EF and SSM were also largely in agreement with land cover and seasonal variability. The present study comprises the first detailed assessment of the “simplified triangle”, in this case, using Sentinel-3 data and in a Mediterranean setting. Findings, albeit preliminary, are of significant value regarding the use of the investigated technique as a tool of environmental management, and towards ongoing, worldwide efforts aiming at developing operationally relevant products based on the Ts/VI feature space and EO data based on new satellites such as Sentinel-3. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - First Results Of Prisma Satellite Data Applied To Water Quality Monitoring In Argentina
JO  - 2022 IEEE Biennial Congress of Argentina, ARGENCON 2022
PY  - 2022
AB  - Water has historically been considered a renewable resource, however in the last century a sustained degradation of its quality has been observed, both in continental and oceanic systems due to anthropic impact. In this context, the management of water resources by satellite technology represents a central point in public policies since they allow anticipating and adapting to these disturbances. In this work, Sentinel 2-MSI multispectral and PRISMA hyperspectral sensors are used to carry out an analysis of different optical water types in North-East of Argentina. Convolutional procedure was used to compare sensors responses for atmospheric corrected products and RMSE (root mean square error), BIAS and MAE (mean absolute error) metrics were used to assess their performance. Differences below 1 percent were obtained in all cases, indicating an excellent match-up between both sensors. From hyperspectral PRISMA data it was possible to detect quantitative shift towards reddish wavelengths as turbidity of Parana River increases along a transect as well as an increase of the peak value in magnitude. This work opens new opportunities to monitor water quality changes related to optical constituents with deeper details in space and time in highly urbanized and perturbed regions. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Decadal Reanalysis Of Biogeochemical Indicators And Fluxes In The North West European Shelf-Sea Ecosystem
JO  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper presents the first decadal reanalysis simulation of the biogeochemistry of the North West European shelf, along with a full evaluation of its skill, confidence, and value. An error-characterized satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10 ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity, and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\% confidence level. These results indicate that the reanalysis output data set can inform the management of the North West European shelf ecosystem, in relation to eutrophication, fishery, and variability of the carbon cycle.

TI  - Drought Pattern Assessment Over Marathwada, India Through The Development Of Multivariate Advance Drought Response Index
PY  - 2022
AB  - The intensity and frequency with which recent drought events are occurring has made management of food and water a challenge. The situation in Indian subcontinent is no difference. The presented study takes inspiration from such problems to propose a remote sensing based multivariate advance drought response index (ADRI). The proposed multivariate index takes into consideration long term conditions of precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness temperature and soil moisture in a linear way for 8-day drought assessment over drought affected Marathwada region, Maharashtra, India. A value of 33 corresponding to ADRI was found to be normal condition over two decades which corresponds to normal vegetation condition index (VCI) value of 51.1 and 54.2. The last 7 years shows a consistent pattern in the change of regional ADRI values which suggests the years in which agricultural assistance is needed over the region. Drought over the region is found to shift from central to eastern and northern regions in the last 5 years. Temporal analysis for the duration suggests up to 5 percent of the area of Marathwada has been facing severe drought conditions over the last decade while up to 70 percent of the area is experience below normal conditions with varying intensities of water stress. The districts of Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli and Nanded which are downstream river Godavari have been affected the most due to large percentage of land being under agriculture.

TI  - A Typhoon Center Location Method On Satellite Images Based On Deep Reinforcement Learning
JO  - Chinese Control Conference, CCC
PY  - 2021
AB  - The location of the typhoon center is a key technology for analyzing and forecasting typhoons as well as reducing typhoon disasters. Varied patterns, blurred borders, and uncertain centers of the typhoons in the satellite images make the task challenging. In this work, a method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to locate the typhoon center. It turns the problem of typhoon center locating into an issue of searching and views the process of searching for the typhoon center as a series of Markov Decision Processes. Specifically, the agent learns to move and reduce a search box using simple transformation actions to make the search box center close to the typhoon center. Meanwhile, discriminant rules for detecting typhoons are designed based on the relationship of selected action and its value function. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can complete the locating of typhoons of different grades and types in about 16 steps. The recall of the proposed method increases with the typhoon level and reaches 100% at grade 5 and 6, and the average precision reaches 91.85%. The proposed method can effectively locate typhoon centers in different forms with a mean absolute error of 0.265°, which is superior to the comparison algorithms. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

TI  - A Novel Forecasting Model For Wind Speed Assessment Using Sentinel Family Satellites Images And Machine Learning Method
JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2021
AB  - Wind energy produced in near and offshore farms is constantly increasing, mainly thanks to the use of new technologies and the economic costs decrease. Data coming from satellites recently launched can be effectively used in near and offshore areas for wind speed mapping, and long and short-term analyses of wind regimes. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence methods is constantly increasing for predicting wind energy production. In this framework, a new forecasting model for wind speed assessment is presented integrating Sentinel satellite imagery analysis, in two phases using multi-sensor satellites, and machine learning methods. In the first step, wind speed and bathymetry have been analysed by means of sentinel-1 (S-1) and sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites images, respectively. Furthermore, a hybrid forecasting model has been proposed to assess and predict wind speed. The machine learning model consists of an integrated model using generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The new developed method has been then applied to assess wind energy potential around the Favignana island in Sicily, Italy. The results show that all the important primary parameters for a wind farm installations potential analysis, such as wind speed, water depth, and distance to the shoreline can be successfully analysed in a possible short time and freely. The following results have been obtained testing the new method: i) S-1 and S-2 satellite images have good potential for near and offshore wind speed assessment and bathymetry detection around Favignana island, ii) the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the proposed forecasting model using the whole dataset are 0.0205, 0.0159, and 6.8385 respectively, iii) the proposed forecasting model for wind speed has higher accuracy than other valid models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessing The Impact Of Urbanization On Urban Climate By Remote Sensing Perspective: A Case Study In Danang City, Vietnam
PY  - 2015
AB  - Urban climate, one of the challenges of human being in 21 century, is known as the results of land use/cover transformation. Its characteristics are distinguished by different varieties of climatic conditions in comparison with those of less built-up areas. The alterations lead to "Urban Heat Island", in which temperature in urban places is higher than surrounding environment. This happens not only in mega cities but also in less urbanized sites. The results determine the change of land use/cover and land surface temperature in Danang city by using multi-temporal Landsat and ASTER data for the period of 1990-2009. Based on the supervised classification method of maximum likelihood algorithm, satellite images in 1990, 2003, 2009 were classified into five classes: water, forest, shrub, agriculture, barren land and built-up area. For accuracy assessment, the error metric tabulations of mapped classes and reference classes were made. The Kappa statistics, derived from error matrices, were over 80\% for all of land use maps. An comparison change detection algorithm was made in three intervals, 1990-2003, 2003-2009 and 1990-2009. The results showed that built-up area increased from 8.95\% to 17.87\% between 1990 and 2009, while agriculture, shrub and barren decreased from 12.98\% to 7.53\%, 15.72\% to 9.89\% and 3.88\% to 1.77\% due to urbanization that resulted from increasing of urban population and economic development, respectively. Land surface temperature (LST) maps were retrieved from thermal infrared bands of Landsat and ASTER data. The result indicated that the temperature in study area increased from 39 degrees C to 41 degrees C for the period of 1990-2009. Our analysis showed that built-up area had the highest LST values, whereas water bodies had the least LST. This study is expected to be useful for decision makers to make an appropriate land use planning which can mitigate the effect to urban climate.

TI  - Scenario Analysis For The San Pedro River, Analyzing Hydrological Consequences Of A Future Environment
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2004
AB  - Studies of future management and policy options based on different assumptions provide a mechanism to examine possible Outcomes and especially their likely benefits and consequences. The San Pedro River in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico is an area that has undergone rapid changes in land use and cover, and subsequently is facing keen environmental crises related to water resources. It is the location of a number of studies that have dealt with change analysis, watershed condition, and most recently, alternative futures analysis. The previous work has dealt primarily with resources of habitat, visual quality, and groundwater related to urban development patterns and preferences. In the present study, previously defined future scenarios, in the form of land-use/land-cover grids, were examined relative to their impact on surface-water conditions (e.g., surface runoff and sediment yield). These hydrological outputs were estimated for the baseline year of 2000 and predicted twenty years in the future as a demonstration of how new geographic information system-based hydrologic modeling tools can be used to evaluate the spatial impacts of urban growth patterns on surface-water hydrology.

TI  - Scaling Up The Use Of Remote Patient Monitoring In Canada
JO  - Studies in Health Technology and Informatics
PY  - 2015
AB  - Evidence supporting the use of remote patient monitoring (RPM) as a cost-effective means of keeping patients from being re-admitted to hospitals or making repeated emergency department visits is growing, especially for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). A recent study funded by Canada Health Infoway, titled Connecting Patients with Providers: A Pan-Canadian Study on Remote Patient Monitoring, aimed to assess the current state of RPM solutions; to examine the evidence for patient and health system benefits achieved both in Canada and internationally; and to determine the critical success factors needed to support further investment and scaling-up of RPM solutions across the Canadian health care system. Break-even analysis of four different implementations reviewed in this study demonstrated that RPM programs can be viable and sustainable for large and small jurisdictions; however, more evidence is needed with regards to a number of potential applications for RPM beyond the management of COPD and CHF. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

TI  - Integrated Applications Of Gis And Remote Sensing For Monitoring The Land-Use Changes In Thaton District Of Mon State Between 1993 And 1997
PY  - 2000
AB  - This research study is based on integrated applications of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. These applications have proved to have immense potential for upgrading the living standard of human society as a whole. One of the examples is the provision of unique solutions for achieving global communication even into remote areas. Moreover, storm-tracking radar and meteorological satellites are regularly utilized for more accurate weather forecasting and cyclone prediction. On the other hand, remote sensing satellites are providing value-added information for the management of disasters such as storms and floods. As GIS and remote sensing are important tools for natural resource management and environment monitoring, they have become an integral part in planning sustainable development worldwide. Myanmar is still well endowed with natural resources, such as forests, fertile lands, abundant fresh water and rich minerals. For systematic and fruitful exploitation and utilization of these natural resources on a sustainable basis, applications of GIS and remote sensing are essential in different fields of natural resource management and environment monitoring in Myanmar. In this context, GIS and remote sensing are important decision-supporting tools.

TI  - Modelling Urban Cooling Island Impact Of Green Space And Water Bodies On Surface Urban Heat Island In A Continuously Developing Urban Area
JO  - Modeling Earth Systems and Environment
PY  - 2018
AB  - Urban areas are most affected by the adverse environmental impacts such as urban microclimate change in the form of urban heat island effect (UHI) which results into the urban health degradation. For this concern, mitigation of UHI gains more attention to the urban researchers. The spatial pattern of green spaces have an important impact on urban heat island mitigation also existing green spaces and water bodies can play an important role to reduce the urban heat island intensity. This study tries to find out the changing behaviour of land surface temperature in respect to change in land use types. This Study found a significant relationship between green space composition and configuration on mitigating increasing temperature of the whole study area And also identify the impact of individual green space and water body configuration in mitigating urban heat island effect. To assess the impact of green spaces and water bodies on Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), land use land cover map is prepared using unsupervised classification method, NDVI and NDWI and land surface temperature is also calculated. Extraction of land surface temperature values is performed and impact of green space and water body is assessed using different graphs. Results of this study suggest that green space is more effective in SUHI mitigation than the water bodies. Green space can control 1 °C temperature minimization for a 150–180 m distance from green space boundary and elongated shaped green space can control 1 °C temperature drop for more areas than the circular green spaces and irregular shaped green spaces and water bodies play more important role in mitigating SUHI effect than regular shaped green spaces and water bodies. Results of this study can be used for future urban planning for minimizing SUHI impact for certain areas by considering the size and the shape of the plant green spaces and water bodies for adopting increasing SUHI impact of the highly urbanized areas. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.
