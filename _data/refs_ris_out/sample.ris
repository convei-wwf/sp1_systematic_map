TI  - Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Based Crop Classification Using A Hybrid 3d-2d Cnn Model
JO  - Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering
PY  - 2021
AB  - Reliable and accurate classification of crop types can greatly contribute to data sources in agricultural monitoring and food security. Remote sensing can be used to rapidly and accurately extract the planting areas and distribution of main crops, thereby optimizing the spatial pattern of crops, grain production, and management. However, it is extremely difficult to identify and then map different types of crops with high accuracy and efficiency, especially for traditional machine learning. The reason is that there are highly complex and heterogeneous spectral data in crop space on time-series remote sensing images. Fortunately, three-dimensional convolution neural networks (3D CNN) are suitable for the spatio-temporal information in the time-series remote sensing imagery. Nevertheless, the high complexity of the 3D CNN model often requires a large number of training samples. In this study, a novel hybrid classification model (called 3D-2D CNN) was proposed to integrate 3D CNN and two-dimensional convolution neural networks (2D CNN) in the trade-off among accuracy, efficiency, and ground sample acquisition. The specific procedure was as follows. The spatio-temporal features were first extracted from the multiple 3D convolutional layers, then the output features were compressed for the spatial feature analysis in the 2D convolutional layer, and finally the high-level maps of features were flattened to predict the category in the fully connected layer. Batch normalization was performed on the input data of each layer to accelerate the network convergence. As such, the complex structure of the original 3D CNN was reduced, while the capacity of 3D-2D CNN remained in spatio-temporal feature extraction. Taking northern California, USA, as the study area, Landsat8 multi-temporal images were utilized as the remote sensing data source in the test to verify the model. Landsat images presented specific characteristics, compared with the natural. The spectral and texture features of the same type varied greatly along with the imaging time and conditions. California agricultural investigation was used as sampling data. Accordingly, the land plots in the study area were randomly divided into a training, validation, and test region, according to 2:2:6 stratification, where the training and validation sample datasets were randomly selected. Since the overflow easily occurred, when the training dataset was limited in actual work, it was necessary for the deep learning model to require a large number of data samples to train a CNN. Correspondingly, two small sample sets of different proportions were randomly selected from the training sample set of 50% and 25% to verify the feasibility of the model. The trained models were then used to predict the test region. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy (89.38%), macro-average F1 value (84.21%), and Kappa coefficient (0.881) of 3D-2D CNN for 13 crop classifications performed better than other deep learning, including 3D CNN and 2D CNN, as well as traditional machine learning, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). It should be mentioned that the proposed 3D-2D CNN also achieved the best performance in the small training set, where the highest recognition rate of classification was obtained, compared with the benchmark models. Meanwhile, the convergence time of 3D-2D CNN was reduced greatly, compared with the 3D CNN, thanks to a significant reduction of parameters. It was found that there was a greater effect of temporal features of crops that were hidden in multi-temporal remote sensing imagery on CNN classification, compared with texture features. Consequently, the highest accuracy and strongest robustness were obtained in the 3D-2D CNN model, due mainly to the comprehensive utilization of spatial-temporal-spectrum features. The finding can provide a highly effective and novel solution to crop classification from multi-temporal remote sensing. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Modelling Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery In Portugal
JO  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2011
AB  - Wildfires in Mediterranean Europe have been increasing in number and extension over the last decades and constitute one of the major disturbances of these ecosystems. Portugal is the country with more burnt area in the last decade and the years of 2003 and 2005 were particularly devastating, the total burned areas of 425 000 and 338 000 ha being several times higher than the corresponding average. The year of 2005 further coincided with one of the most severe droughts since early 20th century. Due to different responses of vegetation to diverse fire regimes and to the complexity of landscape structures, fires have complex effects on vegetation recovery. Remote sensing has revealed to be a powerful tool in studying vegetation dynamics and in monitoring post-fire vegetation recovery, which is crucial to land-management and to prevent erosion. The main goals of the present work are (i) to assess the accuracy of a vegetation recovery model previously developed by the authors; (ii) to assess the model's performance, namely its sensitivity to initial conditions, to the temporal length of the input dataset and to missing data; (iii) to study vegetation recovery over two selected areas that were affected by two large wildfire events in the fire seasons of 2003 and 2005, respectively. The study relies on monthly values of NDVI over 11 years (1998-2009), at 1 kmx1 km spatial resolution, as obtained by the VEGETATION instrument. According to results from sensitivity analysis, the model is robust and able to provide good estimations of recovery times of vegetation when the regeneration process is regular, even when missing data is present. In respect to the two selected burnt scars, results indicate that fire damage is a determinant factor of regeneration, as less damaged vegetation recovers more rapidly, which is mainly justified by the high coverage of Pinus pinaster over the area, and by the fact that coniferous forests tend to recover slower than transitional woodland-shrub, which tend to dominate the areas following the fire event.

TI  - Combining Deep Semantic Edge And Object Segmentation For Large-Scale Roof-Part Polygon Extraction From Ultrahigh-Resolution Aerial Imagery
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2022
AB  - The roofscape plays a vital role in the support of sustainable urban planning and development. However, availability of detailed and up-to-date information on the level of individual roof-part topology remains a bottleneck for reliable assessment of its present status and future potential. Motivated by the need for automation, the current state-of-the-art focuses on applying deep learning techniques for roof-plane segmentation from light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, but fails to deliver on criteria such as scalability, spatial predictive continuity, and vectorization for use in geographic information systems (GISs). Therefore, this paper proposes a fully automated end-to-end workflow capable of extracting large-scale continuous polygon maps of roof-part instances from ultra-high-resolution (UHR) aerial imagery. In summary, the workflow consists of three main steps: (1) use a multitask fully convolutional network (FCN) to infer semantic roof-part edges and objects, (2) extract distinct closed shapes given the edges and objects, and (3) vectorize to obtain roof-part polygons. The methodology is trained and tested on a challenging dataset comprising of UHR aerial RGB orthoimagery (0.03 m GSD) and LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) (0.25 m GSD) of three Belgian urban areas (including the famous touristic city of Bruges). We argue that UHR optical imagery may provide a competing alternative for this task over classically used LiDAR data, and investigate the added value of combining these two data sources. Further, we conduct an ablation study to optimize various components of the workflow, reaching a final panoptic quality of 54.8% (segmentation quality = 87.7%, recognition quality = 62.6%). In combination with human validation, our methodology can provide automated support for the efficient and detailed mapping of roofscapes. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Protected Areas Do Not Fulfil The Wintering Habitat Needs Of The Trans-Saharan Migratory Montagu's Harrier
JO  - Biological Conservation
PY  - 2012
AB  - Populations of migratory birds can be affected by events happening at both breeding and wintering grounds. The Sahel is a vast region holding a large number of wintering trans-Saharan migratory European birds, and current land-use changes there may represent a threat for these species. We used satellite tracking data from the migratory Montagu's harrier to evaluate habitat use of the species during the wintering season, and whether the current network of protected areas is effective to provide their habitat needs during that season. We also developed an ecological niche model for the species in Western-Central Sahel to check if the most suitable sites are included within current protected areas. Tracked harriers occupied a large region encompassing a total of eight countries. The most preferred habitats during winter were croplands and some natural vegetation habitats, especially grasslands. Protected areas only covered a small proportion of the overall wintering grounds of tracked harriers and the most suitable areas for the species in Western-Central Sahel. Increasing the extent of preferred natural habitats within protected areas should benefit the conservation of this and probably other insect-eating raptors. However, substantial increases in extent and number of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa are very unlike to occur. Conservation actions in the region should therefore be mostly focused on improving land use planning and management outside protected areas, specially enhancing agricultural practices to make biodiversity conservation compatible with poverty alleviation. These can be chiefly targeted at an area of <20,000km 2 of very suitable habitat for these species. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Model-Evaluation Tools For Three-Dimensional Cloud Verification Via Spaceborne Active Sensors
JO  - Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Clouds posemany operational hazards to the aviation community in terms of ceilings and visibility, turbulence, and aircraft icing. Realistic descriptions of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution and temporal evolution of clouds in numerical weather prediction models used for flight planning and routing are therefore of central importance. The introduction of satellite-based cloud radar (CloudSat) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) sensors to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration A-Train is timely in light of these needs but requires a new paradigm of model-evaluation tools that are capable of exploiting the vertical-profile information. Early results from the National Center for Atmospheric Research Model Evaluation Toolkit (MET), augmented to work with the emergent satellite-based active sensor observations, are presented here. Existing horizontal-plane statistical evaluation techniques have been adapted to operate on observations in the vertical plane and have been extended to 3D object evaluations, leveraging blended datasets from the active and passive A-Train sensors. Case studies of organized synoptic-scale and mesoscale distributed cloud systems are presented to illustrate themultiscale utility of theMET tools.Definition of objects on the basis of radar-reflectivity thresholds was found to be strongly dependent on the model's ability to resolve details of the cloud's internal hydrometeor distribution. Contoured-frequency-by-altitude diagrams provide a useful mechanism for evaluating the simulated and observed 3D distributions for regional domains. The expanded MET provides a new dimension to model evaluation and positions the community to better exploit active-sensor satellite observing systems that are slated for launch in the near future. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Towards An Integrated Observational System To Investigate Sediment Transport In The Tidal Inlets Of The Lagoon Of Venice
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2022
AB  - An observation system integrating satellite images, in situ water parameters and hydrodynamic measurements was implemented in a tidal inlet of the Venice Lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). The experimental infrastructure was developed to autonomously investigate suspended sediment dynamics in the two channels of the Lido inlet in relation to the longshore currents in the littoral zone and the tidal circulation along the lagoon channel network. It provided time series of turbidity at the surface, water flow and acoustic backscatter, which was converted into turbidity along the vertical column during different tidal phases and meteo-marine conditions. Accurate turbidity maps were derived from Sentinel-2 (Copernicus) and Landsat 8 (NASA) satellites. Long-term in situ data from field surveys enabled the calibration and intercalibration of the instrumental setup and validation of satellite-derived products. Time series from the instrumental network were analyzed in order to evaluate the temporal variability of suspended sediment in relation to tidal phases and the different meteo-marine conditions. The integration of available datasets with satellite images also permitted the testing of the methodology for a 3-D reconstruction of the suspended sediment pattern in calm sea conditions, under the effect of the sole hydrodynamical forcing. Remotely sensed data provide a synoptic distribution of turbidity in the inlet area allowing the analysis of the surficial patterns of suspended sediment and the inferring of information on the transport processes at different spatial scales. In calm sea conditions, the results show that the transport is driven by tidal currents with a net seaward transport related to a larger export of materials from the northern basin of the Lagoon of Venice. During typical northeasterly storms, materials mobilized on the beaches and in the shoreface are transported into the inlet and distributed into the lagoon channel network, following the flood tidal currents and determining net import of materials. The multitude of information provided by this system can support research on aquatic science (i.e., numerical simulations) and address end-user community practices. The ecosystem management will also benefit operational purposes, such as the monitoring of morphological transformations, erosion processes and planning of coastal defense in the future scenarios of sea level rise. The developed approach will also help to understand how the regulation of the inlet flow introduced by the operation of the flood barriers will affect the fluxes of particles and, in the long term, the lagoon morphodynamics.

TI  - Bulgaria Since 1989
JO  - Central and Southeast European Politics since 1989
PY  - 2010
AB  - As a small Balkan country on the edge of the European continent, Bulgaria attracts little international attention. It has not seen any of the violent conflicts that have troubled most of the rest of Southeastern Europe, nor has it been among the best political and economic performers in the region during the post-communist era. Nonetheless, in 2007, Bulgaria is substantially different from the Soviet satellite it was in 1989. Today, the country is a member of both NATO and the EU, and has a stable democracy and a functioning market economy.; But if Bulgaria's transition from one-party communist rule to a multi party political system was not violent, the country had difficulty in adjusting to the challenges of a free-market economic system, most of which were the result of its recent history. Prior to 1989, the country was characterized by prolonged periods of foreign domination, dependence on its trading partners in the Soviet bloc, and several non-democratic regimes, with only brief periods of democratic development. Consequently, when the political system opened up to allow for the establishment of democratic values and institutions, Bulgaria experienced numerous, and often daunting, challenges in reforming or replacing its existing political, economic, and social systems.; Despite these difficulties, the transformation of the country since 1989 has been impressive. Bulgaria's transformation consisted of three distinct, but often interrelated, processes: the dismantling of the pre-1990 one-party state, the establishment of a multiparty democracy, liberal society, and a market economy; and the gradual adoption of European norms, policies, and practices. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

TI  - Estimating Monthly Evapotranspiration By Assimilating Remotely Sensed Water Storage Data Into The Extended Budyko Framework Across Different Climatic Regions
JO  - Journal of Hydrology
PY  - 2018
AB  - The estimates of actual evapotranspiration (E) across basins and/or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land-plant-atmosphere system, even though the basic physical mechanism of E is well understood. Presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits, the Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged E at long-term scale. Given the ability of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change (ΔTWS) at monthly scale, a model to estimate E was developed based on the Budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi-years, and was applied to the estimation of E for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across China. Results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments, the positive or negative trends in precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E0), runoff (R) and ΔTWS were not statistically significant during 2003–2013 at both annual and monthly scales, but the ΔTWS occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of P into R and E at monthly scale. The monthly Budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments. The Budyko-modeled monthly E (Budyko-E) represented the GRACE-derived ones (GRACE-E) across these catchments well with both modeled E volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with GRACE-E series except some underestimation for peak E. Overall, the Budyko-E represented GRACE-E in the arid and semi-arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi-humid catchments due to the larger proportion of ΔTWS in the P partition. Among all the 24 selected catchments, the monthly Budyko-type E model represented the GRACE-E across Shixiali catchment (located in the Hai River basin) best, with the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSCE) and relative error (RE) between GRACE-E and simulated results being 0.996, 0.988, −0.033 in calibration and 0.994, 0.951, −0.111 in validation, respectively. Furthermore, using GRACE-E as the benchmark values, the Budyko-E outperformed four other global E products from the newly published Global Land Data Assimilation System with Noah Land Surface Model-2 (GLDAS_E), MODIS (MODIS_E), Japanese 25-year reanalysis product (JRA_E), and Zhang's method (Zhang_E). GLDAS_E was the best of four global E products at reproducing monthly variations, with relatively high r and NSCE values, small RE. While MODIS_E showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter-annual E variations of these catchments, which was reflected by low r and NSCE values. This extended Budyko-E model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of E estimate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Statistical Approach To Site-Specific Thresholding For Burn Severity Maps Using Bi-Temporal Landsat-8 Images
JO  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Burn severity mapping facilitates post-fire management and restoration and predicts surface erosion and landslide risk. Different severity levels are usually distinguished by fixed threshold values with remote sensing techniques. Since the climate, ecosystem, geology, and morphology control the destruction level of forest fires, site-specific class thresholds should be considered to discriminate severity classes precisely. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to produce an accurate burn severity map using spectral indices with site-specific thresholds for unburned, low, moderate and high severity classes. In this context, pre- and post-fire Landsat 8 images were used to produce bi-temporal burn severity indices such as normalized burn ratio (NBR), normalized burned index (NBI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and green optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (GOSAVI). An alternative classification method based on a statistical distribution-based clustering approach was employed on the differential indices to determine severity class thresholds. The proposed thresholds were validated by the composite burn severity index (CBI) ratings of the field sampling points. The overall classification accuracy was found to be between 50\% and 92.5\%. In addition, the results were compared with the thresholds published in the literature. Consequently, this methodology can be used as adaptive thresholding in similar ecological and morphological zone to determine the burn severity classes.

TI  - A Change Vector Analysis Method To Monitor Drought Using Landsat Data
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2019
AB  - Drought has always been a heavy financial burden on a country's economy. To mitigate the impacts of an ongoing drought, spatial information on high risk areas are required. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the areas prone to drought in order to minimize the damages through a proper management policy. To achieve this goal, the actual evapotranspiration is considered. The rate of actual evapotranspiration was measured in Najaf Abad using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) on Landsat ATM+ images. To present and test the changes in drought, the Change Vector Analysis (CVA) technique was applied to multi-temporal data to compare the differences in the time-trajectory of the tasselled cap intestines and brightness for two time periods 1995 to 2008-2008 to 2015. The images were processed using ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS Imagine 8.6&trade; software. The results indicated that the changed area is 9691.41 hectare and the unchanged is 49335.2 hectare between 1995 to 2008. The area of the changed pixels between 2008 and 2015, 3% is higher than the area of the change pixels in 1995 until 2008. In more than 3-quarter of the study area, the value of evapotranspiration has not changed. The proposed method demonstrated immense potentials in monitoring drought change dynamics especially when complemented with field studies. © 2019 R. Ebrahimian.

TI  - Analysis Of Spatial Pattern And Ecological Service Value Changes Of Large-Scale Regional Paddy Fields Based On Remote Sensing Data
JO  - Smart Agriculture
PY  - 2020
AB  - Under the pressure of economy development and climate change, rice production and distribution in the Yangtze River basin have undergone great changes, which may pose a great threat to the ecological environment and food security. Based on land use remote sensing-monitoring data from1990 to 2015, the GIS spatial analysis method was used to explore the spatial pattern variation characteristics of paddy fields in the Yangtze River economic belt. Meanwhile, Ecosystem services value (ESV) was calculated by using the equivalent factor method corrected by region and time factor to measure the comprehensive impact of paddy field change. The results showed that, to begin with, paddy fields number of the Yangtze River economic belt continued to decrease, with a total decrease of 17 390km2, and the decrease rate presented a trend of growth with significant regional differences. The difference between the reduction rate of paddy fields in the middle upper and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was about 9.56%. Among them, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the proportion of paddy fields decreased, while in the middle and upper reaches which was just the opposite. Then, paddy fields mainly flowed to construction land and water, resulting from economic construction and aquaculture development. Paddy fields chiefly came from water, dry land and wetland, etc. Furthermore, paddy fields in the Yangtze River Delta, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations changed the most dramatically. The expansion of construction land to paddy fields was widespread, and paddy fields flooded by water primarily distributed in the two lake plains. In addition, the conversion of paddy fields and other ecosystems had a positive impact on ESV, in which the paddy-water diversion type contributed the most. Its scale determined the net increase of ESV in different periods. Value loss lead by conversion from water to paddy fields was the largest, and construction land invading paddy fields was the second. The conversions in different cities were different, so the difference in ESV increases and decreases. In addition, the tradeoffs within ecosystem services were mainly between hydrological regulation, water supply and food production, gas regulation, which were directly related to the increase of water resources and the loss of paddy fields. The research results are helpful to reveal the spatio-temporal changes process of paddy fields in the Yangtze River basin and its impact on ecological functions, and provide theoretical support for regional land use planning, agricultural policy and ecological sustainable development. © 2020 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

TI  - Lunar Landing Necessary Building Blocks And Good Practices For A Sustainable Development Of Human Lunar Activities
JO  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
PY  - 2023
AB  - After almost 50 years from the last step on the Moon in 1972, Space Agencies and companies from all over the World are evaluating once again the need, potential, and benefits of human settlements on the Moon and beyond. Several spacecraft, landers, and rovers have already made their way on Earth's only natural satellite, and more will come in the coming years, followed by or in parallel with human missions, with all the related challenges and issues to overcome. At first, Human activities will target specific locations on the lunar surface, mainly driven by scientific objectives. For these missions, the landing site will necessarily be close to the target areas until a surface transport infrastructure is put in place, such as a system of transport rovers or a rail network. As the interest and involvement of public and private actors grow, and depending on their mission objectives, we will see either massive landings with multiple spacecraft involved or specific pinpointed landings with relatively small assets, to perform local analyses without the need to bring a full settlement to the location. Therefore, it is fundamental to see which resources/terrain characteristics will act as an attractor for intensive human activities with multiple landings that will need traffic management regulations. One of the objectives of our research is to analyze those potential attractors and identify key factors that would make specific locations of the Moon more suitable for landing (e.g. surface characteristics, distance from points of interest). Once defined, the following objective is to evaluate what features and services a landing site should have in order to support exploration or exploitation missions and become an efficient spaceport. In parallel, as mentioned above, all these activities on and around the Moon's surface need to be regulated and coordinated to avoid a "far west"scenario, with the related potential hazards that could affect the lunar environment, human settlements, and facilities. The last objective of our project is to evaluate and propose ideas on how future missions could be regulated, taking into account that the Moon is a different celestial body that, at the current moment, is not under any national or international significant traffic management regulation. The present abstract is submitted under the auspices of Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) Technical Unit Research for a Thriving Lunar Ecosystem (TURTLE).

TI  - Mapping The Spatial Distribution Of Winter Crops At Sub-Pixel Level Using Avhrr Ndvi Time Series And Neural Nets
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2013
AB  - For large areas, it is difficult to assess the spatial distribution and inter-annual variation of crop acreages through field surveys. Such information, however, is of great value for governments, land managers, planning authorities, commodity traders and environmental scientists. Time series of coarse resolution imagery offer the advantage of global coverage at low costs, and are therefore suitable for large-scale crop type mapping. Due to their coarse spatial resolution, however, the problem of mixed pixels has to be addressed. Traditional hard classification approaches cannot be applied because of sub-pixel heterogeneity. We evaluate neural networks as a modeling tool for sub-pixel crop acreage estimation. The proposed methodology is based on the assumption that different cover type proportions within coarse pixels prompt changes in time profiles of remotely sensed vegetation indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Neural networks can learn the relation between temporal NDVI signatures and the sought crop acreage information. This learning step permits a non-linear unmixing of the temporal information provided by coarse resolution satellite sensors. For assessing the feasibility and accuracy of the approach, a study region in central Italy (Tuscany) was selected. The task consisted of mapping the spatial distribution of winter crops abundances within 1 km AVHRR pixels between 1988 and 2001. Reference crop acreage information for network training and validation was derived from high resolution Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) images and official agricultural statistics. Encouraging results were obtained demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach. For example, the spatial distribution of winter crop acreage at sub-pixel level was mapped with a cross-validated coefficient of determination of 0.8 with respect to the reference information from high resolution imagery. For the eight years for which reference information was available, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of winter crop acreage at sub-pixel level was 10\%. When combined with current and future sensors, such as MODIS and Sentinel-3, the unmixing of AVHRR data can help in the building of an extended time series of crop distributions and cropping patterns dating back to the 80s.

TI  - Extreme Dynamic Mapping: Animals Map Themselves On The "Cloud"
PY  - 2012
AB  - Animal tracking data are routinely delivered in the form of e-mail messages with an attachment or in the main text of an e-mail that includes satellite-telemetry data provided by Argos services. Downloading these data onto a computer, transferring them into shapefiles, filtering, processing, and displaying them consumes considerable end-user time and energy. In this paper, we demonstrate that freely available "Cloud"-based services are sufficient to take over this workload and fast enough to deliver spatial data to an end-user without a considerable investment of time. The animal-generated spatial data we present come in two forms: satellite data from the Argos service and GPS data delivered as text messages using a Short Message Service (SMS). We suggest a simple mail-to-map system, which automatically archives data (coordinates, time, telemetry) and displays it dynamically on various Internet applications such as Google Maps/Google Earth or Google Graphs. We use the Gmail service to filter messages, a free blog service (e. g., blogger.com or wordpress.com) for unlimited-time data storage and the Google spreadsheets to dynamically assemble the KML (Keyhole Markup Language) files. To demonstrate the utility of our mail-to-map system, we apply the approach to two contrasting wildlife case studies-the highly endangered Steller's Sea Eagle (Haliaetus pelagicus) of northeast Asia and White-tailed Deer (Odolescens virginianus), which is ubiquitous in the eastern United States-and discuss conservation implications of the near-real-time data publication opportunities that our system provides.

TI  - Deep Learning Forecasts Of Soil Moisture: Convolutional Neural Network And Gated Recurrent Unit Models Coupled With Satellite-Derived Modis, Observations And Synoptic-Scale Climate Index Data
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Remotely sensed soil moisture forecasting through satellite-based sensors to estimate the future state of the underlying soils plays a critical role in planning and managing water resources and sustainable agricultural practices. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) hybrid models (i.e., CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU) are designed for daily time-step surface soil moisture (SSM) forecasts, employing the gated recurrent unit (GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). To establish the objective model's viability for SSM forecasting at multi-step daily horizons, the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model is tested at 1st, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th day ahead period by assimilating a comprehensive pool of 52 predictor dataset obtained from three distinct data sources. Data comprise satellite-derived Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) repository a global, high-temporal resolution, unique terrestrial modelling system, and ground-based variables from Scientific Information Landowners (SILO) and synoptic-scale climate indices. The results demonstrate the forecasting capability of the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model with respect to the counterpart comparative models. This is supported by a relatively lower value of the mean absolute percentage and root mean square error. In terms of the statistical score metrics and infographics employed to test the final model's utility, the proposed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU models are considerably superior compared to a standalone and other hybrid method tested on independent SSM data developed through feature selection approaches. Thus, the proposed approach can be successfully implemented in hydrology and agriculture management.

TI  - The Contribution Of The Composite Of Clinical Process Indicators As A Measure Of Hospital Performance In The Management Of Acute Coronary Syndromes-Insights From The Concordance Registry
JO  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-QUALITY OF CARE AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES
PY  - 2017
AB  - Aims Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a costly condition for health service provision yet variation in the delivery of care between hospitals persists. A composite measure of adherence with evidence-based clinical-process indicators (CPIs) could better inform hospital performance reporting and clinical outcomes in the management of ACS. Methods Data on 7444 ACS patients from 39 Australian hospitals were used to derive a hospital-specific composite quality score by calculating mean adherence to 14 evidence-based CPIs. Using the generalized estimating equation to account for clustering of patients within hospitals and the GRACE risk score to adjust for differences in presenting risk, we evaluated associations between the hospital-specific composite quality score, in-hospital major adverse events, in-hospital mortality and mortality and readmission for ACS at 6 months. Results Hospitals had a mean adherence of 68.3\% (SD 21.7) with the composite quality score. There was significant variation between hospital adherence tertile 1 (79\%) and tertile 3 (56\%), P < 0.0001. With risk adjustment, there was an association between hospitals with a higher composite quality score and reduced in-hospital adverse events (OR: 0.85, CI: 0.71-0.99) and survival at hospital discharge (OR: 0.47; 95\% CI: 0.28-0.77). There was trending improvement in survival at 6 months (OR 0.48; CI: 0.20-1.16) and fewer readmissions to hospital for ACS at 6 months (OR 0.79; CI 0.60-1.05). Conclusion The association between the quality composite score and reduced in-hospital events and survival at hospital discharge supports the utility of reporting CPIs in routine hospital performance reporting on the management of ACS.

TI  - Building Detection With Decision Fusion
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2013
AB  - A novel decision fusion approach to building detection problem in VHR optical satellite images is proposed. The method combines the detection results of multiple classifiers under a hierarchical architecture, called Fuzzy Stacked Generalization (FSG). After an initial segmentation and pre-processing step, a large variety of color, texture and shape features are extracted from each segment. Then, the segments, represented in K different feature spaces are classified by K different base-layer classifiers of the FSG architecture. The class membership values of the segments, which represent the decisions of different base-layer classifiers in a decision space, are aggregated to form a fusion space which is then fed to a meta-layer classifier of the FSG to label the vectors in the fusion space. The paper presents the performance results of the proposed decision fusion model by a comparison with the state of the art machine learning algorithms. The results show that fusing the decisions of multiple classifiers improves the performance, when they are ensembled under the suggested hierarchical learning architecture. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - A Tool For Assessing Ecological Status Of Forest Ecosystem
PY  - 2016
AB  - Managers and policy makers are beginning to appreciate the value of ecological monitoring of artificially regenerated forest especially in urban areas. With the advent of more advance technology in precision forestry, high resolution remotely sensed data e.g. hyperspectral and LiDAR are becoming available for rapid and precise assessment of the forest condition. An assessment of ecological status of forest ecosystem was developed and tested using FRIM campus forest stand. The forest consisted of three major blocks; the old growth artificially regenerated native species forests, naturally regenerated forest and recent planted forest for commercial timber and other forest products. Our aim is to assess the ecological status and its proximity to the mature old growth artificially regenerated stand. We used airborne LiDAR, orthophoto and thirty field sampling quadrats of 20x20m for ground verification. The parameter assessments were grouped into four broad categories: a. forest community level-composition, structures, function; landscape structures-road network and forest edges. A metric of parameters and rating criteria was introduced as indicators of the forest ecological status. We applied multi-criteria assessment to categorize the ecological status of the forest stand. The paper demonstrates the application of the assessment approach using FRIM campus forest as its first case study. Its potential application to both artificially and naturally regenerated forest in the variety of Malaysian landscape is discussed

TI  - Mapping Spatial Variability Of Foliar Nitrogen In Coffee (Coffea Arabica L.) Plantations With Multispectral Sentinel-2 Msi Data
JO  - ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting factor to coffee development and productivity. Therefore, development of rapid, spatially explicit and temporal remote sensing-based approaches to determine spatial variability of coffee foliar N are imperative for increasing yields, reducing production costs and mitigating environmental impacts associated with excessive N applications. This study sought to assess the value of Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands and vegetation indices in empirical estimation of coffee foliar N content at landscape level. Results showed that coffee foliar N is related to Sentinel-2 MSI B4 (R2 = 0.32), B6 (R2 = 0.49), B7 (R2 = 0.42), B8 (R2 = 0.57) and B12 (R2 = 0.24) bands. Vegetation indices were more related to coffee foliar N as shown by the Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index – IRECI (R2 = 0.66), Relative Normalized Difference Index – RNDVI (R2 = 0.48), CIRE1 (R2 = 0.28), and Normalized Difference Infrared Index – NDII (R2 = 0.37). These variables were also identified by the random forest variable optimisation as the most valuable in coffee foliar N prediction. Modelling coffee foliar N using vegetation indices produced better accuracy (R2 = 0.71 with RMSE = 0.27 for all and R2 = 0.73 with RMSE = 0.25 for optimized variables), compared to using spectral bands (R2 = 0.57 with RMSE = 0.32 for all and R2 = 0.58 with RMSE = 0.32 for optimized variables). Combining optimized bands and vegetation indices produced the best results in coffee foliar N modelling (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.23). All the three best performing models (all vegetation indices, optimized vegetation indices and combining optimal bands and optimal vegetation indices) established that 15.2 ha (4.7%) of the total area under investigation had low foliar N levels (<2.5%). This study demonstrates the value of Sentinel-2 MSI data, particularly vegetation indices in modelling coffee foliar N at landscape scale. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

TI  - Communities And Areas At Intensive Risk In The Mid-Atlantic Region: A Reanalysis Of 2011 Hurricane Irene With Future Sea Level Rise And Land Subsidence
JO  - OCEANS 2018 MTS/IEEE Charleston, OCEAN 2018
PY  - 2019
AB  - Powerful tropical cyclones along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard produce several unique coastal hazards that result from the combination of heavy inland rainfall and storm surge that accompany events ranging from strong Nor'easters to tropical storms and major hurricanes. Combined with longer-term challenges of rising sea levels attributed to coastal subsidence and steric expansion, impacts from these events are expected to increase, especially in the lower Chesapeake Bay in Portsmouth and Norfolk, VA. In 2017, NASA's Earth Science Disasters Program hosted a regional workshop to explore these issues with particular focus on coastal Virginia and North Carolina, given impacts that NASA's Langley Research Center and the community of Hampton Roads had experienced from several past events. The workshop brought together partners from academia including: Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Old Dominion University, Hampton University, George Mason University, and the University of Alabama. These universities partnered with emergency management and scientists from NASA among other partnering federal agencies to explore capabilities among the team that could improve understanding of the physical processes related to these hazards, their potential impact to these changing communities, and identify methodologies for supporting emergency response and risk mitigation. A pilot demonstration research initiative was developed to examine coastal hazards in two communities adjacent to the James River and Elizabeth River: Portsmouth, VA, and Norfolk, VA. The demonstration study examined inundation via these approaches: 1) reanalysis of impacts from 2011 Hurricane Irene, using numerical weather modeling in combination with coastal surge and hydrodynamic, urban inundation modeling to evaluate combined impact scenarios considering sea level rise, 2) remote sensing of flood extent from available optical and synthetic aperture radar useful for identifying storm impacts and as precursors for future response efforts, 3) adding value to remotely sensed flood maps through depth predictions and related efforts, and 4) examining coastal subsidence as measured through time-series analysis of synthetic aperture radar observations. This presentation will highlight outcomes of the demonstration's activities and describe a series of combined storm surge and sea level rise scenarios relative to the lower Chesapeake Bay during 2011 Hurricane Irene and the anticipated impacts of a similar strength storm in 2045. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Questionnaire Survey Of Hospitals In Saitama Prefecture Regarding The Shortage Of 99mtc-Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals And 99mo/99mtc Generators
JO  - Annals of Nuclear Medicine
PY  - 2010
AB  - Objective and methods A questionnaire survey was conducted at all 32 hospitals in Saitama Prefecture to investigate the current difficult situation in terms of nuclear medicine management in the face of the mTc shortage due to insufficient supply, and 29 hospitals (90.6%) replied. Results Of the 29, 15 (51.7%) reported a reduction in the number of nuclear medicine studies performed due to the shortage of supply, although the reduction was small. The decrease per month was less than 20 studies in 73% of the institutions. Of the nuclear medicine studies that involve the use of mTc, the studies whose reduction in number most seriously affected patient management were, in decreasing order: mTc-MAA lung perfusion scans, mTc-MAG3, mTc-DTPA, or mTc-DMSA renoscans, mTc-MDP bone scans, mTc-HMPAO or ECD brain SPECT studies, mTc-MIBI or tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT studies, mTc-radiocolloid sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, mTc-HSA-D or pyrophosphate bleeding scans, mTc-GSA hepatic function reserve scans, and mTc-MIBI parathyroid scans. The reduction is probably ascribable to factors such as cancellations of emergency studies, absence of substitute studies, sequential studies using the same radiopharmaceutical, and higher cost of the syringe-type products than the vial-type products. Substitutes for mTc studies were performed at 52% (15/29) of the institutions. Myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl chloride was the most common substitute study. Conclusions The results of this survey suggested the several procedures to resolve the issues related to the shortage. The staffs at all institutions except one gave the impression that their nuclear medicine ordering systems had been greatly affected by the shortage of supply. This adverse circumstance, however, may provide a good opportunity to educate the public about nuclear medicine studies that use mTc and SPECT, with which citizen are now unfamiliar. © The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine 2010.

TI  - Service-Oriented Fair Resource Allocation And Auction For Civil Aircrafts Augmented Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
JO  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
PY  - 2020
AB  - In this paper, we present a civil aircrafts augmented space-air-ground integrated networks (CAA-SAGIN) architecture, where each mobile user can access multiple platforms simultaneously. With the target of ensuring fairness, we put forward the fair optimization strategies including resource allocation and resource auction. In the resource allocation, we formulate a service-oriented fair (SOF) resource allocation problem in order to minimize the difference between the allocated and required data rate. After introducing convex-relaxation and logarithmic approximation, the joint optimal solutions of subchannel and power allocation can be obtained by SOF iteration algorithm. Aiming at managing the terrestrial network overload, we present a user update mechanism. After applying SOF resource allocation for selected original users in sky access platforms, we propose a resource auction scheme so as to maximize the utility for both sides. First, we decompose the original problem into several subproblems and transform them into their lower bound by first-order approximation. Then, we can obtain the joint optimal solution with an alternating descent iterative method. From simulation results, we can find that CAA-SAGIN can bring great benefits to traditional terrestrial networks. In addition, the proposed resource allocation and auction schemes are significant in terms of telecommunication and economic parameters.

TI  - Connecting Dryland Fine-Fuel Assessments To Wildfire Exposure And Natural Resource Values At Risk
JO  - FIRE ECOLOGY
PY  - 2023
AB  - BackgroundWildland fire in arid and semi-arid (dryland) regions can intensify when climatic, biophysical, and land-use factors increase fuel load and continuity. To inform wildland fire management under these conditions, we developed high-resolution (10-m) estimates of fine fuel across the Altar Valley in southern Arizona, USA, which spans dryland, grass-dominated ecosystems that are administered by multiple land managers and owners. We coupled field measurements at the end of the 2021 growing season with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and vegetation indices acquired during and after the growing season to develop predictions of fine fuel across the entire valley. We then assessed how climate, soil, vegetation, and land-use factors influenced the amount and distribution of fine fuels. We connected fine fuels to fire management points, past ignition history, and socio-economic vulnerability to evaluate wildfire exposure and assessed how fuel related to habitat of the endangered masked bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi).ResultsThe high amount of fine fuel (400-3600 kg/ha; mean = 1392 kg/ha) predicted by our remote sensing model (R-2 = 0.63) for 2021 compared to previous years in the valley was stimulated by near-record high growing season precipitation that was 177\% of the 1990-2020 mean. Fine fuel increased across the valley if it was contained within the wildlife refuge boundary and had lower temperature and vapor pressure deficit, higher soil organic content, and abundant annual plants and an invasive perennial grass (R-2 = 0.24). The index of potential exposure to wildfire showed a clustering of high exposure centered around roads and low-density housing development distant from fire management points and extending into the upper elevations flanking the valley. Within the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, fine fuel increased with habitat suitability for the masked bobwhite quail within and adjacent to core habitat areas, representing a natural resource value at risk, accompanied with higher overall mean fine fuel (1672 kg/ha) in relation to 2015 (1347 kg/ha) and 2020 (1363 kg/ha) means.ConclusionsBy connecting high-resolution estimates of fine fuel to climatic, biophysical and land-use factors, wildfire exposure, and a natural resource value at risk, we provide a pro-active and adaptive framework for fire risk management within highly variable and rapidly changing dryland landscapes.

TI  - Cd-Transunet: A Hybrid Transformer Network For The Change Detection Of Urban Buildings Using L-Band Sar Images
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2022
AB  - The change detection of urban buildings is currently a hotspot in the research area of remote sensing, which plays a vital role in urban planning, disaster assessments and surface dynamic monitoring. SAR images have unique characteristics compared with traditional optical images, mainly including abundant image information and large data volume. However, the majority of currently used SAR images for the detection of changes in buildings have the problems of missing the detection of small buildings and poor edge segmentation. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach based on deep learning for changing building detection, which we called CD-TransUNet. It should be noted that CD-TransUNet is an end-to-end encoding-decoding hybrid Transformer model that combines the UNet and Transformer. Additionally, to enhance the precision of feature extraction and to reduce the computational complexity, the CD-TransUNet integrates coordinate attention (CA), atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and depthwise separable convolution (DSC). In addition, by sending the differential images to the input layer, the CD-TransUNet can focus more on building changes over a large scale while ignoring the changes in other land types. At last, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using a pair of ALOS-2(L-band) acquisitions, and the comparative experimental results obtained from other baseline models show that the precision of the CD-TransUNet is much higher and the Kappa value can reach 0.795. Furthermore, the low missed alarms and the accurate building edge reflect that the proposed method is more appropriate for building changing detection tasks.

TI  - Model-Assisted Estimation Of Change In Forest Biomass Over An 11year Period In A Sample Survey Supported By Airborne Lidar: A Case Study With Post-Stratification To Provide "Activity Data"
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2013
AB  - The United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN REDD) was launched with the aim of contributing to the development of capacity for reducing emissions from loss of forest carbon in developing countries. It is understood that REDD mechanisms must be supported by forest assessment programs that can monitor the carbon stocks by carbon pools and human activities. Reporting at a national level will be required but many countries are likely to benefit from more local monitoring programs within the countries as well, gauging the effects of national policies and local financial mechanisms aimed at reaching goals for emission control for the nation as a whole. Field-based forest sample surveys are typically used as support for national reporting purposes. However, monitoring within the countries will require huge investments in field surveys to provide reliable change estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution. Airborne scanning LiDAR has emerged as a promising tool to provide auxiliary data for sample surveys aiming at estimation of above-ground tree biomass. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how "wall-to-wall" LiDAR data can be used for change estimation. Estimators for areal changes of categories representing human activities such as "deforestation", "degradation" and "untouched" were presented. Corresponding estimators for variance were also provided. Furthermore, it was shown how net change in biomass for the defined activity categories and for the entire area of interest can be estimated from a field sample survey with and without support of LiDAR remote sensing data and how the uncertainty can be quantified by corresponding variance estimates. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6. ha) a probability sample of 176 field sample plots distributed according to a stratified systematic design was measured twice over an 11. year period. Corresponding multi-temporal scanning LiDAR data were also available. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to predict change category for every LiDAR grid cell in the area, and areal changes were estimated from the pure field sample and with the support of the LiDAR data applying model-assisted estimators. The standard errors of the areal change estimates were reduced by 43-75% by adding LiDAR data to the estimation. The change categories were used as post-strata in a subsequent estimation of net change in biomass. The standard errors of the biomass change estimates for the respective change categories were reduced by 18-84% compared to the pure field survey when using LiDAR data as auxiliary information in a model-assisted estimation procedure, which translates to a need for 1.5-38.7 times as many field plots when relying only on the field data. For the entire area of interest, the standard error of the overall net change in biomass was reduced by 57% compared to the uncertainty reported from the pure field survey. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It can be used to evaluate the effect of pollution control of the upstream of that river section, analyze the trend of environmental pollution, and assist the government to make decisions. Yi river is the main tributary of the Yellow River. In the headwaters of the Yi river, there are two very large molybdenum mines with a history of mining and smelting of many years. This area is also a region with a high molybdenum geochemical background. Using the collected regional molybdenum geochemical map, historical monitoring data, sampling data, remote sensing image, and spatial information of mineral enterprises, we found two reasons of why the molybdenum concentration is unusual in the basin. The first reason is the area is a high molybdenum region. The second reason is that the inherent solubility of molybdenum in the soil is changed due to human engineering activities. In this paper, we did a linear fitting on the soil samples and water samples collected from the natural areas and areas affected by human mining activities, and established a leaching model. By comparing the leaching capability of molybdenum in the soil of different areas, we found that the molybdenum release capability in areas affected by human mining was much higher than that in natural areas. Finally, this paper proposed a method to analyze the contribution rate of molybdenum concentration of this river section, using a combination of the leaching model and the D8 algorithm. The experimental results showed that the contribution rate of natural factors and human influence factors at the exit section of Yi River was 81.38% and 18.62% respectively. The background molybdenum concentration in this section was 0.16 mg/L. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Big Data, Small Island: Earth Observations For Improving Flood And Landslide Risk Assessment In Jamaica
JO  - GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2023
AB  - The Caribbean region is highly vulnerable to multiple hazards. Resultant impacts may be derived from single or multiple cascading risks caused by hydrological-meteorological, seismic, geologic, or anthropological triggers, disturbances, or events. Studies suggest that event records and data related to hazards, risk, damage, and loss are limited in this region. National Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) planning and response require data of sufficient quantity and quality to generate actionable information, statistical inferences, and insights to guide continual policy improvements for effective DRR, national preparedness, and response in both time and space. To address this knowledge gap, we review the current state of knowledge, data, models, and tools, identifying potential opportunities, capacity needs, and long-term benefits for integrating Earth Observation (EO) understanding, data, models, and tools to further enhance and strengthen the national DRR framework using two common disasters in Jamaica: floods and landslides. This review serves as an analysis of the current state of DRR management and assess future opportunities. Equally, to illustrate and guide other United Nations Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) priority countries in the Pacific region, known as Small Island Developing States (SIDS), to grapple with threats of multiple and compounding hazards in the face of increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events, and climate change impact.

TI  - Mapping The Available Water Capacity Of Australian Soils
JO  - GlobalSoilMap: Basis of the Global Spatial Soil Information System - Proceedings of the 1st GlobalSoilMap Conference
PY  - 2014
AB  - Soil Available Water Capacity (AWC) is the main source of water for vegetation and it is the potential amount of water available for atmospheric exchange. Studying its spatial distribution is crucial for agricultural planning and management and for use in biophysical modelling. The aim of this work is to obtain a continuous spatial prediction of AWC for Australia's wheat belt. We used a data set compiling 806 soil profiles to predict AWC at six depth intervals (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, and 100-200 cm) and different combinations of environmental information (topographic, climatic, soils, Landsat imagery, gamma-ray spectrometry) as covariates. The modelling techniques used were symbolic regression (genetic programming), Cubist (regression tree), and support vector machines. Instead of selecting a single model, we opted for using an averaging method to generate an ensemble model for a grid spacing of 500 m. We also used a downscaling technique to increase the resolution of the maps to 100 m (compliant with the GlobalSoilMap specifications) of selected sites. We observed decreasing RMSE values with the addition of extra covariates and also an expected performance decrease with depth. The downscaling technique showed satisfactory results, increasing the resolution while maintaining the model performance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.

TI  - Adaptive Estimation Of Aircraft Flight Parameters For Engine Health Monitoring System
JO  - Journal of Aircraft
PY  - 2002
AB  - An adaptive control approach to the implementation of on-line estimation of aircraft flight parameters for the engine health monitoring system is presented. The adaptive estimation system enables a fast reliable data prediction to replicate the missing or misleading data caused by malfunctions in the sensors or communication links, thereby compensating for the deficiency of data that can trigger fault diagnoses of engine health. The estimation method features the integration of an autoregression model and a self-tuning adaptation algorithm for one-step-ahead estimation, in which the manufacturer's baseline values are used as an input in conjunction with an adaptive input adjusted to minimize the estimate error deviated from the snapshot data taken from satellites. The entire system is implemented through the parameter identification and optimization in an attempt to minimize the estimate error. Stability of this adaptive estimation system is investigated, and discrete-time simulations of in-flight parameter estimation will also be presented to show the effectiveness of the present approach.

TI  - Study Of Land Surface Temperature (Lst) At Naogaon District Of Bangladesh
JO  - AIP Conference Proceedings
PY  - 2023
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) has been used to investigate the effects of changing land cover on climate. The importance of surface temperature in a range of earth science concerns and themes, such as urban climatology, human-environment interactions, and global environmental change, cannot be overstated. In this study, Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager (OLI), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat-5 Thematic MAPPER (TM) satellite images are used to calculate the parameters. A total period of 20 years, starting from 2000 to 2020 is selected. At every 10 years interval starting from 2000, the Land cover map, LST, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have been calculated. The digital number of the thermal infrared band is converted to spectral radiance with the help of the Landsat user's guidebook. The final LST is computed using surface emissivity based on NDVI classes. The study reveals an abrupt change in LST that says LST is increasing from 2000-2010 time period and again decreases in 2010-2020 time span. The northwest parts of the Naogaon district have the highest LST values. LST and NDVI are found to have a considerable positive correlation. The study shows the increase in vegetation reduces LST and the decrease of vegetation is responsible for increased LST. Also, bare soil, built-up area, waterbody are responsible for controlling LST. From the land cover map, it is visible that, bare soil and water body has a slight effect on LST but on the other hand, LST increases with growing of built-up area. The spatial distribution statistics of Land cover map, LST, and NDVI can be used as a guideline for urban planning, methods for improving the quality of the urban environment and a possible solution for diminishing of LST. © 2023 Author(s).

TI  - Synthetic Biology In Space: Considering The Broad Societal And Ethical Implications
JO  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY
PY  - 2012
AB  - Although the field of synthetic biology is still in its infancy, there are expectations for great advances in the coming decades, both on Earth and potentially in space. Promising applications for long duration space missions include a variety of biologically engineered products and biologically aided processes and technologies, which will undoubtedly be scrutinized for risks and benefits in the broad context of ethical, legal and social realms. By comparing and contrasting features of Earth-based and space-applied synthetic biology, it is possible to identify the likely similarities and differences, and to identify possible challenges ahead for space applications that will require additional research, both in the short and long terms. Using an analytical framework associated with synthetic biology and new technologies on Earth, this paper analyses the kinds of issues and concerns ahead, and identifies those areas where space applications may require additional examination. In general, while Earth- and space-based synthetic biology share many commonalities, space applications have additional challenges such as those raised by space microbiology and environmental factors, legal complications, planetary protection, lack of decision-making infrastructure(s), long duration human missions, terraforming and the possible discovery of extraterrestrial (ET) life. For synthetic biology, the way forward offers many exciting opportunities, but is not without legitimate concerns - for life, environments and society, both on Earth and beyond.

TI  - Evaluation And Hydrologic Validation Of Three Satellite-Based Precipitation Products In The Upper Catchment Of The Red River Basin, China
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2018
AB  - Satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) provide alternative precipitation estimates that are especially useful for sparsely gauged and ungauged basins. However, high climate variability and extreme topography pose a challenge. In such regions, rigorous validation is necessary when using SPPs for hydrological applications. We evaluated the accuracy of three recent SPPs over the upper catchment of the Red River Basin, which is a mountain gorge region of southwest China that experiences a subtropical monsoon climate. The SPPs included the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 product, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Algorithm (CMORPH), the Bias-corrected product (CMORPH\_CRT), and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) Climate Data Record (PERSIANN\_CDR) products. SPPs were compared with gauge rainfall from 1998 to 2010 at multiple temporal (daily, monthly) and spatial scales (grid, basin). The TRMM 3B42 product showed the best consistency with gauge observations, followed by CMORPH\_CRT, and then PERSIANN\_CDR. All three SPPs performed poorly when detecting the frequency of non-rain and light rain events (<1 mm); furthermore, they tended to overestimate moderate rainfall (1-25 mm) and underestimate heavy and hard rainfall (>25 mm). GR (Genie Rural) hydrological models were used to evaluate the utility of the three SPPs for daily and monthly streamflow simulation. Under Scenario I (gauge-calibrated parameters), CMORPH\_CRT presented the best consistency with observed daily (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, orNSE = 0.73) and monthly (NSE = 0.82) streamflow. Under Scenario II (individual-calibrated parameters), SPP-driven simulations yielded satisfactory performances (NSE >0.63 for daily, NSE >0.79 for monthly); among them, TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH\_CRT performed better than PERSIANN\_CDR. SPP-forced simulations underestimated high flow (18.1-28.0\%) and overestimated low flow (18.9-49.4\%). TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH\_CRT show potential for use in hydrological applications over poorly gauged and inaccessible transboundary river basins of Southwest China, particularly for monthly time intervals suitable for water resource management.

TI  - Satnetcode: Functional Design And Experimental Validation Of Network Coding Over Satellite
JO  - 2018 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications, ISNCC 2018
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this paper, we present the functional design and experimental validation of network coding technology over hybrid networks including satellite links. We first describe our design framework based on a holistic modelling of (overlay) heterogeneous networking satellite scenarios. We then define different types of logical nodes depending on their encoding, re-encoding and decoding functionalities and whether or not the satellite (overlay) application designer has control over them. Nodes are assumed strategically chosen to recode, which may result in a small number of re-encoding nodes that suffice to optimize selected performance metrics. Our main contribution is a system-oriented functional design of network coding that enables flexible instantiation of different types of network codes via configurable network coding (C-NC) functions. Random or structured NC coefficients can be remotely or locally generated and a packet scheduler can forward packets according to different policies. The choice of coefficients and overall NC scheme depend on the SATCOM-specific performance target, namely delay or bandwidth constraints. Here, we present a preliminary design and experimental testebed validation for the case of delay constrained transmission. Our results show the practical benefits of re-encoding and performance tradeoffs of different network coding schemes. In particular, our results show the good structural properties and delay-reliability tradeoffs of our novel proposal of structured network codes using Pascal matrices due to the regenerative properties of the coding coefficients. © 2018 IEEE.

Long-distance labor migrations had dire health consequences to both immigrants and host populations. Focusing on the quarantine station on Flat Island, Mauritius, this study analyzes a historical social setting and natural environment that were radically altered due to the implementation of health management. Using aerial and satellite imagery, digital elevation models, RTK and total station raw data, 3D modeling, and GIS mapping, we reconstructed the spatial organization and the built landscape of this institution to assess the gap between the benefits claimed by European colonizers and the actual effects on immigrant health conditions through the promotion of public health practices.

TI  - Evaluation Of Long-Term Estuarine Vegetation Changes Through Landsat Imagery
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - Salt marshes support estuarine biodiversity and provide ecosystem services; however, their general decay is being observedworldwide, in large part due to land reclamation. Accordingly, there is a growing concern about saltmarsh preservation status having in mind the promotion of effective management decisions towards their conservation and restoration. Satellite imagery offers the opportunity tomonitor land surface dynamics, constituting a fundamental information source for wetland monitoring. This study analyses spatial and temporal vegetation changes within Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon between 1984 and 2017, by processing and analyzing TM and ETM+ Landsat imagery. A database consisting of 264 cloud-free images was collected and analyzed. The Normalized DifferenceWater Index was computed using the remote surface reflectance and was then used to distinguish land from water and to estimate the flooded lagoon area. Moreover, the tidal statewas determined for each image froma tidal elevation record monitored at the lagoon entrance. Subsequently, four vegetation indices (VI) were computed and their spatial variability in the lagoon area uncovered by waterwas assessed. Spatially averaged spectral indiceswere also statistically analyzed and seasonal variations and interannual trends evaluated. Results show that the intertidal area increased, and VI values decreased indicating a possible reduction in the Chlorophyll content and suggesting that the new intertidal regions are mostly covered by mud. The spatially averaged VI values show seasonal patterns, with peaks in spring and summer, coinciding with high biomass productivity periods. The largest flooded area and VI modifications occurred after 1999, suggesting that changes are associated with dredging activities performed in themain lagoon channels. This study reinforced the potential of Landsat archives tomonitor coastalwetlands, highlighting their importance for coastal managers of threatened systems, and therefore helping to define management strategies about the ecological conservation of estuarine systems.

TI  - Reported Health Conditions In Animals Residing Near Natural Gas Wells In Southwestern Pennsylvania
JO  - Journal of Environmental Science and Health - Part A Toxic/Hazardous Substances and Environmental Engineering
PY  - 2015
AB  - Natural gas extraction activities, including the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, may pose potential health risks to both human and animal populations in close proximity to sites of extraction activity. Because animals may have increased exposure to contaminated water and air as well as increased susceptibility to contaminant exposures compared to nearby humans, animal disease events in communities living near natural gas extraction may provide "sentinel" information useful for human health risk assessment. Community health evaluations as well as health impact assessments (HIAs) of natural gas exploration should therefore consider the inclusion of animal health metrics in their assessment process. We report on a community environmental health survey conducted in an area of active natural gas drilling, which included the collection of health data on 2452 companion and backyard animals residing in 157 randomly-selected households of Washington County, Pennsylvania (USA). There were a total of 127 reported health conditions, most commonly among dogs. When reports from all animals were considered, there were no significant associations between reported health condition and household proximity to natural gas wells. When dogs were analyzed separately, we found an elevated risk of any reported health condition in households less than 1km from the nearest gas well (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.07-9.7), with dermal conditions being the most common of canine disorders. While these results should be considered hypothesis generating and preliminary, they suggest value in ongoing assessments of pet dogs as well as other animals to better elucidate the health impacts of natural gas extraction on nearby communities.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Freshwater, aquaculture, fisheries, biodiversity, forests, and agricultural land have high economic and social value throughout the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region; but they can also be over-exploited, with damaging consequences for local economies, long term stability and for the Earth system as a whole - especially the climate system. The ACP's fast growing population puts growing pressure on the environment to provide food, water and fibre, on the regions' urban centres and transport networks, and on energy sources. Information on the location, condition and evolution of resources is an important step towards sustainability, but unfortunately such information can be hard to get. Earth observing satellite technology combined with geographical information management can help fill the information gap. In this objective, and because of its unique position to support the implementation of advanced interoperable geospatial technologies, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) is setting-up of an "Observatory for sustainable development" as single portal to support decision-making for development in the fields of natural resource and food security. The African Union and European Union recognise the importance of this service and are beginning to develop this capacity as part of the AU EU joint strategic partnership. This paper describes the needs, and presents the first steps taken by the JRC and by the joint partnership in harnessing space technologies to help meet Millennium Development Goals, in particular eradication of poverty, and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Indian space programme, whose objectives involve acceleration of economic and social development through applications of space technology, has been engaged in the development of state-of-the-art satellite systems, launch vehicles and equipment necessary for applications. Even during the early phase of evolution of this Programme, deliberate policies have been adopted by the national space agency, namely, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), to promote spin-off benefit from the technologies developed for the use of space projects. Consistently adhering to this policy, ISRO has transferred over 280 technologies till date, spanning a wide spectrum of disciplines. This has resulted in a fruitful two-way cooperation between a number of SMEs and the ISRO. In order to make the technology transfer process effective, ISRO has adopted a variety of functional and organizational policies that included awareness building measures, licensee selection methods, innovative contract systems, diverse transfer processes, post licencing services and feedback mechanisms. Besides analyzing these policies and their evolution, the paper discusses various models adopted for technology transfer and their impact on assessment. It also touches upon relevant issues relating to creating interface between public funded R&D and the private commercial enterprises. It suggests few models in which international cooperation could be pursued in this field. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Science And Policy Lessons Learned From A Decade Of Adaptation To The Emergent Risk Of Sargassum Proliferation Across The Tropical Atlantic
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
PY  - 2023
AB  - Climatic and anthropogenic changes appear to be driving the emergence of new ecosystem and human health risks. As new risks emerge, and the severity or frequency of known risks change, we ask: what evidence is there of past adaptations to emergent risks? What scientific and policy processes lead to adaptive solutions that minimise the impacts of these events, and draw out opportunities? We identify science and policy lessons learned from coping with, and responding to, the sudden arrival of brown macroalgae (pelagic sargassum) that has proliferated across the tropical Atlantic since 2011. Drawing on an evidence base developed from a systematic search of literature relating to sargassum seaweed, and using event timelines and word clouds, we provide an analysis of lessons learned from a case study of adaptive responses across three continents to an emergent risk over the course of a decade. We reflect on successes and failures as well as opportunities taken in building adaptive capacity to address the risk in four key domains: policy, knowledge and evidence, monitoring and early warning, and technology and valorisation. Failures include: lack of environmental risk registries; missed opportunities to share monitoring data; and lack of a shared approach to manage the risk. Successes include: development of national management strategies; open-access knowledge hubs, networks and webinars sharing information and best practice; semi-operational early advisory systems using open access remote sensing data; numerous innovations customising clean-up and harvesting equipment, and research and development of new uses and value-added products.

TI  - Correlation Between Ground Measured Soil Moisture And Radarsat-1 Derived Backscattering Coefficient Over An Agricultural Catchment Of Navarre (North Of Spain)
JO  - Biosystems Engineering
PY  - 2005
AB  - Surface soil moisture is a variable of great importance in several agronomic, hydrological and meteorological processes. The knowledge of its magnitude and its spatial distribution is essential to adequately describe and model the processes where it is involved. Radar remote sensors measure microwave energy backscattered by natural surfaces. This scattered energy depends on the geometrical and the dielectric properties of surfaces. In the case of bare soil surfaces, the dielectric properties are directly related to the soil water content, so theoretically, radar remote sensing allows the extraction of spatially distributed soil moisture information. However, the influence of surface roughness on the scattering process limits the ability to correctly estimate volumetric soil moisture values unless detailed roughness measurements are acquired. The present paper reports the results of a study where five images from the remote radar sensor on the satellite RADARSAT-1 were processed and correlated to ground measured soil moisture values over an agricultural catchment. Linear regression models were fitted between RADARSAT-1 derived backscattering coefficient σ0 and the soil moisture at different spatial scales: point scale, field scale and catchment scale. Three soil moisture classes were identified according to their implications for crop growth: (1) low moisture values which contributed to water stress in plants; (2) medium moisture content that allowed an optimal crop growth; and (3) high moisture values which affected crop growth by other means, such as by fungal disease. Results show a direct relation between σ0 and the soil moisture. At the catchment scale the observed correlation is high. At detailed scales, however, variability increases, causing a decrease of correlation values. The ability of σ0 to discriminate between the considered moisture classes seems to be adequate. The accuracy of the estimation increases from the detailed to coarser scales. In the case of vegetated fields, the vegetation cover can cause a certain attenuation of the radar pulse resulting in reduced σ0 values. In this research, vegetation-induced attenuation was considered by applying the semi-empirical 'Water Cloud' model. The presented technique is useful for crop growth monitoring and modelling at medium to large scales, particularly in early growing seasons where the attenuation of vegetation is not too high. It is also applicable to irrigation planning or crop health studies. However, regression lines are site specific and can be affected by the surface roughness variability and vegetation cover of fields. © 2005 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping Eucalypts Trees Using High Resolution Multispectral Images: A Study Comparing Worldview 2 Vs. Spot 7
JO  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as a major threat to many ecological and socio-economic systems. Nevertheless, the management of some of these plants is often controversial due to the positive socioeconomic and ecosystem roles they play. This necessitates proper mapping and monitoring of the extent and spatial distribution of such plants to prioritize resource allocation and management. However, mapping plant species using remote sensing in a heterogeneous environment such as an urban area is often challenged by high levels of spectral muddle. This study investigated the utility of the high and medium spectral and spatial resolution imageries from the WorldView-2 (WV-2) and SPOT-7 satellites, respectively, to map eucalypts trees in urban areas. Furthermore, the classification performances of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were compared. Both WV-2 and SPOT-7 imageries attained overall accuracies of 81.67\% (0.78 kappa) and 72.78\% (0.67 kappa), respectively, when the RF algorithm was used and 80\% (0.76 Kappa) and 71.11\% (0.65 Kappa), respectively when SVM algorithm was used. The user's accuracies for the eucalypts class in both WV-2 and SPOT 7 imageries were 73.33\% and 60\%, respectively, for the RF and 70\% and 56.67\% for the SVM algorithm, respectively. Thus, WV-2 imagery is more suitable for mapping eucalypts trees in a heterogeneous urban environment. Therefore, the classification of WV-2 imageries using RF produced a relatively more accurate map of the eucalypts trees for the study areas, the southern part of Johannesburg city.

TI  - Using Annual Time-Series Of Landsat Images To Assess The Effects Of Forest Restitution In Post-Socialist Romania
JO  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2012
AB  - The increasing availability of the Landsat image archive and the development of approaches to make full use of these data provide novel insights into the drivers and dynamics of land use systems change. Focusing on Romania, we asked how the drastic institutional and socio-economic transformation after the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe affected forestry. We used an annual time series of Landsat images to investigate how three phases of forest restitution affected forest disturbances (due to both, natural events and forest management). We employed the LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) set of change detection algorithms to perform temporal segmentation and fitting of the Landsat time series, and derived annual disturbance maps (95.72\% overall accuracy) along with recovery dynamics. Our change map suggested that forest disturbances increased substantially since the collapse of socialism in 1989, with 75,000 ha of disturbed forest land (4.5\% of the total studied forest area). Whereas the late socialist years were characterized by relatively low disturbance levels (12\% of all detected disturbances), disturbances increased especially after each of the restitution laws were passed in 1991, 2000, and 2005 (34\%, 21\% and 32\% respectively). Non-state ownership regimes (i.e. private owners vs. public property of local communities) and species composition of restituted forests were two important factors determining disturbance levels. The widespread disturbances we found also raise concerns about timber overexploitation in many areas of the Romanian Carpathians. Our study demonstrates the value of the temporal depth of the Landsat archive and highlights that trajectory-based change detection approaches can be highly beneficial for gaining insights on the effect of institutional shocks on land use patterns.

TI  - Monitoring Metropolitan Growth Dynamics For Achieving Sustainable Urbanization (Sdg 11.3) In Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - The mass accumulation of population in the larger cities of India has led to accelerated and unprecedented peripheral urban expansion over the last few decades. This rapid peripheral growth is characterized by an uncontrolled, low density, fragmented and haphazard patchwork of development popularly known as urban sprawl. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) has been one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in India and is experiencing rampant suburbanization and peripheral expansion. Hence, understanding urban growth and its dynamics in these rapidly changing environments is critical for city planners and resource managers. Furthermore, understanding urban expansion and urban growth patterns are essential for achieving inclusive and sustainable urbanization as defined by the United Nations in the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., SDGs, 11.3). The present research attempts to quantify and model the urban growth dynamics of large and diverse metropolitan areas with a distinct methodology considering the case of KMA. In the study, land use and land cover (LULC) maps of KMA were prepared for three different years (i.e., for 1996, 2006, and 2016) through the classification of Landsat imagery using a support vector machine (SVM) classification approach. Then, change detection analysis, landscape metrics, a concentric zone approach, and Shannon’s entropy approach were applied for spatiotemporal assessment and quantification of urban growth in KMA. The achieved classification accuracies were found to be 89.75%, 92.00%, and 92.75%, with corresponding Kappa values of 0.879, 0.904, and 0.912 for 1996, 2006, and 2016, respectively. It is concluded that KMA has been experiencing typical urban sprawl. The peri-urban areas (i.e., KMA-rural) are growing rapidly, and are characterized by leapfrogging and fragmented built-up area development, compared to the central KMA (i.e., KMA-urban), which has become more compact in recent years. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluating The Potential Of Als Data To Increase The Efficiency Of Aboveground Biomass Estimates In Tropical Peat-Swamp Forests
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests are critically required by many actors including forest managers, forest services and policy makers. Because the AGB of a forest cannot be observed directly, models need to be employed. Allometric models that predict the AGB of a single tree as a function of diameter at breast height (DBH) are commonly used in forest inventories that use a probability selection scheme to estimate total AGB. However, for forest areas with limited accessibility, implementing such a field-based survey can be challenging. In such cases, models that use remotely sensed information may support the biomass assessment if useful predictor variables are available and statistically sound estimators can be derived. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has become a prominent auxiliary data source for forest biomass assessments and is even considered to be one of the most promising technologies for AGB assessments in forests. In this study, we combined ALS and forest inventory data from a logged-over tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia to estimate total AGB. Our objective was to compare the precision of AGB estimates from two approaches: (i) from a field-based inventory only and, (ii) from an ALS-assisted approach where ALS and field inventory data were combined. We were particularly interested in analyzing whether the precision of AGB estimates can be improved by integrating ALS data under the particular conditions. For the inventory, we used a standard approach based on a systematic square sample grid. For building a biomass-link model that relates the field based AGB estimates to ALS derived metrics, we used a parametric nonlinear model. From the field-based approach, the estimated mean AGB was 241.38 Mgha-1 with a standard error of 11.17 Mgha-1 (SE% = 4.63%). Using the ALS-assisted approach, we estimated a similar mean AGB of 245.08 Mgha-1 with a slightly smaller standard error of 10.57 Mgha-1 (SE% = 4.30%). Altogether, this is an improvement of precision of estimation, even though the biomass-link model we found showed a large Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 47.43 Mgha-1. We conclude that ALS data can support the estimation of AGB in logged-over tropical peat swamp forests even if the model quality is relatively low. A modest increase in precision of estimation (from 4.6% to 4.3%), as we found it in our study area, will be welcomed by all forest inventory planners as long as ALS data and analysis expertise are available at low or no cost. Otherwise, it gives rise to a challenging economic question, namely whether the cost of the acquisition of ALS data is reasonable in light of the actual increase in precision. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Introduction Of Tools For Geological Big Data Mining And Their Applications
JO  - Geotectonica et Metallogenia
PY  - 2020
AB  - The research paradigm of big data plays a key role in the emerging big data age. Geological research faces unprecedented challenges and opportunities, and calls for fundamental support by big data mining. This paper pays attention to a few tools of big data mining and their applications in geological field. With its powerful semantic processing ability and open organization ability, the knowledge map provides an effective tool for the knowledge-based organization and intelligent application of information in the big data age. It aims to describe the various entities or concepts that exist in the real world and their relationships. It constitutes a huge semantic network diagram. Nodes represent entities or concepts, and edges are composed of attributes or relationships. Machine learning and convolution neural network model is an important research hotspot in geological data mining. The evolutionary algorithm is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm which draws lesson from the mode of biological evolution and adaptive processes in nature. It is advantageous that it can carry out hidden parallel search without prior knowledge and can be used to accurately obtain the evolutionary trends and space-time characteristics hidden in large data. Graphical community detection technology divides the network into several internal nodes-similar communities, and provides strong technical support for analysis and understanding of networks. With the continuous improvement of spatial resolution, time resolution and radiation resolution, the remote sensing technology has become the main technical means to obtain geological data. Data access and intelligent processing is the most important development direction of remote sensing big data research. There are successful application cases of the methods above and they will be widely used in various geological studies. The intelligent monitoring, simulation, control and early warning of urban soil pollution has benefitted from the proper selection of supporting systems for large-scale data research and the strong support of large-scale data technology in the field of geology. Major barriers to the effective fusion of large data from multiple sources are diminishing. © 2020, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - Regular Shapes Detection In Satellite Images
JO  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
PY  - 2012
AB  - This paper presents a novel and fast method to distinguish regular and irregular regions in satellite and aerial images. This can be employed in further processing such as detecting man-made or artificial structures, disaster response, road sign detection and etc. In order to achieve this goal, we offer a suitable definition of regular shapes. Using this definition, we propose an appropriate technique to evaluate regularity. In our approach, discrete Fourier transform plays the main role for searching the regularity. We suggest a criterion; called RCNR, which indicates to some extent that the shape is regular. The computed RCNR value should be compared with a pre-assigned threshold value for making decision. Our suggested method has a good robustness against rotation and scale variation and could be easily implemented. Moreover, our approach is independent of the shape and has a low processing time. The experimental results show the capability and feasibility of the proposed technique in the classification of regions into regular and irregular shapes in satellite images.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Cover Change Within Different Reserve Types In Southern Ghana
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - Rapid population and economic growth quickly degrade and deplete forest resources in many developing countries, even within protected areas. Monitoring forest cover change is critical for assessing ecosystem changes and targeting conservation efforts. Yet the most biodiverse forests on the planet are also the most difficult to monitor remotely due to their frequent cloud cover. To begin to reconcile this problem, we develop and implement an effective and efficient approach to mapping forest loss in the extremely cloud-prevalent southern Ghana region using dense time series Landsat 7 and 8 images from 1999 to 2018, based on median value temporal compositing of a novel vegetation index called the spectral variability vegetation index (SVVI). Resultant land-cover and land-use maps yielded 90 to 94\% mapping accuracies. Our results indicate 625 km(2) of forest loss within the 9800-km(2) total mapping area, including within forest reserves and their environs between circa 2003 and 2018. Within the reserves, reduced forest cover is found near the reserve boundaries compared with their interiors, suggesting a more degraded environment near the edge of the protected areas. A fully protected reserve, Kakum National Park, showed little forest cover change compared with many other less protected reserves (such as a production reserveSubri River). Anthropogenic activities, such as mining, agriculture, and built area expansion, were the main land-use transitions from forest. The reserves and census districts that are located near large-scale open pit mining indicated the most drastic forest loss. No significant correlation was found between the magnitudes of forest cover change and population density change for reserves and within a 1.5-km buffer surrounding the reserves. While other anthropogenic factors should be explored in relation to deforestation, our qualitative analysis revealed that reserve protection status (management policies) appears to be an important factor. The mapping approach described in this study provided a highly accurate and effective means to monitor land-use changes in forested and cloud-prone regions with great promise for application to improved monitoring of moist tropical and other forests characterized by high cloud cover.

TI  - Geomorphic And Land Cover Identification Of Dust Sources In The Eastern Great Basin Of Utah, Usa
JO  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
PY  - 2014
AB  - This study identifies anthropogenically disturbed areas and barren playa surfaces as the two primary dust source types that repeatedly contribute to dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of western Utah, U.S.A. This semi-arid desert region is an important contributor to dust production in North America, with this study being the first to specifically identify and characterize regional dust sources. From 2004 to 2010, a total of 51 dust event days (DEDs) affected the air quality in Salt Lake City, UT. MODIS satellite imagery during 16 of these DEDs was analyzed to identify dust plumes, and assess the characteristics of dust source areas. A total of 168 plumes were identified, and showed mobilization of dust from Quaternary deposits located within the Bonneville Basin. This analysis identifies 4 major and 5 secondary source areas for dust in this region, which produce dust primarily during the spring and fall months and during moderate or greater drought conditions, with a Palmer Drought Index (PDI) of 2 or less. The largest number of observed dust plumes (similar to 60\% of all plumes) originated from playas (ephemeral lakes) and are classified as barren land cover with a silty clay soil sediment surface. Playa surfaces in this region undergo numerous recurrent anthropogenic disturbances, including military operations and anthropogenic water withdrawal. Anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to produce dust from the vegetated landscape in the eastern Great Basin, as evidenced by the new dust source active from 2008 to 2010 in the area burned by the 2007 Milford Flat Fire; this fire was the largest in Utah's history due to extensive cover of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) along with drought conditions. However, dust mobilization from the Milford Flat Burned Area was limited to regions that had been significantly disturbed by post-fire land management techniques that consisted of seeding, followed by chaining or tilling of the soil. Dust storms in the eastern Great Basin negatively impact air quality and transportation in the populated regions of Utah; this study details an improved forecasting protocol for dust storm events that will benefit transportation planning and improve public health.

TI  - Precision Agriculture And Food Security In Africa
JO  - Systems Analysis Approach for Complex Global Challenges
PY  - 2018
AB  - Background and Significance of the topic: The chapter gives an overview of precision agriculture and its impacts on food security in Africa. Methodology: Methods and concepts of precision agriculture are described including crop, soil and position sensors; which include global positioning and remote sensing applications in detection of crop stress, monitoring variability, soils, weeds, and diseases. Machine controls and computer based systems are also briefly described. Application/Relevance to systems analysis: There are a number of operations that can benefit from precision agriculture at field level, including soil preparation, fertilisation, irrigation and weed management. In Africa, the benefits of precision agriculture include improved food security through increases in water and nutrient use efficiency, and timely management of activities such as weed control. Precision agriculture has saved costs of inputs in both commercial and smallholder farming in Africa. Pollution control of ground and surface water sources has slowed down where fertiliser and agrochemical applications are now more efficient. Policy and/or practice implications: Two examples of precision agriculture application in Africa are presented; FruitLook which is used by farmers in the Western Cape in South Africa as a state-of the art information technology that helps deciduous fruit and grape farmers to be water efficient and climate-smart. The Chameleon and Wetting Front Detector Sensors have enabled small scale farmers in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe to cut down irrigation frequency fifty times and double productivity. Discussion and conclusion: It is clear that precision agriculture has played a major role in improving food security in Africa through the efficient use of inputs such as fertiliser and water, while also reducing environmental pollution and degradation. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

TI  - Characterizing And Classifying Urban Tree Species Using Bi-Monthly Terrestrial Hyperspectral Images In Hong Kong
JO  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2021
AB  - Urban trees exhibit a wide range of ecosystem services that have long been unveiled and increasingly reported. The ability to map tree species and analyze tree health conditions would become vividly essential. Remote sensing techniques, especially hyperspectral imaging, are being evolved for species identification and vegetation monitoring from spectral reponse patterns. In this study, a hyperspectral library for urban tree species in Hong Kong was established comprising 75 urban trees belonging to 19 species. 450 bi-monthly images were acquired by a terrestrial hyperspectral camera (SPECIM-IQ) from November 2018 to October 2019. A Deep Neural Network classification model was developed to identify tree species from the hyperspectral imagery with an overall accuracy ranging from 85\% to 96\% among different seasons. Representative spectral reflectance curves of healthy and unhealthy conditions for each species were extracted and analyzed. The hyperspectral phenology models were developed to achieve high accuracy and optimization of data acquisition. The bi-monthly canopy signatures and vegetation indices revealed different seasonality patterns of evergreen and deciduous species in Hong Kong. We explored the utility of terrestrial hyperspectral remote sensing and Deep Neural Network for urban tree species identification and characterizing. This provides a unique baseline to understand hyperspectral characteristics and seasonality of urban tree species in Hong Kong that can also contribute to hyperspectral imaging and database development elsewhere in the world.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Mentawai Island is adjacent with Indian Ocean that prone to high waves due to the wind in the Australia monsoon periods so that this island affected by coastal erosion. This coastal hazard causes significant risk like physical damage. Accordingly, disaster risk reduction program in coastal areas is indispensable in advance for the next destructive coastal hazard event. This need is answered by conducting disaster risk analysis as the first step in coastal erosion identification in the Mentawai Islands. The risk was obtained using a qualitative approach by combining the multidimensional aspects of hazard as well as vulnerability. Hazards aspect was derived from identification of physical variables to erosion and was represented by index value. Vulnerability aspects consist of physical aspect and social aspect. The physical aspect is the distribution of buildings and the social aspect is population density that obtained by modeling process. The result indicated that the eastern Mentawai coast has a wider area of erosion risk than the west coast due to the influence of the Australian monsoon. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - A Mixed-Methods Study Of Users' Journey Mapping Experience And Acceptance Of Telehealthcare Technology In Taiwan
JO  - Telemedicine and e-Health
PY  - 2019
AB  - Background: The integration of telehealthcare technologies into geriatric care has clear advantages, but poses challenges for key stakeholders, including the telehealthcare service industry, smart device developers, marketers and, of course, users. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into user experience and acceptance of telehealthcare technology in Taiwan. Materials and Methods: Taking an integrated mixed-methods approach, 51 participants - 33 women (64.71%) and 18 men (35.29%) (mean age: 52.1 years) - were examined before, during, and after using a telehealthcare device. A questionnaire was used to assess users' acceptance of the technology. Interviews were conducted to gather feedback. Results: The quantitative analysis revealed that (1) effort expectancy and relatives significantly influenced users' behavior intentions, (2) error and memorability significantly affected users' satisfaction, and (3) intention and satisfaction significantly affected users' behavior. The qualitative analysis revealed two key implications. First, participants generally were not satisfied with the telehealthcare device. Second, participants suggested the redesign of the telehealthcare device to reduce operating errors and time consumption to meet users' needs. Conclusions: Contemporary telehealthcare devices do not meet users' needs. Participants were made to adapt to the equipment rather than the equipment tailored to meet their needs. Although there were key benefits from home telehealthcare, the systems require enhanced technology, improved usability, and an expanded scale of services backed by government before widespread implementation can successfully proceed. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

TI  - An Assessment Of Ecosystem Degradation And Poverty: A Case Study Of Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area, Ogun State, Nigeria
JO  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
PY  - 2022
AB  - Ecosystem services have continued to dwindle due to human activities, with likely implications for the dependent populations. This paper assesses the relationship between poverty and ecosystem degradation within the peri-urban domain of Obafemi-Owode local government area (LGA) using a range of research methods including satellite imagery analysis to track land-use change, economic valuation of ecosystem services, and surveys to construct a multidimensional poverty index (MPI). The analysis shows that vegetation and wetlands have been replaced with built-up area and savannahs. This has resulted in a net loss in the value of ecosystem services worth US\$ 11.3 million, most of which is attributable to the decline in waste-management services provided by peri-urban wetlands. The major activities cited as causing environmental degradation were lumbering and land clearing, which were perceived to be deepening poverty through water contamination, food shortages, loss of farmlands, unemployment, increased erosion, epidemics and dropping out of school.

TI  - A Discussion Of Using Self-Maintenance Technology To Achieve High Reliability Of Equipment
JO  - 2010 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference, PHM '10
PY  - 2010
AB  - Reliability and maintainability is an indivisible entity. High reliability of equipment can reduce or avoid the cost caused by shutdown and maintenance which is induced by faults. This can be done through improving the maintainability of the equipment, and it can compensate the disadvantage of the large amount of money which is caused by merely increasing reliability. Compare to the traditional maintenance task, for the self-maintenance technology can detect the faults of the equipment timely and monitor the integrity of structure to heal itself, it can provide higher reliability to equipment. Based on the research of the self-maintenance theory and the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technology, a framework of maintainability design based on the self-repairing technology is presented in this paper. A discussion of the application value gained through using the self-maintenance technology to the equipment, such as man-made satellite, that may have a heavy loss caused by faults which are difficult to maintain is provided. © 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Spectral Index-Based Monitoring (2000-2017) In Lowland Forests To Evaluate The Effects Of Climate Change
JO  - GEOSCIENCES
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the next decades, climate change will put forests in the Hungarian Great Plain in the Carpathian Basin to the test, e.g., changing seasonal patterns, more intense storms, longer dry periods, and pests are expected to occur. To aid in the decision-making process for the conservation of ecosystems depending on forestry, how woods could adapt to changing meso- and microclimatic conditions in the near future needs to be defined. In addition to trendlike warming processes, calculations show an increase in climate extremes, which need to be monitored in accordance with spatial planning, at least for medium-scale mappings. We can use the MODIS sensor dataset if up-to-date terrestrial conditions and multi-decadal geographical processes are of interest. For geographic evaluations of changes, we used vegetation spectral indices; Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the summer half year, 16-day MODIS data composites between 2000 and 2017 in an intensively forested study area in the Hungarian Great Plain. We delineated forest areas on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve using Corine Land Cover maps (2000, 2006, and 2012). Mid-year changes over the nearly two-decade-long period are currently in balance; however, based on their reactions, forests are highly sensitive to abrupt changes caused by extreme climatic events. The higher occurrence of years or periods with extreme water shortages marks an observable decrease in biomass production, even in shorter index time series, such as that between 2004 and 2012. In the drought-stricken July-August periods, the effect of a dry year, subsequent to years with more precipitation, immediately pushes back the green mass and the reduction in the biomass production could become persistent, according to climatology predictions. The changes of specific sub-periods in the vegetation period can be evaluated even in a relatively short, 18-year data series, including the change in the growing values of the vegetative growth in spring or the increase in the summertime biomass production. Standardized differences highlight spatial differences in the biomass production; in response to years with the highest (negative) biomass difference; typically, the northern and southwestern parts of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve in the study area have longer lasting losses in biomass production. A comparison of NDVI and EVI values with the PaDI drought index and the vegetation indices of LANDSAT Operational Land Imager sensor respectively confirms our results.

TI  - Npoess Next-Generation Operational Global Earth Observations
JO  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
PY  - 2010
AB  - The United States is merging its two polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite programs operated by the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense into a single system, which is called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). During the next decade, NPOESS will provide global operational data to meet many of the needs of weather forecasters, climate researchers, and global decision makers for remotely sensed Earth science data and global environmental monitoring. The NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) will be launched in 2011 as a precursor to NPOESS to reduce final development risks for NPOESS and to provide continuity of global imaging and atmospheric sounding data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) missions. Beginning in 2014, NPOESS spacecraft will be launched into an afternoon orbit and in 2016 into an early-morning orbit to provide significantly improved operational capabilities and benefits to satisfy critical civil and national security requirements for space-based, remotely sensed environmental data. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Meteorological Operation (MetOp) spacecraft will complement NPOESS in a midmorning orbit. The joint constellation will provide global coverage with a data refresh rate of approximately four hours. NPOESS will observe more phenomena simultaneously from space and deliver a data volume significantly greater than its operational predecessors with substantially improved data delivery to users. Higher-resolution (spatial and spectral) and more accurate imaging and atmospheric sounding data will enable improvements in short-to medium-range weather forecasts. Multispectral and hyperspectral instruments on NPOESS will provide global imagery and sounding products useful to the forecaster that are complementary to those available from geostationary satellites. NPOESS will support the operational needs of meteorological, oceanographic, environmental, climatic, and space environmental remote sensing programs and provide continuity of data for climate researchers. This article that describes NPOESS was completed and accepted for publication prior to the White House decision in February 2010 ordering a major restructuring of the NPOESS program. The Department of Commerce will now assume primary responsibility for the afternoon polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite orbit and the Department of Defense will take primary responsibility for the early morning orbit. However, NPP, as described in this article, is still scheduled to be launched in 2011. Several of the instruments and program elements described in this article are also likely to be carried forward into future U. S. polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite missions.

TI  - Impacts Of Urbanization And Land Cover Dynamics On Underground Water In Islamabad, Pakistan
JO  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
PY  - 2019
AB  - Due to accelerated urbanization trend across the globe, unsustainable planning and management has consequently led to tremendous deterioration of ecosystem especially vegetation cover and water resources. Subsequently, posing a great challenge to sustainable urban advancement. Detection and evaluation of such variations would assist the planners to apprehend the factors, which are responsible for land use land cover change (LULCC) to adopt effective measures. GIS and remote sensing techniques have proved to be an effective tool for the assessment of land use changes. This study was conducted to assess the water quality index and analyze the major change in land cover types, vegetation cover, rate of urbanization and its possible impact on ground water resources vegetation, barren land and water lands have been decreased by -101.77 km(2), -2.90 km(2) and -1.10 km(2), while built-up lands expanded from 51.10 km(2) to 105.77 km(2). 16 Sites in Islamabad were categorized as unsuitable (with < 300 WQI value) for drinking water due to highly anthropogenic activities. Decreasing water quality and vegetation cover with alarming rate is posing a pressure on the limiting ground water resource as well. This study would be helpful for the decision makers and planners to take proper sustainable measure to address the repercussions of unplanned urbanization and land use changes to protect the ecosystem.

TI  - Multipolarized Radar For Delineating Within-Field Variability In Corn And Wheat
JO  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2006
AB  - In agriculture, there is growing interest in determining field spatial variability for implementing differential management practices, which should generate economic and environmental benefits. To date, the majority of studies involving remote sensing and differential management have focused on optical sensor systems. Less attention has been paid to synthetic aperture radar (SAR), despite the advantages of "all-weather" acquisition enabling information to be collected under cloud cover. This study examined the information content of multipolarization (HH, HV, VV, RR, LL, RL), multitemporal, and multiangle radar for delineating within-field spatial variability. On three dates in 2001, airborne C-band SAR data ( 35 and 55 incident angles) were acquired over four experimental fields. A series of fuzzy K-means analyses showed that the ability to differentiate zones was dependent upon the crop, the date in the growing season, and the pedodiversity of the field. Consistent with the soil and plant biophysical data, two of the four fields showed no spatial variability in radar backscatter. In the high-pedodiversity cornfield (Zea mays L.), three zones of productivity were discriminated early in the growing season and two zones of productivity in mid-season. Late in the season as a result of saturation of the radar signal, no spatial variability was evident. In corn, the results were similar regardless of the radar polarization. In the wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) field, which was of lower pedodiversity, two zones were identified in early-, mid-, and late-season images. Differences were evident among polarizations, with VV and HV being most sensitive to within-field variation. The delineated zones in both fields were shown to relate to plant and soil parameters, suggesting that radar may be a valuable tool in delineating spatial variation in producer fields and delineating differential management units.

TI  - Facilitating Feral Camel Removal In Australia Through Commercial Use
JO  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
PY  - 2016
AB  - Approximately 16.5\% of feral camel removal under the Australian Feral Camel Management Project (AFCMP) was by commercial means, via mustering for transport to abattoir (9.3\%) and pet-meating in the field (7.2\%). The challenges of commercial use of feral camels as a removal method include: variable density, mobility and distribution of the feral camel population; achieving landholder collaboration; accessibility to remote areas by road; availability of yard infrastructure and trucking capacity; and distance to slaughter facilities and end-markets. However, the AFCMP recognised commercial use as important to some Aboriginal communities, bringing a range of economic and social benefits as well as environmental outcomes in terms of reduced feral camel density. To facilitate mustering offtake, a removal assistance scheme was developed, whereby a formal landholder agreement was entered into with various legal requirements, including animal welfare. The agreement incentivised removal of both sexes: payments were for cow camels received at abattoir, but with a concurrent requirement for approximately equal sexes to be delivered to abattoir in an annual contract period. Additional project costs included contract development and oversight, landholder engagement, training and animal welfare auditing. Pet-meating, by way of ground culling and in-field butchering for meat storage in mobile refrigeration units, was also supported by the AFCMP via measures to increase harvest efficiency such as satellite tracking, aerial spotting and improved road access. However, pet-meating ceased mid-project due to changed industry demands. Post-AFCMP, mustering operations continue to service market demand for camel meat. The camel industry is also looking to camel farming to ensure greater continuity and quality of supply than can be achieved through wild harvest.

TI  - Assessing Environmental Impacts Of Urban Growth Using Remote Sensing
JO  - Geo-Spatial Information Science
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper provides a study of the changes in land use in urban environments in two cities, Wuhan, China and western Sydney in Australia. Since mixed pixels are a characteristic of medium resolution images such as Landsat, when used for the classification of urban areas, due to changes in urban ground cover within a pixel, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) together with Super-Resolution Mapping (SRM) are employed to derive class fractions to generate classification maps at a higher spatial resolution using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predicted Wavelet method. Landsat images over the two cities for a 30-year period, are classified in terms of vegetation, buildings, soil and water. The classifications are then processed using Indifrag software to assess the levels of fragmentation caused by changes in the areas of buildings, vegetation, water and soil over the 30 years. The extents of fragmentation of vegetation, buildings, water and soil for the two cities are compared, while the percentages of vegetation are compared with recommended percentages of green space for urban areas for the benefit of health and well-being of inhabitants. Changes in Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) resulting from the urbanization have been assessed for Wuhan and Sydney. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for urban areas are being assessed by researchers to better understand how to achieve the sustainability of cities. © 2020, © 2020 Wuhan University.

TI  - Spatial Estimation And Visualization Of Co<Sub>2</Sub> Emissions For Campus Sustainability: The Case Of King Abdullah University Of Science And Technology (Kaust), Saudi Arabia
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2017
AB  - A total of 21 metric tons of CO2 per person in terms of per capita emissions from consumption of energy was recorded in Saudi Arabia in 2011 and forecasts have shown that this emission of CO2 is increasing. This poses the threat of climate change and global warming and therefore the need for the sustainability of the country. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Vision for 2030 addresses environmental sustainability that includes a reduction in CO2 emissions as well as diversified economic growth. Universities have been regarded as institutions with significant responsibilities to resolve the issues of sustainability as well as serve as role model to society by implementing a sustainability plan. This study established a spatial evaluation, estimation, and visualization of the CO2 emissions of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. The data required for this study were collected from the overall coverage of the university campus buildings by transforming raster data from the satellite image to vector data in the form of polygons, and then multiplying the area by the number of floors of the individual building. ArcGIS 10.3((R)) (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) software was used for this campus CO2 emissions evaluation and visualization. The overall estimate of the CO2 emissions for the university campus was 127.7-tons CO2 equivalent. The lowest emission was 0.02-tons CO2 equivalent while the maximum value was 20.9-tons of CO2 equivalent. By this ArcGIS-based evaluation, it is evident that geographically integrated model for campus estimation and visualization of CO2 emissions provides the information for decision makers to develop viable strategies for achieving a higher standard in overall campus sustainability and addressing the issue of climate change.

AB  - Building detection is an important task for disaster management and urban area planning. Many papers are already published to provide the solution of building detection but they are failed with insufficient accuracy. This paper provides a advanced and efficient solution for building detection process using the novel Tetra wavelet method. Tetra wavelet process deals with tetra images wh ich are derived from the original grayscale image. Also it handles the pixel values in between 0 to 3 which is also in terms of tetra. The Tetra wavelet process approaches wavelet procedure which is constructed by XOR operation. The fmal building detection is controlled by the eight component connectivity method. This approach is suitable for all types of satellite image building detection problems. The experimental result shows that the proposed method improves the segmentation accuracy at a significant level. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Environmental Awareness And Vulnerability In The Yellow River Delta: Results Based On A Comprehensive Household Survey
JO  - Ocean and Coastal Management
PY  - 2016
AB  - In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive survey concerning environmental awareness and vulnerability, conducted in October 2013 in the Yellow River Delta, China. The purpose of this survey is to provide insight to the vulnerability of rural households and their livelihoods to internal and external threats, such as flooding, oil spills, droughts, erosion, and salinization. Education level, awareness, opinions regarding pollution and available public utilities and facilities are also polled. Specific questions regarding agriculture and aquaculture activities are included. It is the most comprehensive questionnaire regarding social vulnerability in the area to date, with 93 households interviewed with the aid of an interpreter. The results show that the respondents generally have a low education; many earn below minimum wage for the area, and are not aware of global processes of climate variability and sea level rise. Cotton and maize are the predominant agriculture crops farmed in the area, while ground salinization is a major threat to agriculture. The results of this survey can be used in a follow up study in conjunction with a separate spatial data analysis (e.g. earth observation, census) to assess the social vulnerability in the Yellow River Delta in a spatially representative fashion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Producing Liminal Legality
JO  - Denver Law Review
PY  - 2015
AB  - Inside and outside of the sphere of immigration law, liminal legal statuses are proliferating. These legal categories function simultaneously as a means to effectuate administrative resource conservation through community-oriented risk management strategies and as a form of "preservation through transformation" that enable governmental actors to reassert and maintain control over populations identified as risky in ways that do not trigger the rights-protective schemes that evolved both internationally and domestically in the mid-Twentieth Century. This Article uses the existing literature on liminal legal subjects as a starting point for understanding and critiquing the legal mechanisms that produce liminal legality. Part I discusses the taxonomical features of liminal legality identified in studies focusing on the life experiences of marginalized noncitizens. These features include uncertainty about the scope of reprieve from banishment, a reliance on administrative grace to effectuate freedom from banishment, an obligation to pay one's way to prevent that banishment, experiences of heightened monitoring by governmental actors, and a related vulnerability to control, exclusion, and abuse by private actors. Part II tests the possibility of expanding notions of liminal legality outside of the iconic cases of noncitizens granted temporary reprieves from removal. This section expands the analysis first to other, more legally privileged noncitizens, then to citizens in immigrant communities, and finally to broader classes of citizens with relatively high rates of contact with law enforcement agents. This analysis highlights the commonalities of the legal structures that regulate and punish these diverse categories of individuals and communities that experience liminal legality. Part III explores the potential benefits that transubstantive legal analysis focusing on liminal legality offers over more subject-specific frames like "crimmigration." Framing legal analysis in terms of liminal legality could both check unjustifiable presumptions of immigration law exceptionality and foster the identification of the common regulatory practices that have generated a broader social normalization of liminal legality. Additionally, a focus on the legal production of liminal legality may, in fact, open up a path to return crimmigration scholarship to its deeper theoretical grounding in membership theory, thereby reinvigorating the discussion of the role that race, class, and place play in structuring governance strategies both at the border of criminal and immigration law and beyond it.

TI  - Analytical Expressions Of Radiocarbon Distribution In Transient State Unconfined Aquifers And Their Application To Determination Of Past And Present Recharges Of North Africa Aquifers
JO  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
PY  - 2021
AB  - In this study, we developed two-dimensional hydrodynamic age expressions for the free-surface aquifer problem required for radiocarbon data interpretation in terms of recharge. Time-varying recharge is accounted for in fully transient or pseudo-steady state alternative analytical expressions applying to weakly or highly hydraulically reactive unconfined aquifers, respectively. These expressions extend the well-known model proposed by Vogel in 1967 and represent a convenient alternative approach to the more complex numerical solution of a particle tracking problem considering climate variability. An application of the developed expressions was carried out to assess past (40 Kyr) and present recharge rates for the North Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS) and the Djeffara plain (Tunisia-Libya). Using the available C-14 data at different outcrops, we obtained local recharge values ranging from 0.2 +/- 1.7 to 4.5 +/- 3.2 mm yr(-1). Here, it is shown that using the standard purely steady-state model for radiocarbon interpretation leads to a present recharge overestimation of up to 360\%. A linear relation between the present recharge and the average annual rainfall was obtained and used to identify the regional distribution of the recharge and domain-averaged values. Global values of 1.6 +/- 2.3 mm yr(-1) for the NWSAS and 3.5 +/- 2.3 mm yr(-1) for the Djeffara are in excellent agreement with the values obtained by hydrogeological models and derived using Satellite gravity data. The relation between recharge and rainfall obtained here can be used as a first-order estimate for hydrogeological modeling or water management analysis for aquifers in the Saharan area.

TI  - Ontogenetic Shifts From Social To Experiential Learning Drive Avian Migration Timing
JO  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
PY  - 2021
AB  - Learning from one's own experience, and/or social learning from older individuals, could influence decision-making in migrating birds. Here the authors analyse 16 years of tracking data on whooping cranes to show that whether social or experiential learning is the dominant process in migration timing depends on life stage. Migrating animals may benefit from social or experiential learning, yet whether and how these learning processes interact or change over time to produce observed migration patterns remains unexplored. Using 16 years of satellite-tracking data from 105 reintroduced whooping cranes, we reveal an interplay between social and experiential learning in migration timing. Both processes dramatically improved individuals' abilities to dynamically adjust their timing to track environmental conditions along the migration path. However, results revealed an ontogenetic shift in the dominant learning process, whereby subadult birds relied on social information, while mature birds primarily relied on experiential information. These results indicate that the adjustment of migration phenology in response to the environment is a learned skill that depends on both social context and individual age. Assessing how animals successfully learn to time migrations as environmental conditions change is critical for understanding intraspecific differences in migration patterns and for anticipating responses to global change.

TI  - Lsfusenet: Dual-Fusion Of Landsat-8 And Sentinel-2 Multispectral Time Series For Permutation Invariant Applications
JO  - 2023 IEEE 10th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, DSAA 2023 - Proceedings
PY  - 2023
AB  - Satellite data provides valuable insights into environmental changes and natural resource management, such as monitoring deforestation, mapping land use changes, and identifying areas at risk of soil degradation. Landsat-8 and Sentine1-2 are the publicly available high spatial resolution satellites launched in recent years. But, both have a moderate temporal resolution which limits their use in the applications like precision agriculture, land cover mapping, disaster monitoring, etc. For such applications, daily or weekly monitoring is better suited. Fusing data from the two satellites can provide enhanced observations. Both Landsat-8 and Sentine1-2 satellites have the same geographic coordinate systems which makes them amiable for fusion. But, fusing data at the pixel level for these satellites is challenging as they visit the same location on different days. The proposed model 'LSFuseNet' effectively fuses data at the feature level. It is a dual-fusion model in which bi-directional cross-modal attention is used to identify and exchange the hotspot information in the two modalities. A feature alignment module learns the fine-grained features and mitigates the noise in the data. We have innovatively applied contrastive learning to improve the quality of the learned representations of the data from the two satellites. We evaluate our model for two applications - crop yield prediction and snow cover prediction. For crop yield prediction, we have taken two crops, viz. corn, and soybean, for approximately 500 counties in the US. For snow cover prediction, we considered approximately 1300 US counties. Our extensive experiments show that LSFuseNet outperforms competing models. Also, the benefit of fusing the data from two satellites over using the data from a single satellite is evident from the results of both applications. We have further modified the model to include meteorological and/or soil data (if applicable) to further enhance the performance of the model. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Fine Scale Mapping Of Fractional Tree Canopy Cover To Support River Basin Management
JO  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
PY  - 2021
AB  - Management of water, regionally, nationally and globally will continue to be a priority and complex undertaking. In riverine systems, biotic components like flora and fauna play critical roles in filtering water so it is available for human use and consumption. Preservation of ecosystems and associated ecosystem functions is therefore vital. In highly regulated large river basins, natural ecosystems are often supported through provision of environmental flows. Flow delivery, however, should be underpinned by rigorous monitoring to identify and prioritise biotic water requirements. Currently, large-scale monitoring solutions are scaled from remote sensing data via measurement of field evapotranspiration for woody tree vegetation species. However, as there is generally a mismatch between field data collection area and remote sensing pixel size, new methods are required to proportion tree evapotranspiration based on tree fractional canopy area per pixel. We present a novel method to derive tree fractional canopy cover (FTCC) at 20 m resolution in semi-arid and arid floodplain areas. The method employs LiDAR as a canopy area field measurement proxy (10 m resolution). We used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (radar and multispectral imagery) in a Random Forest analysis, undertaken to develop a predictive FTCC model trained using LiDAR for two regions in the Murray-Darling Basin. A predictor model combining the results of both regions was able to explain between 71\%-85\% of FTCC variation when compared to LiDAR FTCC when output in 10\% increments. Development of this method underpins the advancement of woody vegetation monitoring to inform environmental flow management in the Murray-Darling Basin. The method and fine scale outputs will also be of value to other catchment management concerns such as altered catchment water yields related to bushfires and as such has application to water management worldwide.

TI  - Cloud-Based Analysis Of Large-Scale Hyperspectral Imagery For Oil Spill Detection
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2024
AB  - Spectral indices are of fundamental importance in providing insights into the distinctive characteristics of oil spills, making them indispensable tools for effective action planning. The normalized difference oil index (NDOI) is a reliable metric and suitable for the detection of coastal oil spills, effectively leveraging the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral bands offered by commercial sensors. The present study explores the calculation of NDOI with a primary focus on leveraging remotely sensed imagery with rich spectral data. This undertaking necessitates a robust infrastructure to handle and process large datasets, thereby demanding significant memory resources and ensuring scalability. To overcome these challenges, a novel cloud-based approach is proposed in this study to conduct the distributed implementation of the NDOI calculation. This approach offers an accessible and intuitive solution, empowering developers to harness the benefits of cloud platforms. The evaluation of the proposal is conducted by assessing its performance using the scene acquired by the airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor during the 2010 oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The catastrophic nature of the event and the subsequent challenges underscore the importance of remote sensing (RS) in facilitating decision-making processes. In this context, cloud-based approaches have emerged as a prominent technological advancement in the RS field. The experimental results demonstrate noteworthy performance by the proposed cloud-based approach and pave the path for future research for fast decision-making applications in scalable environments. © 2008-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Development Of An Online Tool For Tsunami Inundation Simulation And Tsunami Loss Estimation
JO  - Continental Shelf Research
PY  - 2014
AB  - The devastating impacts of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the need for an effective end-to-end tsunami early warning system in the region that connects the scientific components of warning with preparedness of institutions and communities to respond to an emergency. Essential to preparedness planning is knowledge of tsunami risks. In this study, development of an online tool named "INSPIRE" for tsunami inundation simulation and tsunami loss estimation is presented. The tool is designed to accommodate various accuracy levels of tsunami exposure data which will support the users to undertake preliminary tsunami risk assessment from the existing data with progressive improvement with the use of more detailed and accurate datasets. Sampling survey technique is introduced to improve the local vulnerability data with lower cost and manpower. The performance of the proposed methodology and the INSPIRE tool were tested against the dataset in Kamala and Patong municipalities, Phuket province, Thailand. The estimated building type ratios from the sampling survey show the satisfactory agreement with the actual building data at the test sites. Sub-area classification by land use can improve the accuracy of the building type ratio estimation. For the resulting loss estimation, the exposure data generated from detailed field survey can provide the agreeable results when comparing to the actual building damage recorded for the Indian Ocean tsunami event in 2004. However, lower accuracy exposure data derived from sampling survey and remote sensing can still provide a comparative overview of estimated loss. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - From Landslide Characterization To Nature Reserve Management: The "Scialimata Grande Di Torre Alfina" Landslide Geosite (Central Apennines, Italy)
JO  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Italy is characterized by widespread geomorphological instability, among which landslides leave impressive marks on the landscape. Nevertheless, landslide bodies may represent key sites for thematic and educational itineraries, especially in protected areas, where their management becomes an important issue. Our study focuses on the "Monte Rufeno Nature Reserve" (Central Apennines, Italy), where iconic landslides are present. Here, the "Scialimata Grande di Torre Alfina" landslide (SGTA) is listed in the regional Geosite database. This work aims to propose a multiscale procedure for landslide analysis, in terms of both hazard sources but also educational and geoheritage enhancement opportunities in natural reserves. After performing a Landslide Susceptibility conditional Analysis (LSA) for the reserve territory, attention was focused on the SGTA, to define properly its features and morphodynamics. A multi-disciplinary approach was adopted, by applying both remote sensing (UAV structure from motion, Photointerpretation) and field survey (geomorphological and GPS monitoring). From the LSA, based on drainage density, curvature, and slope triggering factors, the road and trail susceptibility maps were derived, as base tools for future risk assessments and trail paths management within the reserve. At the SGTA scale, the monitoring showed a displacement of up to 23 m during the time interval between 2015 and 2018. The landslide dynamics seem to be driven by alternating dry and extremely wet periods; moreover, leaks from the aqueduct in the detachment area and piping effects through clays may have also decreased the substrate cohesion. The SGTA complex influence on the Paglia River valley geometry was also hypothesized, underlining the action of landslide through different spatial scales (on-site and off-site) and on different environment features (sediment connectivity, hydrology). Finally, the SGTA appears highly representative of the geomorphic dynamics within the Nature Reserve (i.e., scientific value) and it could be classified as an active geosite. Since the site was featured by a tourist trail, adequate management strategies must be adopted, considering the educational value and safety issues.

TI  - A Wood Density And Aboveground Biomass Variability Assessment Using Pre-Felling Inventory Data In Costa Rica
JO  - Carbon Balance and Management
PY  - 2014
AB  - Background: The high spatio-temporal variability of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is a large source of uncertainty in forest carbon stock estimation. Due to their spatial distribution and sampling intensity, pre-felling inventories are a potential source of ground level data that could help reduce this uncertainty at larger spatial scales. Further, exploring the factors known to influence tropical forest biomass, such as wood density and large tree density, will improve our knowledge of biomass distribution across tropical regions. Here, we evaluate (1) the variability of wood density and (2) the variability of AGB across five ecosystems of Costa Rica. Results: Using forest management (pre-felling) inventories we found that, of the regions studied, Huetar Norte had the highest mean wood density of trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than or equal to 30 cm, 0.623 ± 0.182 g cm-3 (mean ± standard deviation). Although the greatest wood density was observed in Huetar Norte, the highest mean estimated AGB (EAGB) of trees with a DBH greater than or equal to 30 cm was observed in Osa peninsula (173.47 ± 60.23 Mg ha-1). The density of large trees explained approximately 50% of EAGB variability across the five ecosystems studied. Comparing our study's EAGB to published estimates reveals that, in the regions of Costa Rica where AGB has been previously sampled, our forest management data produced similar values. Conclusions: This study presents the most spatially rich analysis of ground level AGB data in Costa Rica to date. Using forest management data, we found that EAGB within and among five Costa Rican ecosystems is highly variable. Combining commercial logging inventories with ecological plots will provide a more representative ground level dataset for the calibration of the models and remotely sensed data used to EAGB at regional and national scales. Additionally, because the non-protected areas of the tropics offer the greatest opportunity to reduce rates of deforestation and forest degradation, logging inventories offer a promising source of data to support mechanisms such as the United Nations REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Tropical Deforestation and Degradation) program. © 2014 Svob et al.; licensee Springer.

TI  - The Utility Of Airborne Hyperspectral And Satellite Multispectral Images In Identifying Natura 2000 Non-Forest Habitats For Conservation Purposes
JO  - Scientific Reports
PY  - 2023
AB  - Aerial hyperspectral and multispectral satellite data are the two most commonly used datasets to identify natural and semi-natural vegetation. However, there is no documented analysis based on data from several areas concerning the difference in the classification accuracy of non-forest Natura 2000 habitat with the use of aerial hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data. Also, there is no recommendation, on which habitat can be classified with sufficient accuracy using free multispectral images. This study aimed to analyse the difference in classification accuracy of Natura 2000 habitats representing: meadows, grasslands, heaths and mires between data with different spectral resolutions and the results utility for nature conservation compared to conventional maps. The analysis was conducted in five study areas in Poland. The classification was performed on multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) and hyperspectral HySpex (HS) images using the Random Forest algorithm. Based on the results, it can be stated that the use of HS data resulted in higher classification accuracy, on average 0.14, than using S2 images, regardless of the area of the habitat. However, the difference in accuracy was not constant, varying by area and habitat characterisation. Greater differences in accuracy were observed for areas where habitats were characterised by high α-diversity or β-diversity. The HS and S2 data make it possible to create maps that provide a great deal of new knowledge about the distribution of Natura 2000 habitats, which is necessary for the management of protected areas. The obtained results indicate that by using S2 images it is possible to identify, at a satisfactory level, alluvial meadows and grassland. For heaths and mires, using HS data improved the results, but it is also possible to acquire general distribution of these classes, whereas HS images are obligatory for mapping salt, Molinia and lowland hay meadows. © 2023, The Author(s).

TI  - A Practical Remote Sensing Monitoring Framework For Late Frost Damage In Wine Grapes Using Multi-Source Satellite Data
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Late frost damage is one of the main meteorological disasters that affect the growth of wine grapes in spring, causing a decline in wine grapes quality and a reduction in yield in North-west China. At present, remote sensing technology has been widely used in the field of crop meteorological disasters monitoring and loss assessments, but little research has been carried out on late frost damage in wine grapes. To monitor the impact of late frost in wine grapes accurately and quickly, in this research, we selected the Ningxia planting area as the study area. A practical framework of late frost damage on wine grapes by integrating visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared satellite data is proposed. This framework includes: (1) Wine grape planting area extraction using Gaofen-1 (GF-1), Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 based on optimal feature selection and Random Forest (RF) algorithm; (2) retrieval of the land surface temperature (LST) using Landsat-8 thermal infrared data; (3) data fusion using Landsat-8 LST and MODIS LST for a high spatiotemporal resolution of LST with the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM); (4) the estimation of daily minimum air temperature (Tmin) using downscaled LST and meteorological station data; (5) monitoring and evaluation of the degree of late frost damage in wine grapes in April 2020 by combining satellite-derived data and late frost indicators. The results show that the total area of wine grapes extracted in Ningxia was about 39,837 ha. The overall accuracy was 90.47%, the producer’s accuracy was 91.09%, and the user’s accuracy was 90.22%. The root mean square (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) of the Tmin estimation model were 1.67 ℃ and 0.91, respectively. About 41.12% of the vineyards suffered severe late frost damage, and the total affected area was about 16,381 ha during April 20–25, 2020. This suggests the satellite data can accurately monitor late frost damage in wine grapes by mapping the wine grape area and estimating Tmin. The results can help farmers to take remedial measures to reduce late frost damage in wine grapes, and provide an objective evaluation of late frost damage insurance claims for wine grapes. With the increasing weather extremes, this study has an important reference value for standardized global wine grape management and food security planning. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Deforestation monitoring is changing the nature of conservation practices in increasingly profound ways. This study illustrates how forest co-management by means of earth-observation technologies among Indigenous communities opens up new debates and perspectives on transformational actions for inclusion and equity in globalization. We analyze cases of drone adoption by the Shipibo Conibo and other Indigenous people on both sides (Peru and Brazil) of the Sierra del Divisor National Park. Our findings indicate that these technology adoptions may be inclusive and beneficial when combined with indigenous knowledge and alternative understandings of forest politics. First, we specify how counter-mapping initiatives grounded in Indigenous communities may be steered towards developing new co-participation and co-design. Second, we identify five key parameters for assessing whether co-participation and co-design during technological adoptions. Third, we assess the short- and long-term benefits, risks and threats in these technological adoption processes, drawing on indigenous perspectives. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessing Spatio-Temporal Variability Of Wildfires And Their Impact On Sub-Saharan Ecosystems And Air Quality Using Multisource Remotely Sensed Data And Trend Analysis
JO  - SUSTAINABILITY
PY  - 2019
AB  - Globally, wildfires are considered the most commonly occurring disasters, resulting from natural and anthropogenic ignition sources. Wildfires consist of burning standing biomass at erratic degrees of intensity, severity, and frequency. Consequently, wildfires generate large amounts of smoke and other toxic pollutants that have devastating impacts on ambient air quality and human health. There is, therefore, a need for a comprehensive study that characterizes land atmosphere interactions with regard to wildfires, critical for understanding the interrelated and multidimensional impacts of wildfires. Current studies have a limited scope and a narrow focus, usually only focusing on one aspect of wildfire impacts, such as air quality without simultaneously considering the impacts on land surface changes and vice versa. In this study, we use several multisource data to determine the spatial distribution, frequency, disturbance characteristics of and variability and distribution of pollutants emitted by wildfires. The specific objectives were to (1) study the sources of wildfires and the period they are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa over a 9 year period, i.e., 2007-2016, (2) estimate the seasonal disturbance of wildfires on various vegetation types, (3) determine the spatial distribution of black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke, and (4) determine the vertical height distribution of smoke. The results show largest burned areas in December January February (DJF), June July August (JJA) and September October November (SON) seasons, and reciprocal high emissions of BC, CO, and smoke, as observed by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). In addition, the results reveal an increasing trend in the magnitude of BC, and CO concentration driven by meteorological conditions such as low precipitation, low relative humidity, and low latent heat flux. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of multisource remotely sensed data in characterising long-term wildfire patterns and associated emissions. The results in this study are critical for informing better regional fire management and air quality control strategies to preserve endangered species and habitats, promote sustainable land management, and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions.

TI  - Developing A Virtual Grassland Ecosystem Website: Methodologies And Implementation - For Sharing Research And Outreach Information
JO  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
PY  - 2006
AB  - There is much data and information about grassland ecosystems in China but it is scattered throughout the country and only partially shared. Thus, it is difficult for scientists to adequately study relationships between communities of grassland plants and their environment and the changes that are occurring in the various grassland ecosystems. In addition, it is difficult for government decision-makers to assess the current status and important trends. This study examined the methodology of establishing a "web-based virtual grassland ecology system" for China by applying ecological concepts and new digital technologies. Grassland ecosystems can be conceptualized as multidimensional spaces. Any point within the system may be identified by latitude, longitude, and elevation. In addition, vegetation type, extent of cover, biomass yield, soil type, climate attributes, and other characteristics are spatially variable. This research project chose 10 primary attributes to characterize the grassland ecosystem. The attribute database was applied spatially to a digital elevation model. This was then integrated with dynamic information in the form of remote-sensing images. Technologies applied included Java Applet programming and ASP software within the framework of a GIS, with the system delivered over the Internet to the global scientific community. The current URL is: http://www.grassland.net.cn. For any point on the map of China, the current system provides 10 attributes (latitude, longitude, elevation, vegetation type, soil type, annual average precipitation, annual average temperature, accumulated temperature greater than 10°C, above ground biomass, and local district name). Users can also specify a single attribute (such as vegetation type) for the system to find its geographic distribution and area. In addition, if multi-attributes are specified, eg. temperate grassland, chestnut soil, precipitation < 300 mm, and elevation between 800 and 1500 m, the system will quickly display the geographic distribution and area which matches the four conditions of the query. This draft system uses a novel approach and current electronic technologies to display characteristics of Chinese grasslands on the Internet. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility and value of WebGIS and Java technologies. The system offers a virtual platform for cooperative research for scientists engaged in the field of grassland ecology, allowing for organization of large amounts of data and synthesis of new information by integration of various data types.

TI  - Delivering Wildlife Habitat On Productive Agricultural Lands Cost-Effectively: The Case Of Migratory Shorebirds On California Rice Lands
JO  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
PY  - 2023
AB  - Promoting wildlife habitat on working agricultural land is a growing conservation priority, and agri-environment schemes are using payments for environmental services (PES) to reach these privately owned lands. PES can be ecologically effective, but also expensive, putting pressure on these schemes to be cost-effective, maximizing the conservation value of their limited resources. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of four PES schemes in California that paid rice growers to provide temporary flood habitat on their working lands in support of shorebirds. It examines whether the schemes (1) paid for flood habitat only when needed (targeting); (2) paid for habitat that was actually delivered and would not otherwise be provided (additionality); (3) sacrificed as little habitat as possible when the habitat competed with production (ag/wildlife balance); and (4) fostered a commitment among growers to maintain the habitat after payments ended (permanence). Results show that the schemes fell short in each of the four goals, and they expose several factors that undermined their cost-effectiveness. First, variable weather patterns altered the date in which the shorebird-habitat gap emerged year-to-year, creating a dynamic and unpredictable target for the schemes to address. Second, growers' views on the compatibility of the flood habitat with their rice production varied widely and changed rapidly as the agricultural calendar progressed, making it a challenge to mitigate potential ag/wildlife conflicts. Third, water for flood habitat is expensive, and growers proved unwilling to shoulder that expense once payments ended. These results highlight the need for schemes to adopt design elements that can add flexibility, such as cancelation clauses, so that they can adjust to dynamic targets and adapt to changing ag/wildlife relationships. Results also suggest that PES schemes operating on working lands may require long-term external support. That finding amplifies the imperative that schemes use their conservation resources cost-effectively.

TI  - User-Relevant Land Cover Products For Informed Decision-Making In The Complex Terrain Of The Peruvian Andes
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - Land cover in mountainous regions is shaped by a complex web of stressors arising from natural and anthropogenic processes. The co-design process implemented with regional stakeholders in this study highlighted persistent data gaps and the need for locally relevant (thematic, spatial, and temporal) data products, which global alternatives still fail to deliver. This study describes the development of a land cover database designed for the Junin National Reserve (JNR) in Peru as a precursor of a broader effort designed to serve Andean wetland ecosystems. The products were created using Random Forest models leveraging Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and trained using a large database of in situ data enhanced by the use of high-resolution commercial imagery (Planet). The land cover basemap includes eight classes (two of vegetation) with an overall accuracy of 0.9 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.93. A second product further subdivided vegetation into locally meaningful vegetation classes, for a total of four types (overall accuracy of 0.85). Finally, a surface water product (snapshot and frequency) delivered a representation of the highly variable water extent around Lake Junin. It was the result of a model incorporating 150 Sentinel-1 images from 2016 to 2021 (an overall accuracy of 0.91). The products were successfully employed in identifying 133 ecosystem services provided by the different land cover classes existing in the JNR. The study highlights the value of participatory monitoring and open-data sharing for enhanced stewardship of social-ecological systems.

TI  - Innovating In A Crisis: A Qualitative Evaluation Of A Hospital And Google Partnership To Implement A Covid-19 Inpatient Video Monitoring Program
JO  - Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association
PY  - 2022
AB  - Objective: To describe adaptations necessary for effective use of direct-to-consumer (DTC) cameras in an inpatient setting, from the perspective of health care workers. Methods: Our qualitative study included semi-structured interviews and focus groups with clinicians, information technology (IT) personnel, and health system leaders affiliated with the Mount Sinai Health System. All participants either worked in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit with DTC cameras or participated in the camera implementation. Three researchers coded the transcripts independently and met weekly to discuss and resolve discrepancies. Abiding by inductive thematic analysis, coders revised the codebook until they reached saturation. All transcripts were coded in Dedoose using the final codebook. Results: Frontline clinical staff, IT personnel, and health system leaders (N = 39) participated in individual interviews and focus groups in November 2020-April 2021. Our analysis identified 5 areas for effective DTC camera use: Technology, patient monitoring, workflows, interpersonal relationships, and infrastructure. Participants described adaptations created to optimize camera use and opportunities for improvement necessary for sustained use. Non-COVID-19 patients tended to decline participation. Discussion: Deploying DTC cameras on inpatient units required adaptations in many routine processes. Addressing consent, 2-way communication issues, patient privacy, and messaging about video monitoring could help facilitate a nimble rollout. Implementation and dissemination of inpatient video monitoring using DTC cameras requires input from patients and frontline staff. Conclusions: Given the resources and time it takes to implement a usable camera solution, other health systems might benefit from creating task forces to investigate their use before the next crisis. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Biodiversity Mapping Via Natura 2000 Conservation Status And Ebv Assessment Using Airborne Laser Scanning In Alkali Grasslands
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives
PY  - 2016
AB  - Biodiversity is an ecological concept, which essentially involves a complex sum of several indicators. One widely accepted such set of indicators is prescribed for habitat conservation status assessment within Natura 2000, a continental-scale conservation programme of the European Union. Essential Biodiversity Variables are a set of indicators designed to be relevant for biodiversity and suitable for global-scale operational monitoring. Here we revisit a study of Natura 2000 conservation status mapping via airbone LIDAR that develops individual remote sensing-derived proxies for every parameter required by the Natura 2000 manual, from the perspective of developing regional-scale Essential Biodiversity Variables. Based on leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds (10 pt/m2) collected in an alkali grassland area, a set of data products were calculated at 0.5 ×0.5 m resolution. These represent various aspects of radiometric and geometric texture. A Random Forest machine learning classifier was developed to create fuzzy vegetation maps of classes of interest based on these data products. In the next step, either classification results or LIDAR data products were selected as proxies for individual Natura 2000 conservation status variables, and fine-tuned based on field references. These proxies showed adequate performance and were summarized to deliver Natura 2000 conservation status with 80% overall accuracy compared to field references. This study draws attention to the potential of LIDAR for regional-scale Essential Biodiversity variables, and also holds implications for global-scale mapping. These are (i) the use of sensor data products together with habitat-level classification, (ii) the utility of seasonal data, including for non-seasonal variables such as grassland canopy structure, and (iii) the potential of fuzzy mapping-derived class probabilities as proxies for species presence and absence.

TI  - A Reliable Gis-Based Fahp-Ftopsis Model To Prioritize Urban Water Supply Management Scenarios: A Case Study In Semi-Arid Climate
JO  - Sustainable Cities and Society
PY  - 2022
AB  - The growing problem of urban water shortage and its sustainable management methods is one of today's critical research needs globally. This paper applies an integration of the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) with the help of triangular fuzzy sets to manage urban water supply priorities in a semi-arid region. Hence, a group decision-making approach was proposed by combining the Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) and the Fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) models based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. Therefore, a hierarchical model-based GIS and AHP was developed to classify the effective criteria and determine the Importance Weights (IWs) of criteria according to the experts’ opinions and using data layers based on spatial criteria. The priority ranking of scenarios was obtained using the FTOPSIS method. Different criteria such as environmental, geographical, geological, economic, climatic, and social conditions were considered in this study. Furthermore, to assess the water supply scenarios under the essential water demands of the basin cities and suburbs, a hydrologic model utilizing WEAP software was designed. Among the considered criteria, total expense, climatic conditions, and geographic conditions with the IWs values of 0.9, 0.85, and 0.83 were determined as the most effective criteria for evaluating the scenarios' ranking, respectively. © 2022

TI  - Controls On Anastomosis In Lowland River Systems: Towards Process-Based Solutions To Habitat Conservation
JO  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
PY  - 2017
AB  - Anastomosing rivers were historically common around the world before extensive agricultural and industrial development in river valleys. Few lowland anastomosing rivers remain in temperate zones, and the protection of these river-floodplain systems is an international conservation priority. However, the mechanisms that drive the creation and maintenance of multiple channels, i.e. anabranches, are not well understood, particularly for lowland rivers, making it challenging to identify effective management strategies. This study uses a novel multi-scale, process-based hydro-geomorphological approach to investigate the natural and anthropogenic controls on anastomosis in lowland river reaches. Using a wide range of data (hydrologic, cartographic, remote-sensing, historical), the study (i) quantifies changes in the planform of the River Narew, Poland over the last 100 years, (ii) documents changes in the natural and anthropogenic factors that could be driving the geomorphic change, and (iii) develops a conceptual model of the controls of anastomosis. The results show that 110 km of anabranches have been lost from the Narew National Park (6810 ha), a 42\% reduction in total anabranch length since 1900. The rates of anabranch loss have increased as the number of pressures inhibiting anabranch creation and maintenance has multiplied. The cessation of localized water level and channel management (fishing dams, water mills and timber rafting), the loss of traditional floodplain activities (seasonal mowing) and infrastructure construction (embanked roads and an upstream dam) are contributing to low water levels and flows, the deposition of sediment at anabranch inlets, the encroachment of common reed (Phragmites australis), and the eventual loss of anabranches. By identifying the processes driving the loss of anabranches, this study provides transferable insights into the controls of anastomosis in lowland rivers and the management solutions needed to preserve the unique anastomosing river pattern and diverse wet grasslands that are central to the conservation value of lowland floodplains.

TI  - A Multi-Resolution Probabilistic Ocean Current Forecasting System For Offshore Energy Operations
JO  - Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference
PY  - 2018
AB  - We present a multi-resolution probabilistic ocean forecasting system designed to support offshore energy operations worldwide. The system is composed of an integrated suite of ocean circulation models including a global model of 25 km resolution, Atlantic and Indian Ocean models of 6 km resolution, and 8 fine scale models (< 3 km resolution) for high-priority regions such as the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Brazil, West Africa, and the Caribbean. It expands on current ocean prediction systems through exclusive access to proprietary data streams, state-of-the-art data assimilation methods and ensemble modeling capabilities. The global and basin scale models incorporate large-scale information from satellite and in-situ observations and provide initial and boundary conditions for the regional models. The regional scale models then dynamically downscale the initial and boundary conditions to produce both deterministic and probabilistic fine-scale forecasts for regions of interest. The system has been validated for consistency, quality, and accuracy against a suite of publicly available models and field observations (Remotely sensed observations, ARGO float data and Drifting Buoys). Results show that the system compares favorably to other leading ocean current forecasting systems such as HYCOM and the Mercator system. Experiments in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that the finescale forecasts are further improved by using proprietary data streams and when operated in an ensemble (probabilistic) mode they also provide robust quantification of uncertainty in forecasts. The system has been operational since the beginning of 2017, providing daily 7-day forecasts of ocean currents. Additionally, 20-year hindcasts for some regions are in progress and outputs will be available for extreme value analysis for planning and structural design. It is expected that Ocean current hindcasts and forecasts through the new system will translate to increased situational awareness, reduced downtime, improved environmental protection, and safety.

TI  - Object-Based Image Analysis (Obia) For Mapping Mangrove Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Uav) On Tidung Kecil Island, Kepulauan Seribu, Dki Jakarta Province
JO  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
PY  - 2021
AB  - Tidung Kecil Island is a conservation and mangrove cultivation area. Therefore, the potential of mangrove ecosystems on Tidung Kecil Island will have a direct role in coastal ecosystems. Accurate mangrove mapping is necessary for the effective planning and management of ecosystems and resources because mangroves function as protectors of ecological systems. The utilization of remote sensing technology that is near real-time can be used as an alternative in providing spatial data effectively. Mapping earth's surface objects method is growing especially after the development of design, research, and production of flexible Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. The use of object-based classification methods is currently an alternative in classifying an object of the Earth's surface using both satellite and aerial photo imagery data (orthophoto) that has a high accuracy value. This research aim is to map object based mangrove ecosystems using UAV technology on Tidung Kecil Island, Kepulauan Seribu, DKI Jakarta. The K-NN algorithm result was a good classification with 81.081% overall accuracy (OA) at the optimum value of the MRS segmentation scale 300;0,1;0.7 and divided into two classes which are mangrove and non-mangrove for 0.381 ha and 20.912 ha respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Typological Fragility Curves For Rc Buildings: Influence Of Damage Index And Building Sample Selection
JO  - Engineering Structures
PY  - 2022
AB  - The recent earthquakes occurred in the last years in Italy registered a great number of casualties and large economic losses. In this perspective, the effective seismic risk assessment has become crucial for the Government mitigation policies that have to allocate the limited economic sources for the risk reduction. In this paper, data collected after the 2012 Emilia and the 2009 L'Aquila, Italy, earthquakes were used to derive novel fragility curves for RC frame buildings classes. Compared to previous studies, different aspects affecting the fragility curves parameters were investigated. First of all, data are completed accounting for the presence of undamaged buildings that are generally uninspected after the seismic events, considering alternative criteria to complete the database. Then, the influence of the building damage index definition was considered by selecting four damage indices available in the literature that allow converting the damage data collected with the post-earthquake form into one of the five damage states, according to the European macroseismic scale. Separate sets of fragility curves, as a function of peak ground acceleration, were developed for the building stock of the two regions. The results reveal that the database correction with the uninspected buildings is relevant to avoid the overestimation of the exceedance probability, especially at lower peak ground acceleration values, resulting in less steep curves. Then, the building damage indices accounting for the damage of both structural and non-structural elements led to a higher exceedance probability with respect to damage indices based on damage of only structural elements, especially for the lower damage states. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems In The Eastern Tropical Pacific: The Current State Of Knowledge And The Spatial Variability Of Their Depth Boundaries
JO  - Science of the Total Environment
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs) are limited by oceanographic conditions and are thought to be mostly absent. However, considering the currently discussed more flexible approach to define mesophotic boundaries, based on light availability, we performed a systematic search to assess their current state of knowledge. Using MODIS-Aqua satellite data (Kd490), we calculated the mesophotic boundaries in the ETP, based on optical depths, and performed a bibliographic search of studies carried out at those depths, including those present in turbid waters with KdPAR values up to 0.2 m-1. Seventy-seven papers on MCEs research were compiled in this review, recording a total of 138 species. The studies focus almost exclusively on taxonomy, ecosystem function, and reviews, indicating the need for future research regarding aspects, such as structuring environmental variables, molecular ecology, and natural resource management. Furthermore, remote sensing data show that there exists a high spatial variability of water transparency in the ETP, resulting in significant differences in KdPAR between oceanic and continental locations, mostly related to the occurrence of seasonal upwelling in the latter. Based on KdPAR, we estimated the mesophotic depth boundaries (z10%, z1%, z0.1%) for specific locations within the ETP and found that MCEs can potentially occur as shallow as 13-15 m in coastal regions. Also, we compared the calculated boundaries with the respective deepest records of light-dependent corals. With one exception, the presence of the corals was restricted to the upper mesophotic subzone (z10%-z1%), which agrees with reports for other regions, showing that light availability is one of the main drivers for the bathymetric distribution of MCEs and can be used as a first approach to identify their potential presence, though other local factors (e.g., geomorphology, temperature, internal waves) should also be considered, as they can cause shifts in depth limits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Integrating Dynamic Subsurface Habitat Metrics Into Species Distribution Models
JO  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
PY  - 2018
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become key tools for describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain, environmental data used in modeling species distributions are often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako sharks lsurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory power for most species. Model predictive performance also significantly improved, but only for species that had strong affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common thresher sharks). Geospatial predictions for all species showed the integration of isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency contributed value at the mesoscale level (< 100 km) and varied spatially throughout the study domain. These results highlight the utility of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDM development and support the continuing ecological use of biophysical output from ocean circulation models.

TI  - Achieving Land Degradation Neutrality: The Role Of Slm Knowledge In Evidence-Based Decision-Making
JO  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY
PY  - 2019
AB  - WOCAT The World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies with its unique methodology and global Sustainable Land Management (SLM) database - can help promote scaling out of SLM and thus contribute to land degradation neutrality. This paper focuses primarily on three Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) indicators: (i) land cover, (ii) land productivity and (iii) carbon stocks. It is demonstrated what can be achieved by analyzing SLM practices in the database and how these shed light on the LDN indicators. Different stages of interventions - from prevention (avoiding), to reduction (reducing), and restoration (reversing) of Land Degradation (LD) - are differentiated and analyzed. This highlights the fact that most efforts and achievements recorded by WOCAT focus on reducing and preventing LD: that stands in contrast to the current emphasis by many policy makers on the much more costly task of restoration. The use of the WOCAT-LADA (Land Degradation Assessment) mapping approach is illustrated, with a case study from Madagascar. Understanding and integrating mosaic pieces at the local level can help in comprehending impacts at the national and global levels as observed by remotely sensed imagery. Supporting land users with financial resources, an enabling legal framework and, in particular with knowledge and information about SLM practices is a logical and promising way forward to promoting adoption of SLM and, eventually, reaching LDN. With respect to creating an enabling environment for scaling out SLM and supporting land users, the analysis reveals that knowledge is the second greatest constraint after financial resources. This implies that further investment must be made in capacity building and sharing knowledge on impacts of SLM, costs-benefits and the spatial spread of SLM. Furthermore, this knowledge should be linked to a clear SLM mainstreaming and scaling out strategy, which will support countries to reach their LDN targets. A decision support framework was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WOCAT which guides countries in LD and SLM assessments, and the use of the results for formulating and informing SLM mainstreaming and scaling out.

TI  - Baseline Assessment Of Ecological Quality Index (Eqi) Of The Marine Coastal Habitats Of Tonga Archipelago: Application For Management Of Remote Regions In The Pacific
JO  - REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2023
AB  - The loss of coral habitats and associated biodiversity have direct effects both on the physical dynamics of the coast and on natural resources, threatening the survival of local populations. Conservative actions, such as the creation of new Marine Protected Areas, are urgent measures needed to face climate change. Managers need fast and simple methods to evaluate marine habitats for planning conservation areas. Here, we present the application of an Ecological Quality Index (EQI), developed for regional-scale habitat maps of the Atlas of the Marine Coastal Habitats of the Kingdom of Tonga, by processing Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery. Both the habitat mapping classification and the EQI application were focused on the importance of coral reef, seagrass and mangrove habitats, both as natural defense and sustenance for the local populations. Twelve main Pacific reef habitats were evaluated through a three-level EQI score assigned to six parameters: nursery ground, connectivity, species reservoir, fish attraction, biodiversity and primary production. The EQI was integrated into a developed georeferenced database associated to the QGIS software providing the ability to identify on the maps the area of interest and the associated habitats, and to quantify their ecological relevance. The EQI is proposed as a tool that can offer to stakeholders and environmental managers a simple and direct indicator of the value of the marine coastal environment. The index may be handled for management purposes of vast areas with remote and uninhabited islands.

TI  - Estimation Of Vegetation Parameter For Modeling Soil Erosion Using Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis Of Landsat Etm Data
JO  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
PY  - 2007
AB  - Soil conservation planning often requires estimates of soil erosion at a catchment or regional scale. Predictive models such as Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its subsequent Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) are useful tools to generate the quantitative estimates necessary for designing sound conservation measures. However, large-scale soil erosion model-factor parameterization and quantification is difficult due to the costs, labor and time involved. Among the soil erosion parameters, the vegetative cover or C factor has been one of the most difficult to estimate over broad geographic areas. The C factor represents the effects of vegetation canopy and ground covers in reducing soil loss. Traditional methods for the extraction of vegetation information from remote sensing data such as classification techniques and vegetation indices were found to be inaccurate. Thus, this study presents a new approach based on Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) of Landsat ETM data to map the C factor for use in the modeling of soil erosion. A desirable feature of SMA is that it estimates the fractional abundance of ground cover and bare soils simultaneously, which is appropriate for soil erosion analysis. Hence, we estimated the C factor by utilizing the results of SMA on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We specifically used a linear SMA (LSMA) model and performed a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation and pixel purity index (PPI) on Landsat ETM image to derive the proportion of ground cover (vegetation and non-photosynthetic materials) and bare soil within a pixel. The end-members were selected based on the purest pixels found using PPI with reference to very high-resolution QuickBird image and actual field data. Results showed that the C factor value estimated using LSMA correlated strongly with the values measured in the field. The correlation coefficient (r) obtained was 0.94. A comparative analysis between NDVI- and LSMA-derived C factors also proved that the latter produced a more detailed spatial variability, as well as generated more accurate erosion estimates when used as input to RUSLE model. The QuickBird image coupled with field data was used in the validation of results. (C) 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Healthcare Providers’ Perspectives On Using Smart Home Systems To Improve Self-Management And Care In People With Heart Failure: A Qualitative Study
JO  - International Journal of Medical Informatics
PY  - 2022
AB  - Background: Smart home systems can potentially improve heart failure (HF) self-management and care. However, evidence is lacking on clinicians’ expectations and opinions about these systems. This study aimed to investigate key healthcare providers' perspectives on using smart home systems for self-management and care in people with HF. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively selected healthcare providers experienced in caring for people with HF in Australia. Participants were presented with a schematic for a prototype smart home system comprising a central hub connected with medical devices and sensors. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to establish the perceived benefits and barriers to using smart home systems and enhance the self-management of people with HF. Results: Overall, participants reported that smart home systems could improve the self-management of people with HF with some reservations and suggestions. Four substantive themes emerged from the qualitative findings: role of smart home systems in self-management, suggested features of a smart home system, benefits of smart home system, and factors that may influence smart home system uptake. Participants shared several reservations, such as the potential for increased workload and difficulty of technology use for some patients due to age and HF-related disabilities. Participants highlighted that the abilities and needs of people with HF must be considered when developing any smart home systems. Furthermore, these systems might benefit health institutions and people with HF by allowing remote monitoring and services and allowing patients to live at home independently. Conclusion: Healthcare providers considered smart home systems might be potentially helpful to monitor HF patients and deliver interventions to improve their lives, despite several reservations. Future research is needed to address these reservations, identify the needs and abilities of people with HF to use technologies, effects of smart home systems on HF self-management and their impact on clinical practice and health outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Combined Use Of Local And Global Hydro Meteorological Data With Hydrological Models For Water Resources Management In The Magdalena - Cauca Macro Basin – Colombia
JO  - Water Resources Management
PY  - 2020
AB  - Reanalysis and earth observation data have enormous potential to support water resources management, particularly in river basins where data availability is poor or where available stations are unequally distributed. Despite this potential, these datasets continue to be underused around the world. In this article, we combine a recently established global water resources reanalysis that was developed within the EartH2Observe research project, and in-situ data in the Magdalena Cauca Macrobasin in Colombia. Through rigorous hydrological modelling we evaluate the contribution of this new information to the derivation of water availability indices used to support water policy and management. Results confirm the complementarity of the reanalysis, with water management indices derived from the reanalysis data showing good comparison to values obtained using in-situ data only. Indeed, the estimation of simple indices such as an Aridity Index and a Water Regulation Index show to be a suitable method for assessing and comparing the different reanalysis datasets. We also explore the value of the reanalysis and earth observations datasets in the study of climate and land use change scenarios in the basin. While considering the associated uncertainties, results show that on average rainfall is projected to increase in the basin and thus available water resources. Deforestation will increase the water balance due to lower evapotranspiration. However, reduced fog deposition in deforested cloud forest areas will lead to a decrease in the water balance. The promising results of the comparison have bolstered the confidence of the national hydro-meteorological agency to include the evaluated reanalysis datasets in the national water resources evaluation, complementing available in-situ datasets. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Applying A Risk-Based Approach To The Analysis Of Environmental Aspects (On The Example Of Dairy Industry Enterprise)
JO  - International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference Surveying Geology and Mining Ecology Management, SGEM
PY  - 2020
AB  - The business is under constant pressure to improve their environmental performance, in particular, in response to scarcity of natural resources and the higher societal expectations for social and environmental responsibility. Therefore environmental management has become crucial to overall business management. In the new series of ISO standards, the “risk-based thinking" underlies the development and implementation of the environmental management system. The risk-based approach allows the integration of risk management into the normal business practice, improves performance, encourages innovation, and supports the achievement of the environmental objectives of the company. The aim of the paper is to present the designed procedure of risk identification and analysis, environmental risk assessment and mitigation plan in accordance with international standards ISO 14001 “Environmental management systems” and ISO 31000 “Risk Management”. Risk-Based thinking as a systematic approach to environmental aspects management has to be incorporated throughout the entirety of business strategy. Dairy production enterprise was considered as an example. The research showed that the environmental risk assessment is required to make informed decisions that will build a resilient business culture and enable company to deliver its ambitions. The authors of the study conclude that the risks associated with achieving environmental objectives should be managed to ensure the protection of what company values; stakeholders' confidence and trust; reduce the impact on the environment and driving the value for the business. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Data As An Alternative Input For The 'Stream' Runoff Model
JO  - CATENA
PY  - 2005
AB  - Water erosion of cropland constitutes an issue for natural environments along runoff flowpaths due to property damage by soil-laden water and the associated transfer of nutrients and pesticides. In the Pays de Caux region of northwestern France, the silty soils with crusting properties induce a high risk of runoff and erosion. Changes in agricultural practices, land use and landscape patterns appear to have increased the occurrence of erosion and mud flows over the past few decades. A runoff and erosion model called STREAM, applicable to single rainfall events at catchment scale, has been developed to simulate the impacts of land-use modifications. The model takes into account processes that degrade surface states when calculating infiltration rates, as well as agricultural aspects when computing the runoff circulation network. STREAM is based on an expert-system approach that focuses on the dominant processes whilst having only a few input parameters: three of these are used to determine the runoff circulation network, and the other four to calculate infiltration rates. Input nevertheless requires field observations, which restricts application of the model to small catchments. Satellite data covering large areas is considered as an alternative input for such a model, the main objectives being to adapt STREAM accordingly, and to compare the obtained results with field data. In view of previous work involving the extraction and validation of roughness indices using RADARSAT data, this study is based on RADARSAT and LANDSAT TM data collected during the winter of 1998. After adaptation to receive remote-sensing data, the resulting STREAM-TED model requires less input, namely (1) slope and orientation, (2) land-use classification from optical remote-sensing data, (3) roughness indices from radar remote-sensing data, and (4) previous rainfall. Runoff volumes at a gauged catchment outlet (Bourville in Upper Normandy, France) are simulated by four successive versions of the model ranging from the original STREAM to the adapted STREAM-TED. Predictions of the four versions are compared, and performance of the successive simulations is assessed in relation to measured values and according to five statistical indices. Predictions of runoff volume at the catchment outlet using STREAM-TED are similar to those using the original STREAM model, but with a tendency towards overestimation. The final STREAM-TED version is capable of identifying areas sensitive to runoff within a group of catchments and could be used as a planning decision tool in the implementation of conservation practices.
