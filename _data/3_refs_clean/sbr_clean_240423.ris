AB  - Earth Observation — the suite of activities used to gather data about the earth from satellites, aircraft, remotely piloted systems, and other platforms — delivers spatial information that underpins our daily weather and oceanographic forecasts, disaster management systems, water and power supply, infrastructure monitoring, mining, agricultural production, environmental monitoring and more. Within Australia, Earth Observation is so commonly used across all levels of government, industry and society that the minimum economic impact of Earth Observation from space-borne sensors alone is approximately $5.3 billion each year.

TI  - Advancing The Understanding And Measurement Of The Societal Benefits Of Earth Observations
PY  - 2019
AB  - The goal of this workshop was to advance valuation of the benefits from Earth Observation (EO) through case studies and through cross-fertilization with researchers, practitioners and managers from different disciplines. It brought together around 60 economists, engineers, scientists, policy makers and key personnel from space agencies and international organisations to discuss the motivations, the approaches and the challenges for valuing EO. During a dense three days programme, the participants shared ideas about areas for improvement and elaborated concrete recommendations to support the advancement of EO valuation practices. The working sessions, addressing separately different types of\nbenefits (i.e. socio-economic, socio- environmental, regulatory, on innovation and entrepreneurship and on scientific research), stimulated the participants to discuss the challenges intrinsic to the measurement of the different impacts. The splinter sessions allowed concrete and interactive discussions among small groups, whose conclusions were brought together during a final session. The workshop summary findings and the recommendations are documented in these proceedings.

TI  - Earth Observation Science Strategy For Esa: A New Era For Scientific Advances And Societal Benefits
PY  - 2015
AB  - Thanks to the ERS and Envisat workhorse satellites and the series of ongoing and planned Earth Explorer missions, our scientific understanding of Earth has come a long way in recent decades. While science continues to reap the benefits of these missions, we are now in a new era where Earth observation also plays a pivotal role in environmental management systems to benefit society at large and everyday life. The launch of the first Sentinel mission for Europe’s environmental monitoring Copernicus programme signalled a new beginning for operational monitoring. Accordingly, ESA’s new Earth observation science strategy takes a holistic approach that responds to both scientific and societal challenges. Developing new and integrated observing systems, ensuring sustained observations and capabilities to fill gaps in current observing systems, building on well-established international cooperation and taking advantage of the major technological advances in computing capabilities, modelling and data handling not only advances knowledge, but also has cross-cutting impacts. The value of Earth observation is increasingly recognised beyond the traditional fields. Today’s paradigm shift towards open access to data, big data and exascale computing, collaborative approaches and analyses, as well as new ways of visualising and communicating data mean that Earth observation is at society’s fingertips. In essence, as these rapidly evolving technologies become more commonplace and improvements in the ways in which data can be exploited and transformed into knowledge, the better we can address environmental, scientific and societal challenges, adapt to change and improve our way of life. In turn, new knowledge feeds back into new challenges, thereby continuing the process.

TI  - The Benefits To Mexican Agriculture Of An El Niño-Southern Oscillation (Enso) Early Warning System
JO  - The benefits to Mexican agriculture of an El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO) early warning system
PY  - 2002
AB  - Weather agencies worldwide are attempting to determine if systematic disturbances in climate, such as the El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO), can be detected far enough in advance so that decisions can be altered to better accommodate these disturbances. Mexico is one country where ENSO related climatic disturbances have been observed. If climate forecasters were able to disseminate information on upcoming ENSO-induced weather patterns with sufficient lead time, Mexican farmers could adjust by altering a variety of crop decisions, such as growing less (or more) water consumptive crops, planting drought resistant varieties, or altering planting times. This could have a positive impact on crop production, enhancing food security, farmers’ incomes, and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to value such forecasts in a Mexican agricultural setting. \n\nTo assess the economic consequences of climate arising from various ENSO phases, estimates of regional crop yield sensitivity for key crops were modeled using a crop biophysical simulator. The value of a forecast is then measured by the expected increase in economic benefits due to changes in cropping patterns, production and consumption arising from the yield changes under each ENSO phase forecast. These economic estimates are derived from an economic model of Mexican agriculture. The value of the ENSO information will depend on its accuracy in terms of predictions of the weather consequences of each phase.\n\nThe economic model is a stochastic, price endogenous, mathematical programming model that represents agronomic and economic conditions in a five-state Mexican region. This model depicts agricultural behavior across the three ENSO phases and provides the basis for calculating the value of information. The benefits of an ENSO early warning system for Mexico is approximately US$ 10 million annually, based on a 51-year time period of ENSO frequencies and when a forecast skill of 70% is assumed. This value translates into an internal rate of return for such an early warning system of approximately 30%. The values for higher skill levels are correspondingly higher. The values estimated here should be viewed as lower bound estimates of the value of an ENSO early warning system because benefits are not estimated for other parts of Mexican agriculture, such as non commercial (subsistence) agricultural areas, areas where there is only a weak ENSO signal that is not very predictable, and the livestock sector. Also, benefits here do not include benefits that could occur with adjustments in energy generation, water management, or any other economic sectors that may be positively affected by the existence of an ENSO early warning system.\n

TI  - Value Of Improved Long-Range Weather Information
JO  - Contemporary Economic Policy
PY  - 1995
AB  - An important human welfare implication of climate involves effects of interannual variation in temperature and precipitation on agriculture. Year-to-year variations in U.S. climate result from El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a quasi-periodic redistribution of heat and momentum in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The study described here represents a preliminary assessment of the value to the entire U.S. agricultural sector of improved ENSO forecasts in the southeastern United States. This interdisciplinary assessment combines data and models from meteorology, plant sciences, and economics under a value of information framework based on Bayesian decision theory. An economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector uses changes in yields for various ENSO phases to translate physical (yield) effects of ENSO changes into economic effects on producers and on domestic and foreign consumers. The value of perfect information to agriculture is approximately $145 million. The economic value of an imperfect forecast is $96 million. These results suggest that increases in forecast accuracy have substantial economic value to agriculture.

TI  - Investigating The Global Socio-Economic Benefits Of Satellite Industry And Remote Sensing Applications
JO  - Proceedings of the 33rd IBIMA Conference
PY  - 2019
AB  - In recent years we have seen a growth in the revenues and investments of satellite industry. Originally, satellites, remote sensing (RS), and other navigations systems were only employed for government and military purposes. However, in the past two decades there has been an increase use of these tools for commercial purposes. In particular, satellites and RS can be used for space and earth observations, support military operations, precision agriculture, meteorological forecasting, communication and internet connectivity to lesser-known applications such as in transport tracking and monitoring of utility networks. In this paper, we analyse the current trends, benefits and limitations of the use of satellites and RS. In particular, we try to identify the main socio-economic benefits deriving from the use of RS in several sectors. We also seek to introduce economists to the science of RS data, and give a flavour of how this new fountain of data can be utilized so far and what might be done in the future.

TI  - Contingent Valuation Study Of The Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Maize Farmers In The Republic Of Benin, West Africa
JO  - Climate Services
PY  - 2017
AB  - This study aims to assess the economic benefits of seasonal climate forecasts in West Africa based on a random survey of 354 maize farmers and to use the contingent valuation method. Results indicate that farmers need accurate seasonal climate forecasts between 1 and 2 months before the onset of rains. The most desirable dissemination channels are radio, local elders, local farmer meetings and extension agents. The most likely used farming strategies are change of: planting date, crop acreage, crop variety, and production intensification. The vast majority of farmers are willing to pay for seasonal climate forecasts, and the average annual economic value of seasonal climate forecasts are about USD 5492 for the 354 sampled farmers and USD 66.5 million dollar at the national level. Furthermore, benefits of seasonal climate forecasts are likely to increase with better access to farmer based organisation, to extension services, to financial services, to modern communication tools, intensity of use of fertilizer and with larger farm sizes. Seasonal climate forecasts are a source of improvement of farmers’ performance and the service should be integrated in extension programmes and in national agricultural development agenda.

PY  - 2017
AB  - This paper reviews the key role that Earth Observations (EO) play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as articulated in the 2030 Agenda document and in monitoring, measuring, and reporting on progress towards the associated targets. This paper also highlights how the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) would contribute to ensure the actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda; and how the Global Earth Observations System of Systems meets requirements for efficient investments in science and technology and a good return on investment, which is elaborated in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on development financing. Through a number of examples, we first discuss how extensive EO use would: provide a substantial contribution to the achievements of the SDGs by enabling informed decision-making and by allowing monitoring of the expected results; improve national statistics for greater accuracy, by ensuring that the data are “spatially-explicit” and directly contribute to calculate the agreed SDG Targets and Indicators support the fostering of synergy between the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements by addressing cross-cutting themes such as climate and energy; and facilitate countries’ approaches for working across different development sectors, which is, according to the special adviser on the 2030 Agenda, a key challenge to achieve the SDGs. We then focus on the role that GEO could play in enabling actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda by directly addressing the Strategic Development Goal 17 on partnerships.

TI  - Using Data From Earth Observation To Support Sustainable Development Indicators: An Analysis Of The Literature And Challenges For The Future
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2022
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework aims to end poverty, improve health and education, reduce inequality, design sustainable cities, support economic growth, tackle climate change and leave no one behind. To monitor and report the progress on the 231 unique SDGs indicators in all signatory countries, data play a key role. Here, we reviewed the data challenges and costs associated with obtaining traditional data and satellite data (particularly for developing countries), emphasizing the benefits of using satellite data, alongside their portal and platforms in data access. We then assessed, under the maturity matrix framework (MMF 2.0), the current potential of satellite data applications on the SDG indicators that were classified into the sustainability pillars. Despite the SDG framework having more focus on socio-economic aspects of sustainability, there has been a rapidly growing literature in the last few years giving practical examples in using earth observation (EO) to monitor both environmental and socio-economic SDG indicators; there is a potential to populate 108 indicators by using EO data. EO also has a wider potential to support the SDGs beyond the existing indicators.

AB  - Increased accuracy of weather forecasts does not necessarily increase commodity supply or farmer welfare. This study presents a stylized model of competitive production with rational expectations and demonstrates that improved weather information harms farmers facing an inelastic demand. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, the decline in farmer welfare does not require an expansion in expected supply. Better weather information may signal farmers to produce less on average under an inelastic demand. A supply decrease occurs when increases in the physical productivity of applied inputs are dominated by adverse price consequences.

They can be leveraged to provide policy assessments, digital services and applications for public administrations, businesses and citizens. Location data and technology plays an important role in facilitating data integration, enabling data-driven decision making on where and why things happen and easing communication through intuitive visualisations. However, there are persistent challenges that need to be tackled to realise the benefits of effectively using location data and technology in local and regional governments across the European Union (EU) and creating scalable and replicable high-impact solutions. It is within this context that this study takes place as part of the European Location Interoperability Solutions for e-Government (ELISE) ISA2 Action. This report provides an overview of state of the art applications of location data and technology to improve public services, focused specifically on local and regional governments. This report is part of the broader ELISE Lot 1 Project, which aims to provide knowledge and tools to enhance the quality of public services offered by sub-national governments by the meaningful and innovative use of location data and technology.

AB  - Earth observations can provide a wealth of information for making informed societal decisions. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) integrates a variety of organizations interested in environmental data and/or decision-making to create a sound technical platform for information-sharing and collaboration. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) facilitates the use of Earth observations in decisions by making decision-support tools and information publically available. The main principle of GEOSS is to benefit society. The Health Societal Benefit Area (SBA) spans the science-to-decision-making continuum through three tasks: Information Systems for Health, Monitoring and Prediction Systems for Health, and End-to-End Projects for Health. Projects within each overarching task focus on building connections between basic research, tools, and tangible decisions. Current foci within the Health SBA include: aerosol impacts on health, air quality forecasting, global monitoring of persistent organic pollutants and mercury, meningitis in Africa, developing malaria early warning systems, and decision support tools for ecosystems, biodiversity and health.

TI  - Valuing User Preferences For Geospatial Fire Monitoring In Guatemala
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2021
AB  - Like many landscapes across Central America, forests in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) are increasingly susceptible to forest fire, with most forest fires resulting from untended agricultural fires. Fire damage poses significant risk to the MBR’s natural resources and cultural heritage, but budget challenges limit the capacity of national, regional, and local institutions to effectively detect, monitor, and control forest fires. The Geospatial Information System for Fire Management (SIGMA-I) is a United States government-subsidized suite of geospatial fire management tools that are widely disseminated, free of charge, to land managers and other users in Guatemala for on-the-ground fire prevention and response. Provision of SIGMA-I geospatial data and tools such as daily thermal “hotspot” maps provide positive benefits for sustainable fire management. However, little research exists supporting the nonmarket monetary value of geospatial fire monitoring tools and their component features. We used a choice experiment to estimate land managers’ willingness to pay for individual attributes of SIGMA-I hotspot mapping in Guatemala. We found quantitative evidence of positive willingness to pay for geospatial data, demonstrating positive nonmarket value of geospatial data for sustainable fire management in developing countries and regions where agricultural fires are common. Our results indicate strong preferences from Guatemala’s forest fire management community for improving the frequency of hotspot reporting and reducing detection of erroneous hotspots. As the availability of geospatial data increases, use of tools like SIGMA-I has the potential to significantly improve fire management, especially in regions where funding and resources for fire management are scarce. Our results support continued multinational funding for tools like SIGMA-I for forest fire management in Guatemala and other developing countries.

TI  - Earth Observations Can Enable Cost-Effective Conservation Of Eastern North Pacific Blue Whales: A Value Of Information Analysis
PY  - 2021
AB  - We conduct an analysis to estimate the value of information (VOI) of Earth observations for prospective regulation of marine shipping to conserve Eastern North Pacific blue whales in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States. Outcomes are driven by differences across two data products that can be used to inform regulations to limit ship strikes. In the reference case, vessel speed limits depend on species distribution data from shipboard surveys. In the counterfactual case, speed limits depend on species distributions predicted by WhaleWatch, a federal data product incorporating information from several remote sensing technologies. The VOI is identified as the difference in costs to marine shipping operators under the reference and counterfactual cases for regulation of vessel speeds. We estimate that the annual VOI of WhaleWatch is US $21–332 million, depending on the conservation goals of the modeled regulation. Conserving more blue whales—averting more ship strikes—increases the VOI.

AB  - Geospatial data inform decision makers. An economic model that involves application of spatial and temporal scientific, technical, and economic data in decision making is described. The value of information (VOI) contained in geospatial data is the difference between the net benefits (in present value terms) of a decision with and without the information. A range of technologies is used to collect and distribute geospatial data. These technical activities are linked to examples that show how the data can be applied in decision making, which is a cultural activity. The economic model for assessing the VOI in geospatial data for decisionmaking is applied to three examples: (1) a retrospective model about environmental regulation of agrochemicals; (2) a prospective model about the impact and mitigation of earthquakes in urban areas; and (3) a prospective model about developing private–public geospatial information or an ecosystem services market. Each example demonstrates the potential value of geospatial information in a decision with uncertain information.

Wecompared the costs associated with producing a Burn Area Reflectance Classification map and implementing a BAER when imagery from satellites (either Landsat or a commercial satellite) was available to when the response team relied on information collected solely by aerial reconnaissance. The case study included two evaluations with and without Burn Area Reflectance Classification products: (a) savings of up to US$51,000 for the Elk Complex wildfire incident request and (b) savings of a multi-incident map production program. Landsat is the most cost-effective way to input burn severity information into the BAER program, with savings of up to US$35 million over a 5-year period.

TI  - Estimating The Social Value Of Geologic Map Information: A Regulatory Application
JO  - Journal of Environmental Economics and Management
PY  - 1997
AB  - People frequently regard the landscape as part of a static system. The mountains and rivers that cross the landscape, and the bedrock that supports the surface, change little during the course of a lifetime. Society can alter the geologic history of an area and, in so doing, affect the occurrence and impact of environmental hazards. For example, changes in land use can induce changes in erosion, sedimentation, and ground-water supply. As the environmental system is changed by both natural processes and human activities, the system’s capacity to respond to additional stresses also changes. Information such as geologic maps describes the physical world and is critical for identifying solutions to land use and environmental issues. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the economic value of applying geologic map information to siting a waste disposal facility. An improvement in geologic map information is shown to have a net positive value to society. Such maps enable planners to make superior land management decisions.

TI  - The Role Of Geoscience Information In Reducing Catastrophic Loss Using A Web-Based Economics Experiment
PY  - 2003
AB  - What role can geoscience information play in the assessment of risk and the value of insurance, especially for natural hazard type risks? In an earlier, related paper Ganderton and others (2000) provided subjects with relatively simple geoscience information concerning natural hazard-type risks. Their research looked at how subjects purchase insurance when faced with relatively low probability but high loss risks of the kind that characterize natural hazards and now, increasingly, manmade disasters. They found evidence to support the expected utility theory (definitions of economics terms can be found in a glossary at the end of report), yet there remained the implication that subjects with excessive aversion to risk were willing to pay considerably more for insurance than the actuarially fair price plus any reasonable risk premium. Here, we report the results of additional experiments that provide further support for the basic postulates of expected utility theory. However, these new experiments add considerably to the decision environment facing subjects by offering an option to purchase geoscientific information that would assist them when calculating expected losses from hazards more accurately.\n\nUsing an Internet-based mechanism to present information and gather data in an experimental setting, this research provided subjects with considerable textual and graphical information, and time to process it. Over a period of three months, almost 400 subjects participated in on-line experiments that generated approximately 22,000 usable data points for the empirical analysis discussed in this report.\n\nIn the design of the experiment, we modeled the decisions to purchase (1) a detailed map giving subjects more information regarding the distribution of losses from a hazard and (2) insurance to indemnify them from any losses should they occur. On the basis of this design, we find strong evidence in support of the expected utility theory. Many of the findings reinforce those found in the early, similar study (Ganderton and others, 2000). However, this research also finds interactions between the decision to become better informed and the decision to insure. We chose an empirical framework that allows for both explicit and implicit (unobservable) correlations between the two decisions. The results suggest that at the end of the computer game subjects recognize the benefits of greater geoscience information. They take advantage of it, but are sensitive to its cost. When subjects use the more detailed information, they are more likely to purchase insurance when it offers a net benefit.

TI  - California’s Covid-19 Economic Shutdown Reveals The Fingerprint Of Systemic Environmental Racism
JO  - OSF Preprints
PY  - 2020
AB  - Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States often experience higher-than-average exposures to air pollution. However, the relative contribution of embedded institutional biases to these disparities can be difficult to disentangle from physical environmental drivers, socioeconomic status, and cultural or other factors that are correlated with exposures under status quo conditions. Over the spring and summer of 2020, rapid and sweeping COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders around the world created large perturbations to local and regional economic activity that resulted in observable changes in air pollution concentrations, compositions, and distributions. Here, we use the pandemic-related emergency order and subsequent economic slowdown to causally estimate pollution exposure disparities in California. Using both public ground-based sensor data and a citizen-science network of monitors for respirable particulate matter (PM2.5), along with satellite records of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), we show that the initial sheltering-in-place period produced disproportionate air pollution reduction benefits for Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and low- income communities. By linking these pollution data with weather, geographic, socioeconomic, and mobility data in difference-in-differences models, we demonstrate that these disparate pollution reductions cannot be explained by environmental conditions, geography, income, or local economic activity and are instead driven by non-local activity. This study thus provides causally-identified evidence of systemic racial and ethnic bias in pollution control under business-as-usual conditions.

This workshop has been conducted as part of GEO Task US-09-02a: “Socio-Economic Benefits of GEO and GEOSS”, led by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the International Institute for Advanced Spatial Applications (IIASA), and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC). It was organized by these three organizations, and by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Twenty-five experts from America, Europe and Australia have gathered in Ispra to present their experience in the field of the evaluation of the benefits from Earth Observations obtained by in-situ, remote and the new citizen’s sensors. The discussion was based on the outcomes of two previous workshops held in 2010 on the same issue, in US and in Europe. The background section presents the rationale behind the need of understanding the benefits Earth Observations, supported by several initiatives at the continental (e.g. INSPIRE Directive in Europe) and at the global (e.g. GEOSS) level. The aim of the workshop, described in the second section of this document, was to support the development of international capabilities to determine, quantify and document the socioeconomic benefits from EO and their use, and to jointly develop a programme of activities to be followed in the next few years by the research group. The foreseen activities of the programme were the consolidation of the body of literature in the field, the collection and analysis of suitable methodologies to assess Earth Observations’ benefits, and of evidence of benefits from existing case studies, the development of appropriate outreach initiatives, the strengthening of the existing community of researchers and the link with other communities of scientists, to set up multidisciplinary studies. To this aim, each participant brought his/her own experience in the analysing and assessing the impacts of Earth Observation in their own field of research, generating an interesting list of multifaceted examples and case studies in which the same problem is analysed from different perspectives. Section 3 contains a summary of each presentation, which gave the elements for the subsequent discussion among experts, leading to the preliminary programme of activities. Among the several subject of discussions there were the value to be ascribed to Earth Observation data, the need of complementing ex-ante impact assessments with monitoring and ex-post evaluations, the need of clearly communicating the benefits to policy makers in order to fund research and as well to provide a service to the society. These discussion topics are summarised in section 4, describing also the view of the experts as regard possible activities for the creation of a body of knowledge about the field, for the definition of a methodology for the estimation of Earth Observations’ benefits, the criteria for selecting suitable case studies to show such benefits and proposal for outreach and dissemination activities. As final recommendations from the workshop, priority should be given to: \n• the development of an accepted scientific paradigm and of a General Economic Framework to measure EO costs and benefits; \n• the establishment of a community of practice bringing together demand and supply; \n• the support to increase the number of researchers active in this field research group; \n• the showcase of concrete projects clearly communicating the benefits achieved. \nMoreover, concrete suggestions were given aimed at developing research activities to establish a consolidated state of the art, mainly consisting in meta-analysis of existing studies and production of high-impact articles or special issues in well-recognised scientific journals.

TI  - Assessing The Value Of Earth Observation For Managing Coral Reefs: An Example From The Great Barrier Reef
JO  - Science of The Total Environment
PY  - 2011
AB  - The Integrated Global Observing Strategy (IGOS, 2003) argues that further investments in Earth Observation information are required to improve coral reefprotection worldwide. The IGOS Strategy does not specify what levels of investments are needed nor does it quantify the benefits associated with better-protected reefs. Evaluating costs and benefits is important for determining optimal investment levels and for convincing policy-makers that investments are required indeed. Few studies have quantitatively assessed the economic benefits of Earth Observation information or evaluated the economic value of information for environmental management. This paper uses an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the possible contribution of global Earth Observation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef including its lagoon is a World Heritage Area affected by anthropogenic changes in land-use as well as climate change resulting in increased flows of sediments, nutrients and carbon to the GBR lagoon. Since European settlement, nutrient and sediment loads having increased 5â€“10 times and the change in water quality is causing damages to the reef. Earth Observation information from ocean and coastal color satellite sensors can provide spatially and temporally dense information on sediment flows. We hypothesize that Earth Observation improves decision-making by enabling better-targeted run-off reduction measures and we assess the benefits (cost savings) of this improved targeting by optimizing run-off reductions under different states of the world. The analysis suggests that the benefits of Earth Observation can indeed be substantial, depending on the perceived accuracy of the information and on the prior beliefs of decision-makers. The results indicate that increasing informational accuracy is the most effective way for developers of Earth Observation information to increase the added value of Earth Observation for managing coral reefs.

TI  - Assessing The Value Of Information For Water Quality Management In The North Sea
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2009
AB  - Global Earth Observation (GEO) is one of the most important sources of information for environmental resource management and disaster prevention. With budgets for GEO increasingly under pressure, it is becoming important to be able to quantify the returns to informational investments. For this, a clear analytical framework is lacking. By combining Bayesian decision theory with an empirical, stakeholder oriented approach, this paper attempts to develop such a framework. The analysis focuses on the use of satellite observations for Dutch water quality management in the North Sea. Dutch water quality management currently relies on information from ‘in situ’ measurements but is considering extending and deepening its information base with satellite observations. To estimate returns to additional investments in satellite observation, we analyze the added value of an extended monitoring system for the management of eutrophication, potentially harmful algal blooms and suspended sediment and turbidity in the North Sea. First, we develop a model to make the potential contribution of information to welfare explicit. Second, we use this model to develop a questionnaire and interpret the results. The results indicate that the expected welfare impact of investing in satellite observation is positive, but that outcomes strongly depend on the accuracy of the information system and the range of informational benefits perceived.

TI  - The Value Of Earth Observation For Managing The Great Barrier Reef
PY  - 2009
AB  - Effective decision-making requires information, but how much information is enough and how much money should be invested in additional information is often unclear. This paper attempts to assess the economic benefits of informational investments, specifically of investments in Earth Observation (EO) for managing the Great Barrier Reef. We develop an expert elicitation approach based on Bayesian Decision Theory to estimate the expected contribution of informational investments to decision-making. We hypothesize that EO can improve decision-making by allowing for better-targeted emission reduction measures in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. For assessing the benefits (cost savings) of improved targeting we develop a model to optimize emission reductions under different states: emissions from all catchments may affect reef quality, or emissions from certain catchments may affect reef quality more. The states reflect the current uncertainties relating to water quality management in the region. The analysis suggests that the expected benefits of EO information for managing the GBR can be substantial, and depend on the perceived accuracy of EO information and on decision-makers prior beliefs.

TI  - Bayesian Framework For Assessing The Value Of Scientific Space Systems: Value Of Information Approach With Application To Earth Science Spacecraft
JO  - Acta Astronautica
PY  - 2013
AB  - Space systems play an important role in today's society by generating or transmitting information from source to sink(s). The acquisition of the space system is often justified by the type, quantity and quality of information provided or transmitted. This work posits that the value of a class of space systems derives from and can be assessed through the value of information these systems provide. To this effect, a Bayesian framework is developed to assess system value in which systems are viewed as information sources, and stakeholders as information recipients. Information has value to stakeholders as it helps to update their beliefs, enabling them to make decisions that can yield higher expected pay-offs than in the absence of information. This increase in expected pay-offs is ascribed to the value of the system. Based on this idea, a new metric, Value-of-Design (VOD), is introduced to quantify the value of a class of space systems with unpriced services. The Bayesian framework assesses the Value-of-Design for the space system by considering the impact of the information transmitted on the actions taken by stakeholders, and estimating the resulting pay-offs from these actions. The framework here developed is then applied to the case of an Earth Science satellite that provides hurricane information to oil rig operators in the Gulf of Mexico. Probability models of stakeholders’ beliefs, and economic models of pay-offs are developed and integrated with a spacecraft design tool. Results from the application point to clusters of payload instruments that yielded higher information value, and minimum information thresholds below which it is difficult to justify the acquisition of the system. Additionally, the system is analyzed in Cost-VOD trade space to provide program managers with additional insights into the coupling of a system's predicted value generation and its associated lifecycle cost.

TI  - Landscape Analysis Of Cobalt Mining Activities From 2009 To 2021 Using Very High Resolution Satellite Data (Democratic Republic Of The Congo)
JO  - Sustainability
PY  - 2022
AB  - The cobalt mining sector is well positioned to be a key contributor in determining the success of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite the important contribution to the DRC’s economy, the rapid expansion of mining operations has resulted in major social, health, and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the cumulative impact of mining activities on the landscape of a prominent cobalt mining area in the DRC. To achieve this, an object-based method, employing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, was used to map land cover across the city of Kolwezi and the surrounding mining areas, where long-term mining activity has dramatically altered the landscape. The research used very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery (2009, 2014, 2019, 2021) to map the spatial distribution of land cover and land cover change, as well as analyse the spatial relationship between land cover classes and visually identified mine features, from 2009 to 2021. Results from the object-based SVM land cover classification produced an overall accuracy of 85.2–90.4% across the time series. Between 2009 and 2021, land cover change accounted to: rooftops increasing by 147.2% (+7.7 km2); impervious surface increasing by 104.7% (+3.35 km2); bare land increasing by 85.4% (+33.81 km2); exposed rock increasing by 56.2% (+27.46 km2); trees decreasing by 4.5% (−0.34 km2); shrub decreasing by 38.4% (−26.04 km2); grass and cultivated land decreasing by 27.1% (−45.65 km2); and water decreasing by 34.6% (−3.28 km2). The co-location of key land cover classes and visually identified mine features exposed areas of potential environmental pollution, with 91.6% of identified water situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature, and vulnerable populations, with 71.6% of built-up areas (rooftop and impervious surface class combined) situated within a 1 km radius of a mine feature. Assessing land cover patterns over time and the interplay between mine features and the landscape structure allowed the study to amplify the findings of localised on-the-ground research, presenting an alternative viewpoint to quantify the true scale and impact of cobalt mining in the DRC. Filling geospatial data gaps and examining the present and past trends in cobalt mining is critical for informing and managing the sustainable growth and development of the DRC’s mining sector.

TI  - A New Process For Organizing Assessments Of Social, Economic, And Environmental Outcomes: Case Study Of Wildland Fire Management In The Usa
JO  - Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management
PY  - 2009
AB  - Ecological risk assessments typically are organized using the processes of planning (a discussion among managers, stakeholders, and analysts to clarify ecosystem management goals and assessment scope) and problem formulation (evaluation of existing information to generate hypotheses about adverse ecological effects, select assessment endpoints, and develop an analysis plan). These processes require modification to be applicable for integrated assessments that evaluate ecosystem management alternatives in terms of their ecological, economic, and social consequences. We present 8 questions that define the steps of a new process we term integrated problem formulation (IPF), and we illustrate the use of IPF through a retrospective case study comparing 2 recent phases of development of the Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system, a planning and budgeting system for the management of wildland fire throughout publicly managed lands in the United States. IPF extends traditional planning and problem formulation by including the explicit comparison of management alternatives, the valuation of ecological, economic and social endpoints, and the combination or integration of those endpoints. The phase 1, limited prototype FPA system used a set of assessment endpoints of common form (i.e., probabilities of given flame heights over acres of selected land-resource types), which were specified and assigned relative weights at the local level in relation to a uniform national standard. This approach was chosen to permit system-wide optimization of fire management budget allocations according to a cost-effectiveness criterion. Before full development, however, the agencies abandoned this approach in favor of a phase 2 system that examined locally specified (rather than system-optimized) allocation alternatives and was more permissive as to endpoint form. We demonstrate how the IPF process illuminates the nature, rationale, and consequences of these differences, and argue that its early use for the FPA system may have enabled a smoother development path.

TI  - Assessing The Usability And Potential Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts In Land Management Decisions In The Southwest Uk: Challenges And Reflections
JO  - Advances in Science and Research
PY  - 2017
AB  - The potential usability and benefits of seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) to help inform decision-making processes is widely accepted. However, the practical use of SCF in Europe is still fairly recent and, as such, current knowledge of the added benefits of SCF in supporting and improving decision-making is limited. This study is based on research conducted to co-develop a semi-operational climate service prototype – the Land Management Tool (LMTool) – with farmers in South West regions of the UK. The value of the SCF provided to the farmers was examined to help us understand the usability and (potential) value of these forecasts in farmers' decisions during the winter months of 2015/2016. The findings from the study point to the need to explore and develop (new) research methods capable of addressing the complexity of the decision-making processes, such as those in the farming sector. The farmers who used the SCF perceived it as useful and usable as it helped them change and adapt their decision-making and thus, avoid unnecessary costs. However, to fully grasp the potential value of using SCF, farmers emphasised the need for the provision of SCF for longer periods of time to allow them to build trust and confidence in the information provided. This paper contributes to ongoing discussions about how to assess the use and value of SCF in decision-making processes in a meaningful and effective way.

TI  - Assessing The Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Decision-Making
JO  - WIREs Climate Change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) can support decision-making and thus help society cope with and prepare for climate variability and change. The demand for understanding the value and benefits of using SCF in decision-making processes can be associated with different logics. Two of these would be the need to justify public and private investment in the provision of SCF and demonstrating the gains and benefits of using SCF in specific decision-making contexts. This paper reviews the main factors influencing how SCF is (or can be) valued in supporting decision-making and the main methods and metrics currently used to perform such valuations. Our review results in four key findings: (a) there is a current emphasis on economic ex ante studies and the quantification of SCF value; (b) there are fundamental differences in how the value of SCF is defined and estimated across methods and approaches; (c) most valuation methods are unable to capture the differential benefits and risks of using SCF across spatiotemporal scales and groups; and (d) there is limited involvement of the decision-makers in the valuation process. The paper concludes by providing some guiding principles towards more effective valuations of SCF, notably the need for a wider diversity and integration of methodological approaches. These should particularly embrace ex-post, qualitative, and participatory approaches which allow co-evaluation with decision-makers so that more comprehensive and equitable SCF valuations can be developed in future.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Understandably, given the fast pace of biodiversity loss, there is much interest in using Earth observation technology to track biodiversity, ecosystem functions and ecosystem services. However, because most biodiversity is invisible to Earth observation, indicators based on Earth observation could be misleading and reduce the effectiveness of nature conservation and even unintentionally decrease conservation effort. We describe an approach that combines automated recording devices, high-throughput DNA sequencing and modern ecological modelling to extract much more of the information available in Earth observation data. This approach is achievable now, offering efficient and near-real-time monitoring of management impactson biodiversity and its functions and services.

TI  - The Value Of Climate Information When Farm Programs Matter
JO  - Agricultural Systems
PY  - 2006
AB  - Predictability of seasonal climate variations associated with ENSO suggests a potential to reduce farm risk by tailoring agricultural management strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse conditions or to take advantage of favorable conditions. Federal farm policies may enhance or limit the usefulness of this climate information. A representative peanut–cotton–corn non-irrigated North Florida farm was used to estimate the value of the ENSO-based climate information and examine impacts of farm programs under uncertain conditions of climate, prices, and risk aversion levels. Yields from crop model simulations and historical series of prices were used to generate stochastic distributions that were fed into a whole farm model, first, to optimize crop selection and planting dates, and then, to simulate uncertain outcomes under risk aversion, with and without the use of climate information, and with and without the inclusion of farm programs. Results suggest that seasonal climate forecasts have higher value for more risk averse farmers when La Niña or El Niño ENSO phases are forecast. Highly risk averse farmers could benefit from the forecast by taking advantage of potential favorable conditions (offensive responses). The inclusion of Commodity Loan Programs (CLP) and Crop Insurance Programs (CIP) decreased the overall value of the forecast information even to negative levels. However, more risk averse farmers could still benefit moderately from El Niño and marginally from La Niña forecasts when they participate in CLP and CIP.

AB  - In 2002, a National Oceanographic Partnership Program project was initiated with the ambitious objective of maximizing the use of currently and soon-to-be-available satellite ocean surface vector wind (OSVW) data, such as NASA’s QuikSCAT scatterometer, in the operational weather forecasting and warning environment. This effort brought together people from the operational forecasting and satellite remote-sensing communities, academia, and the private sector. This diverse gathering of skill and experience yielded documentation of the impacts of these data in the operational short-term warning and forecasting environment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Weather Service, improvement in the use of these data in the public and private sectors, and the transition of promising research results into the operational environment. This project helped create momentum that has continued to grow long after the formal effort ended; today, NOAA uses QuikSCAT operationally and is investigating how to best establish a sustained satellite OSVW observing capability.

TI  - Agricultural Value Of Enso Information Under Alternative Phase Definition
JO  - Climatic Change
PY  - 2002
AB  - The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect has been found to be associated with regional climate variations in many regions of the world, and, in turn, with variation in crop yields. Previous studies have found that early releases of ENSO phase information could permit agricultural producers to make adjustments in their decisions and in turn generate an increase in agricultural sector welfare. This study examines whether the value of the agricultural responses can be enhanced by releasing more detailed ENSO information. Namely we evaluate the implications for projected agricultural welfare under release and adaptation to the Stone and Auliciems five phase definition of ENSO states as opposed to the more standard three phase definition. This value is estimated using a stochastic, U.S./global agricultural model representing 22 climate years. The results indicate that the release and exploitation of the more detailed ENSO phase definition almost doubles the welfare impact. The results also indicate that there is room for up to another doubling of information value through further refinements.

TI  - Integration Of Earth Observation And In-Situ Spatial Data For The Development Of A Decision Support Tool For Technological Risk Management
PY  - 2003
AB  - In this study, the design and implementation of a GIS based tool for the support of technological risk management is presented. This Decision Support Tool is based on the detection and space-time monitoring of plumes caused by technological accidents, by integrating moderate and high-resolution satellite imagery and in-situ spatial data. The Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) on board the NOAA satellites has been used for the detection of fire as well as for the detection and monitoring of plumes. The detection algorithms have been presented in previous studies for past accidents in Europe. AVHRR images, were adjusted to the broader area of Athens in order to develop a major technological accident scenario based on real plumes. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on board the EOS AM-1 satellite has been used for the extraction of topographic information, land cover and spatial distribution of vegetation, as well as for the depiction of urban areas, road network and major industrial installations. The scenario was used to present the functionality of the developed GIS tool for the support of decision making during the crisis, as well as for the assessment of the accident's impact to natural and human environment.

TI  - Assessing The Full Effects Of Public Investment In Space
JO  - Space Policy
PY  - 2020
AB  - Many space-related impact studies have been carried out in the past, but there is no conclusive, comprehensive evaluation of the economic and social effects of public investments in space. Such evaluations are not easy to perform, for several reasons: the space sector is not a recognised category in official statistics; social benefits, which are likely to be very important, are hard to assess; and impacts from R&D are complex and occur in the long term. However, important steps can be made towards better evaluation of impacts. The full set of impacts of space investments may be simultaneously evaluated from both a "bottom-up" and a "top-down" perspective. In the bottom-up perspective, each effect is measured separately, while the top-down perspective provides a framework for integrating the effects. Although both perspectives have their own advantages and drawbacks, combining them yields both detailed and integrated results. Our discussion of the bottom up approach starts by identifying an extensive list of impacts. Next, data availability issues and methodological improvements are identified, leading to recommendations on programmes to collect data and perform case studies. Finally, suggestions are made for presenting impacts in the form of a scoreboard. The core of the top-down evaluation methodology proposed is social cost benefit analysis. Effects are weighted, where possible, on the basis of observed market prices or other estimations of monetary values. For effects that are hard to measure or monetize, multi-criteria analysis can be applied using surveys and expert opinion. Our core recommendations are to clearly define the space sector, to collect additional data, and to use improved methodologies. Social, strategic and environmental impacts deserve special attention, aiming at a more comprehensive coverage of impacts. Comprehensive evaluations can contribute to more upport for space expenditures.

TI  - Earth Observation In A Cost-Benefit Analysis Perspective: Cosmo Skymed Satellites Of The Italian Space Agency
PY  - 2019
AB  - Over the past decade, an increasing number of high-resolution satellite images have become available to public administration, policymakers and scientists, boosting the amount of information they can obtain to manage and analyse different issues. Satellites allow observing different natural and socio-economic phenomena that would be very hard and costly to monitor from the ground with the same optimal coverage, accuracy and consistency, providing valuable information both to the private and public sector. These phenomena include global societal challenges, such as climate change and air pollution, as well as local ones such as precision farming, urbanisation and transport infrastructures monitoring. This working paper aims at paving the way to a comprehensive assessment of the socio-economic impact of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) concerning the creation of innovative products and services generated by the Earth Observation (EO)1. Although the wide range of potential applications of EO satellite data, little is known about the effective use of Cosmo SkyMed (CSK) data so far. Most of the benefits related to their availability remain potential, unexpressed and undervalued. The analysis also intends to identify the institutional and organisational barriers that limit their full exploitation and formulate sounds policy recommendations to release the untapped potential of the Italian space downstream sector.

TI  - Market-Based Methods For Monetizing Uncertainty Reduction
JO  - Environment Systems and Decisions
PY  - 2020
AB  - New measurement systems are often expensive and need a solid economic justification. Traditional tools based on the value of information are sometimes difficult to apply. When risks are traded in a market, it may be possible to use market instruments to monetize the reductions in uncertainty. This paper illustrates such market-based methods with a satellite system designed to reduce uncertainty in predicting soil moisture in the USA. Soil moisture is a key variable in managing agricultural production and predicting crop yields. Using data on corn and soybean futures, we find that a 30% reduction in the weather-related component of uncertainty in corn and soybean futures pricing yields a yearly US consumer surplus of $1.44 billion. The total present value of information from the satellite system for the USA—calculated with a 3% discount rate—is about $22 billion, assuming the system is in operation for 20 years. The global value of the improvements in weather forecasting could be $63 billion.

TI  - Value Of Information For Climate Observing Systems
JO  - Environment Systems & Decisions
PY  - 2014
AB  - The Interagency Working Group Memo on the social cost of carbon is used to compute the value of information (VOI) of climate observing systems. A generic decision context is posited in which society switches from a business as usual (BAU) emissions path to a reduced emissions path upon achieving sufficient confidence that a trigger variable exceeds a stipulated critical value. Using assessments of natural variability and uncertainty of measuring instruments, it is possible to compute the time at which the required confidence would be reached under the current and under a new observing system, if indeed the critical value is reached. Economic damages (worldwide) from carbon emissions are computed with an integrated assessment model. The more accurate observing system acquires the required confidence earlier and switches sooner to the reduced emissions path, thereby avoiding more damages which would otherwise be incurred by BAU emissions. The difference in expected net present value of averted damages under the two observing systems is the VOI of the new observing system relative to the existing system. As illustration, the VOI for the proposed spaceborne CLARREO system relative to current space-borne systems is computed. Depending on details of the decision context, the VOI ranges from 2 to 30 trillion US dollars.

TI  - The Value Of El Niño Forecasts In The Management Of Salmon: A Stochastic Dynamic Assessment
JO  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
PY  - 2020
AB  - The El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the largest source of interannual variability in global climate. Variability in climate has been linked to variability in fisheries, specifically salmon stocks of the Pacific Northwest. The ability to forecast El Niño events already exists and is likely to improve in coming years. An accurate prediction may have value because it allows for better management decisions. In this article, we develop a bioeconomic model of the coho salmon fishery and derive the value of information from improved El Niño forecasting ability. We find that a perfect El Niño forecast results in an annual welfare gain of approximately $1 million, while imperfect forecasts lead to smaller gains. Results also suggest that optimal management in the face of uncertainty involves a “conservative” management strategy, resulting in lower harvest, higher wild fish escapement, and lower hatchery releases than management in the absence of such uncertainty.

TI  - Cost And Value Of Multidisciplinary Fixed-Point Ocean Observatories
JO  - Marine Policy
PY  - 2016
AB  - Sustained ocean observations are crucial to understand both natural processes occurring in the ocean and human influence on the marine ecosystems. The information they provide increases our understanding and is therefore beneficial to the society as a whole because it contributes to a more efficient use and protection of the marine environment, upon which human livelihood depends. In addition the oceans, which occupy 73% of the planet surface and host 93% of the biosphere, play a massive role in controlling the climate. Eulerian or fixed-point observatories are an essential component of the global ocean observing system as they provide several unique features that cannot be found in other systems and are therefore complementary to them. In addition they provide a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work, combining physical, chemical and biological observations on several time scales. The fixed-point open ocean observatory network (FixO3) integrates the 23 European open ocean fixed-point observatories in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. The programme also seeks to improve access to key installations and the knowledge they provide for the wider community, from scientists, to businesses, to civil society. This paper summarises the rationale behind open ocean observatories monitoring the essential ocean variables. It also provides an estimate of the costs to operate a typical fixed-point observatory such as those included in the FixO3 network. Finally an assessment of the type of data and services provided by ocean observations and their value to society is also given.

TI  - The Eoc Geoservice: Standardized Access To Earth Observation Data Sets And Value Added Products
PY  - 2013
AB  - Within long-term data preservation, providing sustainable, user friendly and interoperable access to archived data sets becomes more and more important. The rising interest of users in accessing EO data and products results in the need to offer fast, easy-to-use, and reliable data access. Data access for the Earth Observation Community of the German Satellite Data Archive at DLR is available through the data portal Earth Observation on the WEB (EOWEBÂ®). The EOC Geoservice has been established at DLR to provide interoperable access to both, selected German Satellite Data Archive data sets and data sets provided by external providers. Opposite to EOWEB, the EOC Geoservice provides direct data access through standardized interfaces in addition to the classical order-based ones.

TI  - The Evolution Of Earth Observation Satellites In Europe And Its Impact On The Performance Of Emergency Response Services
JO  - Acta Astronautica
PY  - 2016
AB  - The paper reviews the evolution of Earth Observation systems in Europe and Worldwide and analyses the potential impact of their performance in support of emergency response services. Earth Observation satellites play already a significant role in supporting the action of first responders in case of major disasters. The main principle is the coordinated use of satellites in order to ensure a rapid response and the timely delivery of images and geospatial information of the area affected by the event. The first part of the paper reviews the main instruments and evaluates their current performance.\nThe International Charter “Space and Major Disasters”, signed in October 2000, was the first international initiative aimed at establishing a unified system for the acquisition of space data. The charter is a cooperation agreement between space agencies and operators of space systems. At regional level, a similar instrument exists in Asia: Sentinel-Asia. In the frame of the European programme Copernicus, the emergency management service was launched in 2009. Geo-information products derived from space imagery are delivered during all phases of the emergency management cycle, in either rush or non-rush mode, free of charge for the users. In both cases, the capacities were historically drawn from national missions, funded with public money and directly operated by the space agencies or by national operators. \nThe paper focuses on the performance of the space infrastructure (satellites and ground segments). Several trends may have a significant impact on the current performance: \n– The increasing number of space systems which are privately-owned and managed by commercial operators.\n– The emergence in Europe of shared-ownership or community-owned systems. Copernicus Sentinel missions (Copernicus) or Eumetsat satellites are two typical examples. – The development of dual-use capacities and the sovereignty dimension of these systems. \n– The development of unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications.\n– The development of social media and crowd-based initiatives for humanitarian aid and emergency response.\n– Possible disruptions, such as large LEO constellations or GEO infrastructures enabling persistent observation. \nA common feature is the increased number of information sources and the higher real time dimension.

TI  - An Analysis Of The Value Of Additional Information Provided By Water Quality Measurement Network
JO  - Journal of Water Resource and Protection
PY  - 2016
AB  - European Community policy concerning water is placing increasing demands on the acquisition of information about the quality of aquatic environments. The cost of this information has led to a reflection on the rationalization of monitoring networks and, therefore, on the economic value of information produced by these networks. The aim of this article is to contribute to this reflection. To do so, we used the Bayesian framework to define the value of additional information in relation to the following three parameters: initial assumptions (prior probabilities) on the states of nature, costs linked to a poor decision (error costs) and accuracy of additional information. We then analyzed the impact of these parameters on this value, particularly the combined role of prior probabilities and error costs that increased or decreased the value of information depending on the initial uncertainty level. We then illustrated the results using a case study of a stream in the Bas-Rhin department in France.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Design For A Water Quality Monitoring Network Maximizing The Economic Value Of Information To Optimize The Detection Of Accidental Pollution
JO  - Water Resources and Economics
PY  - 2020
AB  - The reduction of damage due to water pollution requires good knowledge of the quality of surfacewaters. The Water Quality Monitoring Networks (WQMNs) have evolved over time according to the objectives of each one of them: knowledge of long-term quality evolution, search for the origin of pollution, detection of accidental pollution, etc. Information provided by WQMNs could be improved by a spatial approach, optimizing the location or the number of monitoring stations, or by a temporal approach, optimizing the sampling frequency. However, there is a cost for monitoring water quality.\nIn this article, we show, for the first time, how the estimation of the Economic Value of Information (EVOI) can be used to determine the spatio-temporal design of the network. With the example of a network that aims to detect accidental pollution, we show how to calculate the EVOI according to the spatial and temporal network design (number and location of stations, temporal accuracy of measurement) and how to define this design by maximizing the EVOI. This will allow us to answer questions such as: Are the expenses invested in the networks justified? With an additional budget, is it better to add a station or to increase the temporal accuracy of the measurement of existing stations? What is the optimal spatial and temporal design of the network when working with a fixed budget?

TI  - The Benefits And Challenges Of Having An Open And Free Basis Satellite Data Sharing Platform In Turkey: Gezgin
JO  - The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2016
AB  - Turkey is a county that experiences rapid socioeconomic development, which, in turn, leads to high urbanization rates due to migration of people from rural to urban areas, many large-scale development projects (e.g. highways, dams, housing and infrastructure), and environmental problems that adversely affect agriculture, such as soil erosion and deforestation. Furthermore, Turkey lies in a region prone to natural disasters, especially earthquakes, landslides, flooding and forest fires. Successfully overcoming these challenges requires continuous monitoring to enable rapid response as well as the development of effective socioeconomic policies. In this regard, space-based earth observation (EO) systems play a critical role in the rapid acquisiton and extraction of crucial information. The first launch of the first Turkish-designed satellite, RASAT, in 2011 led to the wide-spread exploitation of space-based resources by Turkish institutions through the dissemination of EO data on an open and free basis via the GEZGIN internet portal (http://www.gezgin.gov.tr). The push for data sharing was further instigated by the nationally funded project GEOPORTAL (Satellite Image Processing and Geoportal Development Project) and European Union FP7 project EOPOWER (Earth Observation for Economic Empowerment), which strove to create conditions for sustainable economic development through the increased use of Earth observation products and services for environmental applications. In this work, the technical challenges involving processing and preparing raw satellite data for dissemination as well as software design of the GEZGIN Portal will be presented.

TI  - Digital Earth Australia- Unlocking New Value From Earth Observation Data
JO  - Big Earth Data
PY  - 2017
AB  - Petascale archives of Earth observations from space (EOS) have the potential to characterise water resources at continental scales. For this data to be useful, it needs to be organised, converted from individual scenes as acquired by multiple sensors, converted into “analysis ready data”, and made available through high performance computing platforms. Moreover, converting this data into insights requires integration of non-EOS data-sets that can provide biophysical and climatic context for EOS. Digital Earth Australia has demonstrated its ability to link EOS to rainfall and stream gauge data to provide insight into surface water dynamics during the hydrological extremes of flood and drought. This information is supporting the characterisation of groundwater resources across Australia’s north and could potentially be used to gain an understanding of the vulnerability of transport infrastructure to floods in remote, sparsely gauged regions of northern and central Australia.

AB  - Soil surveys and the information they provide are commonly believed to be good investment, with significant benefits accrued to their users. To date, the empirical evidence for this comes from studies that have shown how enhanced soil information can alter agricultural practices to yield higher returns. This study attempts to estimate the economic value of soil information generated by a host of new proximal and in situ geophysical methods for the assessment of the following soil properties: carbon content, water content, clay content, bulk density, and soil depth. The study also adopts a novel approach to the economic valuation of soil information by employing for the first time a choice experiment to estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of potential users of the digital maps and their features. The choice experiment took the form of an online survey, administered to about a thousand individuals from the wider soil community. The results reveal significant WTP for maps of high resolution and accuracy that offer map interpretation in addition to a number of soil properties.

AB  - The productivity of Indonesia's palm oil was considered low when referring to the 14.6 million ha land area in 2019, with the production of national palm oil only reaching 3.2 tons of CPO/ha/year. The uses of remote sensing technology as a means of monitoring and supervising, were expected to increase oil palm production in line with productivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the economic potential based on oil palm plantation productivity, with and without using remote sensing-based technology, as well as other variables likely to affect productivity. Primary and secondary data collection methods were also used in this research. There were three quantitative methods being used in this study, namely (i) Multiple regression model with panel data, (ii) Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) tool, and (iii) Multinomial logistic regression technique. The results showed that the generated economic potential from the utilization of the remote sensing model, had efficient opportunity value of 10.48, which was higher than the non-usage of the technology. Therefore, the main variables that affected productivity in this study, were fertilizer and labour.

AB  - Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) as a space ecosystem runner government institution of the space agency in Indonesia is mandated by Indonesia space law of 2013 to carry out remote sensing activities that are not only strategic nationally in nature but also charged being benefits economically. This study investigated the intangible economic benefits of remote sensing activities in Indonesia. This research explored qualitatively the advantage of the use of remote sensing information by users obtained from the results of questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The conceptual framework of intangible benefit is based on the information system success model by the De-Lone and McLean Information Value model. The results showed that the quality of remote sensing was good. This can be seen from most responses of user respondents on the Perceived System Quality and Information Quality indicators giving a good rating. The response of the user respondents caused a sense of satisfaction and also caused the use of the system to be more intense. These had a good impact on the performance of respondents, both individually and organizationally. Strengthened by indepth interviews showed that economically provide benefits with an average of 64% increasing in the efficiency of the performance by Agriculture and Palm Oil sectors. In short, space agency in Indonesia is proven to provide intangible economic benefits on remote sensing activities.

PY  - 2020
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the economic health cost from smoke exposure from wildfires in the past 20 years, particularly in the north-western USA that is reflected in an emergent literature. In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of studies since 2006 on the health impacts of wildfire smoke and of approaches for the estimation of the associated economic cost. We focus on the choice of key variables such as cost estimators for determining the economic impact of mortality and morbidity effects. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion and guidance on the functioning, advantages and challenges of BenMAP-CE, freely available software of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that has been used in a growing number of studies to assess cost from wildfire smoke. We highlight what generates differences in outcomes between relevant studies and make suggestions for increasing the comparability between studies. All studies, however, demonstrate highly significant health cost from smoke exposure, in the millions or billions of US dollars, often driven by increases in mortality. The results indicate the need to take health cost into account for a comprehensive analysis of wildfire impacts.

TI  - Decision Analysis For Tornado Warning And Evacuation
JO  - Natural Hazards Review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Uncertainties associated with decision making regarding tornado warnings can lead to false warnings and missed events. A false warning is a situation when the public is warned about a tornado and one does not actually occur. A missed event is a catastrophic situation where a tornado touchdown occurs without an advance warning. This paper mainly focuses on how false warnings and missed events influence the decision-making process of households and forecasters. The underlying factors for false warnings and missed events are analyzed in detail. Forecasters’ decision making about tornado warnings and the public’s decision to respond to a warning are analyzed using a probabilistic decision-tree approach. A logical basis for decision making is developed, and a fundamental inequality for decisions regarding tornado warnings is identified. This logical basis is applicable to other disasters as well. False warning and missed event probabilities are analyzed using the data from the Canadian Prairies. The overall analysis is applicable to improve the tornado-warning performance in the Canadian Prairies.\n\n

TI  - Earth Observation From Space – The Issue Of Environmental Sustainability
JO  - Space Policy
PY  - 2013
AB  - Remote sensing scientists work under assumptions that should not be taken for granted and should, therefore, be challenged. These assumptions include the following:\n 1. Space, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO), will always be available to governmental and commercial space entities that launch Earth remote sensing missions. \n 2. Space launches are benign with respect to environmental impacts. \n 3. Minimization of Type 1 error, which provides increased confidence in the experimental outcome, is the best way to assess the significance of environmental change. \n 4. Large-area remote sensing investigations, i.e. national, continental, global studies, are best done from space. \n 5. National space missions should trump international, cooperative space missions to ensure national control and distribution of the data products. \nAt best, all of these points are arguable, and in some cases, they’re wrong. Development of observational space systems that are compatible with sustainability principles should be a primary concern when Earth remote sensing space systems are envisioned, designed, and launched. The discussion is based on the hypothesis that reducing the environmental impacts of the data acquisition step, which is at the very beginning of the information stream leading to decision and action, will enhance coherence in the information stream and strengthen the capacity of measurement processes to meet their stated functional goal, i.e. sustainable management of Earth resources. We suggest that unconventional points of view should be adopted and when appropriate, remedial measures considered that could help to reduce the environmental footprint of space remote sensing and of Earth observation and monitoring systems in general. This article discusses these five assumptions in the context of sustainable management of Earth’s resources. Taking each assumption in turn, we find the following: \n(1) Space debris may limit access to Low Earth Orbit over the next decades. \n(2) Relatively speaking, given that they’re rare event, space launches may be benign, but study is\nmerited on upper stratospheric and exospheric layers given the chemical activity associated with rocket combustion by-products. \n(3) Minimization of Type II error should be considered in situations where minimization of Type I error\ngreatly hampers or precludes our ability to correct the environmental condition being studied. \n(4) In certain situations, airborne collects may be less expensive and more environmentally benign,\nand comparative studies should be done to determine which path is wisest. \n(5) International cooperation and data sharing will reduce instrument and launch costs and mission redundancy. Given fiscal concerns of most of the major space agencies e e.g. NASA, ESA, CNES e it seems prudent to combine resources.

JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2012
AB  - Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the "space arm" for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan. This paper describes a coordinated program of demonstration projects conducted by CEOS member agencies and partners to utilize Earth observations to enhance energy management end-user decision support systems. We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers. These projects show the utility of Earth observations to enhance renewable energy resource assessment in the developing world, forecast space weather impacts on the power grid, and improve energy efficiency in the built environment.

AB  - This article investigates howthe implementation ofa national space strategy in partnership with supranational organizations affects the development of service ecosystems of Earth Observation (EO) applications. The subject is studied through the lens of a servicedominantlogicperspective, ameta-theorythatseeks to explain how economic value is cocreated in business-to-business markets. Qualitative empirical research was conducted in three emerging space countries—Slovakia, Latvia, and Estonia—to understand how value-creating resource integration processes involving space downstream companies and their potential end-users are affected by adding the European Space Agency (ESA) to the ecosystem. The study’s findings showed that the catalytic procurement of prototypes ofnewEOapplications through ESA is connected to multilevel institutional changes in relevant service ecosystems. ESA’s involvement facilitates more intensive interaction between EO companies and their targeted customers in dyadic relationships. Value cocreation processes are influenced by micro-, meso-, and macrolevel institutions. The study highlights the linkages between ESA’s involvement and the purposeful entrepreneurial efforts of EO companies to change prevailing institutional arrangements. This institutional work is aimed at reconfiguring institutional arrangement at the mesolevel to make it more supportive to value-creating resource integration activities between actors in a service ecosystem.

TI  - Forest Service Spending On Large Wildfires In The West
PY  - 2012
AB  - Since the 1970s, federal spending on wildfire suppression in the United States has grown, reaching $1 billion annually over the past decade. The USDA Forest Service has also increasingly used private contractors to conduct fire suppression. As with all activities that the Forest Service performs, the agency can employ staff directly, contract with outside businesses, or enter into agreements with nonprofit and other government entities to perform fire suppression. Historically, the Forest Service primarily used agency personnel for much of its suppression activities. However, with the decline of Forest Service personnel in the 1990s, the agency turned to contractors more frequently. Despite these growing costs and the larger role of private businesses in fire suppression, relatively little is known outside the land management agencies about what these funds are spent on, how they are spent, which activities are contracted out, and where this spending occurs. Yet, the choices that the Forest Service makes in wildfire suppression spending affect communities and economies near wildfires. In particular, local and regional capture of suppression contracts and local employment of agency staff can help mediate the negative economic impacts of a wildfire.

TI  - Linking Earth Observation And Mobile Technologies For Improved Decision-Support In Case Of Droughts And Related Food Insecurity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Droughts are complex events that constitute a natural part of the climate. Among all natural disasters they show the largest spatio-temporal extent, cause enormous economic loss and numerous casualties. Although droughts pose a threat to both industrialized and developing countries the latter often suffer from chronic poverty and vulnerability, which pave the way for wide-ranging impacts. Earth observation can support aid organizations that are often struggling to cope with the impact of large-scale drought events. However, exploiting the added-value of new technologies requires tools that are adapted to individual user requirements and in-depth knowledge transfer. Within the framework of a project named SATIDA (Satellite Technologies for Improved Drought Risk Assessment) this dissertation links satellite-derived information that aims at the detection of environmental anomalies to information about socio-economic conditions, collected via a corresponding open-source mobile application. The satellite component is based on the combination of different satellite observations (rainfall, soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation health) in an Enhanced Combined Drought Index (ECDI). The soil moisture component, which is considered a key variable between atmospheric and land surface conditions, is improved by linking near-real-time (NRT) observations from active and passive microwave sensors to an offline dataset that was generated within the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). This way, it is possible to detect soil moisture anomalies based on more than 37 years of data (19782015). Supported by Doctors without Borders, the tests were conducted in the Central African Republic and in Ethiopia. The dissertation results in three key findings. First, current NRT observations of soil moisture are mature enough to be considered for operational drought monitoring. Second, the method to combine different variables in the ECDI facilitates exploiting the individual strengths of all input datasets, and the robust detection of major drought events. Third, the combination of earth observation and mobile technologies is beneficial for humanitarian aid organizations that aim at pro-active disaster risk reduction.

TI  - A Bayesian Approach To Decision Making In Applied Meteorology
JO  - Journal of Applied Meteorology
PY  - 1962
AB  - The problem of decision making in applied meteorology is approached from the point of view of decision theory and subjectivist statistics. The modern concept of "utility" is discussed, and optional rules for decision making based on the availability of a limited amount of meteorological data are presented and discussed. Bayes' theorem forms the basis for the statistical estimation of the frequencies of various alternative weather events. The method is applied to a single example for the purpose of illustration, but it is emphasized that the generality of these techniques is great and that they warrant further study.

TI  - Monitoring Sustainable Development By Means Of Earth Observation Data And Machine Learning: A Review
JO  - Environmental Sciences Europe
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper presents and explores the different Earth Observation approaches and their contribution to the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A review on the Sustainable Development concept and its goals is presented followed by Earth Observation approaches relevant to this field, giving special attention to the contribution of Machine Learning methods and algorithms as well as their potential and capabilities to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, it is observed that Earth Observation plays a key role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals given its cost-effectiveness pertaining to data acquisition on all scales and information richness. Despite the success of Machine Learning upon Earth Observation data analysis, it is observed that performance is heavily dependent on the ability to extract and synthesise characteristics from data. Hence, a deeper and effective analysis of the available data is required to identify the strongest features and, hence, the key factors pertaining to Sustainable Development. Overall, this research provides a deeper understanding on the relation between Sustainable Development, Earth Observation and Machine Learning, and how these can support the Sustainable Development of countries and the means to find their correlations. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, given the relevance and growing amount of data generated through Earth Observation, it is concluded that there is an increased need for new methods and techniques strongly suggesting the use of new Machine Learning techniques.

TI  - Free Satellite Imagery And Digital Elevation Model Analyses Enabling Natural Resource Management In The Developing World: Studies From Eastern Indonesia
JO  - Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography
PY  - 2017
AB  - Decentralization of governance and natural resource management is an ongoing process in many parts of Africa and Asia. Natural resource management requires spatial land resource data for planning. However, currently the financial and human capacity for natural resource mapping, monitoring and modelling remains low in local governments. In this context, this paper explores how new opportunities provided by the increasing availability of free satellite imagery, digital elevation data and open source spatial analysis software, can be applied by local government and NGOs to conduct sophisticated natural resource mapping and modelling in ways that meet their needs and incorporates local knowledge. Reported are cases of a local government using free geospatial data and GIS software to improve evidence-based natural resource management in the developing world with a focus on raster data applications for satellite image analysis and terrain modelling. It is argued that, through removing barriers to uptake, such applications provide a means of decentralizing landscape analysis skills to improve local natural resource management. This hypothesis is supported through examples of a local government applying these tools in eastern Indonesia, and within this context barriers to wider adoption are explored.

TI  - Weather Impacts On Natural, Social And Economic Systems
PY  - 2000
AB  - The EU project Weather Impacts on Natural, Social and Economic Systems (WISE) has analysed impacts of current climate variability to evaluate the sensitivity of today's society to extreme weather. Unlike studies of anticipated impacts of climate change, WISE did not rely on scenarios and projections, but on existing and newly collected data. The research involved (i) the statistical modelling of meteorological and sectoral time series, aimed at quantifying the impacts of changing weather variables on sector output, (ii) a population survey, aimed at investigating public perception of and behavioural response to unusually hot and dry summers and mild winters, and (iii) a management survey, aimed at obtaining insight into managers' awareness and perception of the importance of extreme weather on their operations. The three activities revealed a wealth of data and information, providing relevant insights into Germany's sensitivity to and perception of extreme weather events. Sectors that were analysed included agriculture, outdoor fire, water supply, human health, electricity and gas consumption and tourism. It appears from the statistical modelling that extreme weather can have impressive impacts on all sectors, especially when expressed in monetary terms. However, weather variability is generally considered a manageable risk, to which sectors in Germany appear reasonably well-adapted. The population and management surveys reveal both positive and negative impacts of extreme weather. People generally respond to these impacts by adjusting their activities. The utilities (electricity, gas and water) indicate that they are robsut to the current level of weather variability and do not consider climate change an important threat to their operations. The tourism sector experiences impacts but typically takes a reactive approach to adaptation, although it is also developing weather-insensitive products.

TI  - An Economic Value Of Remote-Sensing Information—Application To Agricultural Production And Maintaining Groundwater Quality
PY  - 2012
AB  - Does remote-sensing information provide economic benefits to society, and can a value be assigned to those benefits? Can resource management and policy decisions be better informed by coupling past and present Earth observations with groundwater nitrate measurements? Using an integrated assessment approach, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) applied an established conceptual framework to answer these questions, as well as to estimate the value of information (VOI) for remote-sensing imagery. The approach uses moderate-resolution land-imagery (MRLI) data from the Landsat and Advanced Wide Field Sensor satellites that has been classified by the National Agricultural Statistics Service into the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Within the constraint of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s public health threshold for potable groundwater resources, the USGS modeled the relation between a population of the CDL’s land uses and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers in a case study region in northeastern Iowa. Employing various multiscaled, multitemporal geospatial datasets with MRLI to maximize the value of agricultural production, the approach develops and uses multiple environmental science models to address dynamic nitrogen loading and transport at specified distances from specific sites (wells) and at landscape scales (for example, across 35 counties and two aquifers). In addition to the ecosystem service of potable groundwater, this effort focuses on the use of MRLI for the management of the major land uses in the study region—the production of corn and soybeans, which can impact groundwater quality. Derived methods and results include (1) economic and dynamic nitrate-pollution models, (2) probabilities of the survival of groundwater, and (3) a VOI for remote sensing. For the northeastern Iowa study region, the marginal benefit of the MRLI VOI (in 2010 dollars) is $858 million ± $197 million annualized, which corresponds to a net present value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits in perpetuity. Given that these economic estimates are derived from one case study in a part of only one State, the estimates provide a lower estimate related to the potential value of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission.

TI  - Economic Benefits Of Meteorological Services
JO  - Meteorological Applications
PY  - 2002
AB  - There is an increasing need for more rigorous and more broadly based determination of the economic value of meteorological services as an aid to decision-making on the appropriate level of funding to be committed to their provision at the national level. This paper develops an overall framework for assessment of the economic value of meteorological services based on the recognition that most national meteorological infrastructure and services possess the non-rival properties of public goods. Given this overall framework for determination of both total and marginal benefits, four main methodologies appropriate for use in valuation studies – market prices, normative or prescriptive decision-making models, descriptive behavioural response studies and contingent valuation studies – are outlined and their strengths and limitations described. Notwithstanding the methodological limitations and the need for a much more comprehensive set of studies for the various application sectors, it is clear that the actual and potential benefits to individuals, firms, industry sectors and national economies from stateof-the-art meteorological and related services are substantial and that, at this stage, they are inadequately recognised and insufficiently exploited in many countries.

TI  - Economic And Social Benefits Of Meteorology And Climatology In Switzerland
JO  - Meteorological Applications
PY  - 2010
AB  - National Meteorological Services provide meteorological data, information, forecasts and various related products, which are important for the smooth functioning of many aspects in economy, administration and society. The merit of meteorological services cannot be deduced directly from the consumption of services. Rather, it emerges from the improvement of decisions by economic stakeholders thanks to weather and climate information. These services are purchased by users in order to be able to offer optimally or demand a certain service or, with respect to security, these services aim at helping to prevent damage from extreme events.\n\nA rough estimate for a number of selected sectors shows that benefits from weather services in Switzerland are in the region of hundreds of millions Swiss Francs (1 Swiss Franc ∼ €0.66, US$0.83 as at 2008).\n\nThis pilot study shows that it is not possible to estimate one single figure representing the overall benefit from weather services in a country. Concerning the economic sector, a benefit analysis should therefore concentrate on those sub-sectors where weather services are particularly relevant, i.e. agriculture, construction, energy, insurance, telecommunication, tourism, transport, logistics and water availability. Analysis of benefits from climate data is of particular interest to MeteoSwiss since the Federal Office is the main source for climate data in Switzerland. Climate data form the basis on which climate change and possible climate threats can be detected.\n\nThis study estimates for the first time the socio-economic benefits of meteorological and climatic information in Switzerland as a small developed European country and gives an outlook of how a further study might be designed.

AB  - Meteorological services involve the provision of information on the state of the atmosphere and the ground surface. They provide data, information, forecasts and various related products, which are important for the smooth functioning of many aspects of the economy, government and society. The economic value or benefit of weather forecasts consists in generally improving financial and related outcomes resulting from the use of such forecasts. The merit of meteorological services cannot directly be deduced from the consumption of services. Rather, it emerges from the improvement of decisions made by economic stakeholders thanks to weather-related information. This is the first empirical study on this topic for Switzerland which includes economic data from interviewed users. The results show that the use of meteorology in the road transportation sector in Switzerland generates an economic benefit to the national economy of 65.7–79.77 million Swiss francs (1 Swiss franc ∼0.90 €, 1.20 US$ as of August 2011). In relation to its budget the overall benefit to the national meteorological service might be several times that amount, considering that many other economic sectors such as agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, media and tourism were not included in this study. Furthermore, climate services were not taken into account in this study and, therefore, the economic benefit for the road traffic sector alone might in fact be even higher.

TI  - Landsat In Contexts: Deconstructing And Reconstructing The Data-To-Action Paradigm In Earth Remote Sensing
PY  - 2019
AB  - There is a common theme at play in our talk of data generally, of digital earth data more specifically, and of environmental monitoring most specifically: more data leads to more action and, ultimately, to societal good. This data-to-action framework is troubled. Its taken-for grantedness prevents us from attending to the processes between data and action. It also dampens our drive to investigate the contexts of that data, that action, and that envisioned societal good. In this dissertation, I deconstruct this data-to-action model in the context of Landsat, the United States' first natural resource management satellite. First, I talk about the ways in which Landsat's data and instrumentation hold conflicting narratives and values within them. Therefore, Landsat data does not automatically or easily yield action toward environmental preservation, or toward any unified societal good. Furthermore, I point out a parallel dynamic in STS, where critique is somewhat analogous to data. We want our critiques to yield action, and to guide us toward a more just technoscience. However, critiques- like data- require intentional, reconstructive interventions toward change. Here is an opportunity for a diffractive intervention: one in which we read STS and remote sensingthrough each other, to create space for interdisciplinary dialogue around environmental preservation. A focus on this shared goal, I argue, is imperative. At stake are issues of environmental degradation, dwindling resources, and climate change. I conclude with beginnings rather than endings: with suggestions for how we might begin to create infrastructure that attends to that forgotten space between data, critique, action, and change.

TI  - A Conceptual Framework For Assessing The Benefits Of A Global Earth Observation System Of Systems
JO  - IEEE Systems Journal
PY  - 2008
AB  - The aim of the Global Earth Observation System-ofSystems (GEOSS) is to improve the information available to decision makers, at all levels, relating to human health and safety, protection of the global environment, the reduction of losses from natural disasters, and achieving sustainable development. Specifically, GEOSS proposes that better international cooperation in the collection, interpretation, and sharing of Earth observation information is an important and cost-effective mechanism for achieving this aim. While there is a widespread intuition that this proposition is correct, at some point the following question needs to be answered: how much additional investment in Earth observation (and specifically, in its international integration) is enough? This leads directly to some challenging subsidiary questions, such as how can the benefits of Earth observation be assessed? What are the incremental costs of GEOSS? Are there societal benefit areas where the return on investment is higher than in others? The GeoBene Project has developed a “benefit chain” concept as a framework for addressing these questions. The basic idea is that an incremental improvement in the observing system (including its data collection, interpretation and information-sharing aspects) will result in an improvement in the quality of decisions based on that information. In turn, this will lead to better societal outcomes, which have a value. This incremental value must be judged against the incremental cost of the improved observation system. Since in many cases there will be large uncertainties in the estimation of both the costs and the benefits, and it may not be possible to express them in comparable monetary terms, we show how order-of-magnitude approaches and a qualitative understanding of the shape of the cost and benefit curves can help guide rational investment decisions in Earth Observation Systems.

It describes the evolution from algorithm development from in applied research to the implementation in user driven applications and systems. Concerning TIMELINE, the focus of the work lies on hot spot detection. A detailed description of the choice of a suitable algorithm (round robin approach) will be given. Moreover, strengths and weaknesses of the AVHRR sensor for hot spot detection, a literature review, the study areas and the selected approach will be highlighted. The evaluation showed that the contextual algorithm performed best, and will therefore be used for final implementation. Concerning the PHAROS project, the key aspect is on the use of satellite-based information to provide valuable support to all phases of disaster management. The project focuses on developing a pre-operational sustainable service platform that integrates space-based EO (Earth Observation), terrestrial sensors and communication and navigation assets to enhance the availability of services and products following a multi-hazard approach.

TI  - Essential Variables For Environmental Monitoring: What Are The Possible Contributions Of Earth Observation Data Cubes?
JO  - Data
PY  - 2020
AB  - Environmental sustainability is nowadays a major global issue that requires efficient and effective responses from governments. Essential variables (EV) have emerged in different scientific communities as a means to characterize and follow environmental changes through a set of measurements required to support policy evidence. To help track these changes, our planet has been under continuous observation from satellites since 1972. Currently, petabytes of satellite Earth observation (EO) data are freely available. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized because many big data challenges and complexity barriers hinder their effective use. Consequently, facilitating the production of EVs using the wealth of satellite EO data can be beneficial for environmental monitoring systems. In response to this issue, a comprehensive list of EVs that can take advantage of consistent time-series satellite data has been derived. In addition, a set of use-cases, using an Earth Observation Data Cube (EODC) to process large volumes of satellite data, have been implemented to demonstrate the practical applicability of EODC to produce EVs. The proposed approach has been successfully tested showing that EODC can facilitate the production of EVs at different scales and benefiting from the spatial and temporal dimension of satellite EO data for enhanced environmental monitoring.\n

TI  - Knowledge Generation Using Satellite Earth Observations To Support Sustainable Development Goals (Sdg): A Use Case On Land Degradation
JO  - International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation
PY  - 2020
AB  - Land degradation is a critical issue globally requiring immediate actions for protecting biodiversity and associated services provided by ecosystems that are supporting human quality of life. The latest Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Landmark Assessment Report highlighted that human activities are considerably degrading land and threating the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion\npeople. In order to reduce and ideally reverse this prevailing situation, national capacities should be strengthened to enable effective assessments and mapping of their degraded lands as recommended by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The indicator 15.3.1 (“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”) requires regular data production by countries to inform and assess it through space and time. Earth\nObservations (EO) can play an important role both for generating the indicator in countries where it is missing, as well complementing or enhancing national official data sources. In response to this issue, this paper presents an innovative, scalable and flexible approach to monitor land degradation at various scales (e.g., national, regional, global) using various components of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) platform to leverage EO resources for informing SDG 15.3.1. The proposed approach follows the Data-Information-Knowledge pattern using the Trends.Earth model (http://trends.earth) and various data sources to generate the indicator. It also implements additional components for model execution and orchestration, knowledge management, and visualization. The proposed approach has been successfully applied at global, regional and national scales and advances the vision of (1) establishing data analytics platforms that can potentially support countries to discover, access and use the necessary datasets to assess land degradation; and (2) developing new capacities to effectively and efficiently use EO-based resources.

TI  - Live Monitoring Of Earth Surface (Limes): A Framework For Monitoring Environmental Changes From Earth Observations
JO  - Remote Sensing of Environment
PY  - 2017
AB  - Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale.This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.

People representing several disciplines and fields of endeavor were asked what they would have done in October 1972 had they had an accurate forecast in terms of monthly averages of rainfall and temperature for the rainy season in 1973. The paper contains their responses and discusses their recommendations in light of the existing social, political, economic, and environmental constraints existing not only in the Sahelian countries but also in the international community. The author's purpose in submitting the paper to the Bulletin is to share information about the existing societal framework (in, for example, the West African Sahel) into which such weather information would be put. The paper is concerned with the social value of the weather information that will most likely be developed in the scientific communities in the industrialized countries.

TI  - As Seen From Space: Tele-Epidemiological Data As Pandemic Memory
JO  - Oracle: The History Journal of Boston College
PY  - 2022
AB  - In the modern world, data is instrumental in historical storytelling. The magnitude of events, who they impacted, and the degree to which the events were managed are all, very often, told through the lens of data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of such data-driven history, where statistics on infections, death, vaccination, and average mobility are used to tell the story of how the pandemic unfolded in a given locale. While such statistical history is useful, it can also efface the histories of locations that lack access to the proper surveillance infrastructure, or are otherwise unable to deploy it. This produces an erasure of pandemic memory in healthcare-challenged areas, as deaths and infections go unrecorded and undocumented. This paper proposes the use of satellites to correct this, using Earth observation technologies to track viral vectors and find and document mass burial sites to produce a fuller picture of pandemic history, with an emphasis on filling the statistical gaps between the developed and developing world.

TI  - Supporting Better Decisions Across The Nexus Of Water, Energy And Food Through Earth Observation Data: Case Of The Zambezi Basin
JO  - Proceedings of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences
PY  - 2018
AB  - The water–energy–food (WEF) nexus has been promoted in recent years as an intersectional concept designed to improve planning and regulatory decision-making across the three sectors. The production and consumption of water, energy and food resources are inextricably linked across multiple spatial scales (from the global to the local), but a common feature is competition for land which through different land management practices mediates provisioning ecosystem services. The nexus perspective seeks to understand the interlinkages and use systems-based thinking to frame management options for the present and the future. It aims to highlight advantage and minimise damaging and unsustainable outcomes through informed decisions regarding trade-offs inclusive of economic, ecological and equity considerations. Operationalizing the WEF approach is difficult because of the lack of complete data, knowledge and observability – and the nature of the challenge also depends on the scale of the investigation. Transboundary river basins are particularly challenging because whilst the basin unit defines the hydrological system this is not necessarily coincident with flows of food and energy. There are multiple national jurisdictions and geopolitical relations to consider. Land use changes have a profound influence on hydrological, agricultural, energy provisioning and regulating ecosystem services. Future policy decisions in the water, energy and food sectors could have profound effects, with different demands for land and water resources, intensifying competition for these resources in the future. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse the land cover changes in the Zambezi river basin (1.4 million km2) from 1992 to 2015 using the European Space Agency annual global land cover dataset. Early results indicate transformative processes are underway with significant shifts from tree cover to cropland, with a 4.6 % loss in tree cover and a 16 % gain in cropland during the study period. The changes were found to be occurring mainly in the eastern (Malawi and Mozambique) and southern (Zimbabwe and southern Zambia) parts of the basin. The area under urban land uses was found to have more than doubled during the study period gearing urban centres increasingly as the foci for resource consumption. These preliminary findings are the first step in understanding the spatial and temporal interlinkages of water, energy and food by providing reliable and consistent evidence spanning the local, regional, national and whole transboundary basin scale.

TI  - Economic Evaluation Of Research To Improve The Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System
JO  - Forestry
PY  - 2012
AB  - Canada is a largely forested country, and the economic, environmental, and social effects of the country's wildland fire management are of great importance from an industry and public policy perspective. Investment in research can improve the efficiency of wildland fire management and has an important role in the decision-making process. There is a long history of research investment in Canada related to wildland fire management, including the development of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS). To demonstrate the range of net benefits of the CFFDRS to Canadian society, a cost-benefit study was conducted on research related to enhancing the current system. The benefits of research were measured as the difference in economic returns with additional investment in research, primarily achieved through reduction in damages to timber resources and savings in suppression expenditure (the “with-research scenario”) and those that would have resulted with no changes to the current CFFDRS (the “without-research scenario”). A triangular probability distribution was used to address uncertainty and the results indicated high levels of net economic benefit if the CFFDRS were to be enhanced by additional research investment, with “most likely” estimates of net present value ranging from $30 million to $1.5 billion ($Cdn).

TI  - Simulating The Value Of El Nino Forecasts For The Panama Canal
JO  - Advances in Water Resources
PY  - 2006
AB  - The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canal’s primary storage facility, for operations—principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (July–December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914–1997. Operational capabilities to predict\ntropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment ‘‘virtual’’ canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981–1998. The results show the following main points:\n(i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate.\n(ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies.\n(iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments.\n(iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately $US 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.

TI  - The Ecors System: A Mobility Decision-Making Tool Based On Earth Observation Data
JO  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
PY  - 2009
AB  - This study describes the decision-making system ECORS, dedicated to soils and roads characterization for mobility purposes in operational contexts. This project was initiated by the DGA (Délégation Générale à l’Armement, France) and left to a consortium’s care for the technical realization. This consortium integrates different laboratories, research centers and private companies, specialized in such problematic. The objectives of such study are first to analyze and evaluate current operational technologies able to characterize roads, tracks, and cross-country for mobility either in France or in international contexts. The main data sources authorized are those coming from remote sensors, including remote-sensing data, existing databases, i.e., Topobase Defense, Corinne Landcover, NOAA, etc or opensource data. These data are stored into a GIS oriented tool used for calculating the capacities for vehicles to run on a specific operational theatre. This last operation involves different techniques of data fusion or transformation for estimating the vehicles speed. For this purpose, vehicles performances tables, depending on the theatre features, are established for several climatic scenarios. We describe here the ECORS system, including the selected data sources used in the different processing steps, the technical specifications related to the system architecture and the validation protocols where different decision-making maps are compared to validation data observed on the field.

TI  - A Performance, Semantic And Service Qualityenhanced Distributed Search Engine For Improving Geospatial Resource Discovery
JO  - International Journal of Geographical Information Science
PY  - 2013
AB  - Geospatial resource discovery is a critical step for developing geographic science applications. With the increasing number of geospatial resources available online, many Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) components (e.g. catalogues and portals) have been developed to help manage and discover geospatial resources. However, efficient and accurate geospatial resource discovery is still a big challenge because of the heterogeneity and complexity of decentralized network environments and interdisciplinary semantics. In this article, we report a search engine framework for efficient geospatial resource discovery, which reduces integration costs by leveraging existing Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) components. Specifically, (1) the framework provides integration capability and flexibility by adopting the brokering approach, implementing a ‘plug-in’-based framework for metadata processing and proposing a dynamically configurable search workflow; (2) the asynchronous messaging and batch processing-based metadata record retrieval mode enhances the search performance and user interactivity; (3) an embedded semantic support system improves the discovery recall level and precision by providing semantic-based search rule creation and result similarity evaluation functions and (4) the engine assists user decision-making by integrating a service quality monitoring and evaluation system, data/service visualization tools, multiple views and additional information. Experiments and a search example show that the proposed engine helps both scientists and general users search for more accurate results with enhanced performance and user experience through a user-friendly interface.

AB  - Climate and weather conditions affect almost every industry in nearly every country. Over the coming decades climate change could potentially have adverse impacts on many countries and on a range of industries. For example, agricultural production, particularly in some of the developing regions of the world is likely to be hard hit by climate change over the coming decades. Hence, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of greenhouse warming are critical for regional and global sustainability. In this context, the importance of collection, dissemination and use of climate information across many countries as a global public good is highlighted in this paper.

TI  - The Economic Value Of Geological Information: Synthesis And Directions For Future Research
JO  - Resources Policy
PY  - 2015
AB  - Geological information can play a key role in addressing challenges of sustainable development such as land degradation and groundwater protection, and contribute to improved decision-making processes. In this paper we: (a) provide a review of previous research on the economic value of geological information and other earth observations as well as related products, services and infrastructure; and (b) identify important lessons from this work as well as methodological challenges that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research shows significant economic benefits attached to the generation of this type of public information. The value of geological information has typically been measured in terms of avoided costs. Still, it is difficult to compare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning which sectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in their treatment of potential (rather than only existing) users, and employ varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future research should devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of this type of information, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing the role of potential users. A number of specific methodological challenges also deserve further scrutiny in future research, such as the use of discount rates and benefit-transfer approaches. We also provide some thoughts on how to proceed with such research.

TI  - A Cost-Benefit Analysis Of The National Map
PY  - 2004
AB  - The Geography Discipline of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted this cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of The National Map. This analysis is an evaluation of the proposed Geography Discipline initiative to provide the Nation with a \nmechanism to access current and consistent digital geospatial data. This CBA is a supporting document to accompany the Exhibit 300 Capital Asset Plan and Business Case of The National Map Reengineering Program. \nThe framework for estimating the benefits is based on expected improvements in processing information to perform any of the possible applications of spatial data. This analysis does not attempt to determine the benefits and costs of performing geospatial-data applications. Rather, it estimates the change in the differences between those benefits and costs with The National Map and the current situation without it. The estimates of total costs and benefits of The National Map were based on the projected implementation time, development and maintenance costs, rates of data inclusion and integration, expected usage levels over time, and a benefits estimation model. \nThe National Map provides data that are current, integrated, consistent, complete, and more accessible in order to decrease the cost of implementing spatial-data applications and (or) improve the outcome of those applications. The efficiency gains in per-application improvements are greater than the cost to develop and maintain The National Map, meaning that the program would bring a positive net benefit to the Nation. The average improvement in the net benefit of performing a spatial data application was multiplied by a simulated number of application implementations across the country. The numbers of users, existing applications, and rates of application implementation increase over time as The National Map is developed and accessed by spatial data users around the country

TI  - Potential Value Of Gcm-Based Seasonal Rainfall Forecasts For Maize Management In Semi-Arid Kenya
JO  - Agricultural Systems
PY  - 2009
AB  - We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October–February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions – representing upper and lower bounds of predictability – and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15–30% of the average gross value of production and 24–69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study’s assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.

TI  - Realizing The Potential Benefits Of Climate Prediction To Agriculture: Issues, Approaches, Challenges
JO  - Agricultural Systems
PY  - 2002
AB  - Advances in our ability to predict climate fluctuations months in advance suggest opportunity to improve management of climatic risk in agriculture, but only if particular conditions are in place. This paper outlines prerequisites to beneficial forecast use; highlights key issues, approaches and challenges related to each; and suggests an evolutionary strategy. The first prerequisite is that forecast information must address a need that is both real and perceived. Second, benefit arises only through viable decision options that are sensitive to forecast information. Third, benefit depends on prediction of the components of climate variability that are relevant to viable decisions. Fourth, appropriate forecast use requires effective communication of relevant information. Finally, sustained use requires institutional commitment and favorable policies. It is useful to consider three phases of effort: an exploratory phase to gain understanding and assess potential, a pilot phase characterized by co-learning between researchers and target decision makers, and an operational phase focusing on engaging and equipping relevant institutions. Although examples of use and potential use, and advances in institutional support, are cause for optimism, use of climate prediction by agriculture is still too new to support strong generalizations about its value.

TI  - Earth Observation And The Public Good
JO  - Space Policy
PY  - 2011
AB  - The term ‘public good’ is often used in satellite Earth observation to indicate that Earth observation data are of value or interest to the public. In fact, the term ‘public good’ has a more specific meaning, originating in the discipline of Economics, which carries with it a set of assumptions and implications about how markets operate. In this context a public good has two main characteristics: non-rivalry and nonexcludability. In their most common digital format, Earth observation data can appear to be both nonrivalrous and non-excludable. However, it is not the digital medium itself which controls the ‘publicness’ of a good but the conditions of access to that good. This paper explores the meaning of the concept of public goods in an Earth observation context by, first, examining public good theory and related concepts of categories of goods and, second, applying the concepts to nine Earth observation missions, programmes and data.

JO  - Space Policy
PY  - 2015
AB  - From the Heads of State of the G8 nations, the European Union, international organisations, through to national laws and policies, there is a strong momentum for full, free and open access to public sector digital data so that the benefits of public investment in such data can be maximised with as few barriers to use as possible. While open data for society at large is a relatively new phenomenon, the space sector has been accustomed to open data for all of its existence, especially in astronomy and navigation, but also in Earth observation. In the context of the open data debate, the purpose of this paper is to examine 21 policy and legal instruments concerning open data made by a range of organisations that in one way or another relate to Earth observation data and therefore contribute to the critical examination of the effectiveness of the open data movement. Based on these documents, the paper discusses common issues such as changing perspectives on the desirability of open data, commercial use, and licences and exceptions, and concludes that open access to Earth observation data requires more specification in order to clarify the conditions of access and so to realise fully the potential benefits.

TI  - Benefits Of Meteorological Services In South Eastern Europe
PY  - 2008
AB  - The study evaluated the impacts and potential benefits of meteorological and hydrological information services in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro. The services were analysed for the sectors of transport, construction industry, energy production, flood protection and agriculture production. The study was part of a larger project for the development of weather and climate observation networks and meteorological services in South Eastern Europe countries. In Albania advanced meteorological information services would produce annual savings worth 24 to 26 million euro. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the potential annual benefits were estimated to be about 10 to 22 million euro, in the FYR Macedonia 12 to 40 million euro and in Moldova 12 to 19 million euro per year. For Montenegro the data available did not enable the differentiation from Serbia for aviation and agriculture sectors. For road transport, construction industry and flood protection the annual savings resulting from better hydrometeorological information would be 1 to 3 million euro. Due to the lack of source information only part of the approximate potential benefits could be estimated at magnitude level, even though, the results show that hydrometeorological services are beneficial and worth developing further. The benefits are to a large extent due to higher predictability rates and better planning of operations as well as better preparedness for accidents and the reduction of human and material losses caused by these accidents. The realisation of the potential benefits requires comprehensive development of the hydrometeorological service systems. This means further development of observation infrastructure, data and transmission systems as well as service processes, operation models and know-how. Not only should the services be developed, but their availability and usability should be improved. The utilisation of communications technology should be enhanced and the awareness of the benefits of various services should be raised.

JO  - International Journal of Wildland Fire
PY  - 2020
AB  - A method for estimating the socioeconomic impact of Earth observations is proposed and deployed. The core of the method is the analysis of outcomes of hypothetical fire suppression scenarios generated using a coupled atmosphere–fire behaviour model, based on decisions made by an experienced wildfire incident management team with and without the benefits of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite observations and the WRF-SFIRE wildfire behaviour simulation system. The scenarios were based on New Mexico’s 2011 Las Conchas fire. For each scenario, fire break line location decisions served as inputs to the model, generating fire progression outcomes. Fire model output was integrated with a property database containing thousands of coordinates and property values and other asset values to estimate the total losses associated with each scenario. An attempt to estimate the socioeconomic impact of satellite and modelling data used during the decision-making process was made. We analysed the impact of Earth observations and include considerations for estimating other socioeconomic impacts.

TI  - Weather Satellites And The Economic Value Of Forecasts: Evidence From The Electric Power Industry
JO  - Acta Astronautica
PY  - 2004
AB  - Data from weather satellites have become integral to the weather forecast process in the United States and abroad. Satellite data are used to derive improved forecasts for short-term routine weather, long-term climate change, and for predicting natural disasters. The resulting forecasts have saved lives, reduced weather-related economic losses, and improved the quality of life. Weather information routinely assists in managing resources more e0ciently and reducing industrial operating costs. The electric energy industry in particular makes extensive use of weather information supplied by both government and commercial suppliers. Through direct purchases of weather data and information, and through participating in the increasing market for weather derivatives, this sector provides measurable indicators of the economic importance of weather information. Space weather in the form of magnetic disturbances caused by coronal mass ejections from the sun creates geomagnetically induced currents that disturb the electric power grid, sometimes causing signi4cant economic impacts on electric power distribution. This paper examines the use of space-derived weather information on the U.S. electric power industry. It also explores issues that may impair the most optimum use of the information and reviews the longer-term opportunities for employing weather data acquired from satellites in future commercial and government activity.

TI  - Satellite Observations Of No2 Indicate Legacy Impacts Of Redlining In U.s. Midwestern Cities
JO  - Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene
PY  - 2022
AB  - Redlining was a practice of financial discrimination in the mid-20th century in which banks refused loans or increased interest rates based on the grade of an applicant’s neighborhood as designated by the federally sponsored Home Owner’s Lending Commission (HOLC). The HOLC primarily graded neighborhoods from “A” (best) to “D” (hazardous) based on characteristics including the racial demographics and economic status of the residents, with neighborhoods with higher percentages of non-white and/or recent immigrant residents given lower grades; this and similar discriminatory practices can be traced to modern-day economic and environmental inequalities between neighborhoods. The legacy of redlining and related housing discrimination on modern-day urban air quality, which presents a significant threat to public health, remains an important issue in addressing environmental injustice in U.S. cities. In our study, we used remotely sensed estimates of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) collected with the TROPOMI satellite sensor, and shapefiles of redlined neighborhoods, to determine whether air quality varies among historic HOLC grades in 11 U.S. Midwestern metropolitan areas. This approach allowed us to test these tools for within-city analysis of NO2 for which high spatial and temporal resolution measurements are not often available, despite their importance for monitoring impacts on human health. We found that NO2 levels were as much as 16% higher in neighborhoods that were graded “D” compared to those graded “A” (as in Chicago), with the mean difference across all cities an increase of 7.3% ± 5.9%. These results present evidence of persistent modern-day inequality in urban air quality associated with historic discriminatory policies and should be used as an argument for government action improving air quality in neighborhoods that were poorly graded by the HOLC.

The study took three years to complete. It examines the drivers of space regulations and standards, key regulatory problems, and especially addresses possible improvements in global space governance. The world's leading experts led the drafting of chapters, with input from academics and knowledgeable professionals in the public and private sectors, intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations from all the regions of the world with over 80 total participants. This book and areas identified for priority action are to be presented to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and it is hoped will be considered directly or indirectly at the UNISPACE+50 event in Vienna, Austria, in 2018.\n\nThe report, a collective work of all the contributors, includes objective analysis and frank statements expressed without pressure of political, national, and occupational concerns or interest. It is peer-reviewed and carefully edited to ensure its accuracy, preciseness, and readability. It is expected that the study and derivative recommendations will form the basis for deliberations and decisions at international conferences and meetings around the world on the theme of global space governance. This will hopefully include future discussion at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.

TI  - Potential Benefits Of Climate Forecasting To Agriculture
JO  - Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment
PY  - 2000
AB  - Climate variability leads to economic and food security risks throughout the world because of its major influences on agriculture. Accurate forecasts of climate 3–6 months ahead of time can potentially allow farmers and others in agriculture to make decisions to reduce unwanted impacts or take advantage of expected favorable climate. However, potential benefits of climate forecasts vary considerably because of many physical, biological, economic, social, and political factors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential economic value of climate forecasts for farm scale management decisions in one location in the Southeast USA (Tifton, GA; 31°23′N; 83°31′W) for comparison with previously-derived results for the Pampas region of Argentina. The same crops are grown in both regions but at different times of the year. First, the expected value of tailoring crop mix to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases for a typical farm in Tifton was estimated using crop models and historical daily weather data. Secondly, the potential values for adjusting management of maize (Zea maize L.) to different types of climate forecasts (perfect knowledge of (a) ENSO phase, (b) growing season rainfall categories, and (c) daily weather) were estimated for Tifton and Pergamino, Argentina (33°55′S; 60°33′W). Predicted benefits to the farm of adjusting crop mix to ENSO phase averaged from US$ 3 to 6 ha−1 over all years, depending on the farmer’s initial wealth and aversion to risk. Values calculated for Argentina were US$ 9–15 for Pergamino and up to US$ 35 for other locations in the Pampas. Varying maize management by ENSO phase resulted in predicted forecast values of US$ 13 and 15 for Tifton and Pergamino, respectively. The potential value of perfect seasonal forecasts of rainfall tercile on maize profit was higher than for ENSO-based forecasts in both regions (by 28% in Tifton and 70% in Pergamino). Perfect knowledge of daily weather over the next season provided an upper limit on expected value of about US$ 190 ha−1 for both regions. Considering the large areas of field crop production in these regions, the estimated economic potential is very high. However, there are a number of challenges to realize these benefits. These challenges are generally related to the uncertainty of climate forecasts and to the complexities of agricultural systems.

TI  - The Potential Value Of Improved Ocean Observation Systems In The Gulf Of Mexico
JO  - Marine Policy
PY  - 2004
AB  - A number of coastal and ocean observation systems exist throughout the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), but the network of systems is\nnot currently linked or integrated and at present not fully implemented. The network of local systems are diverse, typically involving\nunique mandates and several different funding sources at various levels of permanence. The purpose of this paper is to describe the\nocean observation systems that currently exist in the GOM, and to identify and quantify the expected economic benefits that may\nresult from the implementation of an integrated regional network. Improved ocean observation systems are expected to reduce the\nuncertainty of ocean/weather forecasting and to enhance the value of ocean/weather information throughout the Gulf region. The\nsource of benefits and the size of activity from which improved ocean observation benefits may be derived are estimated for private\nsector, non-market, and public sector activities categorized according to marine transportation, commercial fishing, recreational\nfishing, search and rescue operations, and pollution management. The benefits of improved ocean observation systems to energy\nexploration, development, and production activities are estimated, and a discussion of potential benefits to lightering activities,\nenvironmental monitoring, royalty payments, and engineering design are highlighted.\nr 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Value Of Short-Run Climate Forecasts In Managing The Coastal Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus Kisutch) Fishery In Washington State
JO  - Natural Resource Modeling
PY  - 2008
AB  - In recent years our understanding of the intricate connections between climate variability, marine and freshwater environmental conditions and the responses of fish stocks has improved considerably. With predictable relationships between the environment and stock abundance, fishery managers should be able to forecast variation in stock survival and recruitment. Such forecasts present an opportunity for increasing the economic value of fisheries and for achieving other management objectives, such as stock conservation and maintenance of population diversity. After describing a 4-step framework for addressing the question ‘What is a forecast worth?’ in a fishery decision-making context, we introduce the management system for Washington's coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fishery. Then we apply the 4-step framework to estimate the value of improved run size forecasts in the annual harvest management of coho salmon in Washington State. Our principal analytical tool is a stochastic simulation model that incorporates the main characteristics of the fishery. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities and constraints to the use of climate-based forecasts in fishery management on various spatial and temporal scales, and we consider the challenges associated with forecasting variations in fish stock size caused by shifts in climate and related ocean conditions.

TI  - A Decision Support System For Forest Fire Management
JO  - Operational Research
PY  - 2005
AB  - Forest fires are considered natural phenomena but the magnitude of the problem can be attributed to poor forest management and to the extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, the abolishment of traditional activities related to forests has sent away people from the forests that they used to protect them. The aforementioned reasons result in the annual destruction of large forest areas, agricultural cultivations, industries, animals and even human lives. At the same time, catastrophic floods entail the gradual desolation of the affected areas and large amounts of carbon dioxide along with smoke particles aggravate air quality. In the present paper, a Decision Support System is proposed capable to support policy makers and services to counteract wildfires destruction danger in lowland Pine forests. The system is composed of two major components: (a) A Wildfire Destruction Danger Index useful for preventive and suppressive measures planning and decision policy making and (b) a Forest Management Planning Decision Support System useful for fire risk reduction through forest management plan. The open architecture of the system allows incorporation of data coming from external sources e.g. satellite systems, meteorological stations etc. All its subsystems can stand alone so as to satisfy the needs of responsible organisations (peripheral institutions of fire brigade, forest inspection and local authorities). The proposed system can be both used as an intergraded operational tool in forest fire management and as a training tool for personnel of various services involved.

TI  - Decision-Analytic Assessment Of The Economic Value Of Weather Forecasts: The Fallowing/Planting Problem
JO  - Journal of Forecasting
PY  - 1987
AB  - A decision-analytic approach is taken to the problem of assessing the economic value of imperfect weather forecasts. Emphasis is placed on measures of the quality of such information and on the relationship between quality and economic value. The fallowing/planting problem for a spring wheat farmer is examined in detail as a specific application. It is assumed that the farmer's goal is to maximize the total expected discounted return over an infinite horizon, which places this problem within the general framework of Markov decision processes. By means of stochastic dynamic programming, the economic value to the farmer of currently available seasonal precipitation forecasts, as well as of hypothetical improvements in the quality of such forecasts, is estimated. Because the relationship between the quality and value of forecasts is highly nonlinear, the need to explicitly determine value-of-information estimates, rather than relying on quality as a surrogate for value, is made clear.

PY  - 1997
AB  - Weather and climate extremes can significantly impact the economics of a region. This book examines how weather and climate forecasts can be used to mitigate the impact of the weather on the economy. Interdisciplinary in scope, it explores the meteorological, economic, psychological, and statistical aspects to weather prediction. The contributors encompass forecasts over a wide range of temporal scales, from weather over the next few hours to the climate months or seasons ahead, and address the impact of these forecasts on human behaviour. Economic Value of Weather and Climate Forecasts seeks to determine the economic benefits of existing weather forecasting systems and the incremental benefits of improving these systems, and will be an interesting and essential reference for economists, statisticians, and meteorologists.

TI  - Fire And Smoke Observed From The Earth Observing System Modis Instrument-Products, Validation, And Operational Use
JO  - International Journal of Remote Sensing
PY  - 2003
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, launched on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra satellite at the end of 1999, was designed with 36 spectral channels for a wide array of land, ocean, and atmospheric investigations. MODIS has a unique ability to observe fires, smoke, and burn scars globally. Its main fire detection channels saturate at high brightness temperatures: 500 K at 4 µm and 400 K at 11 µm, which can only be attained in rare circumstances at the 1 km fire detection spatial resolution. Thus, unlike other polar orbiting satellite sensors with similar thermal and spatial resolutions, but much lower saturation temperatures (e.g. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Along Track Scanning Radiometer), MODIS can distinguish between low intensity ground surface fires and high intensity crown forest fires. Smoke column concentration over land is for the first time being derived from the MODIS solar channels, extending from 0.41 µm to 2.1 µm. The smoke product has been provisionally validated both globally and regionally over southern Africa and central and south America. Burn scars are observed from MODIS even in the presence of smoke, using the 1.2 to 2.1 µm channels. MODIS burned area information is used to estimate pyrogenic emissions. A wide range of these fire and related products and validation are demonstrated for the wild fires that occurred in northwestern USA in Summer 2000. The MODIS rapid response system and direct broadcast capability is being developed to enable users to obtain and generate data in near real-time. It is expected that health and land management organizations will use these systems for monitoring the occurrence of fires and the dispersion of smoke within two to six hours after data acquisition.

TI  - Agricultural Producers' Willingness To Pay For Real-Time Mesoscale Weather Information
JO  - Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics
PY  - 1995
AB  - Mesoscale weather networks can provide improved weather information to agricultural producers. This technology can potentially improve production decisions, reduce irrigation and pesticide inputs, and reduce weather-related losses. Developing a mesoscale network to disseminate real-time mesoscale weather information requires a substantial investment. In addition, there are costs associated with maintenance of the system and distribution of the information available. While public funds may be available to support initial development of the system, there may be less public support for maintaining the system and subsidizing users' access to the information. This study uses the contingent valuation technique to determine the willingness of Oklahoma farmers and ranchers, as one set of potential users, to pay for real-time mesoscale weather information. The results indicate that agricultural producers are willing to pay only a modest fee for improved weather information. Gross sales, irrigation, and past weather losses are among the factors shown to significantly impact willingness to pay.

TI  - A Political History Of U.s. Commercial Remote Sensing, 1984-2007: Conflict, Collaboration, And The Role Of Knowledge In The High-Tech World Of Earth Observation Satellites
PY  - 2007
AB  - The political history of U.S. commercial remote sensing began in 1984 when the U.S. government first attempted to commercialize its civil earth observation satellite system – Landsat. Since then, the high technology of earth imaging satellite systems has generated intense debates and policy conflicts, primarily centered on U.S. government concerns over the national security and foreign policy implications of high-resolution commercial satellite systems. Conversely, proponents of commercial observation satellites have urged U.S. policymakers to recognize the scientific and socio-economic utility of commercial remote sensing and thus craft and implement regulatory regimes that allow for a greater degree of information openness and transparency in using earth observation satellite imagery. This dissertation traces and analyzes that tumultuous political history and examines the policy issues and social construction of commercial remote sensing to determine the role of knowledge in the effective crafting and execution of commercial remote sensing laws and policies.\nAlthough individual and organizational perspectives, interests, missions, and cultures play a significant role in the social construction of commercial observation satellite systems and programs, the problem of insufficient knowledge of the myriad dimensions and complex nature of commercial remote sensing is a little studied but important component of this social construction process. Knowledge gaps concerning commercial remote sensing extend to various dimensions of the subject matter, such as the global, economic, technical, and legal/policy aspects.\nNumerous examples of knowledge voids are examined to suggest a connection between deficient knowledge and divergent policy perceptions as they relate to commercial remote sensing. Relevant knowledge voids are then structurally categorized to demonstrate the vastness and complexity of commercial remote sensing policy issues and to offer recommendations on how to fill such knowledge gaps to effect increased collaboration between the US government and the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry. Finally, the dissertation offers suggestions for future STS studies on policy issues, particularly those that focus on the global dimensions of commercial remote sensing or on applying the knowledge gap concept advanced by this dissertation to other areas of science and technology policymaking.

TI  - Valuing Weather Observation Systems For Forest Fire Management
JO  - IEEE Systems Journal
PY  - 2008
AB  - Weather information is an integral part of modern fire management systems. In this paper, we investigate, by means of simulation studies, how improvements in the weather observation systems help to reduce burned area by targeting and monitoring places ripe fires are likely to occur. In our model, the air patrolling schedule is determined by the Nesterov index, which is calculated from observed weather data. We use two weather data sets based on ldquoroughrdquo and ldquofinerdquo grids. The reduction of the total burned area, associated with an air patrolling schedule based on the ldquofinerdquo grid, indicates the benefits of using better weather observations. We, also, consider a stochastic model to simulate forest fires and explore the sensitivity of the model with respect to the quality of input data. Finally, we investigate the system of systems effect. We find the largest marginal improvement from the rough grid results when we increase the quality of observations in most critical areas.

AB  - Improved ocean observing systems will produce better data on ocean phenomena and result in new and improved information about short-term and long-term ocean conditions and weather/climate. This information will be of economic value to a range of industries and activities, including maritime transportation, commercial fishing, agriculture, the energy industries, recreation, and coastal zone management. Our quantitative understanding of these benefits is incomplete, but the evidence to date suggests that benefits from well-targeted investments in integrated ocean observing systems will justify the costs. Work is underway to better quantify these benefits. This paper reviews the “value of information” approach to the economics of ocean observing systems and describes how this approach can be applied to estimate benefits and assist in the design of these systems.\n

TI  - The Value Of Ocean Surface Wind Information For Maritime Commerce
JO  - Matine Technology Society Journal
PY  - 2011
AB  - Observations, nowcasts, and forecasts of ocean surface wind conditions are of economic value to activities such as maritime transportation, commercial fishing, offshore energy, recreational boating, and search and rescue. In this paper, we estimate the value to the maritime shipping industry of ocean surface wind information and of wind and wave condition forecasts based on this information. Commercial ships transiting the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans are exposed to severe wind and wave conditions associated with extratropical storms. These storms impose costs on maritime commerce by delaying and sometimes damaging vessels or causing loss of cargo. Ocean surface wind information allows ships to limit their exposure to these conditions. We estimate that average expected annual losses to container shipping (lost containers and associated damage to vessels) in the absence of good information about extratropical storm conditions would be on the order of $250 million/year in the North Pacific and $120 million/year in the North Atlantic, and we estimate average expected annual losses to bulk shipping operations from extratropical storm exposure in these regions to be on the order of $150 million/year. A significant fraction of this risk can be avoided with ocean surface vector wind observations and forecasts. Our model results suggest that the QuikSCAT information (available until November 2009) and associated forecasts enabled a reduction in annual exposure for shipping traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific of about 50%, with total annual net savings around $150 million. The estimate of annual benefits to shipping operations from a hypothetical improved satellite instrument is around $200 million.

TI  - Assessing The Economic Value Of Early Warning Systems
PY  - 2011
AB  - As of today, investments into early warning systems are, to a large extent, politically motivated and “disaster driven”. This means that investments tend to increase significantly if a disaster strikes, but are often quickly reduced in the following disaster-free years. Such investment patterns make the continuous operation, maintenance and development of the early warning infrastructure a challenging task and may lead to sub-optimal investment decisions. The paper presented here proposes an economic assessment model for the tangible economic impact of early warning systems. The model places a focus on the false alert problematic and goes beyond previous approaches by incorporating some socio-cultural factors (qualitatively estimated as of now). By doing so, it supports policymakers (but also private investors) in their investment decisions related to early warning applications.

TI  - The Global Earth Observation System Of Systems (Geoss): Supporting The Needs Of Decision Making In Societal Benefit Areas
JO  - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Science
PY  - 2010
AB  - Earth observations can help reduce the loss of life and property from natural and human induced disasters through increasing our understanding of complex environmental systems. In this context, the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is being built through the coordination of efforts within the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), comprised of 80 Member States, the European Commission and 58 Participating Organizations, established in February 2005. The 10-Year Implementation Plan defines a vision statement for GEOSS, its purpose and scope, expected benefits for nine “Societal Benefit Areas” (SBAs) (disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity), technical and capacity building priorities, and the GEO governance structure. The full value of GEOSS lies in its ability to integrate information across disciplines. Thus, GEOSS is concerned with: interlinking weather forecasting systems with other Earth observation systems; supporting efforts to advance sustainable energy; and devising end-to-end information services and sustained observing systems essential for addressing climate variability and change. The international collaborative framework of GEO allows: water experts to define the data and systems needed for improved water-cycle forecasting; international teams to monitor ecosystems and generate maps and other decision support tools; development of an Agricultural Monitoring System of Systems that will integrate in-situ and space data from multiple fields; and comprehensive monitoring critical to the conservation and sustainable use of the world’s biological diversity. In particular, in the field of water, unique regional cooperative approaches are now on-going and under planning for making maximum use of, and contributing to, GEOSS. The current GEO Work Plan furnishes the blueprint for activities to implement GEOSS, and provides concrete examples of how decision makers can use the data and services available through GEOSS to address major global opportunities and challenges. This is why GEO strives to develop a GEOSS that would serve the needs of all SBAs through interconnecting existing and future Earth observation systems, interlinking observation systems, and promotion of open data sharing.

TI  - A Scalable Earth Observations-Based Decision Support System For Hydropower Planning In Africa
JO  - Journal of the American Water Resources Association
PY  - 2021
AB  - Hydropower is a key part of the increasing shift in power production from nonrenewables to renewable energy. In regions such as Africa, hydropower reservoirs are vital for achieving several sustainable development goals, including clean water, energy, and poverty elimination. However, the operations of hydropower reservoirs are often suboptimal due to the lack of hydrologic data for generating reliable inflow forecasts. Here, we present a decision support system (DSS) framework for hydropower planning at daily to seasonal time scales by combining data from earth observation satellites (EOS) with ensemble climate forecasts from dynamical models and hydrologic modeling. The large uncertainty inherent in satellite-based datasets is overcome by using a data validation framework which does not require ground-based measurements. In addition, an EOS evapotranspiration product is used as a proxy for streamflow in calibrating hydrologic models. Compared to a DSS forced with a climatological forecast (zero-skill), the hydropower production with the new DSS increased by 20%. The study highlights the advantage of using data from EOS in overcoming the issue of data scarcity in water resources applications, particularly in developing regions of the world such as Africa.

AB  - Quantifying the social and economic value that geospatial information contributes to modern society is a complex task. To construct reliable and consistent valuation measures requires an understanding of the sequence of processes that starts with data acquisition, and leads to decision-makers’ choices that impact society. GEOValue explores each step in this complex value chain from the viewpoint of domain experts spanning disciplines that range from the technical side of data acquisition and management to the social sciences that provide the framework to assess the benefit to society. The book is intended to provide foundational understanding of the techniques and complexities of each step in the process. As such it is intended to be assessable to a reader without prior training in data acquisition systems, information systems, or valuation methods. In addition, a number of case studies are provided that demonstrate the use of geospatial information as a critical input for evaluation of policy pertaining to a wide range of application areas, such as agricultural and environmental policy, natural catastrophes, e-government and transportation systems.

AB  - Forest fire is one of the primary and recurring problems in Sikkim, India impacting the ecological heritage of the region. The article presents a fire risk model based on the identification of the major factors that contribute to forest fire, namely, vegetation type, vegetation density, land surface temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, and distance from settlements, rivers and roads, and then integrating them using a multi-criteria decision-making technique in a GIS framework. We document that more than 50% of the area of all the districts except North Sikkim falls into high to moderate risk zones. The model shows that 61% of fire information for resource management system data for the last 16 years coincide with the mapped high-risk zone of the state. Areas with low slope and with moderate vegetation density fall into very high risk, whereas areas with high slope and with high vegetation density correspond to moderate risk zones. Further, aspect and density of human intervention differentiate the very high and high-risk zones of the region. This model has provided a robust geographical representation of fire ignition probability and identification of high-risk areas at different regions for the entire state of Sikkim.

TI  - A Design For A Data And Information Service To Address The Knowledge Needs Of The Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus And Strategies To Facilitate Its Implementation
JO  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Food security is essential to sustain human societies. Food production flourishes when water, energy, and land are abundant, but more often it is limited by scarcities in one or more of these resources. In particular, food production is limited by the relatively fixed amount of water that circulates in the hydrosphere, the lack of new land for crops in many countries, and the depletion of critical minerals and fossil fuels in many source regions. An integrated Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus planning and management approach promises improved resource efficiencies, new business opportunities, more coherent resource and environmental policies, and economies of scale for the data and information services underpinning better decision-making. This paper distills discussions on data and information from four regional workshops held as part of a Future Earth W-E-F Nexus Cluster project. The workshops reviewed ways to enhance the sustainability of the W-E-F Nexus through better governance; collecting, analyzing, and communicating data and information; and integrating both with management for better planning and decision-making. The focus of this paper is to explore the potential application of an integrated data and information system to enhance water, energy, and food sustainability. In particular, this paper's objective is to explore how a multisector W-E-F Nexus data and information system could be developed and operated to meet the planning and decision-making information needs of practitioners and to facilitate the implementation of the W-E-F Nexus concept. This “Hypothesis and Theory” paper provides a hypothesis and system design and proposes steps that could be taken to implement and test the system in a W-E-F Nexus environment. Data and information, along with modern technologies, can play a central role in facilitating paradigm shifts that reinforce the W-E-F Nexus by explicitly assessing environmental services, meeting the growing urban food demand, valuing water and other resources used to produce food and energy for export, promoting resource use efficiency through integrated planning and management, and strengthening links between the W-E-F Nexus and appropriate Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Economic Value Of Current And Improved Weather Forecasts In The U.s. Household Sector
PY  - 2002
AB  - The National Weather Service (NWS) within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the primary federal agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of weather forecast information. With an annual budget of about $1,383 million, the average U.S. household pays about $13 a year for the services of the NWS. There is little if any reliable economic information indicating whether these services are worth this $13 a year to households, although it is widely assumed that the benefits far exceed the costs. Furthermore, there is even less information on the value to households of potential improvements to or changes in current weather forecasting services. As NOAA considers new programs and implements new technologies, it is likely to be asked to justify proposed new expenditures using a benefit-cost framework. This study was commissioned to assist in evaluating and quantifying, to the extent possible, the benefits to households of potential improvements in weather forecasting services, as well as how the public values current forecast services. Table S-1 presents this study’s best estimates of annual per household values for improved and current weather forecasts. Based on Census estimates of about 105 million U.S. households, total national values for improving weather forecasts to the maximum levels proposed in the survey are estimated to be $1.73 billion per year. We also calculate an annual national value of $11.4 billion for current weather forecast services (which includes the value of all weather forecast information services from public and private sectors).

The spatial fire management system (sFMS) is a geographic information system based fire management information system that implements two core subsystems of the CFFDRS, along with other models and systems. The sFMS is the spatial engine that has been used to implement both of Canada's national forest fire management information systems, the Canadian wildland fire information system (CWFIS) and the fire monitoring, mapping and modeling system (Fire M3). The CWFIS is Canada's national fire management information system; it presents daily information on fire weather, fire behavior potential and selected upper atmospheric conditions. Fire M3 integrates the use of satellite technology for monitoring and mapping large fire occurrence in Canada. Fire M3 also incorporates information from CWFIS to model the impacts of large forest fires based on fire weather conditions and potential fire behavior.

TI  - Using Earth Observations To Enhance Water Resources Decision-Making And Disaster Assessment Processes In The United States And The Developing World
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper provides an overview and discussion of water-related Applied Sciences Program (ASP) activities within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Science Division. These activities seek to enhance decisionmaking processes that relate to water resources and disaster assessment in the United States (U.S.) and abroad. We evaluate the various approaches that are employed to improve the utility of and access to Earth observations in decision support for water challenges; in particular, we consider the development of applications and activities that strengthen capacity to use these applications. Applications include products like maps, decision support system improvements and tools, and related services. This paper also identifies potential next steps for continuing to facilitate a coordinated water strategy amongst the Applied Sciences Applications Areas and the ASP Capacity Building Program.

TI  - Essential Earth Observation Variables For High-Level Multi-Scale Indicators And Policies
JO  - Environmental Science & Policy
PY  - 2022
AB  - Several holistic approaches are based on the description of socio-ecological systems to address the sustainability challenge. Essential Variables (EVs) have the potential to support these approaches by describing the status of the Earth system through monitoring and modeling. The different classes of EVs can be organized along the environmental policy framework of Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses. The EV concept represents an opportunity to strengthen monitoring systems by providing observations to seize the fundamental dimensions of the Earth system The Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is a partnership of 113 nations and 134 participating organizations in 2021 that are dedicated to making Earth Observation (EO) data available globally to inform about the state of the environment and enable data-driven decision processes. GEO is building the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, a set of coordinated and independent EO, information and processing systems that interoperate to provide access to EO for users in the public and private sectors. The progresses made in the development of various classes of EVs are described with their main policy targets, Internet links and key references The paper reviews the literature on EVs and describes the main contributions of the EU GEOEssential project to integrate EVs within the work plan of GEO in order to better address selected environmental policies and the SDGs. A new GEO-EVs community has been set to discuss about the current status of the EVs, exchange knowledge, experiences and assess the gaps to be solved in their communities of providers and users. A set of four traits characterizing an EV was put forward to describe the entire socio-ecological system of planet Earth: Essentiality, Evolvability, Unambiguity, and Feasibility. A workflow from the identification of EO data sources to the final visualization of SDG 15.3.1 indicators on land degradation is demonstrated, spanning through the use of different EVs, the definition of the knowledge base on this indicator, the implementation of the workflow in the VLab (a cloud-based processing infrastructure), the presentation of the outputs on a dedicated dashboard and the corresponding narrative through a story map.

TI  - Geoessential- Mainstreaming Workflows From Data Sources To Environmental Policy Indicators With Essential Variables
JO  - International Journal of Digital Earth
PY  - 2020
AB  - When defining indicators on the environment, the use of existing initiatives should be a priority rather than redefining indicators each time. From an Information, Communication and Technology perspective, data interoperability and standardization are critical to improve data access and exchange as promoted by the Group on Earth Observations. GEOEssential is following an end-user driven approach by defining Essential Variables (EVs), as an intermediate value between environmental policy indicators and their appropriate data sources. From international to local scales, environmental policies and indicators are increasingly percolating down from the global to the local agendas. The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows. To interpret and present the relevant outputs/results carried out by the different thematic workflows considered in GEOEssential (i.e. biodiversity, ecosystems, extractives, night light, and food-water-energy nexus), a Dashboard is built as a visual front-end. This is a valuable instrument to track progresses towards environmental policies.

TI  - Reviewing Innovative Earth Observation Solutions For Filling Science-Policy Gaps In Hydrology
JO  - Journal of Hydrology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Improved data sharing is needed for hydrological modeling and water management that require better integration of data, information and models. Technological advances in Earth observation and Web technologies have allowed the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) for improved data sharing at various scales. International initiatives catalyze data sharing by promoting interoperability standards to maximize the use of data and by supporting easy access to and utilization of geospatial data. A series of recent European projects are contributing to the promotion of innovative Earth observation solutions and the uptake of scientific outcomes in policy. Several success stories involving different hydrologists’ communities can be reported around the World. Gaps still exist in hydrological, agricultural, meteorological and climatological data access because of various issues. While many sources of data exists at all scales it remains difficult and time-consuming to assemble hydrological information for most projects. Furthermore, data and sharing formats remain very heterogeneous. Improvements require implementing/endorsing some commonly agreed standards and documenting data with adequate metadata. The brokering approach allows binding heterogeneous resources published by different data providers and adapting them to tools and interfaces commonly used by consumers of these resources. The challenge is to provide decision-makers with reliable information, based on integrated data and tools derived from both Earth observations and scientific models. Successful SDIs rely therefore on various aspects: a shared vision between all participants, necessity to solve a common problem, adequate data policies, incentives, and sufficient resources. New data streams from remote sensing or crowd sourcing are also producing valuable information to improve our understanding of the water cycle, while field sensors are developing rapidly and becoming less costly. More recent data standards are enhancing interoperability between hydrology and other scientific disciplines, while solutions exist to communicate uncertainty of data and models, which is an essential pre-requisite for decision-making. Distributed computing infrastructures can handle complex and large hydrological data and models, while Web Processing Services bring the flexibility to develop and execute simple to complex workflows over the Internet. The need for capacity building at human, infrastructure and institutional levels is also a major driver for reinforcing the commitment to SDI concepts.

PY  - 2015
AB  - The article presents a time series (2009–2013) analysis for a new version of the “Digital Divide” concept that developed in the 1990s. Digital information technologies, such as the Internet, mobile phones and social media, provide vast amounts of data for decision-making and resource management. The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of theSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. Unlike many other indices, the DPI isunderpinned by datasets that are consistently provided annually for almost all the countries of the world and can be downloaded without restriction or cost.

TI  - Economic Value Of Hurricane Forecasts: An Overview And Research Needs
JO  - Natural Hazards Review
PY  - 2007
AB  - Hurricane forecasting is in part an economic problem, because it commits scarce resources to save lives, reduce injuries, and lessen economic impacts. New sensing, recording, and reporting technologies, as well as the increased number of clients and their changing needs, have heightened the need to economically justify the hurricane warning system. Estimating forecast value can help show if improved forecast provision and dissemination would offer more benefit to society than alternative public investments such as infrastructure or forecasts of other hazards. We review research that has estimated the economic value of the hurricane forecast and warning system and the value of improving forecast quality. We recommend developing a comprehensive theoretical understanding of economic value of hurricane forecasts to diverse stakeholders across all time scales. This improved, basic understanding would involve a more in-depth discussion of the value of information as well as a broader knowledge of actual or created distinctions between adaptation, mitigation, and response to hurricane risks.

TI  - Value Of Perfect Enso Phase Predictions For Agriculture: Evaluating The Impact Of Land Tenure And Decision Objectives
JO  - Climatic Change
PY  - 2009
AB  - In many places, predictions of regional climate variability associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon offer the potential to improve farmers’ decision outcomes, by mitigating the negative impacts of adverse conditions or by taking advantage of favorable conditions. While the notion that climate forecasts are potentially valuable has been established, questions of when they may be more or less valuable have proven harder to resolve. Using simulations, we estimate the expected value of seasonal climate information under alternative assumptions about (a) land tenure (ownership vs. short-term leases) and (b) the decision maker’s objective function (expected utility vs. prospect theory value function maximization), employing a full range of plausible parameter values for each objective function. This allows us to show the extent to which the value of information depends on risk preferences, loss aversion, wealth levels and expectations, as well as situational constraints. Our results demonstrate in a non-laboratory decision context that, in some cases, psychologically plausible deviations from expected utility maximization can lead to substantial differences in estimates of the expected value of climate forecasts. Efforts to foster effective use of climate information and forecasts in agriculture must be grounded in a firm understanding of the goals, objectives and constraints of decision makers.

There is no doubt that the risk prevention and disaster management sector needs drastic measures and improvements in order to decrease damage and save lives of inhabitants. Effective utilization of satellite positioning, remote sensing, and GIS in disaster monitoring and management requires research and development in numerous areas: data collection, access and delivery, information extraction and analysis, management and their integration with other data sources (airborne and terrestrial imagery, GIS data, etc.), data standardization, organizational and legal aspects of sharing of remote sensing information. This book provides researchers and practitioners with a good overview of what is being developed in this topical area.

AB  - This study employs both a stochastic programming without recourse model and a regression approach to estimate the value of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) information in the Northern Taiwan regional water market. The empirical estimation results provide several useful implications for water resource management. First, the precipitation of this region is significantly affected by El Niño Southern Oscillation events, which increases the uncertainty of regional water supply. Secondly, the damage caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation events to this regional water market could reach up to NT$ 146 million (i.e., US$ 4.56 million). Finally, the possible water management strategies, which include water transfer activities among different demand groups, with a perfect El Niño Southern Oscillation forecast could substantially mitigate the damage and result in a benefit of NT$ 370 million (i.e., US$ 11.56 million).

TI  - Use Of The Mchargian Lusa In Agricultural Research And Decisionmaking In The Age Of Non-Stationarity And Big Earth Observation Data
JO  - Social Ecological Practice Research
PY  - 2019
AB  - In the past fifty years, there have been two major changes that are of methodological and consequential importance to the McHargian land-use suitability analysis (LUSA): increasing evidence of nonstationarity of global and regional ecological conditions and increasing availability of high resolution spatial-temporal earth observation data. For fifty years, the McHargian LUSA has been an important analysis tool for designers and planners for both regional conservation planning and development. McHarg's LUSA is a decision support tool that reduces the dimensions of spatial-temporal data. This makes the technique relevant beyond decision support to spatial identification and prediction of areas of socio-ecological opportunity, risk, and priority. In this article, I use a set of recent studies relating to agricultural LUSA to reveal relationships between the traditional McHargian LUSA and related spatialtemporal research methods that are adapting to more data and non-stationary ecological conditions. Using a classification based on descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive research activities, I organize these related methods and illustrate how linkages between research activities can be used to assimilate more kinds of spatial “big data,” address non-stationarity in socio-ecological systems, and suggest ways to enhance decision-making and collaboration between planners and other sciences.

TI  - Do Users Benefit From Additional Information In Support Of Operational Drought Management Decisions In The Ebro Basin?
JO  - Hydrology and Earth System Sciences
PY  - 2018
AB  - We follow a user-based approach to examine how information supports operational drought management decisions in the Ebro basin and how these can benefit from additional information such as from remote sensing data. First we consulted decision-makers at basin, irrigation district and farmer scale to investigate the drought-related decisions they make and the information they use to support their decisions. This allowed us to identify the courses of action available to the farmers and water managers, and to analyse their choices as a function of the information they have available to them. Based on the findings of the consultation, a decision model representing the interrelated decisions of the irrigation association and the farmers was built. The purpose of the model is to quantify the effect of additional information on the decisions made. The modelled decisions, which consider the allocation of water, are determined by the expected availability of water during the irrigation season. This is currently informed primarily by observed reservoir level data. The decision model was then extended to include additional information on snow cover from remote sensing. The additional information was found to contribute to better decisions in the simulation and ultimately higher benefits for the farmers. However, the ratio between the cost of planting and the market value of the crop proved to be a critical aspect in determining the best course of action to be taken and the value of the (additional) information. Risk-averse farmers were found to benefit least from the additional information, while less risk-averse farmers stand to benefit most as the additional information helps them take better informed decisions when weighing their options.

TI  - Valuing Geospatial Information: Using The Contingent Valuation Method To Estimate The Economic Benefits Of Landsat Satellite Imagery
JO  - Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing
PY  - 2015
AB  - While the U.S. government does not charge for downloading Landsat images, the images have value to users. This paper demonstrates a method that can value Landsat and other imagery to users. A survey of downloaders of Landsat images found: (a) established US users have a mean value of $912 USD per scene; (b) new US users and users returning when imagery became free have a mean value of $367 USD per scene. Total US user benefits for the 2.38 million scenes downloaded is $1.8 billion USD. While these benefits indicate a high willingness-to-pay among many Landsat downloaders, it would be economically inefficient for the US government to charge for Landsat imagery. Charging a price of $100 USD a scene would result in an efficiency loss of $37.5 million a year. This economic information should be useful to policymakers who must decide about the future of this and similar remote sensing programs.

TI  - Ascribing Societal Benefit To Applied Remote Sensing Data Products: An Examination Of Methodologies Based On The Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer Experience
JO  - Journal of Applied Remote Sensing
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper describes and illustrates frameworks for societal benefits associated with data products from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), one of five instruments launched into polar orbit aboard NASA's Terra spacecraft in December 1999. The objective of framing and illustrating benefits is impelled by the January, 2007, U.S. National Research Council’s seminal decadal survey of U.S. Earth science. The survey urges that all missions explicitly identify potential societal benefits in mission planning and operation. In this paper, our retrospective look at MISR offers approaches which mission planning for future instruments could operationalize. "Societal benefit" generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit. The paper demonstrates how societal benefit frameworks work, highlights some of these benefits in the case of MISR, and seeks to provide useful guidance for benefit descriptions in future multi-angle and other Earth observation research programs.

TI  - Ascribing Societal Benefit To Environmental Observations Of Earth From Space
PY  - 2006
AB  - At the request of managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this paper describes frameworks for and illustrates societal benefits associated with Earth observations from an experimental satellite known as the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). MISR is a unique camera that images Earth's atmosphere and other characteristics simultaneously from nine angles. This multiangle perspective enhances our ability to measure and monitor dimensions of climate, weather, air quality, natural hazards, and the biosphere. "Societal benefit" in this paper generally refers to practical applications of data and data products beyond their intrinsic science merit. The paper has two objectives: to demonstrate how several societal benefit frameworks work, and to highlight some of these benefits in the case of MISR. Such consideration of practical benefits is timely, as their realization is becoming a prominent objective of future space remote sensing activities. At least four groups of experts recommend that societal benefit serve as a heavily weighted criterion for prioritizing Earth science research opportunities. The National Academy of Sciences' forthcoming decadal survey for U.S. Earth science applications from space, the U.S. Climate Change Research Program, the framework for the international Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS), and the new world water program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) all argue that societal benefit should be a determining factor in selecting the next Earth-observing spacecraft missions and instruments. If these recommendations are implemented, the frameworks and illustrations below may prove useful in guiding benefit descriptions in future space-derived Earth observation programs.

TI  - Earth Observations In Social Science Research For Management Of Natural Resources And The Environment: Identifying The Landsat Contribution
JO  - The Journal of Terrestrial Observation
PY  - 2009
AB  - This paper surveys the peer-reviewed social science literature in which Landsat data are used to inform public policy in managing natural resources and the environment. The paper differentiates articles in which methodology is developed (for example, developing and testing algorithms or demonstrating how data could be used) and articles in which data are applied for decisionmaking or policy implementation. The studies surveyed in this paper are selected from a wide range of publications within the social sciences. Selection uses social science-oriented bibliographic search indices. Searching the social science literature leads to identification of applications of Landsat by a community of experts unlikely to be identified by surveys or overviews of the Landsat program. Surveys and overview studies have tended to target researchers specializing in remote sensing or photogrammetry rather than researchers drawn from the social sciences. The usefulness of Landsat data as a basis for public investment in the Landsat proogram is underestimated in the absence of recognizing this body of research.

TI  - From Science To Applications: Determinants Of Diffusion In The Use Of Earth Observations
PY  - 2010
AB  - We demonstrate the diffusion in use of Earth observations data in social science research. Our study is motivated by the continuing debate among policymakers over the value of the nation’s investment in Earth observations. We also consider the role of related factors including the spread of geographical information systems (GIS; a complementary tool for using Earth observations data) and the role of data prices. We first estimate a diffusion curve and then draw from standard bibliometric methods to evaluate further the extent to which the research field is growing. We realize that these aspects of the value of Earth observations are often part of policy debate, but we offer insights into how to substantiate \nand document these claims. We find evidence of increasingly widespread use of Earth observations in an ever-widening number of applications and geographic regions. GIS and data prices influence this diffusion. However, we see less evidence of a community of practice within the large social science literature represented in our data. These findings have implications for steps to take to increase the benefits of Earth observations.

The second set of issues concerns the institutional organization of projects, namely whether a project's technology should be an almost exclusively governmentally funded, owned and operated activity as is now the case, or whether there could be a larger role than now envisaged for the commercial space sector.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Governments around the world, as well as private industry, invest heavily in remote sensing spacecraft to obtain data about natural and environmental resources, climate change, and the relationship of earth science to human health and quality of life. Numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments. The studies use a wide variety of methods and generally find a large range of benefits, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies. This article offers a general framework for measuring the value of information. The framework serves two purposes. One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data. Decision makers comprise three communities: consumers and producers of information, public officials whose job is to invest in data acquisition and information development (including sensors and other hardware, algorithm design and software tools, and a trained labor force), and the public at large.

In fact, it was constructed with GEOSS in mind to ensure that NASA’s observation systems can be readily mapped into the GEOSS structure. The architecture contains about 3000 elements that are involved in earth science research: observation sources, sensors, environmental parameters, data products, mission products, observations, science models, predictions, and decision-support tools. The science models use observations from the space-based instruments to generate predictions about various aspects of the environment. These predictions are used by decision-makers around the world to help minimize property damage and loss of human life due to adverse conditions such as severe weather storms. The architecture is developed using both traditional and nontraditional systems engineering (SE) tools and techniques. This paper will describe additional methods needed for the SE toolbox.

TI  - Satellite Earth Observations And Their Impact On Society And Policy
PY  - 2017
AB  - The result of a workshop bringing together an international advisory board of experts in science, satellite technologies, industry innovations, and public policy, this book addresses the current and future roles of satellite Earth observations in solving large-scale environmental problems. The book showcases the results of engaging distinct communities to enhance our ability to identify emerging problems and to administer international regimes created to solve them. It also reviews the work of the Policy and Earth Observation Innovation Cycle (PEOIC) project, an effort aimed at assessing the impact of satellite observations on environmental policy and to propose a mission going forward that would launch an “innovation cycle”. The achievements of such a mission would feed back to innovations in next-generation observation technology, thus contributing to global policy demand for policy-relevant information.\n

TI  - Linking Poverty-Based Inequalities With Transportation And Accessibility Using Mobility Data: A Case Study Of Greater Maputo
JO  - Transportation Research Record
PY  - 2022
AB  - Accessibility is widely considered as the most crucial benefit of any transportation system. Low accessibility may cause compromise on living conditions, low economic growth, high unemployment, social seclusion, and long-term social inequalities. In developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, surveys fail to keep up with the pace of rapid urbanization. Additionally, numerous location-based data sets, including mobile phone location data and Google Maps travel time, enable near-real-time observations of actively changing mobility dynamics. In this study, we use these novel data sets to assess various facets of accessibility and corresponding poverty-based inequalities within the Greater Maputo region in Mozambique. A data-based approach is seldom used in the Sub-Saharan African context. Consistent poverty-based inequalities in access to opportunities by driving, transit, and walking are observed. The transit system was ascertained to be more inefficient in the poorer regions. The richer regions witnessed most decreased access to opportunities because of high congestion. People living in the poorest regions were observed to travel much longer distances to access facilities than did those living in the richest regions. These differences were particularly significant for essential services of education, healthcare, and employment. These results can help urban planners and policymakers identify disadvantaged communities and develop policies to ameliorate the conditions. This assists in measuring the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and investigating areas of concern. Moreover, this study shows the applicability of various data sets and methods in a data-deprived scenario in Africa, and motivates more scholars and practitioners to partake in this technology leapfrogging.

TI  - Knowledge Formalization For Earth Science Informed Decision-Making: The Geoessential Knowledge Base
JO  - IEEE Systems Journal
PY  - 2022
AB  - During the past two centuries, the world has undergone deep societal, political, and economical changes that\nheavily affected human life. The above changes contributed to an increased awareness about the deep impact\nthat policy decisions have at the local and the global level. Therefore, there is a strong need that policy-making\nand decision-making processes for a sustainable development be based on the best available knowledge about\nEarth system and environment.\nThe recent advance of information technologies enables running complex models that use the large amount of\nEarth Observation datasets available. However, data and model interoperability are still limited to the syntactic\nlevel allowing to access and process datasets independently of their structural characteristics (data format, co-\nordinate reference systems, service interface, ...) but with no clear reference to their content (the semantic level)\nand context of use (the pragmatic level). This poses heavy limitations to the reusability of scientific processes and\nrelated workflows.\nThe paper presents a general framework to address this issue through the design of a Knowledge Base sup-\nporting data and model semantic (and pragmatic) interoperability. In this framework, a general ontology rep-\nresents the knowledge generation process for policy relevant decision-making, while multiple vocabularies\nformalize the semantics of data and models, identifying different types of observables, process variables, and\nindicators/indices. To evaluate the proposed approach to semantic interoperability of data and models, the\nKnowledge Base has been integrated with an advanced model-sharing framework, and a proof-of-concept has\nbeen developed for the assessment of one of the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals defined by the\nUnited Nations.

TI  - Banda Aceh-The Value Of Earth Observation Data In Disaster Recovery And Reconstruction: A Case Study
PY  - 2008
AB  - On 26 December 2004, Banda Aceh in Indonesia was at the center of one of the worst natural disasters to affect mankind. Large amounts of international aid poured in to assist in the relief and reconstruction efforts. Amongst this effort, were investments in basic earth observation data from in-situ, airborne and space observations. While the use of this data is assumed to be crucial, few efforts have gone into quantifying the benefits of its acquisition. The objectives of this study were to interview a cross-section of agencies operating in Banda Aceh and across the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam on the use, sources and quality of earth observation data in the relief/reconstruction effort; and to analyze and quantify the value that earth observation data brings to the relief/reconstruction effort based on the survey results and specific examples. Key findings from the interviews point to an overall improvement in the spatial data situation since the tsunami. Problems identified included insufficient training, lack of timely data and sometimes poor spatial resolution. Specific examples of the costbenefits of earth observation data were typically on the order of millions of dollars and involved large time savings.

PY  - 2019
AB  - The current influx of climate related information required scientists to communicate their findings to decision makers in governments, disaster preparedness organizations, and the general public. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a powerful modelling tool that allows scientists to simulate many of the physical processes involved in the water cycle. This article presents the design, methods and development efforts to overcome some of the limitations of the previously developed SWAT visualization software programs by creating a set of modular web applications that can be duplicated, customized, and run. Moreover, this article features a web application development tool for climate data retrieval. The NASAaccess fetches, extracts and reformats climate data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration servers and outputs data compatible with hydrological models. This work has the potential to increase the SWAT's model impact on non-technically trained stakeholders and decision makers charged with water and climate management.

TI  - Economic Value Of Seasonal Climate Forecasts For Agriculture: Review Of Ex-Ante Assessments And Recommendations For Future Research
JO  - Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology
PY  - 2008
AB  - Advanced information in the form of seasonal climate forecasts has the potential to improve farmers’ decision making, leading to increases in farm profits. Interdisciplinary initiatives seeking to understand and exploit the potential benefits of seasonal forecasts for agriculture have produced a number of quantitative ex-ante assessments of the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts. The realism, robustness, and credibility of such assessments become increasingly important as efforts shift from basic research toward applied research and implementation. This paper surveys published evidence about the economic value of seasonal climate forecasts for agriculture, characterizing the agricultural systems, approaches followed, and scales of analysis. The climate forecast valuation literature has contributed insights into the influence of forecast characteristics, risk attitudes, insurance, policy, and the scale of adoption on the value of forecasts. Key innovations in the more recent literature include explicit treatment of the uncertainty of forecast value estimates, incorporation of elicited management responses into bioeconomic modeling, and treatment of environmental impacts, in addition to financial outcomes of forecast response. It is argued that the picture of the value of seasonal forecasts for agriculture is still incomplete and often biased, in part because of significant gaps in published valuation research. Key gaps include sampling of a narrow range of farming systems and locations, incorporation of an overly restricted set of potential management responses, failure to consider forecast responses that could lead to “regime shifts,” and failure to incorporate state-of-the-art developments in seasonal forecasting. This paper concludes with six recommendations to enhance the realism, robustness, and credibility of ex-ante valuation of seasonal climate forecasts.

JO  - Weather, Climate and Society
PY  - 2018
AB  - Knowing the benefits of creating or expanding programs is important for determining optimal levels of investment. Yet estimates of the benefits of weather warning systems are sparse, perhaps because there is often no clear counterfactual of how individuals would have fared without a particular warning system. This paper enriches the literature and informs policy decisions by using conditional variation in the initial broadcast dates of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) transmitters to produce both cross-sectional and fixed effects estimates of the causal impact of expanding the NWR transmitter network. Results suggest that from 1970 to 2014, expanding NWR coverage to a previously untreated county was associated with an almost 40% reduction in injuries and as much as a 50% reduction in fatalities. The benefits associated with further expansion of this system have likely declined over time.

TI  - Users, Uses, And Value Of Landsat Satellite Imagery - Results From The 2012 Survey Of Users
PY  - 2013
AB  - Landsat satellites have been operating since 1972, providing a continuous global record of the Earth’s land surface. The imagery is currently available at no cost through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). We conducted a survey in early 2012 to explore who uses Landsat imagery, how they use the imagery, and what the value of the imagery is to them. The survey was sent to all users registered with USGS (users who have created a login and password to access imagery through USGS directly) who had accessed Landsat imagery in the year prior to the survey (n = 44,731). All contact with users was via email and the survey was administered online. The response rate was 30% with 13,473 users responding. Of those users, 11,275 were current Landsat users who had used the imagery in their work in the year prior to the survey. The results reported below apply to current Landsat users registered with USGS.

TI  - Getting The Most Out Of Ensemble Forecasts: A Valuation Model Based On User–Forecast Interactions
JO  - Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology
PY  - 2008
AB  - A flexible theoretical model of perceived forecast value is proposed that explicitly includes the effects of user and ensemble characteristics and their interactions. The model can be applied to arbitrary decision problems and is sensitive to a much wider range of factors than traditional forecast valuation models. A simple illustration of its application to the cost–loss decision problem familiar from the forecast valuation literature is discussed. It is shown that perceived value is highly sensitive to perceived model accuracy and that in most cases a high level of perceived accuracy is required for the forecasts to be thought to have any value at all. Decisions with a cost–benefit ratio that is close to the climatological probability of the adverse event are shown to be less sensitive to perceived accuracy. The model shows that it is possible for perceived value to remain unchanged when perceived accuracy increases, thus suggesting an explanation for why forecast uptake often does not increase after improvements in model performance are made. Last, it is argued that attempts to increase forecast uptake should be targeted at those users whose cost–benefit ratios fall in a restricted range that depends on the climatological probability of the event and an objective measure of the ensemble accuracy.

JO  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics

AB  - The impact of government institutions on the value of improved climate forecasts is examined. Results suggest that crop insurance and earned income tax credit have little effect on the expected change in after-tax cash flows. Federal tax law has only a modest influence. As expected, the disaster program decreases the value of improved climate forecasts. With no price changes, the farm program lowers the value of the forecasts because of the acreage reduction provisions. With at least some price decreases, the farm program increases the value of climate forecasts. Here, the price supports override the acreage reduction provisions.

PY  - 1989
AB  - This paper examines the complex nature of the process of economically valuing climate/weather forecasts. A discussion of both micro- (producer) and sector (market) economic issues is obtained through a review of previous studies. Integration of these issues is necessary to obtain the overall value of current or improved climate/weather forecasts. Previous studies have predominantly been concerned with valuing climate/weather forecasts at the producer level. By considering only producer level effects, the estimates of the value of climate/weather forecasts ignore market adjustments. Potential biases caused by ignoring these adjustments are illustrated.

JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2018
AB  - Multiple satellite-based earth observations and traditional station data along with the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model were employed to enhance the Lower Mekong River Basin region's hydrological decision support system. A nearest neighbor approximation methodology was introduced to fill the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrieval for the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (IMERG) grid points from 2001 to 2014, together with the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) data points for continuous precipitation forcing for our hydrological decision support system. A software tool to access and format satellite-based earth observation systems of precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures was developed and is presented. Our results suggest that the model-simulated streamflow utilizing TRMM and IMERG forcing data was able to capture the variability of the observed streamflow patterns in the Lower Mekong better than model-simulated streamflow with in-situ precipitation station data. We also present satellite-based and in-situ precipitation adjustment maps that can serve to correct precipitation data for the Lower Mekong region for use in other applications. The inconsistency, scarcity, poor spatial representation, difficult access and incompleteness of the available in-situ precipitation data for the Mekong region make it imperative to adopt satellite-based earth observations to pursue hydrologic modeling.

TI  - Landsat Data Ecosystem Case Study: Actor Perceptions Of The Use And Value Of Landsat
JO  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
PY  - 2022
AB  - It is well-known that Earth observation (EO) data plays a critical role in scientific understanding about the global environment. There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts. Both the role of Big Data and associated technologies are discussed as they relate to the ultimate use of Landsat-derived information products to guide decision-making, and key data ecosystem characteristics that shape the likelihood of these products’ use are highlighted.

TI  - Integrating Earth Observation Data Into Geospatial Databases That Support Public Health Decisions
JO  - International Archive of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences
PY  - 2006
AB  - There are several reasons why public health communities do not use information from Earth observations routinely. Most notable among them are: (1) they need science results that verify, validate, and benchmark the statistical and economic benefits from these exotic inputs; and, (2) they lack the systems that would deliver such reliable information economically and swiftly in their already heavy workloads. The Public Health Applications in Remote Sensing (PHAiRS) project is engineering elements of an enhanced disease surveillance system for dust-related respiratory diseases in the desert southwest of the United States. Several Earth observations (EO) data sets are replacing parameters traditionally used in dust forecasting models to improve simulations of particulate matter entrainment, timing of entrainment, concentrations, and subsequent movement. Output from the enhanced dust forecasting model is nested within a regional version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (Eta version) model (NCEP/Eta). Simulations using the enhanced dust model have been compared to actual dust episodes recorded by NCEP/Eta’s atmospheric patterns and by dust data from a ground-based Continuous Air Monitoring System (CAMS). The simulations were rerun after replacing the land cover layer with land cover classes derived from MODIS (MOD-12). For the CAMS test cases, this resulted in a significant improvement in dust episode patterns. Additional EO data assimilations investigate whether further improvements can be gained by replacing the topographic layer with higher resolution digital elevation data from SRTM, dustgenerating areas derived from MOD-15’s Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, soil moisture data from AMSR-E, and aerodynamic surface roughness. Ongoing simulations aim eventually to measure hourly, daily, and weekly model improvements from EO data replacements that are refreshed on a weekly, seasonal, or inter-annual basis. The overall aims are to: (a) combine the measured improvements from several EO data series that optimize dust forecast scenarios for public health authorities; (b) benchmark each step in the process to document the benefits of EO data inputs into respiratory health care; and (c), develop retrospective and forecast statistics from model runs that boost system reliability and user confidence.

This article aims to reinvigorate interest in societal and economic research and applications (SERA) activities within the meteorological and social science communities by exploring key SERA issues and proposing SERA priorities for the next decade.\n\nThe priorities were developed by the authors, building on previous work, with input from a diverse group of social scientists and meteorologists who participated in a SERA workshop in August 2006. The workshop was organized to provide input to the North American regional component of THORPEX: A Global Atmospheric Research Programme, but the priorities identified are broadly applicable to all weather forecast research and applications.\n\nTo motivate and frame SERA activities, we first discuss the concept of high-impact weather forecasts and the chain from forecast creation to value realization. Next, we present five interconnected SERA priority themes—use of forecast information in decision making, communication of forecast uncertainty, user-relevant verification, economic value of forecasts, and decision support— and propose research integrated across the themes.\n\nSERA activities can significantly improve understanding of weather-society interactions to the benefit of the meteorological community and society. However, reaching this potential will require dedicated effort to bring together and maintain a sustainable interdisciplinary community.

AB  - Shifting cultivation is a dominant land-use system in Laos, and fire is the tool commonly used to clear fallow vegetation for subsequent cultivation. We assessed the feasibility of active fire data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for monitoring fires in Laos. Specifically, we investigated the potential of the active fire data as input into monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems to assess the effectiveness of measures related to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus the enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+). Our qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessments of the fire data yielded mixed results with varying degrees of undetected fires and false detections. Hence, at IPCC Tier 3, the uncertainties inherent in the detection accuracy become too large. Active fire data can be valuable for supporting national-level MRV at Tier 2 in combination with auxiliary data for characterizing fire-dependent local land-use systems, such as shifting cultivation.

Though these problems are being tackled by Government at different levels, pressing issues of food production and sustainability, make government to concentrate on projects that are agriculturally based. As a result, the private sector has become active in providing Satellite Earth Observation services for many ecological problems.\nA number of private companies have made their mark in the Nigerian S.E.O market. In the past, most private earth observation service companies were subsidiaries of foreign companies offering services in the construction and crude oil sectors. As the importance of remote sensing and GIS technologies became better known, the number of companies and organizations offering GIS services increased with the indigenous people also setting up smaller outfits.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive site-scale analysis conducted within the global wetland inventory and mapping (GWIM) project. GWIM was developed and promoted by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) through global partnerships to investigate wetland analyses at multiple scales. The present study investigates the complexity of an inland freshwater wetland system, presenting a conceptual framework for mapping and monitoring the dynamics of Lake Kolleru (a wetland of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention), utilizing a geospatial platform. Illustrating the pace of land use changes leading to the progressive elimination of the wetland ecosystem of freshwater Lake Kolleru, this study also highlights the impacts of such changes on the socio-economic system. A comprehensive temporal analysis (1977–2007) provided a structural base to schematically analyse the dynamics of biophysical and ecological changes to the wetland by effectively using a spectrum of remote sensing data. The present status and changing trends in ecological dimensions of Lake Kolleru were illustrated, utilizing information from spatial analyses, complimented with socio-economic assessment. Attention is drawn to the potential of utilizing earth resources systems in exploring space–time interactions in freshwater ecosystems heavily modified through aquaculture interventions. Further, the spatial derivatives are meant as reference material for local authorities and decision-makers to rehabilitate the economic livelihood activities to the social community dependent on the lake ecosystem. The disseminated message emphasizes the applicability of geospatial tools to enhance the efficacy of the decision-making process by facilitating regular monitoring of ecosystem dynamics and providing updated information on wetland patterns and uses.

AB  - This report provides an analysis of Federal funding for the operational civil environmental satellite program during the fiscal years 1971 through 1985. Both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budgets are examined. Four reasons for recent NOAA satellite funding increases are discussed: (1) responsibilities shifted from NASA to NOAA; (2) NASA decisions that required NOAA system changes; (3) an expanded NOAA satellite mission; and (4) exceptional inflation in the aerospace industry. The analysis reveals a decrease in the real cost of the service component of the satellite program over the years. It also concludes that there has been no growth in the cost of those program components traditionally funded by NOAA, and that only a few percent increase in cost has been experienced in the sum of program funding provided by both NOAA and NASA over the 15-year period.

TI  - Identifying Methods For Quantifying The Societal Impacts Of The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration
PY  - 2011
AB  - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generates tremendous value for the nation. The Agency provides critical environmental data, forecasts, cutting edge knowledge, management and stewardship that the United States needs to plan for and react to in a constantly changing global environment. The Agency, however, needs to do more to understand and measure exactly how its activities, products and services affect the well-being of the nation. Existing and emerging social science methods can be harnessed to help the Agency assess the degree to which we are meeting our mission goals and to improve the value we provide to society. The first NOAA Science Challenge workshop brought together policy makers at NOAA with social science leaders from inside and outside of the Agency to explore methods for better quantifying the ways in which NOAA affects society. As an initial step in better understanding the broader societal impacts of NOAA, we focused on the NOAA line offices and programs that deal most directly with the public: the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Ocean Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (including the National Sea Grant College Program), and the programs that support climate activities at NOAA (the Climate Program Office and the National Climate Data Center). While it is easy to see why society needs NOAA, the workshop revealed just how difficult it can be to rigorously quantify the societal impact of NOAA’s activities, products, and services. As a first step, the line offices identified specific NOAA products, services, and activities (outputs) for which they would like to quantify societal impacts. These examples were meant to highlight a diversity of products and services. We focused initially on relatively straightforward examples that could serve as both a departure for discussion and illustrations of how programs within the Agency might begin thinking about quantifying the societal impact of their work. For each output, the line offices developed a narrative (story) that linked the output with a sector of society and ultimately a state of societal well-being. Workshop participants further developed these stories and explored methods and approaches to better quantify how these NOAA outputs affect societal well-being. The workshop identified many methods that can be applied to better understand the way the Agency affects society. One class of methods is data denial, in which intermediate and final users of NOAA data products are asked to operate in the absence of NOAA data. Other methods involve retrospective analyses of the ways in which the public and private sector have used NOAA outputs. Still other approaches require that users imagine how their decisions would differ in the absence of NOAA activities, products and services.Table 1 provides a sampling of value chains, metrics, and methods developed at the workshop. The participants identified a variety of metrics to measure societal well-being and change including revenues, economic value, lives saved, sense of place, preferences and attitudes, property damages, and crop yields. While one day is insufficient to fully develop these methods and approaches, the workshop was an important opportunity for policy makers at NOAA and social scientists to work together to understand how the Agency can harness social science methods to do a better job of meeting its mission goals. Certain line offices are still more adept at measuring the baseline of societal well-being than in trying to tease out the contribution of any single program or activity. This corresponds, in large part, to the enterprise nature of many activities at the Agency – many programs inside and outside of the Agency combine to achieve our mission goals. As the Agency moves forward in its efforts to understand how NOAA affects society, the methods and metrics used to do so will be refined and improved. Possible next steps in the process include:\n○ More enterprise level approaches to developing value chains and valuations.\n○ Follow-up workshops or symposia on methods for quantifying the societal impacts of specific types of NOAA outputs including: research, information, and weather.

TI  - Indian Earth Observation Programme Towards Societal Benefits: Geoss Perspective
JO  - Proceedings of SPIE
PY  - 2006
AB  - Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme, since its inception has been applications driven and national development has been its main motivation. In order to meet the observational requirements of many societal benefit areas, a series of EO systems have been launched in both polar and geo synchronous orbits. Starting from Bhaskara, the first experimental EO satellite in 1979 to Cartosat-1 successfully launched in May 2005, a large number of sensors operating in optical and microwave spectral regions, providing data at resolutions ranging from 1 km to a meter have been built and flown. Data reception and processing facilities have been established not only in the country but also at various international ground stations. Remotely sensed data and its derived information have become an integral component of the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS), a unique concept evolved and established in the country. The paper discusses the evolution of IRS satellite systems, application programmes in different societal benefit areas and the road ahead. How it complements and supplements the international efforts in the context of Global Earth Observation System of Systems has also been indicated.

TI  - Enabling Stakeholder Decision-Making With Earth Observation And Modeling Data Using Tethys Platform
JO  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Tethys Platform is an open source framework for developing web-based applications for Earth Observation data. Our experience shows that Tethys significantly lowers the barrier for cloud-based app development, simplifies the process of accessing scalable distributed cloud computing resources and leverages additional software for data and computationally intensive modeling. The Tethys software development kit allows users to create web apps for visualizing, analyzing, and modeling Earth Observation data. Tethys platform provides a collaborative environment for scientists to develop and deploy several Earth Observation web applications across multiple Tethys portals. We work in partnership with leading regional organizations world-wide to help developing countries use information provided by earth-observing satellites and geospatial technologies for managing climate risks and land use. This paper highlights the several Tethys portals and web applications that were developed as part of this effort. Implementation of the Tethys framework has significantly improved the Application Readiness Level metric for several NASA projects and the potential impact of Tethys to replicate and scale other applied science programs.

TI  - Visual Evidence From Above: Assessing The Value Of Earth Observation Satellites For Supporting Human Rights
JO  - The Fibreculture Journal
PY  - 2016
AB  - Public access to data collected by remote sensing Earth Observation Satellites has, until recently, been very limited. Now, citizens and rights advocacy groups are increasingly utilising satellite-collected images to interrogate justice issues; to document, prevent and verify rights abuses; and to imagine and propose social change. Yet while other communication technologies have received substantial critical analysis regarding their value as tools of social justice, activism and resistance, satellites have received comparatively scant attention. This article examines the uses of satellite-collected images in human rights contexts including the opportunities, challenges and risks they pose. We conclude this examination by arguing that if satellites are to be used effectively to collect evidence from above by rights advocates, greater attention to and capacity for ensuring accountability from below is required.

TI  - The Value Of Near Real-Time Earth Observations For Improved Flood Disaster Response
JO  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions “on the ground” more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) fromapplying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.

TI  - Enhancing The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index By Integrating Spatiotemporal Information From Satellite And In Situ Data
JO  - Journal of Hydrology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard with its adverse multifaceted impacts cascading in every physical and human system. The vulnerability magnitude of various areas to drought mostly depends on their exposure to water deficiency, the existing water management policy framework and its implementation. The Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) is an integrated attempt towards characterizing drought vulnerability based on a comparative classification system, incorporating precipitation patterns, the supply and demand trends, and the socioeconomic background as the most crucial contributors to drought vulnerability. This work attempts to evolve the SDVI by presenting a more rigorous method of index parameters estimation and argues that the combination of in-situ and satellite data improve the index results in an effort to further minimize the paucity of drought related information. At the same time, it helps to surpass previous limitations in temporal and spatial propagation of the vulnerability concept. The new framework is applied in the South Platte Basin, within Colorado, on the 2012 summer drought (July-September). The proposed index modification may convey drought information in a more holistic manner to decision makers. SDVI could aid in advancing the understanding of each component contribution through in situ and remote sensing data integration and in avoiding existing practices of broken linkages and fragmentation of the reported impacts. Thus, it is believed that the SDVI could serve as an additional tool to guide decisions and target mitigation and adaptation actions, allowing for a more integrated management approach.

TI  - Inclusive Design Of Earth Observation Decision Support Systems For Environmental Governance: A Case Study Of Lake Nokoué
JO  - Frontiers in Climate
PY  - 2021
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data can enhance understanding of human-environmental systems for the creation of climate data services, or Decision Support Systems (DSS), to improve monitoring, prediction and mitigation of climate harm. However, EO data is not always incorporated into the workflow for decision-makers for a multitude of reasons including awareness, accessibility and collaboration models. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a collaborative model that addresses historical power imbalances between communities. This paper highlights a case study of a climate harm mitigation DSS collaboration between the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab and Green Keeper Africa (GKA), an enterprise located in Benin. GKA addresses the management of an invasive plant species that threatens ecosystem health and economic activities on Lake Nokoué. They do this through a social entrepreneurship business model that aims to advance both economic empowerment and environmental health. In demonstrating a Space Enabled-GKA collaboration model that advances GKA’s business aims, this study first considers several popular service and technology design methods and offer critiques of each method in terms of their ability to address inclusivity in complex systems. These critiques lead to the selection of the Systems Architecture Framework (SAF) as the technology design method for the case study. In the remainder of the paper, the SAF is applied to the case study to demonstrate how the framework coproduces knowledge that would information DSS with Earth Observation data. The paper offers several practical considerations and values related to epistemology, data collection, prioritization and methodology for performing inclusive design of climate data services.

TI  - The Public Value Of Improving A Weather Forecasting System In Korea: A Choice Experiment Study
JO  - Applied Economics
PY  - 2018
AB  - The Korean government plans to improve the quality of its weather forecasting system in order to increase its public utility. The benefits arising from the implementation of this plan should be measured. To this end, this study applies a choice experiment to four attributes: the update frequency of both short- and medium-range forecasts, and the accuracy of both. A survey of 1000 randomly selected households was undertaken in Korea. In the study results, the marginal willingness-to-pays, respectively, for one more update of the short-range forecast per day, for a 1% increase in the accuracy of the short-range forecast, for changing the update frequency of the medium-range forecast from once a day (reference level) to twice a day, and for a 1% increase in the accuracy of the medium-range forecast as a result of improving the weather forecast service were estimated to be KRW 499.3 (USD 0.45), 108.3 (0.10), 346.5 (0.31), and 80.9 (0.07) per household per month. The findings can provide policy-makers with useful information for both evaluating and planning improvements in the weather forecasting system.

AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data can be leveraged to estimate environmental variables that influence the transmission cycle of the pathogens that lead to mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs). The aim of this scoping review is to examine the state-of-the-art and identify knowledge gaps on the latest methods that used satellite EO data in their epidemiological models focusing on malaria, dengue and West Nile Virus (WNV). In total, 43 scientific papers met the inclusion criteria and were considered in this review. Researchers have examined a wide variety of methodologies ranging from statistical to machine learning algorithms. A number of studies used models and EO data that seemed promising and claimed to be easily replicated in different geographic contexts, enabling the realization of systems on regional and national scales. The need has emerged to leverage furthermore new powerful modeling approaches, like artificial intelligence and ensemble modeling and explore new and enhanced EO sensors towards the analysis of big satellite data, in order to develop accurate epidemiological models and contribute to the reduction of the burden of MBDs.

TI  - Economic Benefits Expected From Earth Observation Applications. The Case Of The Eu Fp7 Itaca Project
JO  - Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper offers a contribution of how Earth Observation Applications can give economic benefits to the community of End Users. A short overview of EO benefits is given with specific reference to cultural heritage applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the case of a EU FP7 Project ITACA (Innovation Technologies and Applications for Coastal Archaeological sites), which started in January 2014 and it is currently underway. The paper briefly describes the ITACA project and its aims. During the project an economic impact assessment is carried out, initially from a qualitative point of view, through the submission of a questionnaire to the partners involved in the project. The same questionnaire was given also to identified End-Users in order to investigate the precise stakeholders' nature and behaviour and the likely economic modifications they will undergo once the project takes shape and new technical propositions are made potentially available also by way of different service models. Factors affecting positively and negatively the various stakeholder’s communities will be listed and discussed in full. Next stage is involving the quantification of potential benefits ITACA project may produce. Therefore, an evaluation of effects on economic activities of the areas and on communities the archaeological sites is being made. Once qualitative and quantitative assessments are completed, a business plan outlining also the appropriate road/roads to market is going to be prepared and suggestions will be made about which organizational/governance model best fit the expected results. This paper also deals with considerations about strength, weakness, opportunities and threats before during and after project’s deployment. The paper presents all preliminary results to be discussed with the scientific community. EU FP7 ITACA project is coordinated by Planetek Hellas E.P.E. (GR) and includes the following institutes and companies: Kell Srl (IT), NAIS Srl (IT), DHI GRAS (DK), I.EN.A.E (GR), FFCUL (PT), ANESTI Ltd (UK), Regione Sicilia (IT), ALMA Sistemi Sas (IT), CODEVINTEC Srl (IT), SME4SPACE VZW (BE).

TI  - Creation And Operation Of A Global Earth Observation System Of Systems
PY  - 2008
AB  - Integrated global measurements and the information derived from these observations provide critical inputs for sound management decisions on a local national and international scale. For this reason, 72 nations and 44 international organizations have come together to form the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The purpose of GEOSS is to achieve comprehensive, coordinated and sustained observations of the Earth system to meet the need for timely, quality, long term global information. GEOSS builds on, and adds value to, existing regional, national and international Earth observation systems by coordinating their efforts, addressing critical gaps, supporting their interoperability, sharing information, reaching a common understanding of user requirements and improving delivery of information to users. GEOSS is a complex system of sensors, communication devices, storage systems, computational and other devices used to observe the Earth and gather the data needed for a better understanding of the Earth’s processes. In addition, GEOSS includes models and processes to create information from the observational data. This presentation will give the history and details of the current status of GEOSS and its relevance to ocean applications as part of the review of IEEE OES technical committee programs.

TI  - Demonstrating The Value Of Earth Observations- Methods, Practical Applications And Solutions -Group On Earth Observations Side Event Proceedings
PY  - 2019
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Association for Remote Sensing Companies, and the European Space Agency in coordination with the GEOValue Community hosted a side event to the Group on Earth Observations Plenary on October 23-24, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The workshop, entitled "Demonstrating the Value of Earth Observations: Methods, Practical Applications and Solutions," brought together more than 60 international experts including economists, scientists, and engineers to consider the state of the science and applications of valuing Earth observations (EO).\n\nThis 2-day workshop built upon previous activities developed under the GEOValue initiative. This workshop brought together expert analysts from multiple disciplines and backgrounds who are developing methods to identify and measure the value of information generated from the use of satellite and in-situ data. The mix of government agencies, international financial institutions, and independent consultants who participated in the workshop blended to develop a rich mix of views, approaches, and outcomes.\n\nDuring the first part of the workshop, the focus was on the latest science in valuing EO. A number of methodologies were described. Approaches generally assess the societal benefits of specific actions (for example, investments in EO). Some methods focus on broad measures of economic activity (for example, gross domestic product) or methods to assess total economic value such as contingent valuation surveys. Alternatively, use-case approaches (a use case is defined as an evaluation in which one or more decisions, applications, or other uses of data, information, and information products are specifically considered) start with the specific actions and how information is used to support decision making and affect outcomes. \n\nThe second part of the meeting was focused on the use and development of value chains and decision trees. A value chain can be defined as the set of value-adding activities that one or more organizations perform in creating and distributing goods and services. In terms of EO, the value chain approach can be applied to consider societal benefits of the data and assess the value of data and data features. The EO value chain considers the geospatial data sources and the processing of the data into value added information to be incorporated into decision-support systems, leading to decision maker's actions. To understand the value of EO, one would also need to recognize the demand side of the equation or how EO benefits users. Extending the value chain concept and incorporating tenets of Bayesian decision making, a decision tree would include one or more use cases. The value provided by the marginal increase in information could flow from one or several parts of the supply side of the value chain. The decision tree is based on the premise that information has no value if it is not used in at least one decision. By connecting the value chain and the decision tree, a framework is created that allows for conceptualizing the value of EO in its many uses. One can then apply economic techniques to monetize the marginal benefit of an outcome with information versus one without. \n\nA third part of the meeting applied the value chain and decision-tree frameworks to five specific thematic areas, each with the focus of using information for a decision point: \n- Effect of increasing temperatures on human health; \n- Flooding- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts to safety and property damage; \n- Energy and mineral supply- Mitigating, managing, and avoiding impacts of shortfalls on the economy; and\n- Effects of natural hazards on transportation systems- Effects on mobility, safety, and the economy.\n\nDuring the working session, five separate groups worked to define and delineate the value chains and decision trees associated with each topic, discussing the related challenges and data needs. The outcomes were reported back to the full group. Because of the complexity of the topics, most groups first identified a network of value chains and then narrowed the scope to develop a single value chain to address their group's topic. Although they worked separately and on different topics, the groups came to similar conclusions, concurring that the value chain and decision-tree frameworks are very effective for informing quantitative impact assessments and developing a relatable narrative to assist the public in understanding the link between EO and citizens.

TI  - Global Warming Uncertainties And The Value Of Information: An Analysis Using Ceta
JO  - Resource and Energy Economics
PY  - 1993
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of optimal carbon control strategies to parameters of the Carbon Emissions Trajectory Assessment (CETA) Model, and we use CETA in a simple decision tree framework to estimate the value of information about global warming uncertainties. We find that if an optimal control policy is used under uncertainty, the eventual resolution of uncertainty has high value relative to current research budgets, and resolving uncertainty about the costs of warming is nearly as important as resolving uncertainty about the extent of warming. In addition, we find that there is not a high premium on immediate resolution of uncertainty, if resolution would otherwise occur within, say, twenty years; this implies that time is available to plan and execute a carefully designed research program. On the other hand, we find that if the real world political process would result in a suboptimal control policy being chosen under uncertainty, and this choice could be prevented by early resolution of uncertainty, the benefit of early resolution may be as much as three orders of magnitude greater.

TI  - Weather Service Chain Analysis (Wsca) - An Approach For Appraisal Of The Social-Economic Benefits Of Improvements In Weather Services
PY  - 2012
AB  - The so-called Cost-Loss approach for the assessment of the economic benefits of weather forecasts is less suitable for assessing the benefits for user groups among which uncertainty about the uptake and utilization of the information is significant. Most road users can be counted to these groups. Assessment of the benefits of (improvements in) weather services for road users faces several attribution problems which may entail both over- and underestimation of these benefits. In FMI an approach has been developed which aims to account for these uncertainties by means of decomposition of the information flow ranging from forecast generation to benefit realization, i.e. so-called weather service chain analysis (WCSA). This approach can be used both in a quantitative and in a qualitative fashion. The qualitative version is meant to support information management and to identify improvement options in each section of the weather service chain. In the quantitative version the product sum of ratings per step (compared to the maximum score) is established. The quantitative version helps to identify those segments of the chain for which improvements will have the highest social-economic pay-off. It also helps to identify actions that raise the leverage of investments in weather forecast improvement. The WSCA method can be embedded in the economic modelling of particular sectors, such as (road) transport. WSCA also incites to develop regular surveying of user groups and weather service use. The paper will discuss the principles of the method and its links to economic models, as well as show a few applications for road transport.

This study aims to improve the methodology for assessing the value of forecasting technology ex ante to its development, using the Merredin agricultural region of Western Australia as an illustration. Results suggest that a seasonal forecasting technology that provides a 30% decrease in seasonal uncertainty increases annual profits by approximately 5%. The accumulated annual benefit to farmers in the Merredin region (an area with 754 farm holdings over 35,500 km2 of land) is approximately 2 million dollars. Hence, support is given for the development of seasonal forecasting techniques in Western Australia.

TI  - Remote Sensing For Biodiversity Monitoring: A Review Of Methods For Biodiversity Indicator Extraction And Assessment Of Progress Towards International Targets
JO  - Biodiversity Conservation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.

Yet, the two research communities have only recently begun to coordinate their agendas. Such synchronization is the key to improving the potential for satellite data effectively to support future environmental management decision-making processes. With this themed issue, we aim to illustrate how integrating remote sensing into ecological research promotes a better understanding of the mechanisms shaping current changes in biodiversity patterns and improves conservation efforts. Added benefits include fostering innovation, generating new research directions in both disciplines and the development of new satellite remote sensing products.

JO  - Data
PY  - 2019
AB  - The exploitation of potential societal benefits of Earth observations is hampered by users having to engage in often tedious processes to discover data and extract information and knowledge. A concept is introduced for a transition from the current perception of data as passive objects (DPO) to a new perception of data as active subjects (DAS). This transition would greatly increase data usage and exploitation, and support the extraction of knowledge from data products. Enabling the data subjects to actively reach out to potential users would revolutionize data dissemination and sharing and facilitate collaboration in user communities. The three core elements of the transformative DAS concept are: (1) “intelligent semantic data agents” (ISDAs) that have the capabilities to communicate with their human and digital environment. Each ISDA provides a voice to the data product it represents. It has comprehensive knowledge of the represented product including quality, uncertainties, access conditions, previous uses, user feedbacks, etc., and it can engage in transactions with users. (2) A knowledge base that constructs extensive graphs presenting a comprehensive picture of communities of people, applications, models, tools, and resources and provides tools for the analysis of these graphs. (3) An interaction platform that links the ISDAs to the human environment and facilitates transaction including discovery of products, access to products and derived knowledge, modifications and use of products, and the exchange of feedback on the usage. This platform documents the transactions in a secure way maintaining full provenance.

TI  - Earth Observations As Decision Support For Adaptation And Mitigation Strategies In Response To Coastal Sea Level Rise
PY  - 2009
AB  - Local Sea Level (LSL) rise is among the major anticipated impacts of future global warming. Policy makers face a trade-off between imposing today the very high costs of mitigation, adaptation, and coastal protection upon national economies and leaving the costs of major disasters for future generations. Predictions of future LSL trajectories with reliable estimates of uncertainties are a crucial input to risk and vulnerability assessments in support of informed decisions. Current aleatory uncertainties in observations related to past and current LSL variations combined with epistemic uncertainties in some of the global, regional and local processes forcing LSL changes produce a large range of plausible future LSL trajectories and weak estimates of uncertainties. Therefore, policy makers often lack sound scientific support for the development of reasonable mitigation and adaptation strategies in the coastal zone. Additional spaceborne and in situ observations are needed in order to improve decision support by reducing the uncertainties in LSL predictions.

AB  - The rapid development of analysis tools, such as Geographic Information Systems and web-based tools for viewing, accessing, and analyzing of geo-referenced information, and the growing abundance of openly available Earth observations will increase the already large dependency of science and society on georeferenced information. However, most geo-referenced information comes without sufficient information on quality and applicability. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) has embarked on establishing a so-called GEO Label that would provide easy-to-understand, globally available information on aspects of quality, user rating, relevance, and fit-for-usage of the products and services accessible through the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS). There is a wide range of potential goals for the GEO Label including an attractive incentive for involvement; promotion of data sharing; creating trustworthiness; and providing information on usage. Here we propose a tri-faceted label that combines quality, user feedback, and relevance.

PY  - 2006
AB  - India and the United States of America (U.S.A.) held a joint conference from June 21-25, 2004 in Bangalore, India to strengthen and expand cooperation in the area of space science, applications, and commerce. Following the recommendations in the joint vision statement released at the end of the conference, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Indian Space and Reconnaissance Organization (ISRO) initiated several joint science projects in the area of satellite product development and applications. This is an extraordinary step since it concentrates on improvements in the data and scientific exchange between India and the United States, consistent with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the two nations in 1997. With the relationship between both countries strengthening with President Bush’s visit in early 2006 and new program announcements between the two countries, there is a renewed commitment at ISRO and other Indian agencies and at NOAA in the U.S. to fulfill the agreements reached on the joint science projects. The collaboration is underway with several science projects that started in 2005 providing initial results.

TI  - The Economic Value Of Drought Information For Water Management Under Climate Change: A Case Study In The Ebro Basin
JO  - Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences
PY  - 2011
AB  - Drought events in the Mediterranean are likely to increase in frequency, duration and intensity due to climate change, thereby affecting crop production. Information about drought is valuable for river basin authorities and the farmers affected by their decisions. The economic value of this information and the resulting decisions are of interest to these two stakeholder groups and to the information providers. Understanding the dynamics of extreme events, including droughts, in future climate scenarios for the Mediterranean is being improved continuously. This paper analyses the economic value of information on drought events taking into account the risk aversion of water managers. We consider the effects of drought management plans on rice production in the Ebro river basin. This enables us to compute the willingness to compensate the river basin authority for more accurate information allowing for better decision-making. If runoff is reduced, river basin planners can consider the reduction of water allocation for irrigation in order to eliminate the risk of water scarcity. Alternately, river basin planners may decide to maintain water allocation and accept a reduction of water supply reliability, leaving farmers exposed to drought events. These two alternatives offer different risk levels for crop production and farmers’ incomes which determine the value of this information to the river basin authority. The information is relevant for the revision of River Basin Management Plans of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) within the context of climate change.

TI  - Reimagining The Potential Of Earth Observations For Ecosystem Service Assessments
JO  - Science of The Total Environment
PY  - 2019
AB  - The benefits nature provides to people, called ecosystem services, are increasingly recognized and accounted for in assessments of infrastructure development, agricultural management, conservation prioritization, and sustainable sourcing. These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.

TI  - What Is The Economic Value Of Satellite Imagery?
PY  - 2013
AB  - Does remote-sensing information, such as that from Landsat and similar Earth-observing satellites, provide economic benefits to society, and can this value be estimated? Using satellite data for northeastern Iowa, U.S. Geological Survey scientists modeled the relations among land uses, agricultural production, and dynamic nitrate (NO3-) contamination of aquifers. They demonstrated that information from such modeling can allow more efficient management of agricultural production without sacrificing groundwater quality. Just for northeastern Iowa, the value of such remote-sensing information was shown to be as much as $858 million ± $197 million per year, which corresponds to a current value of $38.1 billion ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits into the foreseeable future.

TI  - Decision Support Model And Visualization For Assessing Environmental Phenomena, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, And Satellite Design Using Earth Observation Data
JO  - AIAA ASCEND 2020
PY  - 2020
AB  - With the increasing availability of Earth Observation (EO) data has come a commensurate rise in EO applications. To address the dual needs of processing data for applications and designing missions with applications in mind, we present a multi-disciplinary, integrated modeling framework to advance environmental management, policymaking, and observation platform design. This core modeling framework is called Environment-Vulnerability-DecisionTechnology (EVDT). EVDT is not the model itself, it is the framework that guides the creation of an integrated model customized to each application with a specific set of stakeholders in mind and designed using Systems Architecture. The EVDT framework can be customized to build integrated models specific to a certain application. Individual models in the framework include certain core models (Environment, Vulnerability, Decision, Technology) and optional models such as Public Health which are added when needed for a specific application. The Environment Model uses earth science methods to estimate the state of environmental phenomena; The Vulnerability Model captures societal impact of environmental changes including ecosystem services; the Decision Model captures human behavior and policy consequences; and the Technology Model provides tools to design earth observation systems or select among earth observation technologies such as satellites, airborne sensors, and in-situ sensors. The intent in developing this framework and its applications is to lead to the development of a standard to facilitate the re-use of models and the design of future remote observation systems. The presented prototype specifically focuses on two case studies. The first case study considers the dynamics of human and environmental behavior related to the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. The second case study considers the relevancy of this framework in approaching coronavirus-related public health decisions in Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and elsewhere.

TI  - Interactive Model For Assessing Mangrove Health, Ecosystem Services, Policy Consequences, And Satellite Design In Rio De Janeiro Using Earth Observation Data
PY  - 2020
AB  - There is an increasing need for tools to translate Earth Observation (EO) data into societally relevant metrics to inform human decision-making. To address this need, we present a multi-disciplinary, interactive modeling framework to advance ecological forecasting and policymaking using EO data. This framework will integrate four model components into one tool: Earth Science, Social Impact, Human Behavior and Satellite Design. The capabilities provided by this framework will improve the management of EO and socioeconomic data in a format usable by non-experts, while harnessing cloud computing, machine learning, economic analysis, complex systems modeling, and model-based systems engineering. This paper presents a prototype that demonstrates the viability of the framework via a case study: the mangrove forests in the Guaratiba area of Rio de Janeiro. These mangroves are vulnerable due to urbanization and rising sea levels. They provide a variety of ecosystem services, including serving as a mechanism for carbon sequestration, supporting subsistence shing, preventing coastal erosion, and attracting an ecotourism industry. The case study of mangrove and community health in Rio de Janeiro demonstrates all four model components. The Earth Science Model builds upon work by NASA biospheric scientists to use EO data, cloud computing and machine learning to track mangrove extent, health, and vulnerability over time for a 600 km2 area, as well as work by the Espa co research group at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the local mangrove ecosystem. To create the Human Decision Making model, we have partnered with Instituto Pereira Passos (the data science o ce of the Rio de Janeiro municipal government) to understand the policy history and socioeconomic factors. To build the Social Impact model, we are collaborating with ecosystem services economists to explain how policies impact mangrove health and how mangroves impact socioeconomic wellbeing. The Satellite Design Model accounts for the types of data collection used by policy makers since 1985. Through such collaborations, we are able to build an integrated, interactive model that policymakers can use to assess mangrove health, ecosystem services value, and policy consequences. The model helps answer such questions as: (a) What is the state of the mangroves over time? (b) How are human communities impacting the mangroves? (c) what is the value of the mangrove ecosystem services to human communities? and (d) what policies can improve human and mangrove outcomes? This case study is demonstrative of the viability of a similar approach for ecosystems around the world.

TI  - Value And Validity Of Earth Resources Observations From Space
JO  - Hydrological Sciences Journal
PY  - 1973
AB  - Observations of the earth from space can provide overall repetitive views in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Data from such surveys can be used as the basis for more detailed observations from aircraft and on the ground to guide resource exploration, development, and conservation activities. The value of earth resource observations from space has been demonstrated by the practical use ofphotographs from the Gemini and Apollo spaceflights and particularly by a series of multispectral photographs taken during the flight of Apollo 9. The analysis of those photographs has shown that the performance of the planned Earth Resources Technology Satellite will meet the needs of the resource and environmental community for small-scale repetitive images of the earth in the visible and solar infrared portions of the spectrum and has provided a limited base of material for earth scientists to work with in order to ready themselves for the ERTS data. The validity of earth resource observations from space can be derived by analogy from the successively closer observations of the moon, culminating in repeated physical sampling of the moon's surface. The method of inductive reasoning and analysis used for the moon is the opposite of the normal deductive analysis used on the earth. Adoption of the inductive methods and reasoning for earth observations will provide a framework of broad observations and conclusions leading to the identification of target areas for more detailed observation and will, in time, reduce the costs and time required for surveys dealing with resource and environmental problems.

TI  - The Economic Value Of Seasonal Forecasts: Stochastic Economywide Analysis For East Africa
PY  - 2016
AB  - There is growing interest within the climate change and development community in using seasonal forecast information to reduce the losses to agriculture resulting from climate variability, especially within food-insecure countries. However, forecast systems are expensive to establish and maintain, and therefore, gauging the potential economic return to investments in forecast systems is crucial. Most studies that evaluate seasonal forecasts focus on developed countries and/or overlook agriculture’s economywide linkages. Yet forecasts may be more valuable in developing regions such as East Africa, where climate is variable and agriculture has macroeconomic importance. We use computable general equilibrium and process-based crop models to estimate the potential economywide value of national seasonal forecast systems in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia. Stochastic seasonal simulations produce value distributions for forecasts of varying accuracy and varying levels of farm coverage. A timely and accurate forecast adopted by all farmers generates average regional income gains of US$113 million per year. Gains are much higher during extreme climate events and are generally pro-poor. The forecast value falls when forecast skill and farm coverage decline. National economic and trading structures, including the importance of agricultural exports, are found to be major determinants of forecast value. Economywide approaches are therefore needed to complement farm-level analysis when evaluating forecast systems in low-income agrarian economies.

TI  - Using Willingness‐To‐Pay To Assess The Economic Value Of Weather Forecasts For Multiple Commercial Sectors
JO  - Meteorological Applications
PY  - 2003
AB  - This paper uses an alternative to the usual cost-avoidance approach to estimating the value of weather forecast products. Value is estimated via a demand-based approach based on the willingness to pay of those who use weather forecast services. Contingent valuation is used to estimate the benefits generated by an automated telephone-answering device that provides weather forecast information to commercial users in the Toronto area of Ontario, Canada. Commercial sectors included in the study are construction, landscaping/snow-removal businesses, TV and film, recreation and sports, agriculture, hotel and catering, and institutions such as schools and hospitals. Average value per call varied by commercial sector, from $2.17 for agricultural users to $0.60 per call for institutional users, with an overall mean of $1.20 per call. At roughly 13,750,000 commercial calls annually, this would result in an estimate of benefits generated by the service to commercial users of $16,500,000 per year.

TI  - A Professional Review For Integration Of Earth Observations Into Fews Net Decision Support
PY  - 2009
AB  - The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) provides early warning support to decision makers responsible for anticipating and responding to famine and food insecurity events. This early warning system utilizes a variety of data types, including satellite remote sensing data, to assess climatic hazards that threaten adverse impacts to the food security of agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has recently funded activities to enhance remote sensing inputs to FEWS NET. A professional review was conducted to elicit Earth observation requirements for FEWS NET. It focused upon operational requirements of FEWS NET end-users to determine qualities of useful remote sensing data and data products. In this manner, properties of certain biophysical predictions that would be beneficial as FEWS NET supplementary inputs could be ascertained. Reviewers were asked to evaluate the importance of environmental variables and spatiotemporal requirements for Earth science data inputs, particularly for rainfall and vegetation products. The review was implemented in 2007 as an online questionnaire and was completed by more than 40 experts from around the world. This professional review questionnaire was shown to be a viable tool for the rapid derivation, compilation, and analysis of requirements necessary to enhance FEWS NET. Overall, information related to both rainfall and vegetation remotely sensed data and data products were valued most highly for providing actionable food security information. Notionally, the incorporation of this information will enhance this decision making system.

TI  - Impact Of Global Earth Observation –Systemic View Across Geoss Societal Benefit Areas
JO  - International Journal of Spatial Data Infrastructures Research
PY  - 2010
AB  - The work of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) is perceived as instrumental to attain sustainable development goals and to be a major driver of how the society–technology–environment system is managed. However, appropriate scientific methodologies to assess the benefits of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and validate investments in Earth observation infrastructure have been missing. This paper presents a systems approach to measure and analyze the impact of Global Earth Observation across the nine Societal Benefit Areas defined by GEO. The methodological framework presented here was developed and applied to be complete across space, time and sectors through integration and aggregation. Apart from the general assessment framework, we present some specifics of the numerical tool, which is based on System Dynamics modeling and simulation technique. Our results indicate that though the total system benefits are strongly policy dependent, improvements of GEOSS per se and data availability and interoperability, the accrued benefits are large and have a great potential shaping mankind’s course to sustainability.

AB  - The Landsat program has been collecting and archiving moderate resolution earth imagery since 1972. The number of Landsat users and uses has increased exponentially since the enactment of a free and open data policy in 2008, which made data available free of charge to all users. Benefits from the information Landsat data provides vary from improving environmental quality to protecting public health and safety and informing decision makers such as consumers and producers, government officials and the public at large. Although some studies have been conducted, little is known about the total benefit provided by open access Landsat imagery. \nThis report contains a set of case studies focused on the uses and benefits of Landsat imagery. The purpose of these is to shed more light on the benefits accrued from Landsat imagery and to gain a better understanding of the program’s value. The case studies tell a story of how Landsat imagery is used and what its value is to different private and public entities. Most of the case studies focus on the use of Landsat in water resource management, although several other content areas are included.

TI  - Quantifying The Cost Reduction Potential For Earth Observation Satellites
JO  - Reinventing Space Conference
PY  - 2014
AB  - In the present budget environment, there is a strong need to dramatically drive down the cost of space missions. There is the perception that SmallSats are inherently much lower cost than more traditional larger satellites and can play a central role in reducing overall space mission cost, but this effect has been difficult to quantify. Without quantifiable evidence of their value, SmallSats are under-utilized as a method for reducing space mission cost. The purpose of this study is to quantify the relationship between cost and performance for space systems, by creating a Performance-Based Cost Model (PBCM). Today, most acquisition performance analyses focus on cost overruns, or how much the system costs relative to what it is expected to cost. Instead, PBCM allows us to focus on more important questions, such as, how much performance we can achieve for a given cost, or what the cost is for a given level of performance. In this paper, we present the relationship between cost vs. orbit altitude for a fixed resolution and coverage requirement, cost vs. resolution, and cost vs. coverage. Traditional cost models for space systems are typically weight-based, primarily because mass allocation is determined early in mission design and has historically correlated well with actual hardware cost. To provide the underlying cost data for this study, we apply 3 cost models widely used throughout the aerospace cost modeling community: the Unmanned Space Vehicle Cost Model (USCM), the Aerospace Corp. Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM), and the NASA Instrument Cost Model (NICM). Our first application of the PBCM is for Earth observation systems. Past Earth observation systems have used traditional space technology to achieve the best possible performance, but have been very expensive. In addition, low-cost, responsive dedicated launch has not been available for SmallSats. Space system mass is proportional to the cube of the linear dimensions—equivalent to saying that most spacecraft have about the same density. This means that by flying at lower altitudes, satellites can reduce their payload size and therefore the entire mass of the satellite, thus reducing the cost of the system dramatically. We conclude that for an Earth observation system, an increase in performance, reduction in cost, or both, is possible by using multiple SmallSats at lower altitudes when compared to traditional systems. Specifically,\nBy using modern microelectronics and light-weight materials such as composite structures, future SmallSats\nobservation systems, operating at a lower altitude than traditional systems, have the potential for:\n– Comparable or better performance (resolution and coverage)\n– Much lower overall mission cost (by a factor of 2 to 10)\n– Lower risk (both implementation and operations)\n– Shorter schedules\nRelevant secondary advantages for the low-altitude SmallSats include:\n– Lower up-front development cost\n– More sustainable business model\n– More flexible and resilient\n– More responsive to both new technologies and changing needs\n– Mitigates the problem of orbital debris\nThe principal demerits of the approach are the lack of low-cost launch vehicles, the need for a new way of doing business, and changing the way we think about the use of space assets. This paper provides the basis for this assessment, estimates for the level of cost reduction, and reports on additional results since the 2013 Reinventing Space Conference and AIAA Space 2014 Conference.

TI  - Value Of Enso-Forecasted Drought Information For The Management Of Water Resources Of Small To Mid-Size Communities
JO  - Transactions of the ASABE
PY  - 2016
AB  - There have been great advances in climate forecasting ability in recent years. However, the use of this information in water management decision-making has been lacking. The temporal and spatial scales of forecasts and the difficulty of understanding forecast products have been cited as key reasons for the lack of use of these forecasts. The Community Water Deficit Index (CWDI) was previously developed as a tool to use El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts to forecast droughts in small to mid-sized communities of the southeastern U.S. This study investigated the monetary value and benefits of using CWDI as a seasonal drought forecasting technique. The efforts were focused on determining the usefulness of drought information for municipal water management, the usefulness of water restrictions imposed by municipal water management, and the extent to which advance knowledge of probabilistic drought forecasts mitigates negative impacts. The results indicate that water use restrictions are effective for coping with drought, and the benefits of using forecasts and water management adjustments should involve planning. It was also found that by using drought forecasts, and thus having a drought preparedness plan, communities can save both water and money.

TI  - Enhancing Access And Usage Of Earth Observations In Environmental Decision-Making In Eastern And Southern Africa Through Capacity Building
JO  - Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems
PY  - 2021
AB  - Major strides have been made in the development of remote sensing, reanalysis, and model-based earth observations (EOs), which can be used for long-term climate variability mapping, as well as real-time environmental monitoring and forecasting. Such EOs are particularly valuable for environmental decision-making (e.g., for environmental resources management and disaster mitigation) in the Eastern and Southern Africa (E & SA) region, where ground-based EOs are sparse. Nonetheless, operational application of those EOs to inform decision-making in the region remains limited. This paper reports on a recently concluded (as of June 2019) NASA SERVIR-supported Applied Science Team project that contributed to the uptake of EO applications to inform decision-making in this region. This project was conducted in close collaboration with the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)—the NASA SERVIR regional hub in E & SA. The capacity-building efforts leveraged RCMRD’s existing environmental service capacity, their long experience in capacity building in the region, and their extensive network of regional partners, with the goal of increasing RCMRD and their regional partners’ ability to uptake EOs to enhance their environmental services and, hence, improve the environmental decision-making process. The project focused on: (1) Transfer of technology—Transition and implementation of web-based tools to RCMRD to allow easy processing and visualization of EOs and (2) Capacity training—training of representatives from regional and national environmental service agencies in EO application based on targeted case studies. Here, we describe these capacity-building efforts, provide specific examples to demonstrate the benefits of those efforts in terms of enhanced uptake of EOs, and provide recommendations for furthering the uptake of EOs in the region and beyond.

TI  - Enhancing The Application Of Earth Observations For Improved Environmental Decision-Making Using The Early Warning Explorer (Ewx)
JO  - Frontiers in Climate
PY  - 2021
AB  - The mitigation of losses due to extreme climate events and long-term climate adaptation requires climate informed decision-making. In the past few decades, several remote sensing and modeled-based Earth observations (EOs) have been developed to provide an unprecedented global overview and routine monitoring of climate and its impacts on vegetation and hydrologic conditions, with the goal of supporting informed decision-making. However, their usage in decision-making is particularly limited in climate-risk vulnerable and in situ data-scarce regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, due to lack of access to EOs. Here, we describe the Early Warning eXplorer (EWX), which was developed to address this crucial limitation and facilitate the application of EOs in decision-making, particularly in the food and water-insecure regions of the world. First, the EWX’s core framework, which includes (i) the Viewer, (ii) GeoEngine, and (iii) Support Applications, is described. Then, a comprehensive overview of the Viewer, which is a web-based interface used to access EOs, is provided. This includes a description of (i) the maps and associated features to access gridded EO data and anomalies for different temporal averaging periods, (ii) time series graphs and associated features to access EOs aggregated over polygons such as administrative boundaries, and (iii) commonly used EOs served by the EWX that provide assessments of climate and vegetation conditions. Next, examples are provided to demonstrate how EWX can be used to monitor development, progression, spatial extent, and severity of climate-driven extreme events to support timely decisions related to mitigation of food insecurity and flooding impacts. Finally, the value of a regional implementation of EWX at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) in Nairobi, Kenya, is highlighted. Regional implementation of the EWX facilitates access to regionally focused EOs and their availability at polygon boundaries most relevant to the local decision-makers. Similar instances of EWX implemented in other regions, especially those susceptible to food and water security, will likely further enhance the application of EOs for informed decision-making.

TI  - Valuation Of Calibration For Satellite Constellations
PY  - 2020
AB  - Earth observation systems, consisting of in-space and air borne platforms and sensors, are providing a growing number of high resolution spatial and temporal services including agricultural crop yield predictions, local weather forecasts, and traffic management. As the complexity of these systems increases with multi-platform elements and sophisticated processing and modeling, there are also increasing avenues for introduction of errors. It is important to characterize and quantify the uncertainties and errors. Here, it shown that a value-chain approach can be used for conceptualizing errors and modeling uncertainties relevant for final decisions. This approach can then be applied for improving system value assessments and obtaining an ‘error-adjusted’ value of the remote sensing system. The error-adjusted value can be used in optimization or trade-studies for system design. This value system is then applied, as an example, to the FLARE real world calibration/validation system to look at potential Return on Investment (ROI) of better calibration to satellite image prices and market penetration.

TI  - Position Paper: Evaluation Methods And Techniques
PY  - 2014
AB  - This paper reviews methodologies in economics for valuing the benefits of geospatial data and services; including the value of open data. Section 2 explores the meaning of socioeconomic value and reviews the methodologies underpinning value assessment. It explains the theoretical background to economic welfare analysis, total turnover analysis and value added analysis. The use of different methods for economic impact assessment is then outlined. The methods include benefit cost analysis, multiplier analysis and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling1. This section also outlines the background to value chain analysis and real options analysis. Examples of the application of these techniques are discussed. They include the application of earth observation to agricultural and water resource management and the use of mapping to improve decision making in areas such as emergency management, managing endangered species, conducting property tax assessments and verifying insurance claims. These examples illustrate the potential for geospatial data to deliver value over a wide and growing range of applications. Section 3 addresses the issues that arise in applying these techniques. It points out that the methodology selected must address the questions being asked by policy makers and/or users of geospatial data. In the current defensive fiscal environment experienced by governments in many OECD countries, it is important that the valuation method links the use of geospatial data services to a clearly defined and quantifiable outcome. There needs to be a ‘line of sight’ between application of geospatial data services and the benefits that are identified. The paper suggests that evaluations should clearly outline such relationships and suggests a hierarchy of methods that can be applied in such circumstances. The methods include cost effectiveness analysis, benefit cost analysis and regional and economy wide economic modelling. Section 4 comments on the issues that arise draws some conclusions and raises some questions for discussion. It concludes that there is a need to: align methodology to the decision maker’s needs; develop better evidence based economic assessments; adopt more structured approaches to addressing the rapid evolution in the use and application of geospatial data; develop greater capability in building better business cases; and reaching a consensus on internationally recognised methodologies. It also raises the possibility of greater international collaboration and research into building better business cases and establishing a community of experts to help advance the discipline of socioeconomic evaluation as applied to geospatial data and services.

AB  - Hundreds of millions of poor families receive some form of targeted social assistance. Many of these antipoverty programs involve some degree of geographic targeting, where aid is prioritized to the poorest regions of the country. However, policy makers in many low-resource settings lack the disaggregated poverty data required to make effective geographic targeting decisions. Using several independent datasets from Nigeria, this paper shows that high-resolution poverty maps, constructed by applying machine learning algorithms to satellite imagery and other nontraditional geospatial data, can improve the targeting of government cash transfers to poor families. Specifically, we find that geographic targeting relying on machine learning–based poverty maps can reduce errors of exclusion and inclusion relative to geographic targeting based on recent nationally representative survey data. This result holds for antipoverty programs that target both the poor and the extreme poor and for initiatives of varying sizes. We also find no evidence that machine learning–based maps increase targeting disparities by demographic groups, such as gender or religion. Based in part on these findings, the Government of Nigeria used this approach to geographically target emergency cash transfers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Engaging Global Youth In Participatory Spatial Data Creation For The Un Sustainable Development Goals: The Case Of Open Mapping For Malaria Prevention
JO  - Applied Geography
PY  - 2018
AB  - Practitioners bemoan lack of data as one of the biggest obstacles to progress towards global sustainable development goals. This paper explores a scaled-up participatory method developed by YouthMappers, for creating missing geospatial data derived from remotely sensed imagery in order to contribute to persistent data needs in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries. We reflect on the opportunities and challenges for how this scaled-up “remote participatory sensing” approach to spatial data creation can inform development projects in the context of the SDGs.

TI  - Earth Observation For Sustainable Infrastructure: A Review
JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2021
AB  - Infrastructure is a fundamental sector for sustainable development and Earth observation has great potentials for sustainable infrastructure development (SID). However, implementations of the timely, large–scale and multi–source Earth observation are still limited in satisfying the huge global requirements of SID. This study presents a systematical literature review to identify trends of Earth observation for sustainable infrastructure (EOSI), investigate the relationship between EOSI and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and explore challenges and future directions of EOSI. Results reveal the close associations of infrastructure, urban development, ecosystems, climate, Earth observation and GIS in EOSI, and indicate their relationships. In addition, from the perspective of EOSI–SDGs relationship, the huge potentials of EOSI are demonstrated from the 70% of the infrastructure influenced targets that can be directly or indirectly derived from Earth observation data, but have not been included in current SDG indicators. Finally, typical EOSI cases are presented to indicate challenges and future research directions. This review emphasizes the contributions and potentials of Earth observation to SID and EOSI is a powerful pathway to deliver on SDGs.

TI  - A Benefit-Cost Analysis Of A Regional Global Ocean Observing System: Seawatch Europe
JO  - Marine Policy
PY  - 1996
AB  - The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a joint effort of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, the World Meteorological Organlsation (WMO) and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). GOOS will provide long-term ocean data based on a globally coordinated strategy. These data will be used for climate forecasting. The Seawatch Europe project of the European Marine environment programme (EUROMAR) Is an on-line monitoring and surveillance system of the North Sea and Is a regional component of GOOS. Seawetch forecasts and environmental data are distributed to public authorities, aquecuiture/fish farming, commercial fishing, tourist Industry, research Institutes, navy and coastguards. The Seawatch system Is now operative In Norway and Thailand. it is at present Installed In Spain, and Indonesia Seawatch has aroused considerable Interest In Sweden, The Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Mexico, China, Korea and the USA. In this paper some of the results of a benefit-coat analysis of the Seawatch System are discuseed. So far the main revenues occur in the oll and gas exploitation, commercial flsherless end fish farming, tourism, meteorological forecasting, crises management etc. It is calculated that in the North Sea, a delay of 105 minutes in startup of the productional of a well will cover the costs of Seawatch. The global potential for the Seawatch System in the Exclusive Economic Zone is an estimated 50 units of ten buoys with a running cost of $100 million per year. A strong point of the Seawatch system is that it is commercially off-the-shelf technology. Seawatch is, however, still competing with academic and governmental institutions for funds when viewed as either a research venture or an operational programme. It is important for public authorities at the national and international level to participate in Seawatch and help to steer it towards the potential it was designed to fulfil namely a building stone of GOOS.

TI  - Quantifying The Human Health Benefits Of Using Satellite Information To Detect Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms And Manage Recreational Advisories In U.s. Lakes
JO  - GeoHealth
PY  - 2020
AB  - Significant recent advances in satellite remote sensing allow environmental managers to detect and monitor cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB), and these capabilities are being used more frequently in water quality management. A quantitative estimate of the socioeconomic benefits generated from these new capabilities, known as an impact assessment, was missing from the growing literature on cyanoHABs and remote sensing. In this paper, we present an impact assessment framework to characterize the socioeconomic benefits of satellite remote sensing for detecting cyanoHABs and managing recreational advisories at freshwater lakes. We then apply this framework to estimate the socioeconomic benefits of satellite data that were used to manage a 2017 cyanoHAB event in Utah Lake. CyanoHAB events on Utah Lake can pose health risks to people who interact with the blooms through recreation. We find that the availability of satellite data yielded socioeconomic benefits by improving human health outcomes valued at approximately $370,000, though a sensitivity analysis reveals that this central estimate can vary significantly ($55,000–$1,057,000 in benefits) as a result of different assumptions regarding the time delay in posting a recreational advisory, the number of people exposed to the cyanoHAB, the number of people who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and the cost per case of illness.

TI  - Using Satellite Data To Fill The Gaps In The Us Air Pollution Monitoring Network
PY  - 2018
AB  - Compliance with the Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) is determined at the county level using local air pollution monitors. However, the vast majority of counties have zero or one monitor, and air pollution concentrations can vary dramatically over short distances. In addition, recent evidence suggests monitor placement may be skewed to make NAAQS compliance easier. As a result, the network of air pollution monitors may not detect all areas with pollution levels that exceed the NAAQS. This paper explores this possibility using satellite-derived data on fine particulate matter concentrations (PM2.5) to assess NAAQS compliance for the continental United States at a 1 kilometer (km) resolution. We compare the satellite-based assessments with official attainment designations made by the terrestrial monitor network and calculate the number of people living in “misclassified” areas—areas with PM2.5 levels that exceed the NAAQS but are classified as being in attainment based on the ground monitors and the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) official determination. We estimate that about 24.4 million people are living in these misclassified areas— about as many as are living in properly classified nonattainment areas—and that if such areas had sped up their PM2.5 reductions as much as nonattainment areas did, 5,452 premature deaths would have been avoided, a welfare gain to society of $49 billion.

TI  - Stakeholder Value Network (Svn) Analysis For Indian Earth Observation Program
PY  - 2015
AB  - Indian Space Program operates the world’s largest constellation of civil remote-sensing satellites through its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites system. Since the founding of the nation’s space program in 1969 with the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Earth Observation through satellites has been a core objective of the Indian Space Program harnessing the space technology for national development. The IRS system supports the Indian national economy in the areas of agriculture, water resources, forestry, ecology, geology, watersheds, marine fisheries and coastal management, and advanced research in Earth Sciences. The meteorological payloads of the Indian National Satellites (INSAT) system provide for weather and natural disaster management support.\nThe IRS satellites system began in 1988 with the launch of IRS-1A satellite. The IRS series of satellites are designed and built by the ISRO Satellite Center based in Bengaluru while the ISRO Space Application Center in Ahmedabad fabricates the remote sensing payloads and cameras. The National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) based in Hyderabad is responsible for acquisition, processing and supply of data to the various national programs that utilize the remote-sensing data for optimal use of country’s national resources and water management. The National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS), an autonomous organization under the aegis of the Indian Department of Space oversees interagency coordination among the various national departments that utilize the EO data and addresses underutilization and inadequacies in regional and district level ground facilities.\nThis paper presents a Stakeholder Value Network (SVN), a multi-relation model to analyze the Indian Earth Observation system providing key insights on one of the world’s largest space based Earth Observation program, as well as the valueadded roles of each stakeholder within the network.

TI  - Program Goals For The Nasa/Noaa Earth Observation Program Derived From A Stakeholder Value Network Analysis
JO  - Space Policy
PY  - 2012
AB  - The 2007 US National Research Council Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space was the first consensus perspective produced by the US Earth Science community of the relative priorities among a sequence of 17 satellite missions over the course of the next decade. However, the Decadal Survey only captured the perspective of the science community, leading to questions about the inclusion of broader priorities from constituent communities and stakeholders. We present a stakeholder value network analysis for the NASA/NOAA Earth Observation Program. The analysis includes a rigorous articulation of the needs and objectives of 13 major stakeholders and a complete stakeholder value network with 190 individual “value flows” that capture the interactions between all the stakeholders. It produces a novel stakeholder map, graphically indicating the outputs most likely to create a lasting Earth Science program. The most important value loops and program outputs are used to derive a set of highlevel program goals that suggest what NASA and NOAA should do, as well as how they should conduct business. The analysis concludes that international partnerships represent a strong potential partner for certain science missions with greater potential value delivery than currently-prioritized efforts with defense stakeholders and concludes that weather and land-use missions, in addition to climate missions, should be given highest priority; water, human health, and solid Earth missions should be given lower priority based on each science category’s potential for delivering value to the entire stakeholder network.

TI  - On-Going European Space Agency Activities On Measuring The Benefits Of Earth Observations To Society: Challenges, Achievements And Next Steps
JO  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
PY  - 2022
AB  - Understanding the Earth system and its physical and societal processes is crucial for helping humankind develop in a sustainable way, and for designing effective policies across a wide range of applications that include mitigating the effects of climate change, the sustainable management of natural resources, food security and public health. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide regular and accurate observations of the entire planet that can greatly support improvements in such understanding. The European Space Agency (ESA) is committed to supporting international efforts to decipher the processes and phenomena that regulate life on Earth, by building world class EO space missions and making data available to scientists and citizens across the world. How successful is ESA in this endeavour? Given the variable and dynamic nature of EO data use, it is difficult to answer the question through established figures. Yet, it is crucial that ESA be able to discriminate and assess the benefits brought by the use of its EO missions, in order to demonstrate its achievements, to keep improving its systems, to better design and plan future missions, and to promote further uptake. In this article, after recalling its commitments in support of Earth system sciences, ESA’s attempts to conduct valuations of the impact of its own space missions are described. In particular, the challenges encountered in measuring such impacts and the solutions pursued by the Agency to improve its assessment capabilities are detailed, together with the open issues and the current lines of work.

TI  - Toward Integrated Earth Sensing: The Role Of In Situ Sensing
PY  - 2002
AB  - Significant advancements in Earth observation are expected to come about by developing more systematic capabilities for assimilating remote sensing observations and in situ measurements for use in models, at relevant scales, to generate geophysical and biospheric information products. This paper provides an overview of the role of in situ sensing in the context of integrated Earth sensing. It also defines a framework for taking advantage of intelligent sensorwebs based on the converging technologies of microsensors, computers, and wireless telecommunications in support of critical activities such as the monitoring of remote environments, risk assessment and hazard mapping, and renewable resource information management. The knowledge gleaned from integrated Earth sensing has the potential to empower managers and decision makers to act on critical climate, sustainable development, natural resource, and environmental issues. The paper also describes early work on a prototype wireless intelligent sensorweb evaluation in the context of watershed management and flood forecasting.

TI  - Near Real-Time Wildfire Management Using Distributed Satellite System
JO  - IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (Early Access)
PY  - 2022
AB  - Climate action (SDG-13) is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN), and wildfire is one of the catastrophic events related to climate change. Large-scale forest fires have drastically increased in frequency and size in recent years in Australia and other nations. These wildfires endanger the forests and urban areas of the world, demolish vast amounts of property, and frequently result in fatalities. There is a requirement for real-time/near real-time catastrophic event monitoring of fires due to their growing frequency. In order to effectively monitor disaster events, it will be feasible to manage them in real-time or near real-time, thanks to the advent of the Distributed Satellite System (DSS). This research examines the possible applicability of DSS for wildfire surveillance. For spacecraft to continually monitor the dynamically changing environment, satellite missions must have broad coverage and revisit intervals that DSS can fulfil. A feasibility analysis, as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, are included in this paper to enable prompt action and swiftly provide alerts. In our previous research, it is shown that on-board implementation, i.e., data processing utilising hardware accelerators, is feasible. To enable Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operation (TASO), the same will be included in the proposed DSS architecture, and the outcomes will be provided. To demonstrate the applicability, the suggested DSS architecture will be tested in several geographic locations to demonstrate the system-wide coverage.

TI  - Capacity Building Approach And Application: Utilization Of Earth Observation Data And Geospatial Information Technology In The Hindu Kush Himalaya
JO  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
PY  - 2019
AB  - While the Earth observation (EO) data and geospatial information technology (GIT) are getting more open and accessible, lack of skilled human resources and institutional capacities are limiting effective applications in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formats—standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participants’ expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topics—from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issues—were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies. The ADIM approach and its workflow focused on bridging the gap between the current trend and progression in EO and GIT fields and the existing state of capacity of the agencies involved in the decision-making process. It promoted gender equity, adopted frontier technologies, engaged SMEs and provided sustainable solutions, which are starting to bring success stories in the region.

JO  - Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment
PY  - 2011
AB  - The spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of wildfire risk are challenging U.S. federal land management agencies to meet societal needs while maintaining the health of the lands they manage. In this paper we present a quantitative, geospatial wildfire risk assessment tool, developed in response to demands for improved risk-based decision frameworks. The methodology leverages off recent and significant advancements in wildfire simulation models and geospatial data acquisition and management. The tool is intended to facilitate monitoring trends in wildfire risk over time and to develop information useful in prioritizing fuels treatments and mitigation measures. Wildfire risk assessment requires analyzing the likelihood of wildfire by intensity level, and the magnitude of potential beneficial and negative effects to valued resources from fire at different intensity levels. This effort is designed to support strategic planning by systematically portraying how fire likelihood and intensity influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values at the national scale. We present results for the continental United States, analyze high risk areas by geographic region, and examine how risk evaluations changes under different assumptions with sensitivity analysis. We conclude by discussing further potential uses of the tool and research needs.

TI  - Uncertainty And Risk In Wildland Fire Management: A Review
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
PY  - 2011
AB  - Wildland fire management is subject to manifold sources of uncertainty. Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them. Leveraging the most appropriate decision support tools can facilitate wildfire risk assessment and ideally improve decision-making.

TI  - Extending Data For Urban Health Decision-Making: A Menu Of New And Potential Neighborhood-Level Health Determinants Datasets In Lmics
JO  - Journal of Urban Health
PY  - 2019
AB  - Area-level indicators of the determinants of health are vital to plan and monitor progress toward targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tools such as the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) and UN Habitat Urban Inequities Surveys identify dozens of area-level health determinant indicators that decisionmakers can use to track and attempt to address population health burdens and inequalities. However, questions remain as to how such indicators can be measured in a cost-effective way. Area-level health determinants reflect the physical, ecological, and social environments that influence health outcomes at community and societal levels, and include, among others, access to quality health facilities, safe parks, and other urban services, traffic density, level of informality, level of air pollution, degree of social exclusion, and extent of social networks. The identification and disaggregation of indicators is necessarily constrained by which datasets are available. Typically, these include household- and individual-level survey, census, administrative, and health system data. However, continued advancements in earth observation (EO), geographical information system (GIS), and mobile technologies mean that new sources of area-level health determinant indicators derived from satellite imagery, aggregated anonymized mobile phone data, and other sources are also becoming available at granular geographic scale. Not only can these data be used to directly calculate neighborhood- and city-level indicators, they can be combined with survey, census, administrative and health system data to model household- and individual-level outcomes (e.g., population density, household wealth) with tremendous detail and accuracy. WorldPop and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) have already modeled dozens of household survey indicators at country or continental scales at resolutions of 1 × 1 km or even smaller. This paper aims to broaden perceptions about which types of datasets are available for health and development decision-making. For data scientists, we flag area-level indicators at city and sub-city scales identified by health decision-makers in the SDGs, Urban HEART, and other initiatives. For local health decision-makers, we summarize a menu of new datasets that can be feasibly generated from EO, mobile phone, and other spatial data—ideally to be made free andpublicly available—and offer lay descriptions of some of the difficulties in generating such data products.

TI  - Ten Rules To Increase The Societal Value Of Earth Observations
JO  - Earth Science Informatics
PY  - 2020
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data play an important role in our society today, but there is still tremendous opportunity to improve how these data are used to affect change. In this paper, we provide guidance to help data providers and intermediaries within the EO value chain (from data to applications) increase the societal value ofthe EO data, information, and data products that they work with. We first describe the EO value chain as a conceptual framework for how data are translated and applied for societal benefit. We then introduce three approaches that are often used to assess and improve the EO value chain. Finally, we present "10 rules" that can be implemented to increase the societal benefits of Earth science information. The 10 rules emphasize meeting user needs, problem-solving within interdisciplinary teams, and long-term sustainable solutions. Some rules focus on a specific segment of the value chain or phase in the problem-solving process, while others are relevant to the value chain or process as a whole. Each rule includes at least one case study example to illustrate the key points. The rules are loosely organized according to project management principles with the initial rules focusing on defining problems, planning for data use, creating effective teams, and examining a diverse selection ofsolutions. The next set ofrules are best applied throughout a project, and include such concepts as evaluation, interoperability, trust, adoption, and documentation. Finally, the last rule addresses the challenge of determining when to close a project.

TI  - Satellite Image Analysis For Disaster And Crisis-Management Support
JO  - IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper describes how multisource satellite data and efficient image analysis may successfully be used to conduct rapid-mapping tasks in the domain of disaster and crisis management support. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has set up a dedicated crosscutting service, which is the so-called "Center for satellite-based Crisis Information" (ZKI), to facilitate the use of its Earth-observation capacities in the service of national and international response to major disaster situations, humanitarian relief efforts, and civil security issues. This paper describes successful rapid satellite mapping campaigns supporting disaster relief and demonstrates how this technology can be used for civilian crisis-management purposes. During the last years, various international coordination bodies were established, improving the disaster-response-related cooperation within the Earth-observation community worldwide. DLR/ZKI operates in this context, closely networking with public authorities (civil security), nongovernmental organizations (humanitarian relief organizations), satellite operators, and other space agencies. This paper reflects on several of these international activities, such as the International Charter Space and Major Disasters, describes mapping procedures, and reports on rapid-mapping experiences gained during various disaster-response applications. The example cases presented cover rapid impact assessment after the Indian Ocean Tsunami, forest fires mapping for Portugal, earthquake-damage assessment for Pakistan, and landslide extent mapping for the Philippines

GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage of approximately -27.2 +/- 0.6 mm yr^-1 equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 143.6 km^3 during the course of the study period. Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of ‘‘best current capabilities’’ in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3 +/- 2.1 mm yr^-1 equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3 +/-10.9 km^3 in volume. Furthermore, results raise important issues regarding water use in transboundary river basins and aquifers, including the necessity of international water use treaties and resolving discrepancies in international water law, while amplifying the need for increased monitoring for core components of the water budget.\n\n

TI  - The Social Innovation Potential Of Ict-Enabled Citizen Observatories To Increase Eparticipation In Local Flood Risk Management
JO  - Technology in Society
PY  - 2015
AB  - We live in the age of Big Data, yet many areas of environmental management are still suffering from a lack of relevant data, information and knowledge that impedes sound decision making in the face of change and increasing challenges. A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves. Moreover, given the institutional structures identified in these cases and the obligation of authorities to be accountable for their decisions, citizen observatories do not automatically imply that citizens will have a higher level of participation in flood risk management, nor that communication between stakeholders improves.

TI  - Remote Sensing In Environmental Justice Research—A Review
JO  - International Journal of Geo-Information
PY  - 2019
AB  - Human health is known to be affected by the physical environment. Various environmental influences have been identified to benefit or challenge people’s physical condition. Their heterogeneous distribution in space results in unequal burdens depending on the place of living. In addition, since societal groups tend to also show patterns of segregation, this leads to unequal exposures depending on social status. In this context, environmental justice research examines how certain social groups are more affected by such exposures. Yet, analyses of this per se spatial phenomenon are oftentimes criticized for using “essentially aspatial” data or methods which neglect local spatial patterns by aggregating environmental conditions over large areas. Recent technological and methodological developments in satellite remote sensing have proven to provide highly detailed information on environmental conditions. This narrative review therefore discusses known influences of the urban environment on human health and presents spatial data and applications for analyzing these influences. Furthermore, it is discussed how geographic data are used in general and in the interdisciplinary research field of environmental justice in particular. These considerations include the modifiable areal unit problem and ecological fallacy. In this review we argue that modern earth observation data can represent an important data source for research on environmental justice and health. Especially due to their high level of spatial detail and the provided large-area coverage, they allow for spatially continuous description of environmental characteristics. As a future perspective, ongoing earth observation missions, as well as processing architectures, ensure data availability and applicability of ’big earth data’ for future environmental justice analyses.

TI  - Potential Benefits Of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems To Alaskan Commercial Fisheries
JO  - Coastal Management
PY  - 2008
AB  - In this article we attempt to illustrate the potential benefits to Alaskan commercial fisheries expected from enhancements to the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS) through changes in fishery management strategies. In particular we show how the use of improvedAOOSdata in research, stockassessment, andultimately fisheriesmanagement has the potential to result in significant benefits in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish and Kodiak king crab fisheries. We show through a case study approach that information such as might be provided by an enhanced AOOS could conceivably contribute over $600 million in additional annual revenue in Alaska’s groundfish fishery. In addition we estimate that had the information from such a system been available in the 1970s and 1980s the Kodiak king crab stock collapse could have been avoided and $60 million in annual revenues generated. Benefit estimates (as measured by revenue increases) are based on the assumptions that when better data is delivered those data will be integrated into stock assessment models; when better data are integrated into the models the new data will actually improve the reliability of the models; and when the reliability of the models is improved predictions will be accepted by managers or industry members.

TI  - Nasa Harvest(Ing) Earth Observations For Informed Agricultural Decisions
PY  - 2020
AB  - Agriculture, while critically important to humanity in terms of jobs and sustenance, is also one of the largest contributors to climate change, the largest user of freshwater, and one of the primary drivers of land cover and land use change. Accordingly, the need for timely, accurate, and actionable information to understand these impacts and dynamics is growing. NASA Harvest – NASA’s multisectoral food security and agriculture program – contends that Earth observations play a critical role in both the attainment of and the monitoring of progress toward the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In order to really deliver on what will be in 2030 six decades of investment in Earth observations with respect to agricultural productivity, sustainability, and land use, we posit herein several critical areas of necessary investigation, collaboration, partnership, and action for 2020-2030 and beyond.

AB  - The study develops a model of recreational fish catch probabilities, based on angler fishing strategies, that is conditional on uncertain information about the coastal ocean environment. We calculate expected catch based on a hypothetical Baseline Data Set and hypothetical data from an Integrated Ocean Observation System (IOOS) to demonstrate potential benefits from IOOS. The role of Bayesian probabilities in Random Utility Models of recreational fishing is identified. The study discusses the types of information that will be required by recreational anglers in the Gulf of Mexico. Results have implications for the construction of ocean observation systems for recreational fishermen.

TI  - A Skill Score Based On Economic Value For Probability Forecasts
JO  - Meteorological Applications
PY  - 2001
AB  - An approach to evaluating probability forecasts for dichotomous events, based on their economic value over all possible cost/loss ratio decision problems, is proposed. The resulting Value Score (VS) curve shows non-dimensionalised relative economic value as a function of the cost/loss ratios for different decision-makers, over their full meaningful range. The VS curve is similar in terms of computational mechanics and graphical display to the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, but the ROC curve is shown to be insensitive to either conditional or unconditional biases and thus to reflect potential rather than actual skill. The possibility of collapsing the VS curve into a single scalar score is addressed, and it is shown that the results can depend very strongly on the assumed distribution of cost/loss ratios in the community of forecast users.

AB  - This paper provides evidence for the lack of collaborative remote sensing research between the developed and developing world. Analysis of publications in peer-reviewed journals using Web of Knowledge (WoK), the major UK academic citation database data is presented showing that countries designated low income or lower middle income countries tend to have significantly fewer publications (as might be expected) but also those papers that are describing work conducted in one of these countries have far fewer local authors on papers (compared to high and upper middle income countries). We identify ways in which EO researchers can support the sustainable development of indigenous capacity, through improved collaboration, increased access to publications, and better networking.

TI  - Cloud Services With Big Data Provide A Solution For Monitoring And Tracking Sustainable Development Goals
JO  - Geography and Sustainability
PY  - 2020
AB  - To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), high-quality data are needed to inform the formulation of policies and investment decisions, to monitor progress towards the SDGs and to evaluate the impacts of policies. However, the data landscape is changing. With emerging big data and cloud-based services, there are new opportunities for data collection, influencing both official data collection processes and the operation of the programmes they monitor. This paper uses cases and examples to explore the potential of crowdsourcing and public earth observation (EO) data products for monitoring and tracking the SDGs. This paper suggests that cloud-based services that integrate crowdsourcing and public EO data products provide cost-effective solutions for monitoring and tracking the SDGs, particularly for low-income countries. The paper also discusses the challenges of using cloud services and big data for SDG monitoring. Validation and quality control of public EO data is very important; otherwise, the user will be unable to assess the quality of the data or use it with confidence.

JO  - Remote Sensing
PY  - 2016
AB  - This review paper discusses how to develop, produce, sustain, and serve satellite climate data records (CDRs) in the context of transitioning research to operation (R2O). Requirements and critical procedures of producing various CDRs, including Fundamental CDRs (FCDRs), Thematic CDRs (TCDRs), Interim CDRs (ICDRs), and climate information records (CIRs) are discussed in detail, including radiance/reflectance and the essential climate variables (ECVs) of land, ocean, and atmosphere. Major international CDR initiatives, programs, and projects are summarized. Societal benefits of CDRs in various user sectors, including Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Energy, Heath, Water, Transportation, and Tourism are also briefly discussed. The challenges and opportunities for CDR development, production and service are also addressed. It is essential to maintain credible CDR products by allowing free access to products and keeping the production process transparent by making source code and documentation available with the dataset.

TI  - Assimilation Of Grace Terrestrial Water Storage Data Into A Land Surface Model: Results For The Mississippi River Basin
JO  - Journal of Hydrometeorology
PY  - 2008
AB  - Assimilation of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system of satellites yielded improved simulation of water storage and fluxes in the Mississippi River basin, as evaluated against independent measurements. The authors assimilated GRACE-derived monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies for each of the four major subbasins of the Mississippi into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) using an ensemble Kalman smoother from January 2003 to May 2006. Compared with the open-loop CLSM simulation, assimilation estimates of groundwater variability exhibited enhanced skill with respect to measured groundwater in all four subbasins. Assimilation also significantly increased the correlation between simulated TWS and gauged river flow for all four subbasins and for the Mississippi River itself. In addition, model performance was evaluated for eight smaller watersheds within the Mississippi basin, all of which are smaller than the scale of GRACE observations. In seven of eight cases, GRACE assimilation led to increased correlation between TWS estimates and gauged river flow, indicating that data assimilation has considerable potential to downscale GRACE data for hydrological applications.

TI  - A User-Driven Approach To Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities For Societal Benefit
JO  - IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
PY  - 2012
AB  - In order to help data providers make informed decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of Earth observations for societal benefit, a cross-sectoral meta-analysis of observation priorities was conducted from the perspective of users. The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations’ (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users’ needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie). This study represents one viable method to assess the priority of Earth observations from the perspective of users. The list of critical Earth observation priorities from this study is a foundation for engagement between data providers and users in regard to observation priorities.

TI  - Future Earth Observation Strategy For Societal Benefits
PY  - 2005
AB  - This invited paper presents the future intelligent observing system (FIEOS) and event-driven earth observation concepts as well as their connections to societal benefits for both decision-makers and the general public. The elucidated linkage and flow of information from FIEOS to societal benefits is interoperable. With the envisioned FIEOS, this paper places an emphasis on (i) How to apply the FIEOS to increase the efficiency of monitoring natural disaster, to improve the natural disaster management, and to mitigate disasters through providing highly accurate, and reliable surveillance data for experts, analysts, and decision-makers; (ii) How to significantly increase and extend societal benefits to the future U.S. Earth observation application strategy in, for example, realtime response to time-critical events, and disastrous environmental monitoring. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of FIEOS to society benefit in the realms: (i) reducing loss of life and property from natural and human-induced disasters, (ii) improving human health and well-being, (iii) improving wealth forecasting, (iv) supporting sustainable agriculture, and (v) serving lay people.

AB  - The United States (U.S.) federal government provides imagery obtained by federally funded Earth Observation satellites typically at no cost. For many years Landsat was an exception to this trend, until 2008 when the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made Landsat data accessible via the internet for free. Substantial increases in downloads of Landsat imagery ensued and led to a rapid expansion of science and operational applications, serving government, private sector, and civil society. The Landsat program hence provides an example to space agencies worldwide on the value of open access for Earth Observation data and has spurred the adaption of similar policies globally, including the European Copernicus Program. Here, we describe important aspects of the Landsat free and open data policy and highlight the importance and continued relevance of this policy.

TI  - Benefits And Beneficiaries Of The Oklahoma Mesonet: A Multisectoral Ripple Effect Analysis
JO  - American Meteorological Society
PY  - 2017
AB  - Since the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s automated mesoscale weather station network) was established in 1994, it has served a number of diverse groups and provided public services to foster weather preparedness, education, and public safety, while also supporting decision-making in agricultural production and wildland fire management. With 121 monitoring stations across the state, the Oklahoma Mesonet has developed an array of technologies to observe a variety of atmospheric and soil variables in 5- to 30-min intervals. These consistent observations have been especially critical for predicting and preparing for extreme weather events like droughts, floods, ice storms, and severe convective storms as well as for development of value-added tools. The tools, outreach programs, and mesoscale data have been widely utilized by the general public, state decision-makers, public safety officials, K–12 community, agricultural sector, and researchers, thus generating wide societal and economic benefits to many groups. Based on practical application examples of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet, this paper analyzes both benefits generated by Oklahoma Mesonet information to the public and decision-makers and ripple effects (spreading amplified outcomes/implications) of those benefits in the short and long term. The paper further details ongoing and anticipated Oklahoma Mesonet innovations as a response to changing needs for weather-related information over time, especially as a result of technological developments and weather variability.

TI  - Economic Value Of Environmental And Weather Information For Agricultural Decisions – A Case Study For Oklahoma Mesonet
JO  - Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment
PY  - 2018
AB  - For the past 24 years, weather information and monitoring provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet (the state’s largest weather and environmental monitoring network) has been used by many farmers across the state to optimize their farm operations and improve profitability of agricultural production. Several research studies delineated advantages of Mesonet weather information for efficient agricultural decision-making. However, these studies are mainly qualitative or conceptual, while comprehensive quantitative research in this field is still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap by quantifying the value of weather information for Oklahoma farmers in all climate regions, based on profitability analysis, USDA NASS and agricultural output statistics, as well as crop budgets from the Oklahoma Extension Center. The results show that the cumulative economic benefits for agricultural production in Oklahoma from utilizing Mesonet information (assuming the profitability factor of 3.7% and with 73% of farmers applying Mesonet) amounted to $183.1 million in 2006–2014 (combining generated profits and prevented losses in agricultural production). Mesonet information was found to provide higher annual economic benefits in terms of prevented losses than additional production profits, especially in drought years. A regional analysis for Oklahoma climate regions revealed the highest cumulative benefits of Mesonet applications in the Southwest ($45.9 million), North Central region ($38.2 million), and in Panhandle ($34.5 million) in 2006–2014. Also, high temporal variations were found for all Oklahoma climate regions.This research is focused on the agricultural sector, while it also sets the baseline for a more holistic understanding of the economic value and benefits of weather information provided by the Oklahoma Mesonet that can further be applied to other sectors in the state.

AB  - Remotely sensed data can be used to understand and devise measures to address important global issues such as climate change, disaster and disease outbreak. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is one of the largest producer and gatekeeper of satellite earth observation (EO) data that plays a crucial role in ensuring that these resources are used for solving global societal problems. However, the extent of remote sensing application is highly disparate in different parts of the world. This paper provides a general overview of key societal applications that have been enabled globally with the use of EO data. It also summarizes the impact of various National Aeronautics and Space Administration-supported programs for promoting applications on the targeted beneficiary communities. The themes addressed here are land cover/land use mapping, carbon biomass assessment, food security, disaster management, water resources, ocean management and health and air quality. The paper also argues for capacity building that is crucial to building sustainable solutions when using EO data for science-based decision making.
