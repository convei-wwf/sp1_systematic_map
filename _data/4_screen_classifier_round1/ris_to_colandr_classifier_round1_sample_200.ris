TI  - Societal Need For Improved Understanding Of Climate Change, Anthropogenic Impacts, And Geo-Hazard Warning Drive Development Of Ocean Observatories In European Seas
AB  - Society's needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Barrier-Based Longitudinal Connectivity Index For Managing Urban Rivers
AB  - A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Water Body Extraction From Sentinel-2 Imagery With Deep Convolutional Networks And Pixelwise Category Transplantation
AB  - A common task in land-cover classification is water body extraction, wherein each pixel in an image is labelled as either water or background. Water body detection is integral to the field of urban hydrology, with applications ranging from early flood warning to water resource management. Although traditional index-based methods such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have been used to detect water bodies for decades, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have recently demonstrated promising results. However, training these networks requires access to large quantities of high-quality and accurately labelled data, which is often lacking in the field of remotely sensed imagery. Another challenge stems from the fact that the category of interest typically occupies only a small portion of an image and is thus grossly underrepresented in the data. We propose a novel approach to data augmentation-pixelwise category transplantation (PCT)-as a potential solution to both of these problems. Experimental results demonstrate PCT's ability to improve performance on a variety of models and datasets, achieving an average improvement of 0.749 mean intersection over union (mIoU). Moreover, PCT enables us to outperform the previous high score achieved on the same dataset without introducing a new model architecture. We also explore the suitability of several state-of-the-art segmentation models and loss functions on the task of water body extraction. Finally, we address the shortcomings of previous works by assessing each model on RGB, NIR, and multispectral features to ascertain the relative advantages of each approach. In particular, we find a significant benefit to the inclusion of multispectral bands, with such methods outperforming visible-spectrum models by an average of 4.193 mIoU.

TI  - A Framework For Assessment Of Flood Conditions Using Hydrological And Hydrodynamic Modeling Approach
AB  - River flooding has been triggering significant damage to lives and infrastructure and is a major worry all around the globe. To lessen these losses, proper planning and management methods need to be deployed. The purpose of this research is to fill a knowledge gap on the effects of reservoirs operation of the Idukki and Idamalyar to Periyar River Basin massive flooding. The proposed methodology is implemented on the Periyar River Basin located in Kerala, India, where severe flooding occurred during monsoon season in the year 2018. In this study, modelling technique has been used in two-step: (1) development of 1D physically based, distributed-parameter model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) to compute the stream flow and estimate the stream discharge at different outlet points; and (2) hybrid model is developed by linking SWAT with a well-known 2D hydrodynamic model (International River Interface Cooperative, iRIC) to display flood scenarios and to identify the flood-prone areas. The ArcSWAT user interface employed in the ArcGIS software was utilized to delineate the river basin. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated on daily and monthly basis at two gauge discharge stations, i.e., Neeleeswaram and Kalady. The statistical coefficients result obtained from SWAT model was in good agreement with the measured values for calibration and validation. The hybrid model simulation results compared with observed flood depth and remote sensing data demonstrated good capability of the model. Agreeable performances of computed results were observed in both flow fields and flood propagations. The result was compared with 2018 flood to check model accuracy and found to be satisfactory. The proposed framework can be utilized as an effective tool for efficient planning and management of natural disasters, such as flash floods. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - An Assessment Of Anthropogenic And Climatic Stressors On Estuaries Using A Spatio-Temporal Gis-Modelling Approach For Sustainability: Towamba Estuary, Southeastern Australia
AB  - Monitoring estuarine ecological-geomorphological dynamics has become a crucial aspect of studying the impacts of climate change and worldwide infrastructure development in coastal zones. Together, these factors have changed the natural eco-geomorphic processes that affect estuarine regimes and comprehensive modelling of coastal resources can assist managers to make appropriate decisions about their sustainable use. This study has utilised Towamba estuary (southeastern NSW, Australia), to demonstrate the value and priority of modelling estuarine dynamism as a measure of the rates and consequences of eco-geomorphic changes. This research employs several geoinformatic modelling approaches over time to investigate and assess how climate change and human activities have altered this estuarine eco-geomorphic setting. Multitemporal trend/change analysis of sediment delivery, shoreline positions and land cover, determined from fieldwork and GIS analysis of remote sensing datasets, shows significant spatio-temporal changes to the elevation and areal extent of sedimentary facies in the Towamba estuary over the past 65 years. Geomorphic growth (~ 2600 m2 annually) has stabilised the estuarine habitats, particularly within native vegetation, salt marsh and mangrove areas. Geomorphic changes have occurred because of a combination of sediment runoff from the mostly unmodified terrestrial catchment, nearshore processes (ocean dynamics) and human activities. The construction of GIS models, verified with water and sediment samples, can characterise physical processes and quantify changes within the estuarine ecosystem. Such robust models will allow resource managers to evaluate the potential effects of changes to the current coastal ecosystems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Distributional Implications Of Supply Constraints In Water Markets
AB  - In California, after three decades of water market development, volume of water traded in the market remains lower than desired. Total volume of water traded annually accounts for just around 2\%-5\% of total water used. Vast difference in the marginal values of water in agriculture and urban or environmental uses suggest that significant economic gains can be achieved by easing the barriers to trading water across sectors. This paper draws attention to the role of state and local policies in restricting water transfers. Using novel, purpose-built, satellite-mapped data of a sample of water-trading irrigation districts in California, this paper shows how districts' water transfer decisions are made in response to conflicting pressures of drought-induced high-water demand against the need to support the agricultural economy and the environment in water-exporting areas. The time period under study is 1991-2019, which spans the entire history of water market activity in California from inception to maturity, and helps illustrate the role of changing local and state policies on irrigation districts' water market participation. Despite policy-induced restrictions, this paper shows that sample irrigation districts are highly responsive to demand in water-buying areas, have increased the volume and frequency of water transfers, particularly in the last decade. This paper highlights important research and policy questions about the distribution of economic and environmental effects of water transfers in source area communities that could affect the future potential of water markets in easing structural and drought-induced water scarcity in California.

TI  - Vermont Global Warming Solutions Act: The Costs Of Inaction From Land Conversions
AB  - The Vermont (VT) Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA, 2020) sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets at 26\% below 2005 by 2025, 40\% below 1990 by 2030 and 80\% below 1990 by 2050 for energy-related emissions only. Vermont's omission of GHG emissions from land conversions could result in significant costs of inaction (COI), which could hinder the state's mitigation and adaptation plans and result in climate crisis-related risks (e.g., credit downgrade). Science-based spatio-temporal data of GHG emissions from soils because of land conversions can be integrated into the conceptual framework of "action" versus "inaction" to prevent GHG emissions. The application of soil information data and remote sensing analysis can identify the GHG emissions from land conversions, which can be expressed as "realized" social costs of "inaction". This study demonstrates the rapid assessment of the value of regulating ecosystems services (ES) from soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and total soil carbon (TSC) stocks, based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for VT by soil order and county using remote sensing and information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) databases. Classified land cover data for 2001 and 2016 were downloaded from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) website. These results provide accurate and quantitative spatio-temporal information about likely GHG emissions, which can be linked to VT's climate action plan. A failure to considerably reduce emissions from land conversions would increase climate change costs and potential legal consequences for VT and beyond its borders.

TI  - A Bayesian Game Theoretic Based Bidding Strategy For Demand Response Aggregators In Electricity Markets
AB  - In recent years, significant development in smart metering and remote sensing systems in the electricity industry, especially on the side of consumers, it has made in implementation demand response programs in peak periods possible. The present study aims to present a game theoretical approach to the optimal bidding strategies for demand response (DR) aggregators in deregulated energy market. This model is based on the customer benefit function and price elasticity so that an economic responsive load model is applied to DR implementation. In this paper, the interaction between a system operator and aggregators in a deregulated market is modeled in this paper, where DR aggregator provides DR service to the system operator. It is assumed that a system operator collects bids from DR aggregators and determines each aggregator share in the demand response programs by maximizing its revenue function, and also, offers rewards to DR aggregators to reach this goal. On the other hand, DR aggregators compete together to offer their DR services to the network operator and in this way provide compensation for customers. The competition between DR aggregator participants is modeled as a noncooperative game considering incomplete information. This game is solved using the Nash equilibrium idea. By the implementing the proposed method, the operator's profit rises up 7 percent

TI  - Effects Of Land Cover On Ecosystem Services In Tanzania: A Spatial Assessment Of Soil Organic Carbon
AB  - The multiple ecosystem services provided by healthy soil are well known and include soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change, a medium for plant and agricultural production and regulating the hydrologic cycle. Despite the wide recognition of the importance of these services, drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics across various land uses in East Africa are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were threefold: to quantify SOC stocks across Tanzania; assess the effect of land cover and erosion on SOC; and investigate the relationship between inherent and dynamic soil properties under diverse land uses. The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was used to assess the variability of ecological metrics at different spatial scales. SOC was quantified within and between different land cover types (forest, woodland, shrubland, grassland and cropland) in Tanzania. A total of 2052 soil samples from 1082-1000m2 plots were collected from seven 100-km2 sentinel sites in 2010. Composite soil samples were collected at each plot from two depths (0-20 and 20-50cm) and cumulative soil mass samples were collected to 100cm. Soil samples were analyzed using a combination of traditional analytical laboratory methods and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). Model performance of MIR spectral predictions for carbon was good, with an R2 of >0.95 and RMSEP of 4.3gkg-1, when using an independent validation datasets. Woodland and cropland were the most frequently occurring vegetation structure types in the sampled sites, with 388 and 246 plots, respectively. Average topsoil OC (and range) was 12.4 (1.5-81.4) gCkg-1 (n=1082) and average subsoil OC (and range) was 7.3 (0.64-53.8) gCkg-1 (n=970) for the seven sites. Forested plots had the highest mean topsoil organic carbon concentrations (17.3gCkg-1) followed by cropland (13.3gCkg-1), for all sites included in the study, but with high levels of variability between sites. Soil mass at 30cm was measured and these data were used to calculate carbon stocks for the different land cover types. An approach based on remote sensing was explored for the mapping of SOC stocks at 30cm for Tanzania using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from 2012. Results indicate that the use of image reflectance for the mapping of SOC stocks has promising potential, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.81 and RMSEP values from 0.90 to 1.03kgm-2 for the three validation datasets. There is high utility of these maps for strategic land management interventions that prioritize ecosystem services. © 2015.

TI  - Tissue-Level Biomarkers In Sentinel Slugs As Cost-Effective Tools To Assess Metal Pollution In Soils
AB  - In previous laboratory experiments, slugs were shown to be sensitive to metal pollution. Therefore, they might be invaluable instruments for biological assessment of soil pollution. The present investigation was carried out to validate previous laboratory results in a field study. Slugs were collected from an abandoned copper mine (Parys mountain top, PMT), from a site 7 km away from the mine (Parys mountain bottom, PMB), and from a clean site (Snowdonia Cwm Idwal, SCI) in Wales in early July 1994. Whole soft body and digestive gland Cd, Cu, and Zn concentrations were measured by means of atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The digestive gland was the main tissue for metal accumulation, with significant differences in tissue metal levels between samples from different sites. PMB presented the highest Cd and Zn levels and the highest Cu levels were found at PMT. In addition, metals were demonstrated in situ by autometallography as black silver deposits (BSD) on histological sections of digestive gland tissue. The extent of BSD within lysosomes of digestive cells was closely related to metal levels determined by AAS. Histochemistry revealed that Ca metabolism and structural and reserve connective tissues might be altered in slugs living in metal-polluted soils. Finally, tissue-level biomarkers of biological effect [mean epithelial thickness (MET), mean diverticular radius (MDR), mean luminal radius (MLR), MET/MDR and MLR/MET] were quantified by image analysis of digestive gland histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. MET and MDR values of slugs collected from SCI were high, while slugs from PMB presented low MLR/MET associated with environmental stress induced by metal exposure. We conclude that exposure and effect biomarkers recorded in sentinel slugs could be sensitive, quick, and cheap indices of metal pollution in soils. A Slug Watch monitoring program could be developed similar to the Mussel Watch program, which is currently applied to assess environmental quality in coastal and estuarine areas.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Valuation Of A Natural Reserve Region For Sustainable Management Of Natural Resources
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is extremely important for providing essential ecosystem services, which are crucial for subsistence and human well-being. Using time-series satellite data products and different unit values, the spatially explicit Ecosystem Service Value (ESV) of six eco-regions of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India, has been calculated for four reference years, viz. 1973, 1988, 2002 and 2013. The maximum ESV (million US\$ year(1)) is provided by the mangrove forest (2292-44468), followed by water surface (65-4244), cropland (26-3938), and sparse vegetation cover (0-326). The total ESV (million US\$ year(1)) of Sundarbans is estimated to be 16629.5, 20175.7, 19733.4, and 16761.3 for 1973, 1988, 2002, and 2013 respectively. The regulation of gas and climate, raw material production, and cultural ecosystem services are entirely dependent on the mangrove ecosystem, while the waste treatment, cultural, and water regulation services are found to be highly sensitive to the changes in water bodies. The food production and biodiversity services exhibiting higher sensitivity to the changes in cropland, water regulation and soil formation and retention services show higher sensitivity to the changes in mixed vegetation cover. The current study has thoroughly evaluated the sensitivity and response behavior of six ecoregions of Sundarbans. The outcome of this study will enable the decision-makers, planners, as well as researchers to adopt necessary action plans for strengthening and protecting the natural resources of this biosphere reserve.

TI  - Evidence Supporting The Value Of Surgical Procedures: Can We Do Better?
AB  - There is an acknowledged need for higher-quality evidence to quantify the benefit of surgical procedures, yet not enough has been done to improve the evidence base. This lack of evidence can prevent fully informed decision-making, lead to unnecessary or even harmful treatment, and contribute to wasteful expenditures of scare health care resources. Barriers to evidence generation include not only the long-recognized technical difficulties and ethical challenges of conducting randomized surgical trials, but also legal challenges that limit incentives to conduct surgical research as well as market-based challenges that make it difficult for those funding surgical research to recoup investment costs. These legal and market dynamics differ substantially from those surrounding new drug or device development. Nevertheless, obstacles could be overcome and overall expenditures could be reduced if a share of federal health care agency budgets were reallocated to generating randomized trial data, standardizing outcome measures, and conducting observational studies analogous to those that have been facilitated for drugs via the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative. Until better quality evidence is available, ethical principles require adequate disclosure of the limited evidence base supporting current surgical procedures.

TI  - Flood Effects On An Alaskan Stream Restoration Project: The Value Of Long-Term Monitoring
AB  - On a nationwide basis, few stream restoration projects have long-term programs in place to monitor the effects of floods on channel and floodplain configuration and floodplain vegetation, but long-term and event-based monitoring is required to measure the effects of these stochastic events and to use the knowledge for adaptive management and the design of future projects. This paper describes a long-term monitoring effort (15 years) on a stream restoration project in Glen Creek in Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. The stream channel and floodplain of Glen Creek had been severely degraded over a period of 80 years by placer mining for gold, which left many reaches with unstable and incised streambeds without functioning vegetated floodplains. The objectives of the original project, initiated in 1991, were to develop and test methods for the hydraulic design of channel and floodplain morphology and for floodplain stabilization and riparian habitat recovery, and to conduct research and monitoring to provide information for future projects in similar degraded watersheds. Monitoring methods included surveyed stream cross-sections, vegetation plots, and aerial, ground, and satellite photos. In this paper we address the immediate and outlying effects of a 25-year flood on the stream and floodplain geometry and riparian vegetation. The long-term monitoring revealed that significant channel widening occurred following the flood, likely caused by excessive upstream sediment loading and the fairly slow development of floodplain vegetation in this climate. Our results illustrated design flaws, particularly in regard to identification and analysis of sediment sources and the dominant processes of channel adjustment. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.

TI  - Satellite Altimetry For Ocean And Coastal Applications: A Review
AB  - More than 30 years of observations from an international suite of satellite altimeter missions continue to provide key data enabling research discoveries and a broad spectrum of operational and user-driven applications. These missions were designed to advance technologies and to answer scientific questions about ocean circulation, ocean heat content, and the impact of climate change on these Earth systems. They are also a valuable resource for the operational needs of oceanographic and weather forecasting agencies that provide information to shipping and fishing vessels and offshore operations for route optimization and safety, as well as for other decision makers in coastal, water resources, and disaster management fields. This time series of precise measurements of ocean surface topography (OST)-the "hills and valleys" of the ocean surface-reveals changes in ocean dynamic topography, tracks sea level variations at global to regional scales, and provides key information about ocean trends reflecting climate change in our warming world. Advancing technologies in new satellite systems allows measurements at higher spatial resolution ever closer to coastlines, where the impacts of storms, waves, and sea level rise on coastal communities and infrastructure are manifest. We review some collaborative efforts of international space agencies, including NASA, CNES, NOAA, ESA, and EUMETSAT, which have contributed to a collection of use cases of satellite altimetry in operational and decision-support contexts. The extended time series of ocean surface topography measurements obtained from these satellite altimeter missions, along with advances in satellite technology that have allowed for higher resolution measurements nearer to coasts, has enabled a range of such applications. The resulting body of knowledge and data enables better assessments of storms, waves, and sea level rise impacts on coastal communities and infrastructure amongst other key contributions for societal benefit. Although not exhaustive, this review provides a broad overview with specific examples of the important role of satellite altimetry in ocean and coastal applications, thus justifying the significant resource contributions made by international space agencies in the development of these missions.

TI  - Rapid Estimation Of Canopy Nitrogen Of Cereal Crops At Paddock Scale Using A Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index
AB  - Rising nitrogen (N) fertiliser costs and concerns over environmental impacts have emphasized the need for rapid, non-destructive, paddock-scale tools to support optimal management of N fertiliser in cereal crops. Remote sensing of canopy reflectance is one approach to address the information needed to guide N applications. One remote sensing vegetation index, the Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index (CCCI) was developed to address issues of confounding effects of biomass and chlorophyll concentration, and Fitzgerald et al. (2010) linked the CCCI to the Canopy Nitrogen Index (CNI), a scaled index of the plant N. In the research presented here, we extend the work by Fitzgerald et al. (2010) and Cammarano et al. (2011) to whole paddocks with ground-based, airborne and satellite imagery. The methodology was applied to 11 datasets using multispectral cameras deployed on ground-based and airborne platforms, and to satellite imagery. The previously published relationship between CNI and CCCI was applied to the CCCI and biomass measurements from these new datasets to estimate CNI. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.70. A regression using the means from each dataset produced an r(2) of 0.60, and a standard error of 0.82 (\%N). Exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.87 and reduced the standard error to 0.45 (\%N). A crop model (APSIM v7) was used to simulate above ground dry matter to substitute for measured biomass, and plant N was determined from the measured CCCI and simulated biomass. Regression of the measured on estimated plant N values resulted in r(2) values for individual datasets ranging from 0 to 0.49. The regression using the averages from each dataset was not significant (F-pr >0.10); however, exclusion of the airborne platform data increased the r(2) to 0.89 and reduced the standard error to 0.42 (\%N). To demonstrate the utility of the methods, simulated biomass values coupled with CNI estimated from RapidEye imagery were used to generate paddock maps of plant N. While the agreement between measured and estimated plant N at the paddock scales is not as close as the previous work done at small plot scales, the method shows promise, particularly if biomass can be estimated through modeling or non-destructive measures.

TI  - Annington Versus Deutsche Annington: Private Equity And Housing In The Anglo-Saxon And Rhenish Contexts
AB  - Under the Rhenish model of capitalism the interests of other stake-holders than shareholders are essential to the interests of the firm. However, Rhenish institutions in Germany have been changing. In the housing sector, many organizations that promoted the provision of affordable housing are currently managed by private equity firms promoting shareholders' interests. This paper presents a dual case study on two housing providers: Annington in the UK, and Deutsche Annington in Germany which were owned by the same private equity investor, Terra Firma. The paper - based on this analysis of a single approach to the management of two comparable firms in the Rhenish and Anglo-Saxon contexts - considers the question of whether the Rhenish model is being swept away by the shareholders revolution. The paper concludes that this is not the case and that certain differences between these cases reflect the continuing differences between the Anglo-Saxon and Rhenish models of capitalism.

TI  - Combining Hyper-Resolution Land Surface Modeling With Smap Brightness Temperatures To Obtain 30-M Soil Moisture Estimates
AB  - Accurate and detailed soil moisture information is essential for, among other things, irrigation, drought and flood prediction, water resources management, and field-scale (i.e., tens of m) decision making. Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales. Our results highlight the value of hyper-resolution modeling to bridge the gap between coarse-scale satellite retrievals and field-scale hydrological applications.

TI  - Long-Term Spatiotemporal Variability In High Andean Wetlands In Northern Chile
AB  - High Andean wetlands of the elevated plateaus of the Andes Mountains of Chile, Argentina, Perú and Bolivia are true oases that sustain life in this arid region. Despite their ecological value, they have been rarely studied and are vulnerable to climate change and human activities that require groundwater resources. One such activity that may be intensified in the near future is mining for nonmetallic minerals such as lithium, whose worldwide demand is expected to increase with the rise of electric vehicles that need batteries. To determine a baseline of the natural dynamics of these systems, which allows sustainable management, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wetlands. In this article, we studied the temporal and spatial dynamics of high Andean wetlands of Chile, with the aim of identifying the key processes that govern their dynamics. To do this, we used time series of Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 to study 10 high Andean wetlands. Furthermore, to characterize the climate variability in these systems, we studied the long-term relation between the changes in water and vegetation areas with rainfall and evaporation variability. It was found that the groundwater reservoir plays a key role in sustaining the high Andean wetlands. Wet years with a period of occurrence of 20–30 years are the years in which the groundwater reservoirs are actually recharged, and in between wet years, the groundwater reservoirs gradually release the water that sustains the aquatic ecosystems. Hence, groundwater exploitation should be carefully designed from a long-term perspective, as groundwater levels could take decades to recover. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - Monthly, Seasonal, And Annual Variations Of Precipitation And Runoff Over West And Central Africa Using Remote Sensing And Climate Reanalysis
AB  - Precipitation and runoff variability over West and Central Africa is the major challenge of water resource management, which drives a range of socio-economic issues. Storm water runoff poses serious environmental problems and public health issues in these regions. We use descriptive statistics in order to analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual runoff and precipitation using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5) datasets, respectively for the period 1981-2021. Based on the results, the climate of the western zone is different from that of the equatorial zone, where runoff is persistently high throughout the year. Monthly and seasonal runoff show that June, July and August have higher runoff values. The high values for these three months correspond to the rainy season in these regions. Trends of the runoff and precipitation are detected using Mann-Kendall test. Apart of the coastal zones where trends are positive, trends in runoff are mostly negative throughout the Western and Central African regions. The result will benefit our understanding of the increasing suffrage of the local population from severe floods, landslides and soil erosion over this region.

TI  - Physical Flood Vulnerability Mapping Applying Geospatial Techniques In Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan
AB  - Flooding has been increasing since 2004 in Japan due to localized heavy rainfall and geographical conditions. Determining areas vulnerable to flooding as one element of flood hazard maps related to disaster management for urban development is necessary. This research integrated Remote Sensing data, the Geography Information System (GIS) method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculation to determine the physical flood-vulnerable area in Okazaki City. We developed this research by applying data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) to generate the slope map and drainage density; AMEDAS (Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System) from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to generate the rainfall data; Soil map from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) data; and Sentinel-2 imagery to generate the land cover map. We applied the AHP calculation for weighting pairwise the parameters by comparing five iterations of the normalized matrix. We utilized the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS to run the pairwise comparison to adjudicate the distribution of flooding according to the AHP procedure. The percentage of relative weight was slope (43\%), drainage density (20\%), rainfall intensity (17\%), then both infiltration rate and land cover (10\%). The consistency value was reasonable: consistency index (CI-0.007) and consistency ratio (CR-0.6\%). We generated high accuracy for flood vulnerability prediction; 0.88 for Probability of Detection (POD), 0.28 for Probability of False Detection (POFD), 0.44 for Critical Success Index (CSI), 1.9 for Bias, and 95 of Area under Curve (AUC). The flood vulnerability was matched to the flood inundation survey of Okazaki City in August 2008 and indicated an excellent Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC).

TI  - Rapidly Changing Emissions Drove Substantial Surface And Tropospheric Ozone Increases Over Southeast Asia
AB  - We combined observations and simulations to assess tropospheric ozone trends over Southeast Asia from 2005 to 2016. Multi-platform observations showed that surface ozone had been increasing at rates of 0.7-1.2 ppb year(-1) over the Peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA) and 0.2-0.4 ppb year(-1) over the Maritime Continents (MC); tropospheric ozone columns had been rising throughout Southeast Asia by 0.21-0.35 DU year(-1). These observed ozone trends were better reproduced by simulations driven with satellite-constrained NOx emissions, indicating that NOx emission growths may have been underestimated for the PSEA and overestimated for the MC in the Community Emissions Data System and the Global Fire Emissions Data set. The surface ozone increases over the PSEA were driven by rapidly growing local emissions, wherein fire emission growths may still be underestimated even with satellite constraints. We highlighted the need for better quantifying Southeast Asian emissions to benefit air quality management.

TI  - A Statistical Approach To Mapping Flood Susceptibility In The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region
AB  - Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between different region types; for each region flood risk factors were extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood susceptibility increased by over 200\% between the rural and urban regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk (80-100\%) and high risk (60-80\%) were located outside of the SFHA and included several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood susceptibility. Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding. Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1, respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope, land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor. An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk factor's influence on flooding in a subregion. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion. The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20\%), low risk (20-40\%), medium risk (40-60\%), high risk (60-80\%), and very high risk (80-100\%). It was observed that several areas classified as very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require additional flood risk mitigation.

TI  - Mangrove Health Index As Part Of Sustainable Management In Mangrove Ecosystem At Karimunjawa National Marine Park Indonesia
AB  - Background: Monitoring the health of marine ecosystems is an integral part of sustainable management of the ecosystems including mangrove. Distribution and diversity of mangrove ecosystems are two important parameters in Mangrove Health Index (MHI). The index analyses value of mangrove density, diversity, index of similarity and the number of mangrove species. Method: This study investigates mangrove distribution and diversity. Mangrove distribution maps were prepared using Satellite imagery GEO-EYE. Ecological surveys to analyze the diversity of mangrove at five locations, namely Legon Cilik, Legon Gede, Kemujan, Karimunjawa and Menjangan Besar. MHI was calculated by assigning weight for each parameter, multiplied by each parameter score and then summing all of multiplication results value. Results: Satellite image interpretation results showed that mangroves were found at island of Karimunjawa, Menjangan Besar and Sintok. In total, 22 mangrove species identified, 12 species were true mangroves and the rests were mangrove associates. Rhizophora apiculata dominates three of nine survey locations, while Rhizophora stylosa was the dominant species in two of nine locations and the rest are dominated by Ceriops tagal, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia alba. Density of mangrove in the category of tree, mangrove average density ranging from medium to high, from 230 to 1060 ind/ha. In the category of sapling, dominant mangrove species was relatively diverse. In general, the Shannon diversity index was low, it means that mangrove diversity is low, it means that mangrove diversity is low. Mangrove in Legon Cilik 1 and Menjangan Besar had the highest Shannon diversity index (1,09) while Karimun 1 were the lowest (0,18). Conclusion: The value of MHI at Karimunjawa was 200, which is in the medium category. The results suggest that there is a need to improve MHI as part of sustainable management based on the distribution and diversity of mangrove.

TI  - Multi-Scale Model Analysis Of Boundary Layer Ozone Over East Asia
AB  - This study employs the regional Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to examine seasonal and diurnal variations of boundary layer ozone (O-3) over East Asia. We evaluate the response of model simulations of boundary layer O-3 to the choice of chemical mechanisms, meteorological fields, boundary conditions, and model resolutions. Data obtained from surface stations, aircraft measurements, and satellites are used to advance understanding of O-3 chemistry and mechanisms over East Asia and evaluate how well the model represents the observed features. Satellite measurements and model simulations of summertime rainfall are used to assess the impact of the Asian monsoon on O-3 production. Our results suggest that summertime O-3 over Central Eastern China is highly sensitive to cloud cover and monsoonal rainfall over this region. Thus, accurate simulation of the East Asia summer monsoon is critical to model analysis of atmospheric chemistry over China. Examination of hourly summertime O-3 mixing ratios from sites in Japan confirms the important role of diurnal boundary layer fluctuations in controlling ground-level O-3. By comparing five different model configurations with observations at six sites, the specific mechanisms responsible for model behavior are identified and discussed. In particular, vertical mixing, urban chemistry, and dry deposition depending on boundary layer height strongly affect model ability to capture observed behavior. Central Eastern China appears to be the most sensitive region in our study to the choice of chemical mechanisms. Evaluation with TRACE-P aircraft measurements reveals that neither the CB4 nor the SAPRC99 mechanisms consistently capture observed behavior of key photochemical oxidants in springtime. However, our analysis finds that SAPRC99 performs somewhat better in simulating mixing ratios of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate) at flight altitudes below 1 km. The high level of uncertainty associated with O-3 production in Central Eastern China poses a major problem for regional air quality management. This highly polluted, densely populated region would greatly benefit from comprehensive air quality monitoring and the development of model chemical mechanisms appropriate to this unique atmospheric environment.

TI  - A Comparison Of Dem-Based Indexes For Targeting The Placement Of Vegetative Buffers In Agricultural Watersheds
AB  - Targeted placement of vegetative buffers may increase their effectiveness for improving water quality in agricultural watersheds. The use of digital elevation models (DEMs) enables precise mapping of runoff pathways for identifying where greater runoff loads can be intercepted and treated with buffers. Five different DEM-based targeting indexes were compared and contrasted for the degree to which they identify similar locations in watersheds: Flow Accumulation {[}S.K. Jenson and J.O. Domingue (1988). Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 54:1593], Wetness Index {[}I.D. Moore, R.B. Grayson, and A.R. Ladson (1991). Hydrological Processes 5:3], Topographic Index {[}M.T. Walter, T.S. Steenhuis, V.K. Mehta, D. Thongs, M. Zion, and E. Schneiderman (2002). Hydrological Processes 16: 2041], and the Water Inflow and Sediment Retention Indexes {[}M. G. Dosskey, Z. Qiu, M.J. Helmers, and D.E. Eisenhauer (2011b). Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 66: 362]. The indexes were applied in two different watersheds, one in New Jersey and one in Missouri. Results showed that they all tend to target similar locations in both watersheds which traces to the importance of larger contributing area to the rankings by each index. Disagreement among indexes traces to other variables which enable more accurate targeting under particular hydrologic circumstances. Effective use of these indexes poses special challenges, including selecting an index that better describes the hydrologic circumstances in a watershed and is simple enough to use, ensuring the accuracy of the DEM, and determining a maximum index value for the appropriateness of vegetative buffers. When properly applied, each index can provide a standardized basis and effective spatial resolution for targeting buffer placement in watersheds.

TI  - Effects Of Land Use Transitions Due To Rapid Urbanization On Ecosystem Services: Implications For Urban Planning In The New Developing Area Of China
AB  - With the rapid development of Chinese economy, many negative effects of land use transitions under the pressure of rapid urbanization on local ecological system and environment have occurred. This paper examines the dynamic patterns of land use in Tianjin Binhai New Area experienced rapid urbanization, using high-resolution Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) data in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2010, and socioeconomic data from both research institutes and government departments, and assesses the changes of ecosystem services value (ESV) by drawing a connection between the observed land use dynamics and the evaluation of ESV, based on the latest research of Costanza et al. (2014) and some revisions adapted to the situation of China. The outcomes indicated that, during the period 1985-2010, ESV of the study area decreased by 25.9\%, from 12,194 to 9037 billion RMBY, due to the losses of large quantities of ecological land (e.g., farmland and water body) to construction land. Then, some of the major implications for improving the urban planning of Tianjin Binhai New Area were discussed. The authors argue that it is fundamental to meet the demand of construction land for socio-economic development, meanwhile protect regional ecosystem services function and maintain its stability; only in this way can the new developing area of China realize the sustainable use of ecological resources in the process of rapid urbanization, as well as the integration of economic, social and ecological benefits.

TI  - Development Of A Data Management-System For The Kuwait Oil Fire Atmospheric Measurement Program
AB  - Following the onset of the Kuwait oil fires in early 1991, numerous efforts to monitor and estimate the environmental effects of the fires were initiated. These efforts produced a diverse set of atmospheric data from airborne, surface-based, and satellite platforms. Organizers of the experiments, including the World Meteorological Organization, quickly recognized the value of collecting all data into a central archive. This paper describes the development of that archive. Basic requirements for the archive were that it contain all pertinent datasets, including detailed documentation about each, and provide easy access to all interested researchers. The requirements were met by developing a database management system that contains a catalog of the data inventory and a facility to order specific datasets. A graphical user interface provides access to the database. In addition to the basic capability of searching the data inventory, the system has a number of other features, including a visual catalog of satellite images, a bibliography of relevant publications, and an extensive metadata collection describing the datasets. The system is accessible from the Internet or telephone/modem from a variety of terminal types, making it available to virtually anyone with a computer. Researchers from around the world have successfully used the system.

TI  - Machine Learning As A Strategic Tool For Helping Cocoa Farmers In Cote D'ivoire
AB  - Machine learning can be used for social good. The employment of artificial intelligence in smart agriculture has many benefits for the environment: it helps small farmers (at a local scale) and policymakers and cooperatives (at regional scale) to take valid and coordinated countermeasures to combat climate change. This article discusses how artificial intelligence in agriculture can help to reduce costs, especially in developing countries such as Cote d'Ivoire, employing only low-cost or open-source tools, from hardware to software and open data. We developed machine learning models for two tasks: the first is improving agricultural farming cultivation, and the second is water management. For the first task, we used deep neural networks (YOLOv5m) to detect healthy plants and pods of cocoa and damaged ones only using mobile phone images. The results confirm it is possible to distinguish well the healthy from damaged ones. For actions at a larger scale, the second task proposes the analysis of remote sensors, coming from the GRACE NASA Mission and ERA5, produced by the Copernicus climate change service. A new deep neural network architecture (CIWA-net) is proposed with a U-Net-like architecture, aiming to forecast the total water storage anomalies. The model quality is compared to a vanilla convolutional neural network.

TI  - Impact Of The Urbanisation Process In The Availability Of Ecosystem Services In A Tropical Ecotone Area
AB  - Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - The Sentinel-3 Olci Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (Otci): Algorithm Improvements, Spatiotemporal Consistency And Continuity With The Meris Archive
AB  - The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on-board Sentinel-3 (2016-present) was designed with similar mechanical and optical characteristics to the Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) (2002-2012) to ensure continuity with a number of land and marine biophysical products. The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R-2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R-2>0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD similar to 0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years.

TI  - Using Gis To Develop A Model For Forest Fire Risk Mapping
AB  - Forests are the most beautiful natural resources around the world and play a pivotal role in preserving environmental balance. An important measure taken for managing and protecting forest areas as well as for decreasing the potential damages caused by the fire is the detection of regions susceptible to forest fire through forest fire risk mapping with different models and methods. In recent years, a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) have been successfully applied in the production of forest fire risk maps. In this study, GIS-based analytical network process as MCDA method was employed in order to provide the fire risk map of Noshahr Forests (North Iran) using slope, slope aspect, altitude, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index, annual rainfall, annual temperature, distance to settlements, and distance to road as input data. Furthermore, to prepare the map of the distribution of occurred fires, MODIS fire product and wide-field observations were used. Thereafter, each of these subcriteria of the utilized factors was standardized according to their significance in a forest fire and then with the extracted coefficients in the analytical network process model merged in ArcGIS software. Finally, the fire risk map was generated. Evaluation of the results obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the designed model has good accuracy with a value of under curve area of 0.783. According to the map prepared, 57.45% of the study area (1034.41 km2) is located in the high and very high-risk classes. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.

TI  - Spatial Coverage Of Monitoring Networks: A Climate Observing System Simulation Experiment
AB  - Observing systems consisting of a finite number of in situ monitoring stations can provide high-quality measurements with the ability to quality assure both the instruments and the data but offer limited information over larger geographic areas. This paper quantifies the spatial coverage represented by a finite set of monitoring stations by using global data-data that are possibly of lower resolution and quality. For illustration purposes, merged satellite temperature data from Microwave Sounding Units are used to estimate the representativeness of the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN). While many metrics exist for evaluating the representativeness of a site, the ability to have highly accurate monthly averaged data is essential for both trend detection and climatology evaluation. The calculated correlations of the monthly averaged upper-troposphere satellite-derived temperatures over the GRUAN stations with all other pixels around the globe show that the current 9 certified GRUAN stations have moderate correlations (r >= 0.7) for approximately 10\% of the earth, but an expanded network incorporating another 15 stations would result in moderate correlations for just over 60\% of the earth. This analysis indicates that the value of additional stations can be quantified by using historical, satellite, or model data and can be used to reveal critical gaps in current monitoring capabilities. Evaluating the value of potential additional stations and prioritizing their initiation can optimize networks. The expansion of networks can be evaluated in a manner that allows for optimal benefit on the basis of optimization theory and economic analyses.

TI  - A Sensor Web Architecture For Integrating Smart Oceanographic Sensors Into The Semantic Sensor Web
AB  - Effective ocean and coastal data management are needed to manage marine ecosystem health. Past ocean and coastal data management systems were often very specific to a particular application and region, but this focused approach often lacks real-time data and sharing/interoperating capability. The challenge for the ocean observing community is to devise standards and practices that enable integration of data from sensors across devices, manufacturers, users, and domains to enable new types of application and services that facilitate much more comprehensive understanding and analyses of marine ecosystem. A given kind of sensor may be deployed on various platforms such as floats, gliders or moorings, and thus must be integrated with different operation. and data management systems. Simplifying the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems would benefit system operators and is important for the broader application of diverse sensors. This paper describes a geospatial "sensor web" architecture developed by the "NeXOS" project for ocean and coastal data management, based on the concepts of spatial data infrastructure and the Sensor Web Enablement framework of the Open Geospatial Consortium. This approach reduces the effort to propagate data front deployed sensors to users. To support the realization of the proposed Next generation Ocean Sensors (NeXOS) architecture. hardware and software specifications for a Smart Electronic Interface for Sensors and Instruments (SEISI) are described. SEISI specifies small lower-power electronics. minimal operating system, and standards-basedresearch software to enable web-based sharing, discover, exchange, and processing of sensor observations as well as operation of sensor devices. An experimental scenario is presented in which sensor data front a low-power glider with low-bandwidth intermittent satellite communications is integrated into the geospatial sensor web using the NeXOS architecture.

TI  - Small Range And Distinct Distribution In A Satellite Breeding Colony Of The Critically Endangered Waved Albatross
AB  - To determine the proximate consequences of the limited breeding distribution of the critically endangered Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata), we present continuous breeding season GPS tracks highlighting differences in behaviour, destinations, and distances travelled between three distinct colonies: two in Galapagos and one closer to the South American continent on Isla de la Plata, where a small number of pairs nest. Accelerometer data paired with GPS locations allowed operational classifications of Waved Albatross behaviour. All birds from Galapagos travelled eastward to the continental shelf and foraged southward along the Peruvian coast. Birds from Isla de la Plata made more and shorter foraging trips and used habitat north of the destinations of Galapagos birds. La Plata birds foraged in areas through which Galapagos birds commuted, and had slower average flight speeds and shorter commutes. Overall, albatrosses from La Plata might operate under a consistently lower return but they also incur lower costs compared to birds from Galapagos, which take fewer trips involving longer time investment. Galapagos birds may be able to forage more effectively based on more abundant or more profitable food patches in those highly productive areas. Foraging destinations of birds from the two Galapagos colonies were similar and overlapped areas that presented localized mortality risk from artisanal fisheries in previous years. This study, performed across the species' breeding range, reveals the different foraging distribution of La Plata albatrosses and the potential conservation value of this small colony in terms of maintenance of spatial diversity and behavioural plasticity.

AB  - The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9 t ha(-1)), contributing 65 \% of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1 t ha(-1)) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1 t ha(-1), and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314 x 10(3) kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices. This model will be integrated with World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies methods to support decision-making in that watershed, and it will involve collaboration with both local people and governmental institutions.

TI  - A Survey Of Blockchain-Based Strategies For Healthcare
AB  - Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons. © 2020 ACM.

TI  - Forest Burned Area Detection Using A Novel Spectral Index Based On Multi-Objective Optimization
AB  - Forest fires cause environmental and economic damage, destroy large areas of land and displace entire communities. Accurate extraction of fire-affected areas is of vital importance to support post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact of fires. In this paper, an analytical burned area index, called ABAI, was proposed to map burned areas from the newly launched Sentinel-2 images. The innovation of this method is to separate the fire scars from other typical land covers by formulating different objective functions, which involved three main components: First, spectral differences between the burned land and other land covers were characterized by analyzing the spectral features of the existing burned area indices. Then, for each type of land cover, we formed an objective function by linear combination of bands with the values of band ratios. Second, all the objective functions and possible constraints were formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and then it was solved using a linear programming approach. Finally, the ABAI spectral index was achieved with the optimizing coefficients derived from the multi-objective problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral index, three experimental datasets, clipped from Sentinel-2 images at different places, were tested and compared with baseline indices, such as normalized burned area (NBR) and burned area index (BAI) methods. Experimental results demonstrated that the injection of a green band to the spectral index has led to good applicability in burned area detection, where the ABAI can avoid most of the confusion presented by shadows or shallow water. Compared to other burned area indices, the proposed ABAI achieved the best classification accuracy, with the overall accuracy being over 90\%. Visually, our approach significantly outperforms other spectral indexed methods, especially in confused areas covered by water bodies and shadows.

TI  - Predicting Breeding Habitat For Amphibians: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Across Yellowstone National Park
AB  - The ability to predict amphibian breeding across landscapes is important for informing land management decisions and helping biologists better understand and remediate factors contributing to declines in amphibian populations. We built geospatial models of likely breeding habitats for each of four amphibian species that breed in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We used field data collected in 2000-2002 from 497 sites among 16 basins and predictor variables from geospatial models produced from remotely sensed data (e. g., digital elevation model, complex topographic index, landform data, wetland probability, and vegetative cover). Except for 31 sites in one basin that were surveyed in both 2000 and 2002, all sites were surveyed once. We used polytomous regression to build statistical models for each species of amphibian from (1) field survey site data only, (2) field data combined with data from geospatial models, and (3) data from geospatial models only. Based on measures of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores, models of the second type best explained likely breeding habitat because they contained the most information (ROC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88). However, models of the third type could be applied to the entire YNP landscape and produced maps that could be verified with reserve field data. Accuracy rates for models built for single years were highly variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.78. Accuracy rates for models built with data combined from multiple years were higher and less variable, ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Combining results from the geospatial multiyear models yielded maps of "core" breeding areas (areas with high probability values for all three years) surrounded by areas that scored high for only one or two years, providing an estimate of variability among years. Such information can highlight landscape options for amphibian conservation. For example, our models identify alternative areas that could be protected for each species, including 6828-10 764 ha for tiger salamanders, 971-3017 ha for western toads, 4732-16 696 ha for boreal chorus frogs, and 4940-19 690 ha for Columbia spotted frogs.

TI  - Tempo-Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment From The Perspective Of Human Engineering Activity
AB  - The expansion of mountainous urban areas and road networks can influence the terrain, vegetation, and material characteristics, thereby altering the susceptibility of landslides. Understanding the relationship between human engineering activities and landslide occurrence is of great significance for both landslide prevention and land resource management. In this study, an analysis was conducted on the landslide caused by Typhoon Megi in 2016. A representative mountainous area along the eastern coast of China-characterized by urban development, deforestation, and severe road expansion-was used to analyze the spatial distribution of landslides. For this purpose, high-precision Planet optical remote sensing images were used to obtain the landslide inventory related to the Typhoon Megi event. The main innovative features are as follows: (i) the newly developed patch generating land-use simulation (PLUS) model simulated and analyzed the driving factors of land-use land-cover (LULC) from 2010 to 2060; (ii) the innovative stacking strategy combined three strong ensemble models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-to calculate the distribution of landslide susceptibility; and (iii) distance from road and LULC maps were used as short-term and long-term dynamic factors to examine the impact of human engineering activities on landslide susceptibility. The results show that the maximum expansion area of built-up land from 2010 to 2020 was 13.433 km(2), mainly expanding forest land and cropland land, with areas of 8.28 km(2 )and 5.99 km(2), respectively. The predicted LULC map for 2060 shows a growth of 45.88 km(2) in the built-up land, mainly distributed around government residences in areas with relatively flat terrain and frequent socio-economic activities. The factor contribution shows that distance from road has a higher impact than LULC. The Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM model obtained the optimal AUC value of 0.915 in the landslide susceptibility analysis in 2016. Furthermore, future road network and urban expansion have intensified the probability of landslides occurring in urban areas in 2015. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the PLUS and Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM models in landslide susceptibility analysis in international literature. The research results can serve as a foundation for developing land management guidelines to reduce the risk of landslide failures.

TI  - Field Spectroscopy For Weed Detection In Wheat And Chickpea Fields
AB  - Weed control is commonly performed by applying selective herbicides homogeneously over entire agricultural fields. However, applying herbicide only where needed could have economical and environmental benefits. The objective of this study was to apply remote sensing to the detection of grasses and broadleaf weeds among cereal and broadleaf crops. Spectral relative reflectance values at both leaf and canopy scales were obtained by field spectroscopy for four plant categories: wheat, chickpea, grass weeds, and broadleaf weeds. Total reflectance spectra of leaf tissues for botanical genera were successfully classified by general discriminant analysis (GDA). The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for specific narrow bands was 95 +/- 4.19\% for wheat and 94 +/- 5.13\% for chickpea. The total canopy spectral classification by GDA for future Vegetation and Environmental Monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENS) bands was 77 +/- 8.09\% for wheat and 88 +/- 6.94\% for chickpea, and for the operative satellite Advanced Land Imager (ALI) bands was 78 +/- 7.97\% for wheat and 82 +/- 8.22\% for chickpea. Within the critical period for weed control, an overall classification accuracy of 87 +/- 5.57\% was achieved for >5\% vegetation coverage in a wheat field, thereby providing potential for implementation of herbicide applications. Qualitative models based on wheat, chickpea, grass weed, and broadleaf weed spectral properties have high-quality classification and prediction potential that can be used for site-specific weed management.

TI  - Use Of Satellite Remote Sensing As A Monitoring Tool For Land And Water Resources Development Activities In An Indian Tropical Site
AB  - With the availability of satellite data from free data domain, remote sensing has increasingly become a fast-hand tool for monitoring of land and water resources development activities with minimal cost and time. Here, we verified construction of check dams and implementation of plantation activities in two districts of Tripura state using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for the years 2008 and 2016–2017, respectively. We applied spectral reflectance curves and index-based proxies to quantify these activities for two time periods. A subset of the total check dams and plantation sites was chosen on the basis of site condition, nature of check dams, and planted species for identification on satellite images, and another subset was randomly chosen to validate identification procedure. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat and Senitnel-2 were used to quantify water area evolved, qualify the water quality, and influence of associated tree shadows. Three types of check dams were observed, i.e., full, partial, and fully soil exposed on the basis of the presence of grass or scrub on the check dams. Based on the nature of check dam and site characteristics, we classified the water bodies under 11-categories using six interpretation keys (size, shape, water depth, quality, shadow of associated trees, catchment area). The check dams constructed on existing narrow gullies totally covered by branches or associated plants were not identified without field verification. Further, use of EVI enabled us to approve the plantation activities and adjudge the corresponding increase in vegetation vigor. The plantation activities were established based on the presence and absence of existing vegetation. Clearing on the plantation sites for plantation shows differential increase in EVI values during the initial years. The 403 plantation sites were categorized into 12 major groups on the basis of presence of dominant species and site conditions. The dominant species were Areca catechu, Musa paradisiaca, Ananas comosus, Bambusa sp., and mix plantation of A. catechu and M. paradisiaca. However, the highest maximum increase in average EVI was observed for the pine apple plantation sites (0.11), followed by Bambussa sp. (0.10). These sites were fully covered with plantation without any exposed soil. The present study successfully demonstrates a satellite-based survey supplemented with ground information evaluating the changes in vegetation profile due to plantation activities, locations of check dams, extent of water bodies, downstream irrigation, and catchment area of water bodies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Sustainable Aquifer Management For Food Security
AB  - In aquifer-dependent regions, balancing aquifer protection, desalination, economic development, agricultural irrigation, and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping. Aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers. Despite its importance, little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown. The novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer. It develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination, the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users, aquifers, and time periods. A mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter Lotikipi Aquifer, discovered in 2013 in northern Kenya using modern remote sensing methods. While initial pumping of the Lotikipi Aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels, interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation. The model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels. Based on that exercise, a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven-year time period. A third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system. Results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of \$0.08 - \$0.18 USD per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available. While this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places, the future could be more optimistic. Advances in desalination technology, higher crop prices, technical advance in agriculture, and development of drought-resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination.

TI  - Regional Distribution Of Salt-Rich Dust Across Southwest Asia Based On Predictive Soil-Geomorphic Mapping Techniques
AB  - Understanding the source regions of soluble salt-rich dust is critical for military operations, monitoring potential environmental health impacts to military personnel, and for mitigating abrasion and corrosion to military materiél operating in desert regions. Arid regions are characterized by saline soils which are formed by a lack of precipitation and influenced by surrounding and underlying geology, among other factors. The dust content in soils and surface sediments in southwest Asia is commonly associated with specific landforms. This paper uses a soil-geomorphic conceptual model that integrates geographic datasets of Landsat imagery, soil and landforms, precipitation data, and geologic maps to produce derivative map-based predictions of the spatial distribution and content of salt-rich dust-sized particle in soils and surface sediments in the region. The derivative map is based on three regional dust and salt content maps and the assignment of a five-fold rating class and numerical factor value system to individual map polygons [e.g., Very High (5), High (4), Moderate (3), Low (2), Very Low (1)]. The three regional maps include: (1) dust content based on the identification of distinct landform assemblages from 15-m resolution compressed LANDSAT TM+ imagery at a scale of 1:750,000, (2) salt content developed from 1 km 2 -resolution mean annual precipitation data, and (3) geologic-based salt content developed from published geologic maps. This study presents an initial step towards the prediction of salt-rich dust sources at regional scales that is aimed to provide information to planning military operations and for mitigating the hazards of dust on military personnel and equipment operating in desert regions. The approach used to predict dust and salt sources could also be used to refine atmospheric dust loading models that require knowledge of the spatial distribution of geomorphic-based input parameters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Benefits Of Seasonal Climate Prediction And Satellite Data For Forecasting Us Maize Yield
AB  - Seasonal agricultural production forecasting is essential for agricultural supply chain and economic prediction. However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble. (3) Using the "T + P + VPD + EVI" model with climate prediction from bias-corrected climate prediction from CFSv2 outperformed the yield forecast in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates reports released by the United States Department of Agriculture, with root-mean-square error of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79\% of multiyear averaged yield) by early August. Plain Language Summary Given the significant advances in both seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing, these data have not been fully used in crop yield forecasting at regional scale, and their benefits are to be quantified compared to survey-based approaches. Here we evaluated the benefits of using seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing data in forecasting U.S. maize yield at both national and county levels. To achieve this goal, we built a seasonal forecasting system for U.S. maize yield by bridging the most advanced seasonal climate prediction products from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) with a statistical crop modeling framework. We found we could not achieve a better forecasting performance than the official survey-based forecast from United States Department of Agriculture until we used both climate and remote sensing observations in our model. Compared with using historical climate information for the unknown future in each growing season, using climate prediction from NCEP gave better forecasting performance once we corrected the bias in the seasonal climate prediction products. Using our climate-remote sensing combined model and bias-corrected climate prediction from NCEP, we achieved a better forecasting performance than the United States Department of Agriculture forecast. Our system will be useful for the stakeholders in the agriculture industry and commodity market.

TI  - Urban Sprawl And Changes In Land-Use Efficiency In The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region, China From 2000 To 2020: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Using Earth Observation Data
AB  - Sustainable development in urban areas is at the core of the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Analysis of SDG indicator 11.3.1-Land-use efficiency based on functional urban boundaries-provides a globally harmonized avenue for tracking changes in urban settlements in different areas. In this study, a methodology was developed to map built-up areas using time-series of Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. By fusing the mapping results with four available land-cover products-GlobeLand30, GHS-Built, GAIA and GLC\_FCS-2020-a new built-up area product (BTH\_BU) was generated for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China for the time period 2000-2020. Using the BTH\_BU product, functional urban boundaries were created, and changes in the size of the urban areas and their form were analyzed for the 13 cities in the BTH region from 2000 to 2020. Finally, the spatiotemporal dynamics of SDG 11.3.1 indicators were analyzed for these cities. The results showed that the urban built-up area could be extracted effectively using the BTH\_BU method, giving an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.85, respectively. The overall ratio of the land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR) in the BTH region fluctuated from 1.142 in 2000-2005 to 0.946 in 2005-2010, 2.232 in 2010-2015 and 1.538 in 2015-2020. Diverged changing trends of LCRPGR values in cities with different population sizes in the study area. Apart from the megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, after 2010, the LCRPGR values were greater than 2 in all the cities in the region. The cities classed as either small or very small had the highest LCRPGR values; however, some of these cities, such as Chengde and Hengshui, experienced population loss in 2005-2010. To mitigate the negative impacts of low-density sprawl on environment and resources, local decision makers should optimize the utilization of land resources and improve land-use efficiency in cities, especially in the small cities in the BTH region.

TI  - Integrated Seawater Intrusion And Groundwater Quality Assessment Of A Coastal Aquifer: Galdit, Geospatial And Analytical Approaches
AB  - The pressure and dependence on coastal aquifers are on the rise in many parts of the globe. These lead to overexploitation, aggravated levels of groundwater pollution, and seawater intrusion. Integrated analyses can create holistic insights into the quality and the vulnerability of aquifers to seawater intrusion. In this study, Mombasa North coast’s coastal aquifer was characterized by integrating multiple approaches—GALDIT overlay index, seawater intrusion groundwater quality index GQISWI, total hardness, water quality index (WQI)—and the results were further explored and interpreted with geospatial analysis techniques. The study suggests that the predominant water type in areas under moderate or high vulnerabilities to seawater intrusion is the Na-Cl water type. However, similar Na-Cl water types can produce a range of total hardness from soft to hard. GQISWI classification can be used to narrow down the observations from Stuyfzand’s TH-based classification system. In the aquifer studied, the results of the GALDIT overlay index, a weighted aggregation of intrinsic parameters contributing to seawater intrusion, show that 29%, 59%, and 12% of the aquifer have low, moderate, and high vulnerabilities, respectively. The GQISWI analysis indicates that the groundwater is largely brackish (68%) but saline towards the southern end of the aquifer at 32%. Total hardness values indicate that 67% of the aquifer’s coverage falls under the “moderately hard” category. The geodatabase creation introduced in the study provides a template for similar studies and a baseline for future WQI and water quality monitoring. However, temporal studies on chronological timescales are recommended for sustainable management of the aquifer. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity Evaluation And Zoning Of Production-Living-Ecological Space Based On Multi-Source Spatial Data
AB  - Production-living-ecological space is a typical spatial carrier to coordinate economic, social, and ecological benefits. Its coordinated development has been greatly significant to promote the ecological civilization, even to optimize the spatial planning in land use. However, the spatial function differentiation is still lacking on the different plots in the same land type, particularly in the most current evaluation on the production-living-ecological space. The clustering or Coordination Degree (CD) is also less sufficient in production-living-ecological space. The purpose of this study is to improve the evaluation system of production-living-ecological space, further to partition its aggregation and coordination degree for the land-use spatial optimization. An integration of multi-source spatial data was implemented to evaluate the functions of production-living-ecological space in different plots with the same land from the grid scale, with emphasis on the perspective of spatial heterogeneity. A systematic analysis was then made on the spatial autocorrelation and trigonometric coordinates. As such, the clustering and coordination characteristics were revealed on the production-living-ecological space on the township scale. Zoning schemes were finally proposed for the optimization of land space. The results are as follows. 1) The high score areas of production space in Hainan Island were concentrated in the coastal cities and counties, indicating the distribution characteristics of "higher around and lower in the middle, higher in the north and lower in the south". There were also differences between the urban and rural production spaces. The high score areas of living space were mainly concentrated in the cities and counties, with the spatial pattern of "small part gathering and most scattered". The high score areas of ecological space were concentrated in the middle, with the distribution characteristics of "higher in the middle and lower around". 2) The Moran's I indexes for the production, life, and ecological space function were 0.569, 0.221 and 0.716, respectively, in Hainan Island obtained from the township scale. It inferred that there was the strongest spatial correlation between the spatial autocorrelation characteristics and ecological space. Therefore, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial clustering. 3) There were great differences in the coordination degree of production-living-ecological space in different towns of Hainan Island. The high value areas were dominated by ecological space and coordinated type, accounting for 51.72% and 43.97% of the total number of towns, respectively. The low value area was dominated by ecology space, accounting for 72.41% of the total number of towns, where no living dominant town was observed. In the case of spatial features, a zoning scheme was proposed for the whole island using the characteristics of spatial coordination. The heterogeneity of spatial functions was effectively identified in the production-living-ecological space for the different plots with the same land type. A specific scheme of production-living-ecological spatial zoning was also proposed from two new perspectives of spatial clustering and coordination degree, suitable for the current practice of land space optimization. An optimization path of production-living-ecological spatial evaluation can provide the zoning schemes, according to the spatial characteristics. The finding can offer a potential decision making for the land space optimization, as well as the construction of free trade port and ecological civilization in Hainan Island of southern China. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Porto Alegre 2006: Called To Be The One Church: Ecumenism Beyond Its Crisis?
AB  - From 9-23 February 2006 the World Council of Churches held its 9th Assembly in Porto Alegre, Brasil with the theme God, in your grace, transform the world. It gathered in an atmosphere of crisis in the ecumenical movement, caused by global political and religious developments, post-modern thinking on the value of plurality and difference(1) and by the slow reception of ecumenical agreements. The Assembly, though, became a sign of hope beyond the ecumenical crisis. Its reflections and proposals on Globalisation and economic injustice, on Christian identity and religious plurality and on Church Unity and the Mission of the Church demonstrate a matured ecumenical and ecclesiological awareness, strengthened by a new method of decision-making by consensus. The document Called to be the one Church might be seen as the constitutional basis for a reconfiguration of the ecumenical movement and as a refinement of the Toronto Declaration of 1950. It formulates a matrix of catholicity and of a legitimate diversity of church forms within an essential convergence about its structures of continuity and mission.

TI  - Quantifying Variance Across Spatial Scales As Part Of Fire Regime Classifications
AB  - The emergence of large-scale fire classifications and products informed by remote sensing data has enabled opportunities to include variability or heterogeneity as part of modem fire regime classifications. Currently, basic fire metrics such as mean fire return intervals are calculated without considering spatial variance in a management context. Fire return intervals are also only applicable at a particular grain size (defined as the spatial unit of interest) even though they are typically applied homogeneously. In this study, we utilized a 29-yr fire occurrence database to show how spatial variance changes with respect to grain as postulated by Wiens (1989) when reporting fire patterns within the Great Plains, USA. We utilized data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database of fire occurrence for the years 1984-2012. We analyzed median numbers of fire along with their variance at four spatial grains ranging from small units (e.g., plots at 3 x 3 km resolution) to large units (e.g., landscapes at 1500 x 2700 km resolution). Median number of fire occurrences was consistently low, irrespective of grain. Despite the consistency in low median numbers of fires across grain, variance in the numbers of fires between units decreased. Variance within units, however, did not change as grain increased indicating fire-pattern-scale inconsistencies. Fire pattern interpretations depended entirely on the scale at which it is calculated. Given that the Great Plains region has a large disparity in fire patterns (i.e., some regions burn often, while others may never burn), fire regime classifications will benefit from including scale-specific variance estimates as a foundation for understanding changes in fire regimes and corresponding social-ecological and policy responses.

TI  - Modelling And Evaluation Of Land Use Changes Through Satellite Images In A Multifunctional Catchment: Social, Economic And Environmental Implications
AB  - Floods are recurrent phenomena with significant environmental and socio-economic impacts. The risk of flooding increases when land use changes. The objective of this research is to detect land cover changes via Sentinel-2 images in the Umia Basin (Galicia, NW Spain) in 2016-2021 and to analyse the associated flood risk. This study focuses on how forest use and nature-based solutions (NBS) can reduce the risk and hazard of flooding in cities and crops in the high-risk area. A flood simulation was performed with the land use obtained from Sentinel-2 (Observed) and three more simulations were performed changing the location of afforestation and NBS, i.e. "S-Upstream", "S-Downstream" and "S-Total". Finally, the environmental, economic and social impacts of the scenarios designed and estimated are analysed and discussed. Land cover change was successfully monitored with Sentinel-2 imagery. The catchment area showed noteworthy changes in land use, most notably for the category of trees, which covered 6700 ha in 2016 and 10,911 ha in 2021. However riparian vegetation decreased by almost 11\%. For the flood hazard simulations, an average reduction in peak discharge was obtained for all three scenarios (9.3\% for S-Up; 8.6\% for S-Down and 13\% for S-Total). From the economic perspective, all three scenarios show a positive net present value for the period studied. However, S-Down is the scenario with the lowest benefits (euro15,476,487), while S-Up and S-Total show better values at euro29,580,643 and euro65,158,130 respectively. However, investment cost is much higher for the S-Total scenario, and upstream actions affect the whole catchment, so S-Up is the best decision. This study concludes that the information provided by satellites is a large-scale analysis tool for small heterogeneous plots that facilitates the comprehensive analysis of a territory. This information can be incorporated into flood analysis models, facilitating simulation through the use of NBS. It has been proven that the use of reforestation upstream only is almost as beneficial as reforestation in the entire catchment and is economically more viable. This confirms that the methodology used reduces flood hazard, despite the territorial complexity, facilitating decision making on the use of NBS.

TI  - Network Analysis Of Sea Turtle Movements And Connectivity: A Tool For Conservation Prioritization
AB  - Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of animal movements is a critical element in conserving long-lived, highly mobile marine species. Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts. Location Global. Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections. Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links. Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.

TI  - Unsupervised Bayesian Inference To Fuse Biosignal Sensory Estimates For Personalizing Care
AB  - The role of sensing technologies, such as wearables, in delivering precision care is becoming widely acceptable. Given the very large quantities of sensor data that rapidly accumulate, there is a need to employ automated algorithms to label biosignal sensor data. In many real-life clinical applications, no such expert labels are available, and algorithms for processing sensor data must be relied upon, without access to the 'ground truth.' It is therefore extremely difficult to choose which algorithms to trust or discard at any point in time, where different algorithms may be optimal for different patients, or even for different points in time for the same patient. We propose two fully Bayesian approaches for fusing labels from independent and potentially correlated annotators (i.e., algorithms or, where available, experts). These are generative models to aggregate labels (i.e., the outputs of the algorithms, such as identified ECG morphology) in an unsupervised manner, to estimate jointly the assumed bias and precision of each algorithm without access to the ground truth. The latter fused estimate may then be used to infer the underlying ground truth. For the first time in the biomedical context, we show that modeling correlations between annotators, and fusing information concerning task difficulty (such as the estimated quality of the sensor data), improve these estimates with respect to commonly employed strategies in the literature. Also, we adopt a strongly Bayesian approach to inference using Gibbs sampling to improve estimates over the existing state of the art. We present results from applying the proposed pair of models to simulated and two publicly available biomedical datasets, to demonstrate proof-of-principle. We show that our proposed models outperform all existing approaches recreated from the literature. We also show that the proposed methods are robust when dealing with missing values (as often occurs in real-life biomedical applications), and that they are suitably efficient for use in real-Time applications, thereby providing the basis for the reliable use of sensors for personalizing the care of the individual. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Identifying Causal Changes In Landscape Greenness With Very High-Resolution Airborne Multispectral Imagery And A Panel Data Model
AB  - To effectively manage urban environmental systems, interventions on private lands may sometimes be necessary. This is illustrated in many water districts where water agencies run programs that provide incentives to landholders to change their landscaping to meet the water agency's management goals. It is difficult to monitor, track, and evaluate landscape change programs on private land, however. To most efficiently do so, very high-resolution, time-series measurements of urban landcover would be useful, but such data is often unavailable. This study evaluates how private urban landscape change is represented in the highest resolution, publicly available, multispectral data product distributed in the United States. The study focuses on residential parcels that participated in a lawn replacement rebate program run by the East Bay Municipal Utility District, a water agency in California. Each parcel has a known quantity of turfgrass converted to drought-tolerant landscaping. The study asks if Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data can be used to detect participation in a lawn replacement program at the parcel-level. While the NAIP data product has substantial error in a time-series and urban context, this study finds that approaching change detection using a fixed effect panel data model accommodates error, making it possible to identify NDVI change. With control groups defined by matching and weighing with Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores, results indicate that observed browning at the parcel-level can be causally attributed to participating in the lawn replacement program. This ability to detect small, causal changes in a heterogenous environment opens possibilities for monitoring and evaluating programs acting on private urban landscapes, contributing to more effective and efficient design, pricing and implementation. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Framework For Modeling And Predicting Crop Yield To Enhance Food Security In Saudi Arabia
AB  - Predicting crop yields is a critical issue in agricultural production optimization and intensification research. Accurate foresights of natural circumstances a year in advance can have a considerable impact on management decisions regarding crop selection, rotational location in crop rotations, agrotechnical methods employed, and long-term land use planning. One of the most important aspects of precision farming is sustainability. The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R\%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70\% for training and 30\% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100\%) and (R-2 = 96.33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process. The temperature, insecticides, and rainfall were examined with different crop yields to confirm the effectiveness of these parameters for increasing product crop yields in Saudi Arabia; we found that these items had highest relationships. The average values are R = 98.20\%, 96.50, and 99.14\% with for the temperature, insecticides, and rainfall, respectively. Based on these findings, it appeared that each of the parameter categories that are considered (temperature, pesticides, and rainfall) had a similar contribution to the accuracy of anticipated yield projection.

TI  - Costs And Benefits Of Satellite-Based Tools For Irrigation Management
AB  - This paper presents the results of a collaborative work with farmers and a cost-benefit analysis of geospatial technologies applied to irrigation water management in a semi-arid agricultural area in Lower Austria. We use Earth observation (Eo) data to estimate crop evapotranspiration (Et) and webGlS technologies to deliver maps and irrigation advice to farmers. The study reports the technical and qualitative evaluation performed during a demonstration phase in 2013 and provides an outlook to future developments. The calculation of the benefits is based on a comparison of the irrigation volumes estimated from satellite vs. the irrigation supplied by the farmers. In most cases, the amount of water supplied was equal to the maximum amount of water required by crops. At the same time high variability was observed for the different irrigation units and crop types. Our data clearly indicates that economic benefits could be achieved by reducing irrigation volumes, especially for water-intensive crops. Regarding the qualitative evaluation, most of the farmers expressed a very positive interest in the provided information. In particular, information related to crop ET was appreciated as this helps to make better informed decisions on irrigation. The majority of farmers (54\%) also expressed a general willingness to pay, either directly or via cost sharing, for such a service. Based on different cost scenarios, we calculated the cost of the service. Considering 20,000 ha regularly irrigated land, the advisory service would cost between 2.5 and 4.3 (sic)/ha per year depending on the type of satellite data used. For comparison, irrigation costs range between 400 and 1000 /ha per year for a typical irrigation volume of 2000 cubic meters per ha. With a correct irrigation application, more than 10\% of the water and energy could be saved in water-intensive crops, which is equivalent to an economic benefit of 40-100 (sic)/ha per year.

TI  - Potential Ecosystem Service Values Of Mangrove Forests In Southeastern China Using High-Resolution Satellite Data
AB  - Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US\$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US\$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US\$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23\% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US\$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78\% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33\% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US\$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US\$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers.

TI  - Index-Based Insurance For Climate Risk Management And Rural Development In Syria
AB  - Improving the adaptive capacity of rural producers to climate and weather risks may become an urgent issue in the early stages of political stabilization in Syria. Therefore, this study analyses the agro-ecological, economic and social benefits of - and the institutional challenges to - establishing index-based insurance markets to catalyse rural development in Syria. The paper examines the potential of three index insurance schemes for minimizing risk: (1) a statistical index, (2) an index based on agro-meteorological approach and (3) a remote sensing-based index. It also discusses how index-based insurance markets contribute to rural development in scenarios of increasing climate risks. The study identifies that all three insurance schemes have a very high potential to cope with increasing climate risk. Insurance schemes designed according to these indexes performed very well in terms of covering revenue losses in most of the extreme drought years observed in the country. Farmers purchasing an insurance contract may have better access to credit and find it easier to invest in agricultural production and improve productivity. Because such alternative index-based insurance programmes are low cost, they are more affordable for poor farmers and thus can potentially make an excellent contribution to economic growth in rural areas.

TI  - A Land Use Regression Model Incorporating Data On Industrial Point Source Pollution
AB  - Advancing the understanding of the spatial aspects of air pollution in the city regional environment is an area where improved methods can be of great benefit to exposure assessment and policy support. We created land use regression (LUR) models for SO2, NO2 and PM10 for Tianjin, China. Traffic volumes, road networks, land use data, population density, meteorological conditions, physical conditions and satellite-derived greenness, brightness and wetness were used for predicting SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. We incorporated data on industrial point sources to improve LUR model performance. In order to consider the impact of different sources, we calculated the PSIndex, LSIndex and area of different land use types (agricultural land, industrial land, commercial land, residential land, green space and water area) within different buffer radii (1 to 20 km). This method makes up for the lack of consideration of source impact based on the LUR model. Remote sensing-derived variables were significantly correlated with gaseous pollutant concentrations such as SO2 and NO2. R-2 values of the multiple linear regression equations for SO2, NO2 and PM10 were 0.78, 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, and the RMSE values were 0.32, 0.18 and 0.21, respectively. Model predictions at validation monitoring sites went well with predictions generally within 15\% of measured values. Compared to the relationship between dependent variables and simple variables (such as traffic variables or meteorological condition variables), the relationship between dependent variables and integrated variables was more consistent with a linear relationship. Such integration has a discernable influence on both the overall model prediction and health effects assessment on the spatial distribution of air pollution in the city region.

TI  - Seasonal Forecasts For The Limpopo Province In Estimating Deviations From Grazing Capacity
AB  - Application of seasonal forecasts in agriculture has significant potential and realized utility. Other sectors that may also benefit from using seasonal forecasts include (but are not limited to) health, hydrology, water, and energy. This paper shows that seasonal forecast model data, satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), dry matter productivity (DMP) data (proxy of grass biomass) along with other sets of data are effectively used to estimate grazing capacity (GC) over a 12-year test period (1998/1999–2009/2010) in Limpopo Province. GC comprises a vital consideration in agricultural activities, particularly for a province in South Africa like Limpopo, due to its varying climate. The Limpopo Province capitalizes on subsistence farming, including livestock and crop production. Grazing should thus be regulated in order to conserve grass, shrubs, and trees, thereby ensuring sustainability of rangelands. In a statistical downscaling model, the predictor is the 850 geopotential height fields of a coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation (CGCM) over Southern Africa to predict seasonal DMP values. This model shows that the mid-summer rainfall totals are important predictors for the November through April (NDJFMA) DMP (as well as grazing capacity) growing season. Forecast verification is conducted using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and reliability diagrams. The CGCM model shows skill in discriminating high and low DMP (GC) seasons in the Limpopo Province, as well as reliability in the probabilistic forecasts. This paper demonstrates the development of a tailored forecast, an avenue that should be explored in enhancing relevance of forecasts in agricultural production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Catching "Butterflies" In The Morning: A New Methodology For Rapid Detection Of Aerially Deployed Plastic Land Mines From Uavs
AB  - It is estimated that there are at least 100 million military munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) devices in the world of various size, shape, and composition. Millions of these are surface plastic land mines with low-pressure detonation regimes, such as the mass-produced Soviet PFM-1. These aerially deployed land mines are concentrated primarily in postconflict developing countries such as Afghanistan and represent a continued humanitarian threat, while also thwarting economic and social development in impacted regions. Identification of this particular type of MEC category poses a significant geophysical challenge, as these mines contain almost no metal (nonferrous aluminum). As a result, standard MEC detection and remediation methodologies based on geophysical principles of magnetometry and electromagnetic induction prove largely ineffective and possibly dangerous. Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles can rapidly collect large remotely sensed data sets with no risk to MEC technicians. We present results of an experiment focused on remotely assessing thermal signatures of plastic land mines relative to background geology to show that this type of analysis permits rapid detection of randomly dispersed plastic MECs with a high degree of accuracy and low associated costs. © 2018 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

TI  - Urban Photogrammetric Data Base For Multi-Purpose Cadastral-Based Information Systems: The Riyadh City Case
AB  - Urban information systems are economic resources that can benefit decision makers in the planning, development, and management of urban projects and resources. In this research, a conceptual model-based prototype Urban Geographic Information System (UGIS) is developed. The base maps used in developing the system and acquiring visual attributes are obtained from aerial photographs. The system is a multi-purpose parcel-based one that can serve many urban applications such as public utilities, health centres, schools, population estimation, road engineering and maintenance, and many others. A modern region in the capital city of Saudi Arabia is used for the study. The developed model is operational for one urban application (population estimation) and is tested for that particular application. The results showed that the system has a satisfactory accuracy and that it may well be promising for other similar urban applications in countries with similar demographic and social characteristics. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Utilization Of Global Precipitation Datasets In Data Limited Regions: A Case Study Of Kilombero Valley, Tanzania
AB  - This study explored the potential for bias correction of global precipitation datasets (GPD) to support streamflow simulation for water resource management in data limited regions. Two catchments, 580 km(2) and 2530 km(2), in the Kilombero Valley of central Tanzania were considered as case studies to explore three GPD bias correction methods: quantile mapping (QM), daily percentages (DP) and a model based (ModB) bias correction. The GPDs considered included two satellite rainfall products, three reanalysis products and three interpolated observed data products. The rainfall-runoff model HBV was used to simulate streamflow in the two catchments using (1) observed rain gauge data; (2) the original GPDs and (3) the bias-corrected GPDs as input. Results showed that applying QM to bias correction based on limited observed data tends to aggravate streamflow simulations relative to not bias correcting GPDs. This is likely due to a potential lack of representativeness of a single rain gauge observation at the scale of a hydrological catchment for these catchments. The results also indicate that there may be potential benefits in combining streamflow and rain gauge data to bias correct GPDs during the model calibration process within a hydrological modeling framework.

TI  - How Historical Land Use/Land Cover Changes Affected Ecosystem Services In Lake Pamvotis, Greece
AB  - Historic land changes reflect human pressure in aquatic ecosystems. The value of littoral and riparian zones for lakes is of outmost importance for their hydrology, ecology and support of ecosystem services. The last 75 years altered the landscape mosaic of Lake Pamvotis affecting those habitats. In such an ancient, urban, Mediterranean shallow lake, historic black and white aerial photographs and satellite images were screened in 25 years timestep, from 1945 for extracting land use/land cover changes. The classification took place in two buffer zones (50 m and 500 m). The changes are assessed with respect to their possible impact in water-related ecosystem services. Ecosystem services values were further calculated historically along with landscape ecology indices. The research revealed an extreme landscape makeover until 1995 with detrimental effects in the riparian habitats, with augmented pressure in the 0-50 m buffer. Artificial areas covered 21% in 1995 when in 1945 they occupied only 9%. Total area ecosystem services values rised at the expense of some provisioning and regulating services. As for landscape homogenization and fragmentation, it was already affected by human. Through this research, new ways of studying water bodies can be developed, by following the pressures’ and alterations’ evolution, aiming at better urban and management planning. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Federated Space Systems' Trade-Space Exploration For Strategic Robustness
AB  - Motivated by the growth of the commercial space economy and renewed focus on the disaggregation of military space systems, this work develops a method for conceptual design of federated satellite systems as a collaborative system of systems (SOS). Objectives seek to improve the likelihood of successful SOS formation and pursue constituent system utility robustness. The proposed metaheuristic optimization trade-space exploration method accounts for technical and economic design variables and multi-decision-maker strategy dynamics. Constituent system designs are ranked on their simulated net present value. A game-theoretic measure of risk dominance is used in concert with the net present value to assess the robustness and utility of candidate SOS designs. The method is validated with a notional application case that assesses potential collaboration between Earth-observing and telecommunications systems. The proposed methodology reduces the threshold probability of partner collaboration for which SOS participation is economically rational by up to 18\% for the most efficient designs as compared to a typical conceptual design method, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful SOS formation. The results highlight the importance of accounting for strategy dynamics when designing systems for collaboration.

TI  - Can More Accurate Night-Time Remote Sensing Data Simulate A More Detailed Population Distribution?
AB  - Aging, shrinking cities, urban agglomerations and other new key terms continue to emerge when describing the large-scale population changes in various cities in mainland China. It is important to simulate the distribution of residential populations at a coarse scale to manage cities as a whole, and at a fine scale for policy making in infrastructure development. This paper analyzes the relationship between the DN (Digital number, value assigned to a pixel in a digital image) value of NPP-VIIRS (the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LuoJia1-01 and the residential populations of urban areas at a district, sub-district, community and court level, to compare the influence of resolution of remote sensing data by taking urban land use to map out auxiliary data in which first-class (R1), second-class (R2) and third-class residential areas (R3) are distinguished by house price. The results show that LuoJia1-01 more accurately analyzes population distributions at a court level for second- and third-class residential areas, which account for over 85\% of the total population. The accuracy of the LuoJia1-01 simulation data is higher than that of Landscan and GHS (European Commission Global Human Settlement) population. This can be used as an important tool for refining the simulation of residential population distributions. In the future, higher-resolution night-time light data could be used for research on accurate simulation analysis that scales down large-scale populations.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Continuous Estimates Of Daily 1 Km Pm2.5 From 2000 To Present Under The Tracking Air Pollution In China (Tap) Framework
AB  - High spatial resolution PM2.5 data covering a long time period are urgently needed to support population exposure assessment and refined air quality management. In this study, we provided complete-coverage PM2.5 predictions with a 1 km spatial resolution from 2000 to the present under the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/, last access: 3 October 2022) framework. To support high spatial resolution modeling, we collected PM2.5 measurements from both national and local monitoring stations. To correctly reflect the temporal variations in land cover characteristics that affected the local variations in PM2.5, we constructed continuous annual geoinformation datasets, including the road maps and ensemble gridded population maps, in China from 2000 to 2021. We also examined various model structures and predictor combinations to balance the computational cost and model performance. The final model fused 10 km TAP PM2.5 predictions from our previous work, 1 km satellite aerosol optical depth retrievals, and land use parameters with a random forest model. Our annual model had an out-of-bag R-2 ranging between 0.80 and 0.84, and our hindcast model had a by-year cross-validation R-2 of 0.76. This open-access, 1 km resolution PM2.5 data product, with complete coverage, successfully revealed the local-scale spatial variations in PM2.5 and could benefit environmental studies and policymaking.

TI  - Nineteenth-Century Land-Use Legacies Affect Contemporary Land Abandonment In The Carpathians
AB  - Historical land use may shape landscapes for centuries into the future, but it remains unclear how much land-use legacies affect contemporary land use. Knowing for how long and how strongly land-use legacies affect agricultural systems is important for contemporary land-use planning and conservation. We assessed the effect of nineteenth-century agricultural legacies for contemporary agricultural abandonment by integrating historic maps and satellite imagery in the Carpathian region. We modeled the choice of agricultural land, and the legacies of Habsburg and Socialist regimes, while controlling for agro-ecological, accessibility and sociopolitical variation. Farming during the Habsburg era was concentrated in agro-ecologically suitable areas, but socialist agricultural expansion occurred mostly in less suitable areas, leading to subsequent abandonment. In addition, our results showed that historic land use affected abandonment even 100 years later. Although legacies diminished over time, their effects were amplified when political transformations occurred, likely due to land tenure systems, land owner attitudes, cultural values and differences in land improvement over time. Taken together, land-use legacies and shifts in political systems can constrain current land management and possible future land-use options, suggesting that contemporary land-use decisions can affect future land use for decades and even centuries.

TI  - Do Big Unstructured Biodiversity Data Mean More Knowledge?
AB  - Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of "big unstructured data" for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on "big data." Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritize data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs. standardized data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: (1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardized long-termspecies population studies; (2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and (3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional taxes in Central Finland. Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central Finland are quite significant. Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings, consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism jobs are often low paying. Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries. Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism impact studies using the input-output technique have also been conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers involved in regional planning and development.

TI  - Opti-Msfa: A Toolbox For Generalized Design And Optimization Of Multispectral Filter Arrays
AB  - Multispectral imaging captures spatial information across a set of discrete spectral channels and is widely utilized across diverse applications such as remote sensing, industrial inspection, and biomedical imaging. Multispectral filter arrays (MSFAs) are filter mosaics integrated atop image sensors that facilitate cost-effective, compact, snapshot multispectral imaging. MSFAs are pre-configured based on application-where filter channels are selected corresponding to targeted absorption spectra-making the design of optimal MSFAs vital for a given application. Despite the availability of many design and optimization approaches for spectral channel selection and spatial arrangement, major limitations remain. There are few robust approaches for joint spectral-spatial optimization, techniques are typically only applicable to limited datasets and most critically, are not available for general use and improvement by the wider community. Here, we reconcile current MSFA design techniques and present Opti-MSFA: a Python-based open-access toolbox for the centralized design and optimization of MSFAs. Opti-MSFA incorporates established spectral-spatial optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and simulated annealing, multispectral-RGB image reconstruction, and is applicable to user-defined input of spatial-spectral datasets or imagery. We demonstrate the utility of the toolbox by comparing against other published MSFAs using the standard hyperspectral datasets Samson and Jasper Ridge, and further show application on experimentally acquired fluorescence imaging data. In conjunction with end-user input and collaboration, we foresee the continued development of Opti-MSFA for the benefit of the wider research community.

TI  - Quantitative Catchment Profiling To Apportion Faecal Indicator Organism Budgets For The Ribble System, The Uk's Sentinel Drainage Basin For Water Framework Directive Research
AB  - Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20/60/EC and the US Federal Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within river drainage basins has shifted from traditional point-source control to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive (BWD), under the list of 'protected areas' in the WFD places a requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within catchments in order to achieve the objectives of both the BWD (and its revision - 2006/7/EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44-day period during the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90\% of the total organism load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However, during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater retention tanks. The study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure and WwTW stormwater retention tanks as the dominant component of the high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde coast and the associated bathing waters.

TI  - Subways And Co2 Emissions: A Global Analysis With Satellite Data
AB  - This paper estimates a global CO2 emissions model using satellite data at 25 km resolution. The model incorporates industrial sources (including power, steel, cement, and refineries), fires, and non-industrial population-related factors associated with household incomes and energy requirements. It also tests the impact of subways in the 192 cities where they operate. We find highly significant effects with the expected signs for all model variables, including subways. In a counterfactual exercise estimating CO2 emissions with and without subways, we find they have reduced population-related CO2 emissions by about 50 \% for the 192 cities and about 11 \% globally. Extending the analysis to future subways for other cities, we estimate the magnitude and social value of CO2 emissions reductions with conservative assumptions about population and income growth and a range of values for the social cost of carbon and investment costs. Even under pessimistic assumptions for these costs, we find that hundreds of cities realize a significant climate co-benefit, along with benefits from reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, which have traditionally motivated subway construction. Under more moderate assumptions, we find that, on climate grounds alone, hundreds of cities realize high enough social rates of return to warrant subway construction.

TI  - Soil Moisture Monitoring By Downscaling Of Remote Sensing Products Using Lst/Vi Space Derived From Modis Products
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, as a novel and effective tool for agricultural and water resource management. Accordingly, remote sensing products of surface soil moisture were scaled to MODIS's image scale (similar to 1 km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation, Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method. Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of the obtained results with the ground stations data, the LPRM and the ESA-CCI downscaled images had the best statistical indices values accordingly in 2010 and 2014 that confirm the promising application of remote sensing soil moisture data (rLPRM (2010) = 0.92, MAELPRM (2010) = 4.14\%, RMSELPRM (2010) = 6.39\% and rESA-CC I(2014) = 0.7, MAEESA-CCI (2014)=2.23\%, RMSEESA-CCI (2014)=2.59\%).

TI  - Two Concepts Of Secularism
AB  - Secularism, for many of us, is not a terra incognita, and yet it is certainly an improperly defined and unexplained concept. For more than 150 years, intellectuals, politicians, and theologians have used secular and secularism in a rather ambiguous way. These terms therefore need to be clarified. The time has come to rethink our whole approach to the question of secularism. Given the inapplicability of the French model of secularism to the Muslim world, it becomes necessary to find a criterion by which state involvement, when it occurs in the domain of religion, can appear to the members of a religious group as both legitimate and fair. The Indian concept of secularism based on the toleration and equal protection of all religious communities without being supportive of any particular religion can supply this criterion. That said, to pursue a secular politics of rejecting sectarianism and demanding toleration requires that strategic priorities be rearranged without making historical shortcuts. In this case, a secular politics of toleration is a twofold struggle, a resistance to uniformization and an invitation to democratization. If such a strategy is to find any role in the regulation of the lives and activities of Islamic societies today, an alternative concept of secularism, rather than simply an alternative to it, needs to be worked out. The challenge is not to abandon secularism but to formulate it as a philosophy with spiritual values, rather than solely a policy of the state. This is the only way of rethinking our whole approach to the future in Muslim societies to the extent that the pluralist model of a "shared home" can be presented as "a third way" solution to the crisis of political societies in the Middle East and in opposition to the secular authoritarianism of the state and the rise of religious fundamentalism in civil society. © 2011 by Duke University Press.

TI  - Deep Learning For Automatic Outlining Agricultural Parcels: Exploiting The Land Parcel Identification System
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date information on the spatial and geographical characteristics of agricultural areas is an indispensable value for the various activities related to agriculture and research. Most agricultural studies and policies are carried out at the field level, for which precise boundaries are required. Today, high-resolution remote sensing images provide useful spatial information for plot delineation; however, manual processing is time-consuming and prone to human error. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of deep learning (DL) approach, in particular a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, for the automatic outlining of agricultural plot boundaries from orthophotos over large areas with a heterogeneous landscape. Since DL approaches require a large amount of labeled data to learn, we have exploited the open data from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) from the Chartered Community of Navarre, Spain. The boundaries of the agricultural plots obtained from our methodology were compared with those obtained using a state-of-the-art methodology known as gPb-UCM (global probability of boundary followed by ultrametric contour map) through an error measurement called the boundary displacement error index (BDE). In BDE terms, the results obtained by our method outperform those obtained from the gPb-UCM method. In this regard, CNN models trained with LPIS data are a useful and powerful tool that would reduce intensive manual labor in outlining agricultural plots. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Geolocation Of Free-Ranging Fish On The European Continental Shelf As Determined From Environmental Variables - I. Tidal Location Method
AB  - Demersal fish cannot readily be tracked using satellite-based or light-based geolocation techniques. As an alternative, we describe the tidal location method, which uses tidal data recorded by electronic data storage tags (DSTs), to determine geoposition. Times of high water (H) and tidal ranges (R) recorded by DSTs moored at known locations, and from free-swimming tagged plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, were compared with a North Sea tidal database to identify all positions with matching values of H and R. Within the recording precision of the tag (+/-0.2 m, +/-10 min) and the predicted accuracy of the model generated tidal data (+/-0.15 m, +/-20 min), geolocations over much of the North Sea and eastern English Channel were predicted to be accurate to within 40 kin, sometimes to within 10 km. Positional estimates of the moored tags were within 15.7+/-3.5 km of the actual locations. Geolocations made from tagged plaice within 5 days of release and 5 days pre-recapture were within 35+/-24 km and 37+/-23 km of release and recapture positions respectively. Our results demonstrate the ability of this method to accurately describe the migrations of North Sea plaice throughout their geographical range with a level of accuracy unattainable using light-based geolocation. The method could equally be applied to any shelf-dwelling demersal fish that periodically rests on the sea-bed for the duration of a tidal cycle. In fisheries management, the method has clear potential application in defining the movements and migrations of other commercial species.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Impact Of Urbanization On Urban Heat Island And Urban Thermal Field Variance Index Of Tianjin City, China
AB  - The rapid infrastructure development in densely populated areas has had several negative impacts. Increases in urbanization have led to increased LST, and urban ecological systems have been negatively affected. Urban heat islands (UHIs) can be mitigated by understanding how current and future LST phenomena are linked to changes in landscape composition and land use cover (LUC). This study investigated the multi-scale spatial analysis of LUC and LST in Tianjin using remote sensing and GIS data. We used Landsat data from 2005 to 2020 to examine the effects of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration. According to the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), the city's ecological evaluation was carried out. Results show that changes in LUC and other anthropogenic activities affect the spatial distribution of LST. For the study years (2004-2009), the estimated mean LST in Tianjin was 25.32 degrees C, 26.73 degrees C, 27.62 degrees C, and 27.93 degrees C. Between LST and urban areas with other infrastructures, and NDBI, significant positive correlation values were found about 0.53, 0.48, and 0.76 (p < 0.05), respectively. Temperatures would almost certainly increase by 3.87 degrees C to 7.26 degrees C as a result of decreased plant cover and increased settlements. These findings strongly imply a correlation between LST and the vegetation index. Between 2005 and 2020, the anticipated increase in LST of 3.39 degrees C is expected to harm urban environmental health. This study demonstrates how Tianjin and other cities can achieve ecological sustainability.

TI  - Efficient Storage Method For Massive Remote Sensing Image Via Spark-Based Pyramid Model
AB  - The amount of remote sensing (RS) image has grown considerably and the Big Data era of images has truly emerged. Traditional storage and processing methods cannot meet the requirements of the growing massive image data. So how to provide effective storage and high-performance computation service has brought a great challenge to the research community. In this paper, we present the efficient storage of massive remote sensing image via Spark-based Pyramid model. Based on selection of rational number of image layer via the maximum division layer algorithm, we design the Spark-oriented distributed construction method. We use RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) on Spark system to represent data structures for metadata and ranks, and there is no need to materialize these data structures across multiple iterations. Using our construction method and RDDs caching technology, we design the efficient storage structure of RS image data, which can achieve high-performance processing of massive RS image on Spark system. Experimental results show that proper values can be obtained via optimization parameters of image tile. Also throughput rate and construction performance are much higher than MapReduce and Hadoop.

TI  - Variability Of Water Use Efficiency Associated With Climate Change In The Extreme West Of Bahia
AB  - Water has become more important in agricultural implementations over the years, as has the need for water management. Thus, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) has been used as an alternative form of detecting the variability of water management based on the carbon-water cycle. The study aimed to map and quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of WUE based on its interactions with environmental changes. It focused on an agricultural area in the westernmost region of Bahia, Northeast Brazil (NEB). For WUE estimation, data from Collection 6 MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Evapotranspiration (ET) products with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees were obtained from the Earth Explorer website. Subsequently, annual WUE anomalies were calculated based on the 2001-2019 period. The results obtained indicated that the highest values of GPP (580 gC/m(2)), ET (3000 mm), and WUE (3.5 gC/mm center dot m(2)) occurred in agricultural areas, associated with cultural treatments and insertion of irrigation, which helped in the higher WUE values and consequently increased agricultural productivity in the study region. In addition, there was a marked influence of the phases of the climate variability mode-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-on the annual variability of the WUE, with a reduction of 96\% during the La Nina of 2016 (an increase of 89\% during El Nino of 2005). During El Ninos, vegetation had greater efficiency resulting from the adaptation of vegetation in maintaining the carbon-water balance, using water more efficiently. However, unlike Las Ninas, with excessive precipitation there is an interference in the WUE, which interferes with the absorption of radiation and nutrients for the biophysical processes of vegetation and agriculture and, consequently, agricultural production. The use of WUE for agriculture is extremely important, especially for Brazil and countries with an economy based on primary production. This information on the way vegetation (native or agricultural) responds to interactions with the environment aids in decision-making about water management, possibly lowering losses or agricultural damage caused by a lack of water.

TI  - A Simple Approach For Monitoring Vegetation Change Using Time Series Remote Sensing Analysis: A Case Study From The Thathe Vondo Area In Limpopo Province, South Africa
AB  - This study presents a simple approach of spatiotemporal change detection of vegetation cover based on analysis of time series remotely sensed images. The study was carried out at Thathe Vondo Area, which is characterised by episodic variation of vegetation gain and loss. This variation is attributable to timber and tea plantations and their production cycles, which periodically result in either vegetation gain or loss. The approach presented here was implemented on two ASTER images acquired in 2007 and 2017. It involved the combined use of band combination, unsupervised image classification and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) techniques. True colour composite (TCC) images for 2007 and 2017 were created from combination of bands 1, 2 and 3 in red, blue and green, respectively. The difference image of the TCC images was then generated to show the inconsistencies of vegetation cover between 2007 and 2017. For analytical simplicity and interpretability, the difference image was subjected to ISODATA unsupervised classification, which clustered pixels in the difference image into eight classes. Two ISODATA derived classes were interpreted as vegetation gain and one as vegetation loss. These classes were confimed as regions of vegetation gain and loss by NDVI values of 2007 and 2017. In addition, the polygons of vegetation gain and loss regions were created and superimposed over the TCC images to further demonstrate the spatiotemporal vegetation change in the area. The vegetation change statistics show vegetation gain and loss of 10.62\% and 2.03\%, respectively, implying a vegetation gain of 8.59\% over the selected decade. Significance: Vegetation change detection is essential in environmental monitoring and management of an area. This study presents a simple approach for assessing vegetation change over time. The approach involves change detection through the difference of spectral values of vegetation pixels of time series remotely sensed images.

TI  - A Data-Driven Approach To Hurricane Debris Modeling
AB  - The large amount of debris generated in the aftermath of hurricane and storm events can cause severe financial and logistical burdens to coastal communities. Existing debris estimation models mainly focus on wind-induced debris and produce estimates with errors of nearly 50\%, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive models that can account for other types of debris while improving accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a probabilistic framework to estimate the presence and amount of waterborne debris following a severe storm using machine learning (ML) techniques as a function of relevant storm and landcover parameters. Machine learning techniques are leveraged to generate debris presence and volume models, employing pre- and post-event aerial and satellite imagery and a debris removal database for Hurricane Ike, respectively. The results show that the ensemble learning algorithms perform the best for both tasks, with a misclassification error of 5.56\% for the debris presence predictive model, and a normalized root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 11.98 for the debris volume model, the lowest RMSE of the tested algorithms. Dual-layer ML models are also investigated, incorporating the debris presence as a predictor in the debris volume model. The results show a percent error of 11.29\% for the dual-layer model and an approximately 5.4\% increase in performance with respect to the model that does not incorporate debris presence. The generated debris volume and presence models will provide useful tools to inform decision-making, evaluate mitigation strategies, facilitate recovery efforts, and improve resource allocation following a storm event.

TI  - A New Method For Long-Term River Discharge Estimation Of Small- And Medium-Scale Rivers By Using Multisource Remote Sensing And Rshs: Application And Validation
AB  - River discharge is an important hydrological parameter of river water resources. Especially in small- and medium-scale rivers, data deficiency is the biggest problem for studies of river discharge. In recent years, remote sensing has become a rapid and convenient method to estimate river discharge. However, remote sensing images still have some difficulty generating continuous long-term river discharge. To address this problem, we developed a new method coupling the remote sensing hydrology station method (RSHS) with statistical regression downscaling, using data from optical satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), radar satellites (Sentinel-1), and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We applied this method to monitor monthly river discharge for small- and medium-scale rivers from 2016 to 2020 on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and evaluated the accuracy of the results. The results show that (1) by applying the newly constructed method, the water body continuity index obtained by Landsat-8 increased by 7\% and the average river length percentage in the channel reached 90.7\%, a 40\% increase; (2) there were only 10 river flow data points, on average, in the 5-year period obtained before this method was applied; after this method was applied, more than 50 river flow data points could be obtained, on average, extending the quantity of data fivefold; in addition, improper extreme values could also be avoided; (3) with better continuity of water body distribution, the images provided steadier river widths. The relative error of daily flow estimation from Landsat-8 images was reduced by 60\% and the mean percentage error was reduced by one-fourth. The relative error of the multisource remote sensing composited flow was reduced by 37\% with a reduction in the mean percentage error of over a half; (4) in addition, we found that when the threshold difference between water bodies and land in remote sensing images is more than 0.2, the impact of water body recognition error on flow accuracy can be ignored. This method helps to overcome the absence of remote sensing methods for the long-term estimation of flow series in small- and medium-scale rivers, improves the accuracy of remote sensing methods for calculating flow, and provides ideas for regional water resource management and utilization.

TI  - Coastal Phytoplankton Blooms Expand And Intensify In The 21st Century
AB  - Phytoplankton blooms in coastal oceans can be beneficial to coastal fisheries production and ecosystem function, but can also cause major environmental problems(1,2)-yet detailed characterizations of bloom incidence and distribution are not available worldwide. Here we map daily marine coastal algal blooms between 2003 and 2020 using global satellite observations at 1-km spatial resolution. We found that algal blooms occurred in 126 out of the 153 coastal countries examined. Globally, the spatial extent (+13.2\%) and frequency (+59.2\%) of blooms increased significantly (P < 0.05) over the study period, whereas blooms weakened in tropical and subtropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere. We documented the relationship between the bloom trends and ocean circulation, and identified the stimulatory effects of recent increases in sea surface temperature. Our compilation of daily mapped coastal phytoplankton blooms provides the basis for global assessments of bloom risks and benefits, and for the formulation or evaluation of management or policy actions.

TI  - Forest, Wetland And Biodiversity: Revealing Multi-Faceted Ecological Services From Ecorestoration Of A Degraded Tropical Landscape
AB  - With the deterioration of tropical forests, the loss of species, their habitat and linked socio-ecological degradation is regrettably becoming widespread. Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

TI  - Image To Attribute Model For Trees (Itam-T): Individual Tree Detection And Classification In Alberta Boreal Forest For Wildland Fire Fuel Characterization
AB  - Regional and municipal decision makers rely on fuel (vegetation) maps to inform decisions on tree stand management related to wildfire management and response. Remote sensing of trees is used in commercial applications but has limited uptake in the fire management community. A two-stage detection and identification convolutional network for high-resolution RGB drone imagery is developed to address this limitation. The detection routine is based on DeepForest, an existing convolutional neural network implementation designed to recognize trees in aerial imagery. Retraining the model and implementing an adaptive window-size workflow improves tree detection, with F-1 scores reaching 85\% and averaging 72\% for k-fold cross-validation in boreal forest. For classification, a VGG19 network with added data augmentation and dropout layers is trained. When this network is implemented, manually annotated trees are recognized as coniferous with an average F-1 of 97\% and deciduous with an 87\% F-1. Overall, the developed image-to-attribute model for trees reaches a maximum F-1 score of 85\% considering classification after identification, with averages of 72\% for coniferous trees and 57\% for deciduous trees over six sites. Tree height, size, and stem density are extracted from the tree location output and geometric data. The calculated density is compared to the density of manual annotations, with an average R-2 of 0.90. A remote preliminary proximity-based hazard assessment is performed on a rural property in Alberta, demonstrating the model's ability to detect and classify trees near values-at-risk. The results indicate a potential extension to low-cost decision support in enterprise and fire-related applications.

TI  - The First Generation Of A Regional-Scale 1-M Forest Canopy Cover Dataset Using Machine Learning And Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform: A Case Study Of Arkansas, Usa
AB  - Forest canopy cover (FCC) is essential in forest assessment and management, affecting ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, and water regulation. Ongoing advancements in techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping and extracting FCC information require a thorough evaluation of their validity and reliability. The primary objectives of this study are to: (1) create a large-scale forest FCC dataset with a 1-meter spatial resolution, (2) assess the regional spatial distribution of FCC at a regional scale, and (3) investigate differences in FCC areas among the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) and U.S. Forest Service Tree Canopy Cover products at various spatial scales in Arkansas (i.e., county and city levels). This study utilized high-resolution aerial imagery and a machine learning algorithm processed and analyzed using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to produce the FCC dataset. The accuracy of this dataset was validated using one-third of the reference locations obtained from the Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) dataset and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery with a 0.6-m spatial resolution. The results showed that the dataset successfully identified FCC at a 1-m resolution in the study area, with overall accuracy ranging between 83.31% and 94.35% per county. Spatial comparison results between the produced FCC dataset and the Hansen et al., 2013 and USFS products indicated a strong positive correlation, with R2 values ranging between 0.94 and 0.98 for county and city levels. This dataset provides valuable information for monitoring, forecasting, and managing forest resources in Arkansas and beyond. The methodology followed in this study enhances efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, as it enables the processing of large-scale datasets with high computational demands in a cloud-based environment. It also demonstrates that machine learning and cloud computing technologies can generate high-resolution forest cover datasets, which might be helpful in other regions of the world. © 2023

TI  - Emergency Post-Fire Rehabilitation Treatment Effects On Burned Area Ecology And Long-Term Restoration
AB  - The predicted continuation of strong drying and warming trends in the southwestern United States underlies the associated prediction of increased frequency, area, and severity of wildfires in the coming years. As a result, the management of wildfires and fire effects on public lands will continue to be a major land management priority for the foreseeable future. Following fire suppression, the first land management process to occur on burned public lands is the rapid assessment and emergency treatment recommendations provided by the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team. These teams of specialists follow a dynamic protocol to make post-fire treatment decisions based on the best available information using a range of landscape assessment, predictive modeling, and informational tools in combination with their collective professional expertise. Because the mission of a BAER team is to assess burned landscape and determine if stabilization treatments are needed to protect valued resources from the immediate fire effects, the evaluation of treatment success generally does not include important longer term ecological effects of these treatments or the fates of the materials applied over the burned landscape. New tools and techniques that have been designed or modified for BAER team use are presented in conjunction with current post-fire treatment effectiveness monitoring and research. In addition, a case is made to monitor longer term treatment effects on recovering ecosystems and to make these findings available to BAER teams.

TI  - Mapping Croplands With A Long History Of Crop Cultivation Using Time Series Of Modis Vegetation Indices
AB  - In the study, a method of automated detection of croplands and natural grasslands using multi-year time series of the vegetation indices was developed and implemented. The methodology is based on a new recognition feature enabling identification of all lands cultivated over a long period. The new recognition feature was calculated from time series of the MODIS vegetation indices. It takes into account both intraseasonal and interannual characteristics of the vegetation period for arable lands with spring and winter crops, as well as for natural grasslands. The methodology determines: the procedure of obtaining time series of the NDVI and EVI vegetation indices for the period from March to November in the given years; generalization of the time series by land cover categories and agro-climatic zones; dates for calculating the recognition feature in each zone; calculation of the recognition feature; adaptation of the decision rules to the regional environmental conditions (threshold values for the agroclimatic zones); procedure of classification into croplands and grasslands. Croplands within the territory of the European part of Russia were mapped for the period from 2000 to 2016. The assessment of recognition accuracy and comparison of the results with the existing products confirm that the developed recognition feature can be successfully used for cropland detection and can improve the accuracy of data interpretation when applied along with other features.

TI  - Fuel Modelling Characterisation Using Low-Density Lidar In The Mediterranean: An Application To A Natural Protected Area
AB  - Fuel structure and characteristics are important to better understand and predict wildfire behaviour. The aim of the present study was to develop a methodology for characterising fuel models using low-density and free LiDAR data that facilitate the work of managers of protected territories. Field inventories were carried out in order to understand the characteristics of the stand and the variables that fuel models must include. This information, together with the use of the intensity and structure provided by LiDAR, was used to perform statistical analyses. The linear regressions obtained to characterise the stand of the mixed Quercus spp.-Pinus ssp.-dominated stand had an R-2 value ranging from 0.4393 to 0.66. While working with low-density LiDAR data (which has more difficulties crossing the canopy), in addition to the obtained results, we performed the statistical analysis of the dominant stand to obtain models with R-2 values ranging from 0.8201 to 0.8677. The results of this research show that low-density LiDAR data are significant; however, in mixed stands, it is necessary to only use the dominant stratum because other components generate noise, which reduces the predictive capacity of the models. Additionally, by using the decision tree developed in combination, it is possible to update the mapping of fuel models in inaccessible areas, thereby significantly reducing costs.

TI  - Monitoring Soil Elements For Irrigation Management Using Internet Of Things (Iot) Sensors
AB  - Smart farming focuses on three crucial areas: soil quality, weather conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant impact of weather and irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly integrated with smart environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients) systems for a holistic approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing soil monitoring, giving farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize disease risks, and rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible to measure various parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels, and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors is then transmitted to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth analysis, visual representation, and trend identification. The application of the IoT in agriculture is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential pillar of precision agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management of resources. Smart sensor systems provide more information about water and crop water requirements. This information can be used to mechanically manage the water supply system and help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information acquired by the first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article proposes and evaluates the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were selected to test the IoT system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically designed for soil and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil pH, moisture, and NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation water pH and turbidity sensors exhibited notably precise measurements. The results were noteworthy, with an R2 value surpassing 90% across all sensor measurements. These IoT sensors could facilitate effective crop monitoring without excessive expenditures and serve to safeguard groundwater from nutrient contamination. © 2023 Policy Studies Organization.

TI  - Evaluating Remote Sensing Approaches For Mapping The Bathymetry Of Lake Manzala, Egypt
AB  - Lake Manzala is considered the largest lagoon in Egypt. The lake has significant economic and environmental impacts that should be managed based on management models. The bathymetry of this lake, which is time consuming and laborious to obtain in the field, is one of the key input files for developing hydrological models of the lake. Remote sensing technology is used to determine satellite bathymetric maps with reasonable accuracy. The objective of the present work was to utilize Landsat 8 satellite imagery to determine the bathymetry of Lake Manzala. Generalized linear model (GLM), artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree, bagging (BAG, an ensemble regression algorithm), least-squares boosting fitting ensemble (LSB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were used in this study to process the images and manage the database of each image. The Landsat images were corrected for atmospheric conditions and the sunglint effect. Then values from the logarithms of corrected reflectance bands (coastal, blue, green, and red) and their ratio logarithms at locations corresponding to GPS surveys were extracted. Two assessing metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation (R), were used to calibrate the derived logarithm values for the model using observed data for the lake. The results show that the BAG and decision tree approaches perform well for Lake Manzala. Such methodologies should be applied for bathymetry determination, especially for shallow lakes, to save monitoring effort and costs. This approach facilitates the development of management models for lakes.

TI  - Geoinformation Support For Safe Operation Of Pipeline Transport
AB  - The relevance of the research is determined by the need to minimize the losses at all stages of the cycle of processing and transportation of hydrocarbon raw materials and reduce environmental pollution from leaks in pipelines. Ensuring the safety of the functioning of pipeline systems requires performing operational assessments of situations at any of natural and economic objects within pipeline segment. The most advanced tools for solving analytical problems are technologies of geoinformation mapping. The general purpose of the created cartographic images is to help in organizing the safe placement of industrial facilities during construction and performing environmentalgeodynamic monitoring during pipeline operation. The main aim was to analyze the possibilities of using various geospatial information that contributes to the safe operation of pipeline systems, processed through geoinformation technologies. To achieve this goal, the work examines the domestic and international experience in preventing and eliminating oil spills, and develops requirements for GIS technology that accumulates information about natural and man-made processes. Objects. Composition of information and modules for simulation environment composed of GIS must contain the software for analysis of condition of the components of pipeline infrastructure: primary and backup threads, loopings, branches, bends, site and on-site facilities, industrial buildings, tanks, process piping, etc., and preparation of cartographic materials to ensure prevention and organization of emergency. Methods: decoding of aerospace images of pipeline systems, analysis of space survey materials, data from unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, studying the possibilities of technologies of geoinformation mapping, computer modeling of the state of natural-anthropogenic complexes. Results. The authors have analyzed the regulatory documents that determine the composition of the information necessary for formation of GIS thematic layers on the state of environmental components and the dynamics of natural processes along the routes of pipeline systems. The modules of the information system concentrate data on the disturbance and pollution of the environment, allowing you to create maps of man-made impact scenarios and formulate recommendations for assessing the state and reducing negative consequences. The work shown that the data of remote sensing of the Earth with different spatial resolutions, unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial laser scanning, accurate geodetic reference make it possible to form arrays of geospatial data required for modeling. The environmental safety of hydrocarbon transport is ensured by modeling the development of natural processes that have negative impact on the objects of the pipeline system. For example, when pipeline sections are flooded during floods, as well as when oil and petroleum products enter watercourses, it is necessary to use high-precision digital terrain models. It is proposed to include modules in system that support the analysis of observational data and facilitate decision-making depending on the scenarios of process dynamics, including in the case of emergency oil spills. Conclusions. The significance of the work performed is to develop a methodology for solving a number of issues that contribute to decision-making to minimize the risk of possible accidents during the operation of pipeline systems. The practical value of the proposed technology for collecting and processing primary information for filling databases of geoinformation systems is that it allows you to obtain information sufficient for decision-making in preparation of plans for preventive measures and the elimination of emergency oil spills and the organization of emergency recovery operations. © 2021 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

TI  - Classification Of County Leading Function Types And Pattern Recognition Of Its Spatial Structure Based On Multi-Source Data
AB  - It is of great significance to study the types of dominant function at county level and analyze the spatial structure pattern for the guidance and planning regulation of regional comprehensive, coordinated, and sustainable development. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, this paper uses K-means clustering analysis to classify 124 dominant functional areas of county units. Based on the Tencent location big data, the spatial structure index was constructed using the rank-size rule. The spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were identified and analyzed by combining remote sensing data. Research results show that, firstly, the use of statistics, remote sensing, social media, night lighting multi-source data, and K means clustering method in county dominant function classification can get nice results, which can objectively reflect the features of area. The dominant function of counties in Guangdong can be divided into five classes, including ecological leading, agricultural leading, industry leadership, center service, and balanced developmental. Secondly, the rank-size law method based on Tencent location big data can break through the city scale. It can be used together with the quantitative analysis of remote sensing data in the study of spatial structure pattern recognition at the meso-county scale. Thirdly, the average value of spatial structure index of agriculture-oriented and ecology-oriented counties is greater than 1, showing a trend of single center spatial structure. The mean value of spatial structure index of industrial dominated county is less than 1, showing a polycentric spatial structure trend. The mean value of spatial structure index of balanced development county is close to 1. There are differences in spatial structure characteristics of balanced development county in different regions. Fourthly, the spatial structure patterns of the counties with different dominant functions were significantly different. The ecology-dominated counties showed a single central pole core pattern, while the agriculture-dominated counties showed a single central pole core and scattered point pattern. The balanced development counties had obvious coexistence characteristics of multiple patterns, while the industrial-dominated counties showed a multi-center network distribution pattern. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - The Climate Adaptive Characteristics Of Urban Inside/Outside Water Bodies Based On Their Cooling Effect In Poyang And Dongting Lake Regions, China
AB  - Most publications have focused on the cooling effect of urban inside water bodies. However, the climate adaptive characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies is seldom studied. In this paper, three types of water bodies, i.e., urban inside water bodies, urban outside discrete water bodies and large water bodies are identified according to their relative spatial relationships with built-up areas. The climate adaptive landscape characteristics of water bodies are analyzed based on water bodies' cooling effect (WCE) inside and outside cities in the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake regions. Seventy-three Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images acquired from 1989 to 2019 are employed. Landscape scale characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies are described by area, water depth, perimeter to area ratio (PARA) and distance-weighted area index (DWAI). Three temperature-related parameters are calculated to estimate the WCE in different conditions. Climate adaptive characteristics of water bodies inside/outside cities are determined by corre-lation and regression analysis. Results show that: 1) The long river shape, depth, orientation and fluidity of urban inside water bodies are benefit to enhance their cooling effect; 2) the distance of urban outside water bodies from built-up areas are positive correlated with their cooling effect; 3) the optimal acreage of large water bodies are >2500 km2 and 1111-1287.5 km2 for climate adaption of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, respectively. Simultaneously, the WCE of urban outside large water bodies is related with human activities and climate conditions. The results of our study provide a significant contribution to blue-space planning in cities, and provide insights into actionable climate adaption planning in inland large lake areas.

TI  - An Adaptive Method For Identifying Marine Areas Of High Conservation Priority
AB  - Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14 species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress. Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3 primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human activities, and alterations in the marine environment.

TI  - Mining Subsidence Monitoring Using Distributed Scatterers Insar Based On Goldstein Filter And Fisher Information Matrix-Weighted Optimization
AB  - Due to the shortcomings of traditional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technologies in mining subsidence monitoring, such as a low density of monitoring points and difficulty obtaining fine surface deformation information, this paper proposes a mining area surface deformation monitoring method based on distributed scatterers InSAR while improving the phase information optimization strategy. This method obtains homogeneous points using the hypothesis test of confidence interval algorithm and constructs an adaptive phase optimization method based on the Goldstein principal phase filtering and Fisher information matrix weighting. It effectively preserves the information of deformation fringes, particularly in regions with dense interferometric fringes, and obtains detailed deformation information from the study area through time processing. In the experiments, 63 Sentinel-1 images were used to extract surface subsidence information for the Peibei mining area from September 24, 2018, to November 12, 2020. Compared with the Permanent Scatterers InSAR (PS-InSAR) results, the point density increased by a factor of 4.2. The correlation coefficient between the homonymous points obtained with the two methods and the deformation rate is 0.94, indicating that they have a good consistency. The monitoring results show that the six mining areas in Peibei have different degrees of subsidence during the monitoring period with a clear nonlinear trend, and the maximum cumulative subsidence over time exceeds 350 mm. The analysis shows that the improved DS-InSAR monitoring results are in line with the general law of mining subsidence and have practical application value.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Snow Depth Retrieval At Sub-Kilometer Resolution Over The European Alps
AB  - Seasonal snow is an essential water resource in many mountain regions. However, the spatio-temporal variability in mountain snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) at regional to global scales is not well understood due to the lack of high-resolution satellite observations and robust retrieval algorithms. We investigate the ability of the Sentinel-1 mission to monitor snow depth at sub-kilometer (100 m, 500 m, and 1 km) resolutions over the European Alps for 2017-2019. The Sentinel-1 backscatter observations, especially in cross-polarization, show a high correlation with regional model simulations of snow depth over Austria and Switzerland. The observed changes in radar backscatter with the accumulation or ablation of snow are used in an empirical change detection algorithm to retrieve snow depth. The algorithm includes the detection of dry and wet snow conditions. Compared to in situ measurements at 743 sites in the European Alps, dry snow depth retrievals at 500 m and 1 km resolution have a spatio-temporal correlation of 0.89. The mean absolute error equals 20 \%-30 \% of the measured values for snow depths between 1.5 and 3 m. The performance slightly degrades for retrievals at the finer 100 m spatial resolution as well as for retrievals of shallower and deeper snow. The results demonstrate the ability of Sentinel-1 to provide snow estimates in mountainous regions where satellite-based estimates of snow mass are currently lacking. The retrievals can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography and benefit a number of applications, such as water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction. However, future research is recommended to further investigate the physical basis of the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to snow accumulation.

TI  - A Network To Understand The Changing Socio-Ecology Of The Southern African Woodlands (Seosaw): Challenges, Benefits, And Methods
AB  - Societal Impact Statement The sustainable management of the southern African woodlands is closely linked to the livelihoods of over 150 M people. Findings from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands (SEOSAW) will underpin the sustainability of two of the largest industries on the continent: woodfuels and timber. SEOSAW will also improve our understanding of how human use shapes the biogeography and functioning of these ecosystems. Summary Here we describe a new network of researchers and long-term, in situ, measurements that will characterize the changing socio-ecology of the woodlands of southern Africa. These woodlands encompass the largest savanna in the world, but are chronically understudied, with few long-term measurements. A network of permanent sample plots (PSPs) is required to: (a) address management issues, particularly related to sustainable harvesting for energy and timber; (b) understand how the woodlands are responding to a range of global and local drivers, such as climate change, CO2 fertilization, and harvesting; and (c) answer basic questions about biogeography, ecosystem function, and the role humans play in shaping the ecology of the region. We draw on other successful networks of PSPs and adapt their methods to the specific challenges of working in southern African woodlands. In particular we suggest divergences from established forest monitoring protocols that are needed to (a) adapt to a high level of ecosystem structural diversity (from open savanna to dry forest); (b) quantify the chronic disturbances by people, fire, and herbivores; (c) quantify the diversity and function of the understory of grasses, forbs, and shrubs; (d) understand the life histories of resprouting trees; and (e) conduct work in highly utilized, human-dominated landscapes. We conclude by discussing how the SEOSAW network will integrate with remote sensing and modeling approaches. Throughout, we highlight the challenges inherent to integrating work by forest and savanna ecologists, and the wide range of skills needed to fully understand the socio-ecology of the southern African woodlands.

TI  - Emergent Challenges For Science Suas Data Management: Fairness Through Community Engagement And Best Practices Development
AB  - The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) as platforms for data capture has rapidly increased in recent years. However, while there has been significant investment in improving the aircraft, sensors, operations, and legislation infrastructure for such, little attention has been paid to supporting the management of the complex data capture pipeline sUAS involve. This paper reports on a four-year, community-based investigation into the tools, data practices, and challenges that currently exist for particularly researchers using sUAS as data capture platforms. The key results of this effort are: (1) sUAS captured data-as a set that is rapidly growing to include data in a wide range of Physical and Environmental Sciences, Engineering Disciplines, and many civil and commercial use cases-is characterized as both sharing many traits with traditional remote sensing data and also as exhibiting-as common across the spectrum of disciplines and use cases-novel characteristics that require novel data support infrastructure; and (2), given this characterization of sUAS data and its potential value in the identified wide variety of use case, we outline eight challenges that need to be addressed in order for the full value of sUAS captured data to be realized. We conclude that there would be significant value gained and costs saved across both commercial and academic sectors if the global sUAS user and data management communities were to address these challenges in the immediate to near future, so as to extract the maximal value of sUAS captured data for the lowest long-term effort and monetary cost.

TI  - Local 3d Scene Fine Detection Analysis Of Circular Landform On The Southern Edge Of Dinosaur Valley
AB  - With the continuous advancement of low-altitude UAV (unmanned air vehicle, UAV) technology for the earth observation and its wide popularity, UAV photogrammetry and SfM (Structure from Motion, SfM) methods have received more and more attention as the latest means to obtain true 3D realistic models of the survey area. As the newest means of measuring geomorphological information, UAV low-altitude photogrammetry and SfM methods can quickly obtain a true 3D realistic model of the survey area, and have been applied to a number of research fields. In this paper, the UAV is used to measure the typical local scene of annular landform at the southern edge of Dinosaur Valley in Lufeng, and the high-resolution geomorphological image data of the investigated area are obtained. Combined with the SFM method, a realistic 3D scene model is constructed, and its geomorphological characteristics are discussed and analyzed. The experimental results show that the DSM (digital surface model, DSM) data based on the SFM method can obtain ground points by filtering, diluting, and classifying the data, and the DEM (digital elevation model, DEM) data with a resolution of 0.2m is constructed by using the progressive encrypted triangular mesh method, which can accurately represent the true geomorphological characteristics of the study area. (2) Construction of three typical elevation profiles of the circular scene “inner-middle-outer,” and comparative analysis of the profiles confirmed that the topography of the study area is characterized by the dome ridge line AA' as the main highland ridge line, showing a circular “basin margin” pattern, with gradually decreasing elevations on the inner and outer sides. (3) In order to reveal the complex tectonic geomorphological features of the external scene between the ridge and trough, the ArcGIS surface analysis method was used to extract the ridge lines J1-J7. Accurate quantitative measurements and analysis were carried out to investigate the slope, slope length, slope direction, ridge area face, and other related parameters. (4) Using the multi-view visual interpretation and typical scene analysis of the three-dimensional 3D model, micro-geomorphological features such as the development of washouts in the survey area and the nodal laminar surface of the geological body can be clearly identified. In addition, the coordinates of the geological body’s spatial location and its production, spreading area, square volume, and other rich geological information can be accurately obtained. Through the above experimental study on the detection of 3D scenes of landforms, the advantages of UAV measurement technology and SFM method to construct DSM data and 3D scene models in fine geological structure detection are demonstrated. This will have an important application prospect and practical value for geological survey, monitoring , prevention and control management in mountainous areas.In addition, the fast, low-cost, high-precision, and non-contact measurement mode can provide accurate data basis and technical support for geological structure detection, geological disaster investigation, risk assessment and prevention and control management. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.

TI  - The Use Of Innovative Techniques For Management Of High-Risk Coastal Areas, Mitigation Of Earthquake-Triggered Landslide Risk And Responsible Coastal Development
AB  - Coastal areas constitute a very dynamic environment, balancing between numerous natural and anthropogenic processes liable to sometimes hazardous geomorphic phenomena. Especially in tectonically active coastal regions and areas of high economic value, slope failures can have significant impacts and therefore need careful and detailed examination. This work uses Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-aided photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) in tectonically active segments of the coastal zone of the Ionian Islands in Greece, to explore how their capabilities can help to improve our understanding of the structural integrity of the slopes. Results show that the two approaches are able to extract large numbers of discontinuity facets, in a more practical, rapid and safe way than conventional methods of rock slope stability analysis extending to unreachable yet important parts of the slope. Through this holistic record of the structural condition of the slope the two applications allow the identification of segments that are more prone to instability and failure. In this way, they improve our understanding of the prioritization of interventions aiming to enhance the prevention of slope failures, mitigating the associated risk and improving local development in these high-value locations.

TI  - Neutrosophic Game Pricing Methods With Risk Aversion For Pricing Of Data Products
AB  - With the progressive development of satellite image data products, their pricing strategies become more and more important for enterprises to earn profits. The objective of this study is to explore several game pricing methods with risk aversion for pricing of data products in neutrosophic environments. First, to reflect the uncertainty of problem parameters, the idea of neutrosophic variables is adopted. With the aid of neutrosophic variables, the truth, indeterminacy and falsity degrees of players can be intuitively and conveniently obtained. Subsequently, considering the risk aversion of decision makers, the optimistic value theory is introduced into neutrosophic variables for calculating the optimistic value of player's profits. Then, different pricing models are constructed under the Bertrand and Stackelberg game scenarios, respectively. After deriving the corresponding equilibrium equations, some numerical instances are provided to testify the feasibility of our methods. Furthermore, the influences of dissimilar market power structures are examined. Finally, the effects of seven problem parameters and players' confidence levels on pricing results are investigated through sensitivity analyses. The results show that the proposed methods are practicable and can offer guidance for the pricing decision of data products.

TI  - Soil Erosion Estimates In Arid Region: A Case Study Of The Koutine Catchment, Southeastern Tunisia
AB  - Soil erosion remains one of the principal environmental problems in arid regions. This study aims to assess and quantify the variability of soil erosion in the Koutine catchment using the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) model. The Koutine catchment is located in an arid area in southeastern Tunisia and is characterized by an annual mean precipitation of less than 200 mm. The model was used to examine the influence of topography, extreme rainstorm intensity and soil texture on soil loss. The data used for model validation were obtained from field measurements by monitoring deposited sediment in settlement basins of 25 cisterns (a traditional water harvesting and storage technique) over 4 years, from 2015 to 2018. Results showed that slope is the most controlling factor of soil loss. The average annual soil loss in monitoring sites varies between 0.01 and 12.5 t/ha/y. The storm events inducing the largest soil losses occurred in the upstream part of the Koutine catchment with a maximum value of 7.3 t/ha per event. Soil erosion is highly affected by initial and preceding soil conditions. The RUSLE model reasonably reproduced (R-2 = 0.81) the spatiotemporal variability of measured soil losses in the study catchment during the observation period. This study revealed the importance of using the cisterns in the data-scarce dry areas as a substitute for the classic soil erosion monitoring fields. Besides, combining modeling of outputs and field measurements could improve our physical understanding of soil erosion processes and their controlling factors in an arid catchment. The study results are beneficial for decision-makers to evaluate the existing soil conservation and water management plans, which can be further adjusted using appropriate soil erosion mitigation options based on scientific evidence.

TI  - Evaluation Of River Water Quality In A Tropical South Sumatra Wetland During Covid-19 Pandemic Period
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak affected the world badly in this 21st century leading to the closure of all types of anthropogenic activities. It is declared that there was an environmental betterment in names of water quality and air quality during the COVID-19 period. In this study, we analyzed the improvement in water quality by evaluating the suspended particulate matter (SPM) using the remote sensing technique in a tropical South Sumatra wetland i.e., Musi River in Southern Sumatra, Indonesia. The SPM values were estimated from Landsat 8 images Level-2 product. A quantitative and spatial analyses of before (20th May 2019), during (22nd May 2020), and after COVID-19 (28th May 2022) periods were also calculated. Results revealed that the mean SPM values during COVID-19 period (4.56 mg/L) were lower than that before COVID-19 period (8.33 mg/L). Surprisingly, SPM showed an increase of 54\% in SPM values after COVID-19 period, compared with during COVID-19 period. The role of human activities including industrial and domestic wastes during the restriction period was the main reason for alteration of pollution loads in the river. Outputs of this study can be used to arrange policies for the sustainable management of aquatic environments and water resources.

TI  - Difficult Airway Equipment: A Survey Of Standards Across Metropolitan Perth
AB  - The importance of appropriate equipment to manage the difficult airway has been highlighted by the publication of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) guidelines in 2012. We set out to audit compliance with these guidelines in all public and private sites providing general anaesthesia in metropolitan Perth. Public and private healthcare websites identified 39 sites of which 37 were studied. Institutional and ethics approval was obtained. A tick-box design audit tool, based on the ANZCA guidelines, was used to collect information regarding the dedicated difficult airway container (DDAC) at each site. As recommended in the guidelines, only equipment within the DDAC was considered. Further data about each site, including the number of theatre suites, satellite anaesthetic areas, use of capnography and categories of patients treated (adult, obstetric and paediatric) were collected. An adult DDAC was found at 92% of all sites, but none of the sites had all the essential equipment listed in the ANZCA guidelines. There was limited provision of adult difficult airway equipment within private sites compared to public, and less provision of paediatric difficult airway equipment across all sites treating paediatric patients in metropolitan Perth. Capnography was available in 76% of post anaesthesia care units and used regularly in 27%. Adherence to the ANZCA guidelines regarding the DDAC could be improved. Standardised equipment across a metropolitan region would be of value in the management of the difficult airway.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Vegetation Productivity Predicts Breeding Activity And Drought Refuges For A Threatened Bird In Semi-Arid Australia
AB  - Refuges play a critical role protecting species against the effects of climate change. Managing high priority refuges could improve species resilience and facilitate dispersal during periods of environmental change. In this study, we identified drought refuges in semi-arid Australia for a threatened bird, the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata. Using a Poisson regression model, we quantified the effect of remotely sensed vegetation indices, rainfall, soil moisture and site characteristics on malleefowl breeding activity at 144 sites surveyed from 2000 to 2017 during and after drought. We tested the effect of two vegetation productivity indices on malleefowl breeding activity - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) - averaged across three temporal and three spatial scales during the mound building and incubation stage of the breeding cycle. We found that NDVI and EVI were better predictors of malleefowl breeding activity than soil moisture and winter rainfall. The model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value contained NDVI averaged over 3 months (June-August) and a 1-km radius. Malleefowl breeding activity had a strong positive association with NDVI (0.42 +/- se 0.03) and a negative association with slope (-0.34 +/- se 0.03) and vegetation patch size (-0.23 +/- se 0.02). We found the proportion of refugia (top 20\% of predicted breeding activity) in protected areas was highly variable, decreasing from 42\% in an extreme wet year (2011) to 14\% in an extreme drought year (2007). Expanding the reserve network to include refugia predicted to occur in the south of semi-arid Victoria could improve resilience of malleefowl to climate change. We demonstrate how remotely sensed vegetation indices combined with citizen science data can identify where to protect native vegetation with high, stable productivity. Our approach could be applied to a broad range of species in semi-arid regions vulnerable to climate change.

TI  - The Utility Of Random Forests For Wildfire Severity Mapping
AB  - Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95\%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74\%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6\%-21\%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55\%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.

TI  - Stand Delineation And Composition Estimation Using Semi-Automated Individual Tree Crown Analysis
AB  - Stand delineation and species composition estimation are cornerstones of forest inventory mapping and key elements to forest management decision making. Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions. High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25%. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20%, but a few were up to 30%. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI  - Collective Forest Tenure Reform And Forest Conditions: Evidence From The Social-Ecological System In Southwest China
AB  - China's recent collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve forest conditions by devolution of forest management rights from community collectives to individual households. Studies reveal substantial local variation in CFTR implementation, but the ecological effects and underlying mechanism have received little attention. Our study focused on community-managed forests and household-managed forests in four communities located in the mountains of Southwest China. The objective was to investigate the relationship between CFTR and forest conditions at the local scale. We employed a combination of remote sensing technology, field forest observations and socioeconomic surveys to gather data for analysis. The results showed that the forest cover change trends of collective forests and household forests in each community were consistent from 1994 to 2014. There was no significant relationship between CFTR implementation and local-level differences in species diversity and soil fertility in forests. The aboveground biomass of collective forests was significantly higher than that of household forests. Differentiated access and use, low compensation amounts, and loose payment terms jointly affected CFTR's effectiveness to improve local-scale forest conditions in the study area. Attempts to formalize forest tenure rights must be flexible enough and adapted to the local environment so that changes induced by the CFTR can improve local access to forest resources and its benefits.

TI  - Estimating Community-Level Plant Functional Traits In A Species-Rich Alpine Meadow Using Uav Image Spectroscopy
AB  - Plant functional traits at the community level (plant community traits hereafter) are commonly used in trait-based ecology for the study of vegetation–environment relationships. Previous studies have shown that a variety of plant functional traits at the species or community level can be successfully retrieved by airborne or spaceborne imaging spectrometer in homogeneous, species-poor ecosystems. However, findings from these studies may not apply to heterogeneous, species-rich ecosystems. Here, we aim to determine whether unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imaging could adequately estimate plant community traits in a species-rich alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. To achieve this, we compared the performance of four non-parametric regression models, i.e., partial least square regression (PLSR), the generic algorithm integrated with the PLSR (GA-PLSR), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for the retrieval of 10 plant community traits using visible and near-infrared (450–950 nm) UAV hyperspectral imaging. Our results show that chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoid content, starch content, specific leaf area and leaf thickness were estimated with good accuracies, with the highest R2 values between 0.64 (nRMSE = 0.16) and 0.83 (nRMSE = 0.11). Meanwhile, the estimation accuracies for nitrogen content, phosphorus content, plant height and leaf dry matter content were relatively low, with the highest R2 varying from 0.3 (nRMSE = 0.24) to 0.54 (nRMSE = 0.20). Among the four tested algorithms, the GA-PLSR produced the highest accuracy, followed by PLSR and XGBoost, and RF showed the poorest performance. Overall, our study demonstrates that UAV-based visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging has the potential to accurately estimate multiple plant community traits for the natural grassland ecosystem at a fine scale. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Assessment Of Tropical Cyclone Rainfall From Gsmap And Gpm Products And Their Application To Analog Forecasting In The Philippines
AB  - Tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall is both a resource and a hazard in the Philippines. Observation of its spatiotemporal distribution is necessary for water and disaster mitigation management. This study evaluated the performance of two high-resolution satellite precipitation datasets-the GSMaP and GPM-IMERG-in estimating accumulated TC rainfall in the Philippines from 2000 to 2021. TC rain is defined as rainfall within 5 degrees of a TC center. Several estimation algorithms were included in the assessment. The uncalibrated near-real-time GSMaP\_NRT and early version GPM\_ER, the reanalysis GSMaP\_RNL, and the gauge-calibrated GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G. The assessment shows the worst scores for the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT and GSMaP\_RNL, followed by GPM\_ER with station correlation coefficient (CC) values of 0.63, 0.67, and 0.73, respectively, compared to GSMaP\_G CC of 0.79 and GPM\_G CC of 0.77. GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G also gave the least bias and error, with a consistently high (>0.6) probability of detection (POD) and Pierce skill score (PSS) up to rainfall of 300 mm. In addition to the evaluation, the GSMaP\_G and GPM\_G were used in the analog forecasting of TC rain. Analog forecasting is based on the principle that past weather conditions can occur again. In TC rain analog forecasting, past TCs with similar intensities and tracks are assumed to bring similar rainfall amounts and distribution as a current TC. Composite mean TC rainfall from historical satellite precipitation estimations was produced to create TC rain forecasts. Results show the analog TC rain forecasts generally captured the spatial distribution of TC rain and performed better than the uncalibrated GSMaP\_NRT, with a mean station correlation of 0.62-0.67, POD greater than 0.7, and positive PSS indicating good skills. However, forecasts have a false alarm ratio greater than 0.8 for 150 mm rain and have difficulty producing extreme rainfall (>250 mm).

TI  - A Blind Convolutional Deep Autoencoder For Spectral Unmixing Of Hyperspectral Images Over Waterbodies
AB  - Harmful algal blooms have dangerous repercussions for biodiversity, the ecosystem, and public health. Automatic identification based on remote sensing hyperspectral image analysis provides a valuable mechanism for extracting the spectral signatures of harmful algal blooms and their respective percentage in a region of interest. This paper proposes a new model called a non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing to perform endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation. The model is assessed in benchmark datasets, such as Jasper Ridge and Samson. Additionally, a case study of the HSI2 image acquired by NASA over Lake Erie in 2017 is conducted for extracting optical water types. The results using the proposed model for the benchmark datasets improve unmixing performance, as indicated by the spectral angle distance compared to five baseline algorithms. Improved results were obtained for various metrics. In the Samson dataset, the proposed model outperformed other methods for water (0.060) and soil (0.025) endmember extraction. Moreover, the proposed method exhibited superior performance in terms of mean spectral angle distance compared to the other five baseline algorithms. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing approach achieved better results for abundance map estimation, with a root mean square error of 0.091 for water and 0.187 for soil, compared to the ground truth. For the Jasper Ridge dataset, the non-symmetrical autoencoder for the spectral unmixing model excelled in the tree (0.039) and road (0.068) endmember extraction and also demonstrated improved results for water abundance maps (0.1121). The proposed model can identify the presence of chlorophyll-a in waterbodies. Chlorophyll-a is an essential indicator of the presence of the different concentrations of macrophytes and cyanobacteria. The non-symmetrical autoencoder for spectral unmixing achieves a value of 0.307 for the spectral angle distance metric compared to a reference ground truth spectral signature of chlorophyll-a. The source code for the proposed model, as implemented in this manuscript, can be found at https://github.com/EstefaniaAlfaro/autoencoder\_owt\_spectral.git.

TI  - Analysis Of Extreme Rainfall And Natural Disasters Events Using Satellite Precipitation Products In Different Regions Of Brazil
AB  - The number of natural disasters triggered by extreme events is increasing worldwide and significantly impacts modern society. Extreme rainfall is one of the most important factors contributing to these events. A better understanding of the physical process that causes extreme rainfall can allow rapid responses from decision-makers to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the local population. Satellite monitoring is widely used for this purpose and is essential for regions where terrestrial observations are limited or non-existent. The primary purpose of this study is to describe the performance of satellite products for extreme rainfall events that caused natural disasters in various climate regimes in Brazil and discuss the contribution of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) to these events. We defined regions based on the climatological rainfall distribution. Cases with rain values above the 99th percentile during 2012-2016 were considered statistically extreme. Our analysis is based on three datasets, with precipitation from (i) rain gauge stations, (ii) different satellite-based estimates, and (iii) mesoscale convective tracking data. The methodology was based on identifying extreme rainfall events, analyzing the performance of satellite precipitation estimates and, finally, quantifying the influence of convective systems on extreme rain. Although all regions of Brazil may be affected by natural disasters caused by extreme rains, the results suggest that the impacts caused in each region are different in magnitude. Convective systems explained over 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in Brazil's south and about 60\% to 90\% of extreme rains in the case analyzed in the Northeast. In general, satellite products have identified rain events; however, in the southern region of Brazil, products have tended to overestimate rainfall, while other regions have tended to underestimate extreme rain values. The methods used in satellite precipitation estimation products have limitations to accurately identifying specific extreme rain events.

TI  - Inclusive Development And Prioritization Of Review Questions In A Highly Controversial Field Of Regulatory Science
AB  - How to best assess potential health, environmental and other impacts of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and how to interpret the resulting evidence base have been long-standing controversial issues in the EU. As a response, transparency and inclusiveness became a major focus of regulatory science activities in the GMO impact area. Nevertheless, nearly three decades of controversies resulted in a heavily polarized policy environment, calling for further efforts. Against this backdrop the EU funded project GRACE explored the value of evidence synthesis approaches for GMO impact assessment and developed an evidence synthesis framework with a strong emphasis on openness, stakeholder engagement, transparency, and responsiveness to tackle regulatory science challenges. This framework was tested and implemented in the course of 14 systematic reviews or maps conducted on selected review questions spanning potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of GMOs. An inclusive development and pri-oritisation of review questions is of key importance in evidence synthesis as it helps to provide a better link between stakeholder demands and concerns and policy relevant outcomes. This paper, therefore, places a particular focus on the stakeholder involvement strategy developed and experiences gathered during this particular step in the course of the GRACE project. Based on this experience, possible lessons for future engagement exercises in highly controversial fields of regulatory science are discussed.

TI  - Review Of Remote Sensing-Based Methods For Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation: Progress, Challenges, And Prospects
AB  - Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for elucidating the global carbon cycle and the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change. © 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, And Learning (Meal) In Anticipatory Action-Earth Observation As A Game Changer
AB  - For many decades, humanitarian assistance relied on emergency response, triggering both funding and operational activities only after disaster impacts had been recorded. In recent years, many humanitarian actors have joined forces to complement traditional, reactive mechanisms with a forward-looking approach that can be activated before a disaster strikes. Anticipatory action (AA) uses forecasts of extreme weather events and combines them with risk information to identify and implement locally-led early actions with the goal of protecting lives and livelihoods more efficiently. AA is still a relatively new approach. Hence, monitoring, evaluation, accountability and learning (MEAL) is crucial to measure its effectiveness and adjust where necessary, as well as for (government) donors that want to see the added value of their investment maximized. However, evidence-based studies that investigate potential limitations and the exact impact pathway of AA at household level are time-consuming, costly, and therefore scarce. Satellite earth observation can become a game changer in AA by strengthening the evidence base via rapid, low-cost assessments. Both commercial and freely available satellite-derived data have reached an unprecedented level of quality, spatial, and temporal resolution. Simultaneously, there are major uncertainties regarding where, when, how, and under what conditions satellite data can support MEAL for AA at all. We argue that satellite data for an advanced MEAL framework should be considered already in the design phase of AA projects and that the translation of satellite data into actionable information will require a cross-cutting community of practice.

TI  - Review Of Remote Sensing Algorithms For Monitoring Forest Disturbance From Time Series And Multi-Source Data Fusion
AB  - Spatio-temporally explicit forest disturbance information is regarded as a critical mechanism for net ecosystem productivity. However, quantitative and spatio-temporally explicit information on forest disturbance is currently rare for most regions of the world. Unique among earth observation programs, Landsat data are systematically collected and archived following a global acquisition strategy. The provision of free, robust data products since 2008 has spurred a renaissance of interest in Landsat and resulted in an increasingly widespread use of Landsat Time Series (LTS) for multi-temporal characterizations. The science and application capacity of Landsat have developed steadily since 1972, with the increase in sophistication offered over time incorporated into Landsat processing and analysis practices. With the successful launch of Landsat-8, the continuity of measures at scales of relevance to management and scientific activities is ensured in a short time. The spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution offered by Landsat data is well suited, increasingly established, and operational in usage for forest management and analysis. Particularly, forest change detection algorithms based on LTS stack provide robust tools for detecting near real-time forest ecosystem changes, whereby a baseline of conditions can be determined for both abrupt and gradual changes and attributed to different drivers. Interest in LTS has been further enhanced by the recent introduction of several novel automated data processing techniques suitable for multi-temporal analysis, especially after the successful launch of highly spatio-temporal resolution satellites. The benefits are enabled by data availability, analysis-ready image products, increased computing power and storage, and sophisticated image processing approaches. Thus, change detection research for forest disturbance with time series remote sensing data has entered a brand-new stage. This review systematically summarizes the research progress and application of multi-temporal forest disturbance monitoring methods based on remote sensing data sources. Considering the significance and advantage of applying time series analysis in change detection, data availability selection, and data processing, various spectral indexes and dense time automatic monitoring methods for forest disturbance are analyzed extensively, and the characteristics of multi-source data and algorithms are summarized. Finally, the improvements based on the existing limitations are explored. At the time of this review, three forest disturbance change detection algorithms are commonly used for LTS: spectral variables, classification analysis, and trajectory analysis. Spectral-based techniques range from single-band reflectance to a host of indexes calculated from different algebraic manipulations of the original spectral bands and their derivatives. Classification-based techniques are an extension of traditional change detection techniques based on two-year images. Trajectory-based methods identify trends and breakpoints corresponding to disturbance events, stability, and recovery time, and they are useful for characterizing different disturbance regimes. The strength and limitations of each method prior to conducting an LTS analysis should be understood by forestry and remote sensing communities, who should ideally select a given method depending on their information needs. In summary, unprecedented advances in the assessment of forest disturbance have been realized in recent and future years using LTS data combined with other high spatial and temporal resolution imagery, especially domestic satellites as information sources. © 2018, Science Press.

TI  - Landscape Disturbance Gradients: The Importance Of The Type Of Scene When Evaluating Landscape Preferences And Perceptions
AB  - Understanding of people's landscape preferences is important for decision-making about land planning, particularly in the disturbance patterns that usually occur in rural-urban gradients. However, the use of different types of images concerning the same landscape may influence social preferences and thus perceptions of landscape management and planning decisions. We evaluated landscape preferences and perceptions in four landscapes of southern Chile. We specifically: (1) compared people's perceptions related to living in, visiting, the scenic beauty, well-being, risks, and level of landscape disturbance; and (2) evaluated the influence of the type of scene (i.e., eye-level or aerial images) in these preferences and perceptions. Preferences and perceptions resulted to be better when using eye-level (4.0 +/- 1.1) than aerial (3.7 +/- 0.6) images. In general, we observed a negative association between preferences and perceptions and the landscape disturbance; however, it was consistent when using aerial images but was masked when valuing landscape through eye-level images. Implications of these results are relevant because by far, most landscape preference studies use traditional eye-level images. Different types of scenes should be considered in order to embrace the landscape preferences and perceptions of all those involved and help decision-making in landscape planning.

TI  - Adaptive Estimation Of Aircraft Flight Parameters For Engine Health Monitoring System
AB  - An adaptive control approach to the implementation of on-line estimation of aircraft flight parameters for the engine health monitoring system is presented. The adaptive estimation system enables a fast reliable data prediction to replicate the missing or misleading data caused by malfunctions in the sensors or communication links, thereby compensating for the deficiency of data that can trigger fault diagnoses of engine health. The estimation method features the integration of an autoregression model and a self-tuning adaptation algorithm for one-step-ahead estimation, in which the manufacturer's baseline values are used as an input in conjunction with an adaptive input adjusted to minimize the estimate error deviated from the snapshot data taken from satellites. The entire system is implemented through the parameter identification and optimization in an attempt to minimize the estimate error. Stability of this adaptive estimation system is investigated, and discrete-time simulations of in-flight parameter estimation will also be presented to show the effectiveness of the present approach.

TI  - Crop Dominance Mapping With Irs-P6 And Modis 250-M Time Series Data
AB  - This paper describes an approach to accurately separate out and quantify crop dominance areas in the major command area in the Krishna River Basin. Classification was performed using IRS-P6 (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, series P6) and MODIS eight-day time series remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 23.6 m, 250 m for the year 2005. Temporal variations in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) pattern obtained in crop dominance classes enables a demarcation between long duration crops and short duration crops. The NDVI pattern was found to be more consistent in long duration crops than in short duration crops due to the continuity of the water supply. Surface water availability, on the other hand, was dependent on canal water release, which affected the time of crop sowing and growth stages, which was, in turn, reflected in the NDVI pattern. The identified crop-wise classes were tested and verified using ground-truth data and state-level census data. The accuracy assessment was performed based on ground-truth data through the error matrix method, with accuracies from 67\% to 100\% for individual crop dominance classes, with an overall accuracy of 79\% for all classes. The derived major crop land areas were highly correlated with the sub-national statistics with R-2 values of 87\% at the mandal (sub-district) level for 2005-2006. These results suggest that the methods, approaches, algorithms and datasets used in this study are ideal for rapid, accurate and large-scale mapping of paddy rice, as well as for generating their statistics over large areas. This study demonstrates that IRS-P6 23.6-m one-time data fusion with MODIS 250-m time series data is very useful for identifying crop type, the source of irrigation water and, in the case of surface water irrigation, the way in which it is applied. The results from this study have assisted in improving surface water and groundwater irrigated areas of the command area and also provide the basis for better water resource assessments at the basin scale.

TI  - Forecasting Terrestrial Water Storage For Drought Management In Ethiopia
AB  - Reliable seasonal forecasting of water resources variability may be of great value for agriculture and energy management in Ethiopia. This work aims to develop statistical forecasting of seasonal total water storage (TWS) anomalies in Ethiopia using sea-surface temperature and sea-level pressure indices. Because of the spatial and temporal variability of TWS over the country, Ethiopia is divided into four regions each having similar TWS dynamics. Periods of long-term water deficit observed in GRACE TWS products for the region are found to coincide with periods of meteorological drought. Multiple linear regression is employed to generate seasonal forecasting models for each region. We find that the skill of the resulting models varies from region to region, withR(2)from 0.33 to 0.73 and correlation from 0.27 to 0.77 between predicted and observed values (using leave-one-out cross-validation). The skill of the models is better than the climatology in all regions.

TI  - Sub-Nyquist Sampling And Measurement Of Mpsk Signal Based On Parameter Matching
AB  - Accurate measurement of the M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signal determined by finite parameters per unit of time is significant in engineering fields, such as digital microwave and satellite communication. In this article, we propose a sub-Nyquist sampling system with two channels for measuring characteristic parameters of MPSK signals based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) sampling theory. The carrier frequency parameter measurement process is modeled as a convex optimization problem, solvable using the parameter matching method on the estimated grid. The minimum harmonic frequency of the carrier is determined to build the exact grid, and the carrier frequency is estimated through a greedy search based on the given cost function. Even when the truth value of the carrier frequency is unknown, the discontinuity location parameters can be measured with high precision using the spectral estimation method on the Fourier coefficients of the MPSK signal. We propose an upper bound on the estimation error of this separable measurement method for signals with one segment. The amplitude and phase parameters can be measured by solving a least square problem. Our proposed measurement system, with lower hardware complexity, can accurately measure the MPSK signal with K segments by sampling only 2K + 5 points in a period, at a much lower sampling rate than the carrier frequency. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our state-of-the-art measurement method. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Tephra Clean-Up After The 2015 Eruption Of Calbuco Volcano, Chile: A Quantitative Geospatial Assessment In Four Communities
AB  - Reliable methods for volcanic impact and risk assessments are essential. They provide constructive information to emergency and disaster managers, critical infrastructure providers, the insurance industry, and wider society. Post-eruption clean-up of tephra deposits is a prevalent and expensive (time and resource) activity which is often not planned for. Here, we present an overview of the clean-up efforts undertaken in four communities after the VEI 4 eruption of Calbuco volcano in 2015. We narratively reconstruct clean-up efforts in Ensenada (Chile), Junín de los Andes (Argentina), San Martín de los Andes (Argentina), and Villa La Angostura (Argentina) using semi-structured interviews, syn- and post-deposition photographs, pre- and post-event visual spectrum satellite imagery, and media reports. We compare these reconstructions with estimates based on a geospatial modelling approach adapted from Hayes et al. (Journal of Applied Volcanology 6:1; 2017). Specifically, we compare reported and geospatially derived estimates for volume of tephra removed, and clean-up operation duration. Our modelling approach performed well for Junín de los Andes but did not adequately capture volume and clean-up operation duration for the three remaining case study locations. We discuss several sources of uncertainty (including observational errors and natural variance of tephra deposit thickness), reported tephra removal volume estimates, clean-up methods, land use, and temporal evolution of clean-up operation demand. Our work demonstrates the utility of using simple geospatial data to develop assessments for tephra clean-up for use in response and recovery planning, and quantitative volcanic impact and risk assessments. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - A New Remote-Sensing-Based Indicator For Integrating Quantity And Quality Attributes To Assess The Dynamics Of Ecosystem Assets
AB  - Ecological benefits provided by ecosystem assets play an important role in improving human wellbeing. However, there are few feasible methods to combine data on the quantity and quality of ecosystem assets to describe their state and trend. Here, we developed a new remote-sensing-based indicator by synthesizing ecosystem asset quantity and quality data for effective assessment at a regional or national scale. The new indicator includes a typological ecosystem asset index (TEAI) (e.g., forest ecosystem asset index) and an integrated ecosystem asset index (IEAI). The TEAI and IEAI can be used to assess the state and trend of a specific ecosystem or set of regional ecosystems, respectively. We applied the new indicator in the context of ecological protection policy in the Three-Rivers Source Region (TRSR), a region known as the 'Chinese water tower'. From 2000 to 2015, the IEAI increased by 4.02\% due to an increase in the ecosystem asset area (0.2\%) and the ecosystem asset quality (0.66\% and 0.02\% increases in excellent and good level ecosystem assets, respectively). The implementation of ecological protection and ecological restoration programs was the main direct driver of regional ecological asset improvement. Our results suggest the new indicator is feasible for quickly and accurately evaluating the state and trend of ecosystem assets and can be used to guide ecosystem management at a large regional scale.

TI  - Integrating Field And Satellite Data For Spatially Explicit Inference On The Density Of Threatened Arboreal Primates
AB  - Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.

TI  - Developments In Organ Preserving Treatments For Renal Cell Cancer: Open Surgery
AB  - Recent trends in cancer surgery have shown that the same cure rates can be achieved with more organ and tissue sparing techniques and multimodal approaches. Developments in technology and better patient care now render most operations to be possible. In the past radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) used to save many lives because most of the patients were presenting at advanced stages. Thanks to modern imaging techniques and health awareness of the public, today, most of the patients are presenting with small incidentally detected renal masses. Apart from patients requiring organ preservation for absolute and relative indications, most patients today are enjoying the benefits of nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in an elective setting. The crucial step in NSS is to get control of the renal vessels first and to expose the whole kidney to look for satellite cortical lesions. A safe rim of healthy tissue has to be removed together with the tumor. All bleeders are sutured, and if the collecting system is entered, it should be repaired. The parenchyma is sutured for approximation with absorbable sutures. The long term results with NSS show acceptable oncological outcome. The rate of complications of NSS has dramatically decreased with better patient selection, improved techniques and better management. All patients should be informed of the complications, recurrence rates and follow-up conditions. The advances in laparoscopic techniques now render NSS possible in selected patients. However, this is an extremely challenging operation, and can only be performed in expert hands. New technology is also emerging utilizing new forms of energy for tumor destruction and ultimately for nephron sparing approaches in localized RCC. As we are detecting more small renal masses, some of which are benign, NSS will remain to be the treatment of choice for these patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determination Of Spatiotemporal Changes In Erzurum Plain Wetland System Using Remote Sensing Techniques
AB  - This study takes place in Erzurum city of Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey Erzurum Plain Wetland, one of the wetlands of international importance that has biodiversity and countless benefits to its environment. Studies to offer opportunities to monitor long-term changes in the area by using advanced technology economically and effectively are expected to guide decision makers. In the present study, the changes in surface area of Erzurum Plain Wetland were investigated between 1998 and 2017 by using remote sensing techniques. As a result of the change analysis conducted using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, it has been determined there is an expansion in deep and shallow water areas of the wetland. According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989–2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Potential Of Using Data Assimilation To Support Forest Planning
AB  - Uncertainty in forest information typically results in economic and ecological losses as a consequence of suboptimal management decisions. Several techniques have been proposed to handle such uncertainties. However, these techniques are often complex and costly. Data assimilation (DA) has recently been advocated as a tool that may reduce the uncertainty, thereby improving the quality of forest planning results. It offers an opportunity to make use of all new sources of information in a systematic way and thus provides more accurate and up-to-date information to forest planning. In this study, we refer to literature on handling uncertainties in forest planning, as well as related literature from other scientific fields, to assess the potential benefits of using DA in forest planning. We identify five major potential benefits: (i) the accuracy of the information will be improved; (ii) the information will be kept up to date; (iii) the DA process will provide information with estimated accuracy; (iv) stochastic decision making can be applied whereby the accuracy of the information can be utilized in the decision making process; and (v) DA data allows for the analysis of optimal data acquisition decisions.

TI  - The Assessment Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Salinity Risk Using Neural Network
AB  - Soil salinity in the Aral Sea Basin is one of the major limiting factors of sustainable crop production. Leaching of the salts before planting season is usually a prerequisite for crop establishment and predetermined water amounts are applied uniformly to fields often without discerning salinity levels. The use of predetermined water amounts for leaching perhaps partly emanate from the inability of conventional soil salinity surveys (based on collection of soil samples, laboratory analyses) to generate timely and highresolution salinity maps. This paper has an objective to estimate the spatial distribution of soil salinity based on readily or cheaply obtainable environmental parameters (terrain indices, remote sensing data, distance to drains, and long-term groundwater observation data) using a neural network model. The farm-scale (~15 km 2) results were used to upscale soil salinity to a district area (~300 km 2). The use of environmental attributes and soil salinity relationships to upscale the spatial distribution of soil salinity from farm to district scale resulted in the estimation of essentially similar average soil salinity values (estimated 0.94 vs. 1.04 dS m -1). Visual comparison of the maps suggests that the estimated map had soil salinity that was uniform in distribution. The upscaling proved to be satisfactory; depending on critical salinity threshold values, around 70-90% of locations were correctly estimated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

TI  - Over-Harvesting Driven By Consumer Demand Leads To Population Decline: Big-Leaf Mahogany In South America
AB  - Consumer demand for the premier neotropical luxury timber, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), has driven boom-and-bust logging cycles for centuries, depleting local and regional supplies from Mexico to Bolivia. We revise the standard historic range map for mahogany in South America and estimate the extent to which commercial stocks have been depleted using satellite data, expert surveys, and sawmill processing center data from Brazil. We estimate an historic range of 278 million hectares spanning Venezuela to Bolivia, 57\% of this in Brazil. Approximately 58 million hectares (21\%) of mahogany's historic range had been lost to forest conversion by 2001. Commercial populations had been logged from at least 125 million more hectares, reducing the commercial range to 94 million hectares (34\% of historic). Surviving stocks are extremely low-density populations in remote regions representing a smaller fraction of historic stocks than expected based on estimated current commercial range. Our method could advance international policy debates such as listing proposals for CITES Appendices by clarifying the commercial and conservation status of high-value timber species similar to mahogany about which little information is available. The fate of remaining mahogany stocks in South America will depend on transforming current forest management practices into sustainable production systems.

TI  - Within-Field Nitrogen Response In Corn Related To Aerial Photograph Color
AB  - Precise management of nitrogen (N) using canopy color in aerial imagery of corn (Zea mays L.) has been proposed as a strategy on which to base the rate of N fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between canopy color and yield response to N at the field scale. Six N response trials were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in fields with alluvial, claypan and deep loess soil types. Aerial images were taken with a 35-mm slide film from a parts per thousand yen1100 m at the mid- and late-vegetative corn growth stages and processed to extract green and red digital values. Color values of the control N (0 kg N ha(-1)) and sufficient N (280 kg N ha(-1) applied at planting) treatments were used to calculate the relative ratio of unfertilized to fertilized and relative difference color values. Other N fertilizer treatments included side-dressed applications in increments of 56 kg N ha(-1). The economic optimal N rate was weakly related (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.34) or not related to the color indices at both growth stages. For many sites, delta yield (the increase in yield between control N and sufficient N treatments) was related to the color indices (R (2) a parts per thousand currency sign 0.67) at the late vegetative growth stage; the best relationship was with green relative difference. The results indicate the potential for color indices from aerial photographs to be used for predicting delta yield from which a site-specific N rate could be determined.

TI  - Enhancing Land Cover Mapping And Monitoring: An Interactive And Explainable Machine Learning Approach Using Google Earth Engine
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been applied to solve various remote sensing problems. To fully leverage the power of AI and ML to tackle impactful remote sensing problems, it is essential to enable researchers and practitioners to understand how AI and ML models actually work and thus to improve the model performance strategically. Accurate and timely land cover maps are essential components for informed land management decision making. To address the ever-increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution maps, this paper developed an interactive and open-source online tool, in Python, to help interpret and improve the ML models used for land cover mapping with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The tool integrates the workflow of both land cover classification and land cover change dynamics, which requires the generation of a time series of land cover maps. Three feature importance metrics are reported, including impurity-based, permutation-based, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) value-based feature importance. Two case studies are presented to showcase the tool's capability and ease of use, enabling a globally accessible and free convergent application of remote sensing technologies. This tool may inspire researchers to facilitate explainable AI (XAI)-empowered remote sensing applications with GEE.

TI  - A Case Study On The Relationship Between Land Surface Temperature And Land Surface Indices In Raipur City, India
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) depends primarily on the land surface material and climatic conditions. The present study focuses on deriving the LST of Raipur City and generating the relationship between LST and some land surface indices, like NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, NMDI, and NDBaI for better land-use planning and environmental management inside the city. These land surface indices respond in different ways with the changes of LST in an urban landscape. There are only a few numbers of research works available on the relationship of LST and land surface indices in a tropical city for pre-monsoon season. The present study has been performed on a total of fifteen multi-date Landsat data sets of the pre-monsoon season from 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018. The mono-window algorithm has been applied in retrieving the LST. Results show that LST builds a positive relation with NDBI, NDBaI, and NDWI and a negative relation with NDVI and NMDI. These relationships are stronger in the area below mean LST (low LST zones) and weaker in the area above mean LST (high LST zones). It indicates that the values of LST are largely influenced by the different land surfaces, like vegetation, water, soil, and built-up area.

TI  - The Irrigation Cooling Effect As A Climate Regulation Service Of Agroecosystems
AB  - Agroecosystems provide a range of benefits to society and the economy, which we call ecosystem services (ES). These services can be evaluated on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic indicators. The irrigation cooling effect (ICE), given its influence on the land surface temperature (LST), is an indicator of climate regulation services from agroecosystems. In this context, the objective of this study is to quantify the ICE in agroecosystems at the local scale. The agroecosystem of citrus cultivation in Campo de Cartagena (Murcia, Spain) is used as a case study. Once the LST was retrieved by remote sensing images for 216 plots, multivariate regression methods were used to identify the factors that explain ICE. The use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is proposed, instead of ordinary least squares, as it offsets the spatial dependence and gives a better fit. The GWR explains 78\% of the variability in the LST, by means of three variables: the vegetation index, the water index of the crop, and the altitude. Thus, the effects of the change in land use on the LST due to restrictions on the availability of water (up to 1.22 degrees C higher for rain-fed crops) are estimated. The trade-offs between ICE and the other ES are investigated by using the irrigation water required to reduce the temperature. This work shows the magnitude of the climate regulation service generated by irrigated citrus and enables its quantification in agroecosystems with similar characteristics.

TI  - Potential Drivers Of Common Brusntail Possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula) Decline On A Murray River Floodplain
AB  - Australia's terrestrial mammalian fauna have experienced severe declines since European settlement. On the Murray-Darling floodplain in south-eastern Australia, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, 'possums'), have contracted to riparian zones. Although an important possum refuge, little is known about possum population dynamics here. We examined possum population dynamics and potential drivers across two decades on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station. We related possum density to satellite derived fractional cover, (a measure of the proportion of green, non-green and bare ground cover), and contextualised these findings using tree condition and grazing pressure datasets. Possum surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2019 in riparian and non-riparian habitats and density was modelled in relation to fractional cover values of green, non-green, and bare ground. Possum density fluctuated between 1998 and 2008 but in 2018 and 2019, possums were undetectable. Possum density was negatively associated with bare ground and positively associated with non-green. Overgrazing by kangaroos likely reduced vegetation cover and diversity and contributed to possum decline, via a reduction in possum food resources and increased exposure to predation. Inconsistent monitoring meant that the population decline was not detected until after it had occurred, and management interventions were not triggered, highlighting the dilemma of allocating scarce monitoring resources.

TI  - Improving Spatial Resolution Of Grace-Derived Water Storage Changes Based On Geographically Weighted Regression Downscaled Model
AB  - Obtaining high-resolution products that can accurately estimate the spatiotemporal changes in regional water resources is essential for the rational utilization of water resources. The temporal gravity field model derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite can effectively monitor the regional terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes. Nevertheless, the main of GRACE products is their coarse spatial resolution, which limits their applicability to small-scale regions. Herein, we propose a geographically weighted regression downscaled model (GWRDM) to improve the spatial resolution of TWS from 0.5 degrees to 0.1 degrees and validate it against the downscaled results provided by the spatial global regression downscaled model (SGRDM) and temporal grid regression downscaled model (TGRDM). The results show that the downscaled products based on GWRDM outperform those based on SGRDM and TGRDM. The GWRDM not only effectively improves the spatial resolution of GRACE products but also maintains the intensity of the original signal. Similarly, the GWRDM is further used to downscale groundwater storage (GWS) and validated against the in situ observations. The downscaled GWS based on GWRDM agrees well with in situ observations. On the monthly scale, the average correlation coefficient (CC) for both is 0.53 and above 0.70 for some in situ observations. On the annual scale, 81.25\% and 37.50\% of the in situ observations have CC values larger than 0.60 and 0.90, respectively, which further verifies the reliability of GWRDM. Consequently, the GWRDM provides a practical algorithm for obtaining high-resolution water storage estimates, which is expected to provide a reference for small-scale regional water resources management.

TI  - Balancing Model Generality And Specificity In Management-Focused Habitat Selection Models For Gunnison Sage-Grouse
AB  - Identifying, protecting, and restoring habitats for declining wildlife populations is foundational to conservation and recovery planning for any species at risk of decline. Resource selection analysis is a key tool to assess habitat and prescribe management actions. Yet, it can be challenging to map suitable resource conditions across a wide range of ecological contexts and use the resulting models to identify effective and universal habitat improvement actions. We developed a management-centric modeling approach that sought to balance the need to evaluate the consistency of key habitat conditions and improvement actions across multiple, distinct populations, while allowing context-specific environmental variables and spatial scales to nuance selection responses that form the basis of location-specific management prescriptions. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a set of habitat selection models for Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation, species recovery, and habitat management efforts are needed in six isolated satellite populations (San Miguel, Crawford, Pinon Mesa, Dove Creek, Cerro Summit-Cimarron-Sims, and Poncha Pass) where environmental conditions differ, and the already small number of birds are declining. We used multi-scale and seasonal resource selection analyses to quantify relationships between environmental conditions and sites used by animals. All models included key habitat variables often altered through management actions to assess their differential influences across models. We found important similarities and differences among satellites, indicating that, although some rules of thumb are generally well-grounded, the consideration of population-specific environmental differences could increase the efficiency of local habitat improvement actions. Sagegrouse also had diverse responses to resource conditions at different scales, indicating that regional spatial (e.g., landscape) and local patch scale can differentially influence expected habitat improvements associated with where such management actions are implemented. Although context variables such as topography cannot be manipulated, sage-grouse associations revealed information that could guide the siting of improvement actions. This approach to balancing management objectives associated with habitat assessment may benefit spatially-structured populations with different environmental contexts and species with complex habitat needs and associations.

TI  - Research Progress On Trade-Offs And Synergies Of Ecosystem Services: An Overview
AB  - Being the core of ecosystem assessment, studies on ecosystem services have been becoming a focus in the field of ecology. The formation and provisioning capacity of ecosystem services are tremendously affected by human activities. Conversely, the magnitudes of ecosystem service changes also influence the preferences of human being's daily decision- making. Investigation into the dynamics of the trade-offs and synergistic relationships of regional ecosystem services will shed light on interactions and feedbacks between ecosystem services and the stakeholders at different spatial and temporal scales, and avoid double-counting issue in ecosystem services assessment. In addition, information and progress on trade- offs and synergies in the delivery of ecosystem services will provide scientific basis for designing and implementing eco- compensation schemes and optimize the management behavior of ecosystem services, and finally improve human well-being associated with trade-offs and synergies among different ecosystem services. It is revealed from this review that in the last decades, the valuation of ecosystem services has been received lots of attentions in the decision-making and scientific research communities. However, the double-counting issue during the valuation process usually leads to insufficient or biased guidance in the management of ecosystem services. Since ecosystem service is benefit that human receives from the natural ecosystems, the stakeholders' demand for ecosystem services from different spatial and temporal scales often causes competitions and conflicts among ecosystem's various goods and services. The interactions between human being and ecosystem services often give rise to trade-offs and synergies which in turn directly affect human welfare. With regard to the terminologies, trade-offs between ecosystem services refers to the enhancement of one ecosystem service locally in a short term is at the cost of other ecosystem services locally or at a large spatial scale (e. g., globally) in the future. It can be simplified as the "win-lose" mode. The term synergies means the synchronous changes between two or among many different ecosystem services, including the "win-win" mode and the "lose-lose" mode. The trade-offs and synergistic relationships exist not only within different categories of provisioning services, but also among different ecosystem services and like provision services, regulation services, cultural services, and supporting services. Findings from about 12 literatures has shown specific examples of such kind of trade-offs and synergistic relations, for instance, among provisioning services, between regulating services and cultural services, between provisioning services and supporting services, among regulating services, and between provisioning services and regulating services. The spatial scale of trade-offs and synergies contain various scales, for instance, from ecological scale to institutional scale. The temporal scale could be short-term to long-term based. This paper indicates that so far, trade-offs and synergies analysis of ecosystem services is still at its early stage. However, we identified and summarized two research approaches which have already been commonly used for the analysis of ecosystem services' trade-offs: (1) the Integrated Ecological-Economic Model: it is a traditional approach which is often used to quantify trade-offs. The Model consists of several ecological and economic models. The ecological models are mostly used to analyze the magnitudes of the changes of ecosystem services, while the economic models to evaluate the impacts of the change on human welfare. Since land use and land cover change serves as a direct driving factor of the ecosystem services' trade-offs and synergies, it will become even more extensive due to intensification of interactions between the two in the future. (2) Scenarios Analysis based on Landuse is attracting more and more attention in scientific literature. Remote sensing data and management policies of ecosystem services provd strong data basis for the scenarios formulation and analysis. It could provide more objective and spatially-explicit information on the trade-offs and synergies for optimizing ecosystem services management.

TI  - Role And Impact Of Urban Water Prices On The Management Of Groundwater Consumption Due To Covid-19 Outbreaks
AB  - The main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental role and impact of urban water prices, and hence its consumption in Tehran on its groundwater level drawdown. The issue gets vital in times of drought when the scarcity value of water exceeds benefits of groundwater environmental flow. Hence, the argument is that urban water tariffs may play a role in managing groundwater flow. In this regard, the harmful impact of urban water consumption on the environmental flow of groundwater resources is distinguished. Then the objective would be to identify determinants of urban water consumption. To do so, an urban water's demand function, including important key regressors such as price, income, temperature, and rainfall is estimated. Moreover, the role of Covid-19 in urban water consumption is highlighted. Results show a demand elasticity of -0.29 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 for urban water consumption, or that a 10 percent increase in average price results in a decline in urban water consumption of 1.9-3.9 percent. In addition, one percent lower urban water consumption causes 1.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.1 percent less groundwater extraction, or that response of a 10 percent decrease in the consumption could cause a decline in groundwater extraction of 12-14 percent. Last but not least, a 1 percent decrease in underground extraction for urban water raises 13.2 \& PLUSMN; 6.7 cm of GRACE water level after three months. The results show that groundwater exploitation for urban drinking water is a responsible contributor to the water level drawdown in Tehran. In addition, the significant elasticity of 0.29 shows that price mechanisms are useful to manage hydrological scarcity and the consequent disasters. Moreover, observing significant effects of covid-related determinants for calming down the upward trend of groundwater extraction, we alert for postcovid deterioration of subsidence areas due to regrowth of water consumption.

TI  - Integrating Detailed Timber Assortments Into Airborne Laser Scanning (Als)-Based Assessments Of Logging Recoveries
AB  - The methodology presented here can assist in making timber markets more efficient when assessing the value of harvestable timber stands and the amounts of timber assortments during the planning of harvesting operations. Information on wood quality and timber assortments is essential for wood valuation and procurement planning as varying wood dimensions and qualities may be utilized and refined in different places, including sawmills, plywood mills, pulp mills, heating plants or combined heat and power plants. We investigate here alternative approaches for generating detailed timber assortments for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch (Betula spp.) from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, aerial images, harvester data and field data. For this purpose, we used 665 circular plots, and logging recovery information recorded from 249 clear-cut stands using cut-to-length harvesters. We estimated timber assortment volumes, economic values and wood paying capabilities (WPC) for each stand in different bucking scenarios, and used the resulting timber assortment estimates to assess logging recoveries. The bucking scenarios were (1) bucking-to-value using maximum sawlog and pulpwood volumes excluding quality (theoretical maximum), and (2) bucking-to-value using sawlog lengths at 30 cm intervals for Norway spruce and Scots pine and veneer logs of lengths 4.7 m, 5.0 m, 6.0 m and 6.7 m for birch, either excluding quality (the usual business practice) or including quality (a novel business practice). The results showed that our procedure can assist in locating stands that are likely to be more valuable and have the desired timber assortment distributions. We conclude that the method can estimate WPC with root mean square errors of 28.7\%, 66.0\% and 45.7\% in Norway spruce, Scots pine and birch, respectively, for sawlogs and 19.3\%, 63.7\% and 29.5\% for pulpwood.

TI  - Predicting Occurrence, Abundance, And Fruiting Of A Cultural Keystone Species To Inform Landscape Values And Priority Sites For Habitat Enhancements
AB  - Environmental niche modeling is an increasingly common tool in conservation and management of non-timber species. In particular, models of species' habitats have been aided by new advances in remote sensing and it is now possible to relate forest structure variables to understory species at a relatively high resolution over large spatial scales. Here, we model landscape responses for a culturally-valued keystone shrub, velvet-leaf blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloidesMichaux), in northeast Alberta, Canada, to better understand the environmental factors promoting or limiting its occurrence, abundance, and fruit production, and to guide regional planning. Occurrence and abundance were measured at 845 and 335 sites, respectively, with both strongly related to land cover type and topo-edaphic factors. However, their influence varied widely, reflecting differences in the processes affecting occurrence and abundance. We then used airborne laser scanning (ALS) to characterize horizontal forest canopy cover for the study area, and related this and other geospatial variables to patterns in fruit production where we demonstrated a five-fold increase in fruit production from closed to open forest stands. We then simulated forest canopy thinning across the study area to identify places where gains in fruit production would be greatest following natural disturbance or directed management (e.g., thinning, prescribed burning). Finally, we suggest this approach could be used to identify sites for habitat enhancements to offset direct (land use change) or indirect (access) losses of resources in areas impacted with resource extraction activities, or simply to increase a culturally-valued resource through management.

TI  - Knowledge Graph Construction Method Of Gold Mine Based On Ontology
AB  - Geological and mineral resource survey and scientific research in "geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and remote sensing " have established a large amount of geological and mineral survey data, which contain rich knowledge related to mineralization and distribution of gold mine, such as the metallogenic and tectonic setting, geological environment of occurrence, geological characteristics of mineral mine, genesis and metallogenic model of mine, and so on. The transformation from massive mineral related data to effective metallogenic knowledge has become one of the most important breakthroughs to improve the accuracy of geological prospecting. To solve this problem, through the in- depth analysis of knowledge representation, information extraction, and knowledge fusion in knowledge engineering, this paper explores the knowledge graph construction method of gold mine based on ontology. Firstly, referring to industry norms, gold mine knowledge base, and reference material of geological and mineral resource exploration, the metallogenic model of gold mine is sorted out, and the gold mine concept, gold mine entity, gold mine relationship, gold mine geological attribute, and gold mine metallogenic attribute are determined. In addition, the schema layer of gold mine knowledge graph is constructed by using the top- down ontology knowledge representation method, which represents the conceptual model and logical basis of gold mine knowledge graph. Secondly, based on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured multi-source heterogeneous geological data, the deep learning model is used to realize gold mine knowledge extraction, semantic analysis, and knowledge fusion, which enriches the data layer of gold mine knowledge graph and provides data support for gold mine knowledge graph. The gold mine knowledge graph is constructed in a bottom- up way, and the gold mine knowledge triplet is stored by Neo4j graph database, in which nodes represent gold mine concept, gold mine entity, and gold mine attribute value, while edges represent relation and attribute. Finally, the gold mine knowledge management system is developed based on the graph database. It can be applied to the management of gold mine data, acquisition of knowledge, visualization representation of gold mine knowledge graph, inquiry of knowledge, management and presentation of knowledge base, and other functions well, so as to lay a foundation for the intelligent analysis and mining of geological big data. This study develops a geological prospecting method driven by data and knowledge, and provides a reference for identifying, controlling, and managing mineral resources, which can improve the prospecting accuracy in geological exploration. © 2023 Journal of Geo-Information Science.

TI  - Fusion Of Lidar And Aerial Imagery To Map Wetlands And Channels Via Deep Convolutional Neural Network
AB  - Wetlands and channels provide significant ecological and societal services. Mapping their locations and types at high resolution remains a challenge for scientific communities and regulatory agencies. In the U.S.A., the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) provides the best nationwide wetland maps, but the NWI for some locations has not been updated for up to four decades and includes omission errors. To address these problems, we developed a deep learning framework for identifying wetlands and channels from lidar point clouds and 1 m aerial images. Both deep learning and terrain analysis were applied to classify wetlands and identify channels. The deep learning classifier was a convolutional neural network that utilized both image color information and lidar-derived canopy height. When tested on a 94 km(2) Ohio watershed, the method achieved a classification accuracy of 85.6\%. Compared with the NWI maps, the results included 76\% more forested wetlands by area and 168\% more channels by length. It was also found that only leaf-off images were useful for detecting forested wetlands and typical commission errors (i.e., false positives) were attributed to tree shadows. The study demonstrates the advantages of combining lidar structural and aerial spectral information over the use of each alone and exemplifies the utility of deep learning as an effective means to leverage open-source data for high resolution mapping of wetlands.

TI  - National-Scale Assessment Of Current And Future Flood Risk In England And Wales
AB  - In recent years, through the availability of remotely sensed data and other national datasets, it has become possible to conduct national-scale flood risk assessment in England and Wales. The results of this type of risk analysis can be used to inform policy-making and prioritisation of resources for flood management. It can form the starting point for more detailed strategic and local-scale flood risk assessments. The national-scale risk assessment methodology outlined in this paper makes use of information on the location, standard of protection and condition of flood defences in England and Wales, together with datasets of floodplain extent, topography, occupancy and asset values. The flood risk assessment was applied to all of England and Wales in 2002 at which point the expected annual damage from flooding was estimated to be approximately (sic)1 billion. This figure is comparable with records of recent flood damage. The methodology has subsequently been applied to examine the effects of climate and socio-economic change 50 and 80 years in the future. The analysis predicts increasing flood risk unless current flood management policies, practices and investment levels are changed - up to 20-fold increase in real terms economic risk by the 2080s in the scenario with highest economic growth. The increase is attributable primarily to a combination of climate change (in particular sea level rise and increasing precipitation in parts of the UK) and increasing economic vulnerability.

TI  - Satellite Imagery As A Single Source Of Predictor Variables For Habitat Suitability Modelling: How Landsat Can Inform The Conservation Of A Critically Endangered Lemur
AB  - 1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Assessment Of Land Use Land Cover Changes And Future Predictions Using Ca-Ann Simulation For Gazipur City Corporation, Bangladesh
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have a significant influence on land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially in rapidly growing areas. Among several models, the combination of a cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) model is being widely used for assessing future LULC changes using satellite images. This study aimed to investigate LULC changes in Gazipur City Corporation (GCC), Bangladesh, and the changes in LULC patterns over the last two decades (2002 to 2022). In this study, the maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was used for processing the available satellite images. The results show that the urban area and vegetation coverage increased by 150\% and 22.78\%, whereas the bare land and waterbody decreased by 7.02\% and 78.9\%, respectively, from 2002 to 2022 inside the GCC area. For future LULC predictions, the CA-ANN model was developed, the accuracy percentage of which was 86.49\%, and the kappa value was 0.83. The future LULC prediction model results show that the urban area will increase by 47.61\%, whereas the bare land and waterbody are supposed to decrease by 24.17\% and 67.23\%, respectively, by 2042. The findings of this study could be useful for future sustainable urban planning and management, as well as enabling decision making by authorities for improvements in environmental and ecological conditions in the study area.

TI  - Constraints Of Grassland Science, Pastoral Management And Policy In Northern China: Anthropological Perspectives On Degradational Narratives
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the implications of policies, practices and new “non-equilibrium” management approaches in mobile grassland management. Design/methodology/approach – The author takes an actor-oriented perspective on the narrative of land-use practices, notional sustainable stocking rates and the problematic of state policy interventions in local context. The paper is based on two years in the field on a bilateral aid-funded grassland management project at Xing'an League, Inner Mongolia and follow-up among selected informants. Findings – The constitution of grasslands “degradation” is in fact contested by resource users. Most grassland scientists, Party and Government officials in China have tended to associate ethnic “minority” mobile pastoralists with destructive cultural practices that, they argue, have led to ecological decline on the steppes. This argument is integral to the “degradation narrative” that underpins the discourse on grassland science. The conventional bio-ecology emphasis on species dominance (growth-form), in fact says little about the extent of anthropogenic impacts on above-ground biomass and whether these factors have been the cause of degradation. The paper suggests that greater consideration is given to specific changes in human activity, climatic and plant productivity over time and space, based on endogenous, flexible seasonal estimates. Research limitations/implications – Although presenting challenges to conventional grassland science based on endogenous experiences and herder practices, it may have specific geopolitical limits to more general scaling-up in different contexts. Practical implications – The paper discusses new modalities of non-equilibrium grassland management, inverting normative top-down approaches to controlling environmental degradation, livestock distribution and stocking rates. Social implications – The paper suggests rethinking the use of customary practices, vernacular knowledge and the social organisation of herders in the design of sustainable grassland management. Originality/value – The paper may be valuable to practitioners, rural development planners, funders and researchers interested in the use of integrated, cross-disciplinary, new ecological knowledge in grassland management. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics Of No2 Concentration With Linear Mixed Models: A Bangladesh Case Study
AB  - There is currently a limited understanding of how climatic and anthropogenic factors affect atmospheric NO2 concentration, and how these factors are associated with air pollution over space and time. Using high-resolution TROPOMI satellite data, this study estimates both the degree of association between climatic and anthropogenic factors, and the spatiotemporal variability of NO2 concentration over Bangladesh. Several linear mixed models were developed to isolate possible factors affecting the NO2 concentration values recorded between July 2018 and June 2019). This included monthly mean maximum temperature (MMAXT), rainfall, wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), population density, and distance from industrial activities. The study revealed that the very urbanized central region of Bangladesh experienced high NO2 concentrations, particularly from September through to March. Dynamic variables such as RH, MMAXT, RAIN, and WS can positively or negatively influence NO2 depending on the time of year. Areas with a high vegetation cover, a low population density, and located some distance from industrial areas tended to have low NO2 concentrations. This study concluded that policy measures such as transboundary air quality agreements, the introduction of a month-specific green tax, decentralization, industrial relocation, and increased urban tree plantation activities could all prove valuable in reducing NO2 pollution in Bangladesh.

TI  - A Partition Modeling For Anthropogenic Heat Flux Mapping In China
AB  - Anthropogenic heat (AH) generated by human activities has a major impact on urban and regional climate. Accurately estimating anthropogenic heat is of great significance for studies on urban thermal environment and climate change. In this study, a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation scheme was constructed based on socio-economic data, energy-consumption data, and multi-source remote sensing data using a partition modeling method, which takes into account the regional characteristics of AH emission caused by the differences in regional development levels. The refined AHF mapping in China was realized with a high resolution of 500 m. The results show that the spatial distribution of AHF has obvious regional characteristics in China. Compared with the AHF in provinces, the AHF in Shanghai is the highest which reaches 12.56W·m-2, followed by Tianjin, Beijing, and Jiangsu. The AHF values are 5.92 W·m-2, 3.35 W·m-2, and 3.10 W·m-2, respectively. As can be seen from the mapping results of refined AHF, the high-value AHF aggregation areas are mainly distributed in north China, east China, and south China. The high-value AHF in urban areas is concentrated in 50-200 W·m-2, and maximum AHF in Shenzhen urban center reaches 267 W·m-2. Further, compared with other high resolution AHF products, it can be found that the AHF results in this study have higher spatial heterogeneity, which can better characterize the emission characteristics of AHF in the region. The spatial pattern of the AHF estimation results correspond to the distribution of building density, population, and industry zone. The high-value AHF areas are mainly distributed in airports, railway stations, industry areas, and commercial centers. It can thus be seen that the AHF estimation models constructed by the partition modeling method can well realize the estimation of large-scale AHF and the results can effectively express the detailed spatial distribution of AHF in local areas. These results can provide technical ideas and data support for studies on surface energy balance and urban climate change. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Floral Abundance And Richness Drive Beneficial Arthropod Conservation And Biological Control On Golf Courses
AB  - Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use, which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the biological control services of flying natural enemies and few investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae, excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas by up to 50\% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of turfgrass pests.

TI  - Tree-Related Microhabitats Are Promising Yet Underused Tools For Biodiversity And Nature Conservation: A Systematic Review For International Perspectives
AB  - Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators. Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them, and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101 articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3\%) were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3\%) of the articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and unmanaged forests played a key role as a "natural " forest reference for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing, climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.

TI  - Development Of A Water Quality Management Model For Dry Rivers In Arid Regions: Application On Wadi Rumah, Saudi Arabia
AB  - In dry rivers, urban wastewater discharge forms a pond in the dry period, and surface runoff shapes a longer pond in the wet period. A water quality management model developed for dry rivers is applied on Wadi Rumah in Saudi Arabia. The sub-basin was delineated from 30-m x 30-m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Hydrologic loss, runoff rates, and time of concentration were determined using the soil conservation service curve number, soil conservation service unit hydrograph methods, and Kirpich formula. Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System estimated the wet weather flows for 10 low-to-medium rainfall events. A steady-state hydrodynamic model including river flows, effluent discharge, and evaporation and infiltration losses estimated the hydraulic retention time for the explicit case of ponding conditions of dry rivers. Mass balance and first-order kinetics modeled the physical (total dissolved solid and total suspended solid), chemical (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, NH3, PO4, and Cl2), and microbiological (total coliform and fecal coliform) parameters. The hydrodynamic model and biokinetic rate coefficients were calibrated with satellite images, reported literature, and field measurements. A water quality index compared the aggregated water quality against the standards for 4 intended uses. The study yields "very good" water quality for restricted and unrestricted irrigation for the dry period, "fair" for livestock drinking, and "marginal" for fishery and recreation for the dry period, while water quality remained "marginal" for all the uses in the wet period. Water quality management implies regular water quality monitoring, continuous improvement of treatment facilities, and flood plain management initiatives for the long-term sustainability of dry rivers in arid regions.

TI  - Advancing Marine Biogeochemical And Ecosystem Reanalyses And Forecasts As Tools For Monitoring And Managing Ecosystem Health
AB  - Ocean ecosystems are subject to a multitude of stressors, including changes in ocean physics and biogeochemistry, and direct anthropogenic influences. Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools. These can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, and anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies. Analysis and prediction tools are defined here as ocean circulation models that are coupled to biogeochemical or ecological models. The range of potential applications for these systems is broad, ranging from reanalyses for the assessment of past and current states, and short-term and seasonal forecasts, to scenario simulations including climate change projections. The objectives of this article are to illustrate current capabilities with regard to the three types of applications, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities. Representative examples of global and regional systems are described with particular emphasis on those in operational or pre-operational use. With regard to the benefits and challenges, similar considerations apply to biogeochemical and ecological prediction systems as do to physical systems. However, at present there are at least two major differences: (1) biogeochemical observation streams are much sparser than physical streams presenting a significant hinderance, and (2) biogeochemical and ecological models are largely unconstrained because of insufficient observations. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems will allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, with multiple societal benefits.

TI  - A Conceptual Framework For The Governance Of Multiple Ecosystem Services In Agricultural Landscapes
AB  - ContextWhile the concept of ecosystem services (ES) is well established in the scientific and policy arenas, its operationalization faces many challenges. Indeed, ES supply, demand and flow are related to ecological and social processes at multiple space and time scales, leading to complex interactions in the provision of multiple ES.ObjectivesTo develop a conceptual framework (CF) to facilitate the study and governance of multiple ES in agricultural social-ecological landscapes.MethodWe examined the ecological and social literatures to identify how approaches at the landscape level contribute to a better understanding of ES supply, demand and flow in agricultural systems. After detailing our CF, we use a case study to illustrate how methods from different disciplines can be combined to operationalize our CF.ResultsThe literature suggests that the landscape level is likely to be the level of organization that will make it possible to (i) integrate different components of ES co-production, i.e. ecological processes, agricultural practices and social structures, (ii) understand interactions between stakeholders, including ES co-producers and beneficiaries, (iii) explicit ES trade-offs, i.e. social choices between ES.ConclusionThe production of multiple ES at the landscape level involves different types of interdependencies among ES co-producers and beneficiaries. These need to be addressed in concerted and integrated ways to achieve sustainable and equitable governance of agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Local Drivers Of Anthropogenic Climate Change: Quantifying The Impact Through A Remote Sensing Approach In Brisbane
AB  - Urban expansions to adjoining greenfield sites, particularly in metropolitan regions, have become a global occurrence. Such urbanization practice results in a significant loss in ecosystem services and triggers climate change-where these changes in land cover and emissions of certain pollutants are the fundamental drivers of climate change. Despite its crucial importance, little is known on how to quantify the impact of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change. This study aims to address the question of how the impacts of local drivers on anthropogenic climate change can be measured. The study utilizes a remote sensing approach to investigate the impacts of a period of over 30 years (1989-2019) in Brisbane, Australia and its adjoining local government areas. The methodological steps of the study are two-fold. First, we measure the greenfield development and corresponding ecosystem services losses and, then, we quantify the risk of such losses attributable to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change. The findings of the study reveal the followings: (a) the utilized remote sensing method is a useful technique in quantifying the impacts of climate change; (b) over the last 30-year period, Brisbane and its adjoining areas encountered a total loss of about USD 4.5 billion in ecosystem services, due to direct and indirect anthropogenic climate change; (c) peri-urban areas encountered the biggest losses in ecosystem service values; (d) peri-urban areas experienced the highest greenhouse gas emission production levels, and; (e) ecosystem services should be backed up by robust urban management policies-this is critical for mitigating climate change.

TI  - Development, Optimization, And Validation Of Radium-226 Measurement In Oyster, A Sentinel Organism By Mass Spectrometry
AB  - Radium-226 (226Ra) measurement in living organisms, such as the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), is an analytical challenge: the matrix complexity and the extremely low Ra levels require a purification/preconcentration step prior to its quantification. In this study, 5 g of dry oyster soft tissues and 1.6 g of shell were both mineralized, preconcentrated on an AG50W-X8 and a strontium-specific resin, and measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The volumes of digestate used in the method for both matrices were optimized to reach a high preconcentration factor without any risk of oversaturating the columns. Out of the 50 mL of digestates, 48 mL and 2.5 mL were determined as optimal volumes for soft tissues and shell, respectively. To obtain a higher preconcentration factor and a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) for shell samples, three aliquots of 2.5 mL digestate were run on three different sets of resins and, ultimately, combined for Ra analysis using ICP-MS. LOQs of 7.7 and 0.3 fg/g (260 and 11 mu Bq/g) were achieved for the oyster shell and soft tissues, respectively. The new protocols were applied on relevant samples: oyster soft tissues and shell from New Brunswick, Canada, and different types of reference materials, such as IAEA-470, oyster soft tissue and IAEA-A-12, and animal bones. 226Ra recovery of 105 +/- 3\% (n = 6) was achieved for IAEA-A-12 (animal bones), the closest available reference material to shell with a recommended value for 226Ra. Resin performances were investigated using 226Ra standard solution and real samples: each set of columns could be used more than 100 times without any significant reduction in Ra preconcentration efficiency. Although the method proposed and validated in this work was developed for oysters, it could easily be applied to other matrices by adjusting the volume of digestate run on the resins to avoid their oversaturation.

TI  - Estimating District-Level Electricity Consumption Using Remotely Sensed Data In Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand
AB  - The intensive industrial development in special economic zones, such as Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, increases energy consumption, leading to an imbalance of energy supply and a challenge for energy management. Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2. The local government in developing countries with limited data and financial resources can adopt the proposed approach to benefit from utilizing commonly available remote sensing and statistical data with simple machine learning models such as DT (regression method) for sustainable electricity management.

TI  - A Gis-Based Methodology For Sustainable Farming Planning: Assessment Of Land Use/Cover Changes And Carbon Dynamics At Farm Level
AB  - The assessment of carbon dynamics as a climate-regulation ecosystem service (ES) by modeling of scenarios on land use and land cover (LULC) changes is widely used in environmental conservation studies to support public policies. However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007-2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production.

TI  - Analysis Of Land Damage And Recovery Process In Rare Earth Mining Area Based On Multi-Source Sequential Ndvi
AB  - The problem of land and ecological environment damage caused by ion mining has attracted more and more attention. Taking the Lingbei rare earth mining area as an example, combined with remote sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time sequence analysis method, we used HJ-1B CCD (charge-coupled device), Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing data during 1990-2016, and analyzed land distribution and rare earth mining area damage and recovery process. In order to reduce the NDVI error caused by the sensor itself, NDVI conversion equation of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8 data was constructed by using the regression analysis method, NDVI image of HJ-1B CCD was transformed into the NDVI image corresponding to the years of Landsat 5/8 (the analog image) by using conversion equation, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the simulated image and the real Landsat 5/8 NDVI image was calculated and the accuracy of the transformation equation was verified. The results showed that the R2 values of NDVI equations from HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5, HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 8 data were 0.9319 and 0.9552, both more than 0.9, indicating that there is obvious linear positive correlation between the NDVI of HJ-1B CCD and Landsat 5/8. The RMSE values of NDVI imaging between simulation images and real Landsat 5, and simulation images and real Landsat 8 were 0.0293 and 0.040, which were less than 0.05, showing that the obtained conversion equation has high accuracy and can eliminate the influence of different data sources on the NDVI. Combining NDVI threshold of mining and non-mining, and threshold of non-rare earth mining interference and rare earth mining interference, Lingbei rare earth mining area had annual rare earth mining activity from 1990 to 2016, rare earth mining area of which was smaller in 1990, 1991,1995 and 2000, mining area was more than 1 km2 in 2001-2006, and the mining area reached 2.546 1 km2 in 2006; after 2006, to maintain the rare earth mining scale at the lower level, the country began to implement control of rare earth mining, and the spatial distribution of rare earth mining was more dispersed, which not only caused difficulties in supervision and waste of resources, but also increased governance difficulties to a certain extent. Testing the extraction accuracy of land destruction and restoration type, extraction accuracy of various types was found above 85%, most of which reached more than 90%, satisfying the requirement of accuracy. Analysis of land destruction and restoration type showed that the area that was not disturbed was 97.082 1 km2, accounting for 45.41% of the total mining area; anthropogenic disturbance area was 116.709 3 km2, accounting for 54.59% of the total mining area; the area affected by deforestation disturbance was the largest, which was 86.534 1 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration was 3 years; the arable land that was not abandoned occupied 5.404 5 km2; cultivated land abandoned for many years and that for returning to forest occupied 9.390 6 km2; orchard development area was 3.148 2 km2, and the average time length of vegetation restoration for 7 years; rare earth mining occupied 11.354 4 km2, whose average recovery time was 11 years, and the recovery of the reclamation area was 5.004 9 km2, so there was still 6.349 5 km2 area with the regional vegetation that did not be recovered, and relevant departments should pay attention to the situation. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Enabling Efficient Service Function Chains At Terrestrial-Satellite Hybrid Cloud Networks
AB  - The great improvements in both satellite and terrestrial networks have motivated the academic and industrial communities to rethink their integration. As a result, there is an increasing interest in new-generation hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks, where sufficient flexibility should be enabled to deploy customized SFCs to satisfy the growing diversity of user needs. However, it is still challenging to achieve such a nice vision, since many key issues remain unaddressed comprehensively such as framework design, communication procedures and resource optimization. Therefore, in this article, we focus on how to efficiently deploy customized SFCs at terrestrial-satellite hybrid cloud networks. In particular, we first propose an elastic framework used for SFC deployment at clouds, and second propose an efficient SFC mapping approach for improvement of system resource utilization. Finally, we verify the proposed framework at a proof-of-concept prototype via a number of use cases, and evaluate the proposed mapping approach through extensive simulations based on a real-world topology. Related experimental and simulation results have confirmed the feasibility and benefits of our proposed framework and mapping approach. © 2019 IEEE

TI  - A Supply-Demand Model Of Vegetation Cooling For Urban Heatwave Mitigation
AB  - The tradeoff between heatwave-induced human health risks and vegetation heat mitigation benefits is critical for mitigating heatwave hazards in urban regions. Currently, the heat risk study often focuses on the severity of heat risk to human health while the vegetation cooling is often ignored. Here, we proposed a new supply-demand matching model combining the vegetation cooling supply with the cooling demand induced by the high temperature. The cooling demand was assessed based on a heat exposure, population exposure, and heat vulnerability. The vegetation cooling supply was calculated by using a remote sensing-driven evapotranspiration (ET) model. Results showed: (1) The supply-demand matching model can identify cooling supply-demand mismatch zones in urban areas. (2) The vegetation ET model based on remote sensing can better represent the cooling benefits of vegetation compared to the vegetation abundance such as NDVI; (3) There was a special cluster of heat risk and cooling supply-demand mismatch in blocks of Beijing. The cooling supply and demand comparison model can inform vegetation-based intervention measures and urban planning guidelines for heat risk management.

TI  - Trends Of Greening And Browning In Terrestrial Vegetation In China From 2000 To 2020
AB  - Terrestrial vegetation condition is altering generally as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activity during the past few decades. To reveal the impact of long-term climate factors and artificial protection on multiple vegetation types, it is crucial to understand the spatial distribution of vegetation greening and browning and the effect of national ecological restoration programs. In this study, we established a persistent vegetation change index (P-value) to characterize greening (restoration) and browning (degradation) in China in 2000-2020. Firstly, we generated annual time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from MODIS product by averaging the monthly maximum NDVI values for each year. Secondly, we calculated the Pvalue to investigate the continuous change in vegetation state by incremental time interval. Finally, patterns and trends of greening and browning in forests, shrublands, and grasslands were quantified and mapped at pixel and sample point levels. The findings of our study revealed that Chinese wild vegetated lands greened up by -3.4 x 104 km2 (25\%) and turned brown in -1.6 x 104 km2 (11\%) between 2000 and 2020. Net greening was detected in all biomes, most conspicuously in several ecological program regions in northern China. The NDVI time-series data in 31\% of field plots showed a consistent result, 11\% of field plots showed a browning trend, and 58\% of field plots showed a stable state. These results indicated a synergistic effect on forests, shrublands, and grasslands, but with regional variations attributed to differences in precipitation abundance, the implementation of positive ecological programs by the government and negative human activities. Additionally, these findings provide valuable insight into large-scale terrestrial vegetation transitions and have practical applications for decision-making and policy development in the assessment and restoration of ecosystems aimed at reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and conserving water resources in China.

TI  - Prediction Of Spatial Distribution Of Soil Nutrients Using Terrain Attributes And Remote Sensing Data
AB  - The distribution of the soil organic matter and total nitrogen can provide reliable and useful information for sustainable land management and land use planning. In this study, regression Kriging with environmental predictors was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil nutrients (organic matter and total nitrogen) in Nong'an County, Jilin Province, Northeast China, considering the disadvantages of conventional geo-statistic methods. Terrain and vegetation indicators were chosen for regression Kriging including ten terrain attributes and one vegetation index. The results indicated that relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), roughness of terrain (QFD), rate of gradient (SOS) and NDVI had significant correlations with soil organic matter and total nitrogen. M and Ψ had higher significant correlation with soil organic matter than those with total nitrogen. Relative elevation (Hr), gradient (β), surface roughness (M), river dynamic index (Ω) and NDVI were the best predictors for describing soil nutrients in the study area for they described the regression equations most. In Nong'an County, the soil organic matter and total nitrogen distributed regularly from southeast to northwest, and the values were higher in the part of southeast. This distribution pattern was affected by terrain and vegetation factors synthetically, and it had a significant relationship with soil type. Precision assessment results showed that regression Kriging improved the accuracy significantly and it could be an effective method for evaluating the spatial distribution of soil properties.

TI  - Quantifying The Impacts Of Land Use Change On Flooding In Data-Poor Watersheds In El Salvador With Community-Based Model Calibration
AB  - Urbanization can decrease the flood mitigation capacity of a catchment, and these impacts can be measured with hydrologic modeling. Models are typically calibrated against observed discharge and satellite data, but in a developing country context like El Salvador, these data are often unavailable. Even if a model is well calibrated and tested, its ability to influence land use plans requires additional stakeholder engagement. This study uses a participatory modeling approach to calibrate a watershed model and estimate flood impacts of land use scenarios in two urbanizing catchments in El Salvador with a linked land use-catchment hydrology-hydraulic model calibrated on flood height observed by community members. This paper explores both the value of household flood observation in model calibration and differences of flood extent estimates for land use scenarios with an uncalibrated versus community-calibrated model. We find that calibration using household surveys improves model performance. Results of scenario modeling suggest that while past urbanization has significantly increased household flood exposure in one catchment, future land use scenarios that further urbanize or reforest large areas of either catchment have little effect on the number of houses at risk for flooding. The success of the participatory methodology to increase model accuracy and link results to local land use planning makes clear the contribution of social science to traditional hydrological methods to understand land use-flood links in data-poor catchments.

TI  - Limited Reciprocal Surrogacy Of Bird And Habitat Diversity And Inconsistencies In Their Representation In Romanian Protected Areas
AB  - Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found a limited reciprocal surrogacy performance, with bird species performing slightly better as a conservation surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. We could also show that areas with a high conservation value based on habitat diversity were represented better in already existing protected areas than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.

TI  - Evaluating Performance Of Community-Based Irrigation Schemes Using Remote-Sensing Technologies To Enhance Sustainable Irrigation Water Management
AB  - An accurate estimate of the amount of water used in an irrigation scheme is vital to conserve water resources, although a reliable scheme-level estimate is difficult. The study used remote-sensing technologies to assess the Koga irrigation scheme's performance in the Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Landsat 8 images were used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Additionally, the FAO-Penman-Monteith method was applied to estimate the crop's evapotranspiration (ETc) and used as a crop water need in assessing performance parameters. The result shows that seasonal relative irrigation supply (RIS) was 6 to 77\% higher than the demand. Depletion fraction (DF) varied from 0.4 to 0.5, while relative evapotranspiration deficit values ranged from 0.3 to 0.6, and the crop water use estimate was only about 50\% of its need. The lower crop water use is attributed to the excessive application of water for plowing, pre-plant irrigation, and during the early stage of the crop. While the amount of water applied at the mid and late-season stages is less than the crop water need due to water mismanagement because of a lack of coordination among the water users. The study concludes that the use of remote sensing created a good potential to evaluate community-managed scheme irrigation performance. Performing under potential is an implication of low irrigation water productivity that affects environmental sustainability. Therefore, re-thinking better water management ways in community-managed schemes can help to improve water productivity and food security in the changing environment.

TI  - Cloud Cover And Its Impact On Brazil's Deforestation Satellite Monitoring Program: Evidence From The Cerrado Biome Of The Brazilian Legal Amazon
AB  - The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7\% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US\$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.

TI  - An Evaluation Of Ecosystem Services As A Result Of Land Use Changes In Inland And Coastal Areas: A Comparative Study Of Beijing And Freetown
AB  - Ecosystems provide a number of functions that are essential to human existence and well-being. However, anthropogenic activities and climate change are severely pressuring these ecosystem services. Changes in land use/cover (LU/LC) induced by human activities affect the environment's ecosystem and alter the ecosystem services value (ESV). Decision-making on development based on ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment is significant for the sustainable utilization of resources. In the current study, Beijing in China from 1995 to 2015 and Freetown in Sierra Leone from 2000 to 2018 were used for monitoring the change in (LU/LC) and ecosystem services. To investigate the changes in ESV utilizing an ESV model, cross-sectional field research, GIS technology and economic valuation of natural capital were all combined. In Beijing, land use and land cover (LU/LC) were as follows: forest > farm > urban > water in all periods of the investigated sites. Furthermore, LULC in Freetown was as follows: dense vegetation > spare vegetation > urban > bare > water in 2018. Changes in LU/LC in two areas reflect the trend toward the agriculture sector. Prediction of LU/LC showed a significant decrease in the agriculture areas in Beijing and Freetown that negatively affected the ecosystem. Results showed a lower ESV after prediction than before prediction in Beijing and Freetown, with loss and decrease in ESV caused by excessive economic benefits. Results showed that dense vegetation contributed the most to ecosystem services overall. The finding from this work indicated that for better sustainable ecosystem services, effective land-use regulations should be taken to control vegetation deterioration and protect water bodies.

TI  - Estimation Of Grain Protein Content In Commercial Bread And Durum Wheat Fields Via Traits Inverted By Radiative Transfer Modelling From Sentinel-2 Timeseries
AB  - Wheat (Triticum spp.) is crucial to food security. Grain protein content (GPC) is key to its nutritional and economic value and is controlled by genetic and agronomic factors, soil properties and weather. GPC prediction from remote sensing could reduce nitrogen (N) losses, help management decisions, and improve profit. However, GPC prediction is complex because multiple plant traits influence GPC and their effects change through the growing season. Traits with known physiological links to GPC, which can be retrieved from imaging spectroscopy, include leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll (Ca+b), and stress indicators. Further inspection of these and other traits retrieved from satellite data can advance research relevant to precision agriculture. Sentinel-2 (S2) timeseries (TS) were acquired for 6,355 ha of commercial dryland bread (T. aestivum) and durum (T. durum) wheat fields in south-east Australia through two consecutive years with dissimilar rainfall. Wheat growers provided similar to 92,000 GPC data points from harvester-mounted protein monitors. For each, Ca+b, leaf dry matter, leaf water content (C-w) and LAI were retrieved from the S2 images by radiative transfer model inversion. A gradient boosted machine learning algorithm was applied to analyse these traits' importance to GPC and to predict GPC in 30\% of samples unseen by the algorithm in training. The strongest relationships between predicted and observed GPC (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.56 \%), in a model built from five S2 images across a season, were better than those from single-date hyperspectral (HS). In severe water stress, LAI was the main predictor of GPC early in the season, but this switched to C-w later. Trait importance was more evenly distributed in milder conditions. S2 TS had a clear accuracy advantage over single-date S2 and HS, especially in benign conditions, emphasising the potential of S2 TS for large-scale GPC monitoring.

TI  - Density-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm For Data Clustering
AB  - Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely used in cluster analysis. However, it is a stochastic technique that is vulnerable to premature convergence to sub-optimal clustering solutions. PSO-based clustering algorithms also require tuning of the learning coefficient values to find better solutions. The latter drawbacks can be evaded by setting a proper balance between the exploitation and exploration behaviors of particles while searching the feature space. Moreover, particles must take into account the magnitude of movement in each dimension and search for the optimal solution in the most populated regions in the feature space. This study presents a novel approach for data clustering based on particle swarms. In this proposal, the balance between exploitation and exploration processes is considered using a combination of (i) kernel density estimation technique associated with new bandwidth estimation method to address the premature convergence and (ii) estimated multidimensional gravitational learning coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using 11 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in terms of classification accuracy, repeatability represented by the standard deviation of the classification accuracy over different runs, and cluster compactness represented by the average Dunn index values over different runs. The results of Friedman Aligned-Ranks test with Holm's test over the average classification accuracy and Dunn index values indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves better accuracy and compactness when compared with other algorithms. The significance of the proposed algorithm is represented in addressing the limitations of the PSO-based clustering algorithms to push forward clustering as an important technique in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application, in turn, enhances the classification accuracy and cluster compactness. In this context, the proposed algorithm achieves better results compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms when applied to high-dimensional datasets (e.g., Landsat and Dermatology). This finding confirms the importance of estimating multidimensional learning coefficients that consider particle movements in all the dimensions of the feature space. The proposed algorithm can likewise be applied in repeatability matters for better decision making, as in medical diagnosis, as proved by the low standard deviation obtained using the proposed algorithm in conducted experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Analysis Of Epidemic Characteristics And Related Factors Of Norovirus In Diarrhea Patients In Guangxi, 2015-2020
AB  - Objective To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and related factors of norovirus in Guangxi from 2015 to 2020, and to provide scientific recommendations for norovirus prevention and control. Methods The foodborne diseases surveillance data were collected from 11 sentinel hospitals through the National Foodborne Disease Monitoring and Reporting System from 2015 to 2020. R software with version 4.0.3 was used for descriptive and statistical analysis, including epidemic curve, chi-square test, and trend chi-square and so on. Logistic regression was used to analyze norovirus-related factors, OR values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated respectively with the statistical test level of P<0.05. Results There were 1 008 norovirus cases detected, with a detection rate of 12.75% (1 008/7 903). Children with age less than 5 years (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.13-1.82) and patients at age 20-45 (OR=1.45, 95%CI: 1.13-1.87) were high risk population. The detection rate was higher in autumn (OR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.08-1.53) but lower in summer (OR=0.67, 95%CI: 0.55-0.80). In addition, the tourist area (Guilin City) presented a higher detection rate than other areas (OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.80). Aquatic products (OR=1.40, 95%CI: 1.03-1.91), meat and dairy products (OR=1.31, 95%CI: 1.06-1.61) were high-risk foods for norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can reduce the possibility of norovirus by 61% (OR= 0.39, 95%CI: 0.31-0.49) showed a declining trend (Trend χ2=85.33, P<0.001). In addition, prolonged visit time can lead to 19%-23% decrease in the detection rate of norovirus (OR24-48 hours=0.81, 95%CI: 0.70-0.95; OR>48 hours=0.77, 95%CI: 0.63-0.93). Conclusions The epidemic of norovirus presented seasonal and regional distribution in Guangxi with a declining detection rate trend in diarrhea patients during recent 6 years. Young children were high-risk population in infection norovirus. The intake of seafood can increase the risk of norovirus infection. The prevention and control policies of COVID-19 can sharply decrease the possibility of infection norovirus. The monitoring of key foods such as seafood should be strengthened, and the early screening of suspected cases should be taken. The norovirus monitoring should be improved to ensure the health of the population. © 2023 The authors.

TI  - Access To Fertility Care In Geographically Underserved Populations, A Second Look
AB  - Infertility has a prevalence of up to 16% worldwide and is on the rise in developed nations, largely due to pursuing childbearing at advanced reproductive ages. Advances in assisted reproductive technology have benefitted socioeconomically advantaged patients disproportionately. High costs of fertility care are largely responsible for this disparity; however, patients in rural areas also face barriers in accessing both gynecology and reproductive endocrinology subspecialty care. Here, focusing on the USA, we discuss fertility care in geographically underserved areas and low-resource settings, and the impact on reproductive outcomes. Increased innovation to improve patient access to fertility care such as assisted reproductive technology is critical for ensuring equity. Remote monitoring is frequently performed by fertility centers, but partnership with local gynecologists has also been demonstrated to be an effective assisted reproductive technology monitoring method. Telehealth is now in mainstream use and the continued application to reduce geographic barriers to infertility patients is imperative. Partnership between local gynecologists and reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialists may improve patient access to fertility care and provide the unique benefits of continuity and ongoing local social support. © 2022, Society for Reproductive Investigation.

TI  - Effects Of Long-Term Land Use And Land Cover Changes On Ecosystem Service Values: An Example From The Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are the leading contributors to the decline and loss of ecosystem services in the world. The present study covered the Central Rift Valley lakes basin in Ethiopia, focusing on the valley floor and the East and West escarpments, to analyze changes in LULC and to estimate associated losses in ecosystem service values (ESVs). Covering both upstream and downstream areas in the basin, the study addressed major gaps in existing studies by connecting the sources and sinks of material (e.g., sediment and water) in source-to-lake systems. Additionally, the study facilitated the identification of critical areas for conserving natural resources and reversing the decline of associated ESVs in the Central Rift Valley. A post-classification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1973 and 2020 using four Landsat images from 1973, 1990, 2005 and 2020. The value transfer valuation method was used to estimate the changes in ESVs due to LULC changes. Among the seven major identified LULC classes, farmlands, settlements, and bare lands showed positive changes, while forestlands, grasslands, shrublands and waterbodies showed negative changes over the last 47 years. The expansion of farmlands, for example, has occurred at the expense of grasslands, forestlands and shrublands. The changes in LULC over a period of 47 years resulted in a total loss of US \$62,110.4 x 10(6) in ESVs. The contributors to the overall loss of ESVs in decreasing order are provisioning services (US \$33,795.1 x 10(6)), cultural services (US \$28,981.5 x 10(6)) and regulating services (US \$652.9 x 10(6)). The results imply that addressing the degradation of land and water resources is crucial to reversing the loss of ecosystem services and achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food and water security (SDGs 2 and 6) and life on land (SDG 15).

TI  - Remote Sensing Agricultural Crop Type For Sustainable Development In South Africa
AB  - Effective water resource management improves food production and consents scare water resources, especially in developing countries such as South Africa. The goal of this project was to assist the Republic of South Africa Department of Water Affairs & Forestry to identify a cost-effective remote sensing methodology to accurately measure and monitor agricultural land use for National Water Act water management purposes. The most accurate results were obtained using object-oriented image segmentation techniques applied to SPOT multispectral and panchromatic data (overall accuracy = 89.41%). Accurate classifications were also obtained using just the SPOT multispectral data (85.33%). When applied to Landsat ETM+ and TM data in 2003 and 2005, the image segmentation approach out-performed all other algorithms yielding classification accuracies of 85.71% and 84. 30%, respectively. This is important because Landsat TM type data cover more geography (e.g., 185 & 185 km) than SPOT data (e.g., 60 × 60 km) and are more economical per km2. These findings are of value to the Republic of South Africa as well as other countries throughout Africa that are trying to implement National Water Acts that rely on remote sensing to provide some of the critical land cover information.

TI  - Linking Geomatics And Participatory Social Analysis For Environmental Monitoring: Case Studies From Malawi
AB  - In this paper we demonstrate the need for linking geomatics and social analysis methodologies for enumerating and describing land-use change. Until recently, these two methods were used as distinct approaches at varying levels of inquiry. Using two case studies from Malawi, inductive and deductive approaches to land-use/landcover monitoring illustrate the utility of linking geomatics and social analysis as complementary tools. While both studies integrate geomatics with community-based social analysis, the starting point for each is different. The first case study begins by identifying where environmental change is occurring without preconceived hypotheses of causes. The use of geomatics in this case guides the researchers in determining where to conduct more in-depth analysis of explanations of change. The second case study begins with an environmental policy question - "What has been the effect of market liberalization on the environment?" - and then uses remote sensing to evaluate a set of hypotheses. This is the deductive approach. Regardless of the starting point, integrating geomatics and social analysis can promote a cycle of inductive and deductive research. In this way geomatics and social analysis not only address different questions but also can be used to verify and further develop contributions to nature-society dynamics.

TI  - Hybrid Rough-Pso Approach In Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis
AB  - Pixel classification among overlapping land cover regions in remote sensing imagery is a very challenging task. Detection of uncertainty and vagueness are always the key features for classifying mixed pixels. This paper proposes an approach for pixel classification using a hybrid approach of rough set theory and particle swarm optimization methods. Rough set theory deals with incompleteness and vagueness among data, which property may be utilized for detecting arbitrarily shaped and sized clusters in satellite images. To enable fast automatic clustering of multispectral remote sensing imagery, in this article, we propose a rough set-based heuristical decision rule generation algorithm. For rough-set-theoretic decision rule generation, each cluster is classified using heuristically searched optimal reducts to overcome overlapping cluster problem. This proposed unsupervised algorithm is able to identify clusters utilizing particle swarm optimization based on rough set generated membership values. This approach addresses the overlapping regions in remote sensing images by uncertainties using rough set generated membership values. Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, inspired from the social behavior of bird flock. Therefore, to predict pixel classification of remote sensing imagery, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based membership correction approach over rough set-based initial decision rule generation. We demonstrate our algorithm for segmenting a LANDSAT image of the catchment area of Ajoy River. The newly developed algorithm is compared with fuzzy C-means and K-means algorithms. The new algorithm generated clustered regions are verified with the available ground truth knowledge. The validity analysis is performed to demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms with K-means and fuzzy C-means algorithms.

TI  - Adjoint Inverse Modeling Of NoX Emissions Over Eastern China Using Satellite Observations Of No2 Vertical Column Densities
AB  - A four-dimensional variational data assimilation system for optimization of NOx emissions (RC4-NOx) was developed. A parameterized NOx chemistry scheme was introduced into the RC4-NOx system, and key parameters such as chemical production and loss terms of NOx were calculated in advance using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. RC4-NOx was applied to optimize NOx emissions over eastern China (EC) in July 1996,1999, and 2002 using Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite observations of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and a priori emissions from the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS). After assimilation, RC4-NOx generally reproduced the spatial distribution, regional averaged values, and time evolution of GOME NO2 VCDs. Over EC, a priori emissions were reduced by 20\% in 1996 and by 8\% in 1999, whereas a posteriori emissions were almost the same as a priori emissions in 2002. A priori emissions in the Beijing region were reduced by optimization over the whole simulation period. A posteriori emissions over the Yangtze Delta were larger than a priori emissions in 2002, although they were smaller in both 1996 and 1999. As in other areas, a priori emissions over the North China Plain were reduced in 1996; but those over the eastern part of the plain were increased in 1999, and the area of increased emissions moved slightly westward in 2002. In each region, the growth rates of a posteriori emissions during both 1996-1999 and 1999-2002 became generally larger than those of a priori emissions, and the trends of a posteriori emissions became similar to those of GOME NO2 VCDs. Our inverse modeling analysis indicates that the rate of increase of NO, emissions over EC from 1996 to 2002 was much larger for a posteriori emissions (49\%) than for a priori emissions (19\%).

TI  - Spatial And Temporal Variation Of Net Carbon Sink Function Of Farmland In Aksu Oasis In The Past 17 Years
AB  - Studying the spatial and temporal variations of the net carbon sink function of oasis farmland is important for its management and sustainable development. The net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland was estimated on the basis of remote sensing, meteorological data and agricultural inputs, and other related statistics from 2001 to 2017. The following results are presented. (1) In the past 17 years, the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of oasis farmland in Aksu showed an increasing trend yearly, with an average annual growth rate of 7.43%. Among which, the area of oasis farmland with a significant increasing trend of NEP was 1.44 × 104 km2, accounting for 97.7% of its total area, which is mainly distributed in various counties and cities. The area with a significant decreasing trend was 339 km2, accounting for 2.3% of the total area, mainly in the oasis areas of Wensu, Awati, Aksu, and Kuche counties. (2) Carbon emissions from agricultural production inputs increased from 39.94 × 104 t in 2001 to 106.73 × 104 t in 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25.14% and high and low distribution patterns in the Southeast and Northwest, respectively, considering spatial distribution. The largest proportions of agricultural production input pathways are fertilizer and agricultural machinery at 28% and 26%, respectively. (3) From 2001 to 2017, the net carbon sink of Aksu oasis farmland showed a fluctuating upward trend, spatially demonstrating a gradual increase from Northwest to Southeast, with high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of Wensu county, the western part of Aksu City, the entire territory of Alar City, and the eastern part of Xinhe County. Overall, Aksu oasis farmland has a high net carbon sink capacity. However, regional differences are found in the net carbon sinks of oasis farmland among counties and cities. Thus, the net carbon sink capacity of oasis farmland should be improved by optimizing the agricultural industry structure and enhancing farming measures. © 2022 Editorial office of Arid Zone Research.

TI  - Monitoring Soil-Plant Interactions And Maize Yield By Satellite Vegetation Indexes, Soil Electrical Conductivity And Management Zones
AB  - In modern agriculture, understanding the spatio-temporal variability in crop fields and the implications of environmental factors in soil management are important for sustainable practices. In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield. Finally, the MZs derived from spectral data could define yield-limiting zones inside the crop field.

TI  - Influence Of Technology Adoption On Farmers’ Well-Being: Systematic Literature Review And Bibliometric Analysis
AB  - This study aimed at determining the effects of technology adoption on farmers' well-being. Specifically, we analysed and extended the current understanding of the topic by focusing on the concepts of technology adoption and well-being. The data were sourced from 30 papers that were selected based on specific criteria from the WoS and Scopus databases. They were acquired through a systematic search and quality appraisal process. The adopted technology can be grouped into sustainable agricultural practices and innovations, digital agriculture and information technology, precision farming and resource management, financial inclusion and agricultural transactions, remote sensing and satellite technology, and agricultural programs and initiatives. Most papers indicated that technology adoption improved farmers' well-being which was basically measured using productivity and income. The measure however lacked farmers' value judgments, such as happiness. Agricultural technology could have a mixed effect on farmers' well-being, depending on the type of technology adopted and the compatibility of farmers with technology in their agricultural practices. This study will assist researchers in developing an appropriate framework and strategy to improve farmers' welfare, which can alleviate poverty. These may further help policymakers identify the best technological innovations that can improve farmers' economic and social welfare, thereby facilitating the development of plans to meet farmers’ needs and interests. Finally, the study suggested future research directions for researchers and academics. © 2024

TI  - Improved Understanding Of Vegetation Dynamics And Wetland Ecohydrology Via Monthly Uav-Based Classification
AB  - Vegetation classification is an essential prerequisite for understanding vegetation-water relations at a range of spatial scales. However, in site-specific applications, such classifications were mostly based on a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight, which can be challenging in grasslands and/or herbaceous-dominated systems, as those communities are small in size and highly mixed. Here, we conducted monthly UAV flights for two years in a riparian wetland in Germany, with acquired imagery used for vegetation classification on a monthly basis under different strategies (with or without auxiliary information from other flights) to increase understanding in ecohydrology. The results show that multi-flight-based classification outperformed single-flight-based classification due to the higher classification accuracy. Moreover, improved sensitivity of temporal changes in community distribution highlights the benefits of multi-flight-based classification - providing a more comprehensive picture of community evolution. From reference to the monthly community distribution, we argue that a combination of two or three flights in early- and late-summer is enough to achieve comparable results to monthly flights, while mid-summer would be a better timing in case only one flight is scheduled. With such detailed vegetation mapping, we further interpreted the complex spatio-temporal heterogeneity in NDVI and explored the dominant areas and developmental progress of each community. Impacts from management (mowing events) were also evaluated based on the different responses between communities in two years. Finally, we explored how such vegetation mapping could help understand landscape ecohydrology, and found that the spatio-temporal distribution of minimal soil moisture was related to NDVI peaks of local community, while grass distribution was explained by both topography and low moisture conditions. Such bi-directional relationships proved that apart from contributing to an evidence base for wetland management, multi-flight UAV vegetation mapping could also provide fundamental insights into the ecohydrology of wetlands. © 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Sand Dams For Sustainable Water Management: Challenges And Future Opportunities
AB  - Sand dams are impermeable water harvesting structures built to collect and store water within the volume of sediments transported by ephemeral rivers. The artificial sandy aquifer created by the sand damreduces evaporation losses relative to surface water storage in traditional dams. Recent years have seen a renaissance of studies on sand dams as an effective water scarcity adaptation strategy for drylands. However, many aspects of their functioning and effectiveness are still unclear. Literature reviews have pointed to a range of research gaps that need further scientific attention, such as river corridors and network dynamics, watershed-scale impacts, and interaction with social dynamics. However, the scattered and partially incomplete information across the different reviews would benefit froman integrated framework for directing future research efforts. This paper is a collaborative effort of different research groups active on sand dams and stems from the need to channel future research efforts on this topic in a thorough and coherent way. We synthesize the pivotal research gaps of a) unclear definition of "functioning" sand dams, b) lack of methodologies for watershed-scale analysis, c) neglect of social aspects in sand dam research, and d) underreported impacts of sand dams. We then propose framing future research to better target the synthesized gaps, including using the socialecological systems framework to better capture the interconnected social and biophysical research gaps on sand dams, fully utilizing the potential of remote sensing in large-scale studies and collecting sand dam cases across the world to create an extensive database to advance evidence-based research on sand dams.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Trend Analysis Of Coastal Vegetation Using Metrics Derived From Hyperspectral And Lidar Data
AB  - Monitoring and modeling of coastal vegetation and wetland systems are considered major challenges, especially when considering environmental response to hazards, disturbances, and management activities. Remote sensing applications can provide alternatives and complementary approaches to the often costly and laborious field-based collection methods traditionally used for coastal ecosystem monitoring. New and improved sensors and data analysis techniques have become available, making remote sensing applications attractive for evaluation and potential use in monitoring coastal vegetation properties and ecosystem conditions and change. This study involves the extraction of vegetation metrics from airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to quantify coastal dune vegetation characteristics and assesses landscape-level trends from those derived metrics. HSI- and LiDAR-derived elevation (digital elevation model) and vegetation metrics (canopy height model, leaf area index, and normalized difference vegetation index) were used in conjunction with per-pixel linear regression and hot spot analyses to evaluate hurricane-induced spatial and temporal changes in elevation and vegetation properties. These assessments showed areas with greatest decreases in vegetation metric values were associated with direct tropical storm energies and processes (i.e., overwashing events eroding beach and dune features), while those with the greatest increases in vegetation metric values were in areas where overwashed sediments were distributed. This study narrows existing gaps in dune vegetation data by advancing new methodologies to classify, quantify, and estimate critical coastal vegetation metrics. The tools and methods developed in this study will ultimately improve future estimates and predictions of nearshore dynamics and impacts from disturbance events.

TI  - Ndvi Identification And Survey Of A Roman Road In The Northern Spanish Province Of Alava
AB  - The Iter 34 (Antonine Itinerary XXXIV) is the name of the Roman road that crosses the province of alava from west to east. Since no specific path was officially recognized before our study, the remains of the road did not benefit from heritage protection. In 2017, we made a project to determine the course of the road through rural alava. In addition to traditional archaeological excavation and prospecting techniques, we used UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) to produce NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) orthomosaic plans of ten cultivated areas through which the road is conjectured to pass. NDVI orthomosaics let us see crop marks better than with conventional photography, allowing us to detect the crop marks during times of the year and in places where conventional photography would fail to show them. Thanks to the NDVI orthomosaics, remains of the road were identified not only in places where we knew it existed, but also in previously unknown locations. Furthermore, other archaeological features were identified close to the roadway. This technique heralds a great advance in non-invasive methods of archaeological surveying. By using precision farming techniques we have identified the course of the Roman road Iter 34 in several locations in a short period of time and with few resources.

TI  - Integration Of Urban Growth Modelling Products With Image-Based Urban Change Analysis
AB  - Urban change detection using remotely sensed data has been extensively studied. One current application of detection products is the formulation of calibration data for urban change prediction models. As multi-temporal scenes become available and urban growth prediction models increase in popularity and accuracy, it is natural to envisage a bi-directional relationship where, in addition to detection products assisting prediction models, the prediction information acts as ancillary input to enhance spectral-based change detection products. This closed feedback loop has the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of both detection and prediction efforts. Consequently, our objective is to evaluate the integration of prediction information with spectral data for urban change monitoring. A case study was carried out in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. Probabilities of urban change generated from two existing urban prediction models (based on decision trees and logistic regression) are combined as additional information content with a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene. Detailed assessments at the pixel and block scales are implemented to evaluate urban change classification accuracy using different input data and training sample sizes. Results show that in pixel-based assessments, the fusion of decision tree change probabilities and TM spectral bands with sufficient training samples leads to improvements. In terms of overall accuracies, the improvement is 2.02.4\%, from 87.3\% (spectral-only model) and 87.7\% (prediction probability model) to 89.7\% for the fused model. Similarly, the corresponding kappa coefficients show increases of 0.070.08, from 0.60 for the spectral model and 0.61 for the urban prediction model to 0.68 for the fused model. Accuracies aggregated at the block scale present an approximate 2.14.3\% increase when the fusion-based model is employed compared with the exclusive use of either spectral or prediction probability data, namely 87.6\% (fused) vs 83.4\% (spectral) and 85.7\% (prediction). It is also important to state that the standard deviation of accuracies between blocks is significantly reduced by more than 3\% (11.5\% vs 14.9\% and 14.7\%), suggesting higher consistency in classification performance. This is a desirable attribute for subsequent use of these products, for example by the urban planning community. Statistical tests at the block scale also demonstrate that such improvements are significant. It is also observed that to receive the integration benefits, the remote sensing classifier needs a large but reasonable training data set size, while the prediction model should be based on advanced modelling methods. Further assessments on block accuracy with respect to urbanization conditions (i.e. urban presence and change sizes) indicate the ability of the fusion to address spectral limitations, especially in blocks with high relative change. These initial results encourage the expansion of spectral/prediction data fusion to other sites, modelling techniques, and input data.

TI  - An Intelligent Hot-Desking Model Harnessing The Power Of Occupancy Sensing Data
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to harness occupancy sensing in a commercial hot-desking environment. Hot-desking is a method of office resource management designed to reduce the real estate costs of professional practices. However, the shortcoming is often in the suitability and appropriateness of allocated work environments. The Internet of Things could produce new data sets in the office at a resolution, speed and validity of which that they could be factored into desk-allocation, distributing seats based on appropriate noise levels, stay length, equipment requirements, previous presence and proximity to others working on the same project, among many others. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilises primary data from a commercial office environment in Central London (numerical building system data and semi-structured interviews) to feed a discrete events simulator. To test the hypothesis, the authors look at the potential for intelligent hot-desking to use "work type" data to improve the distribution of individuals in the office, increasing productivity through the creation of positive "work type environments" - where those working on specific tasks perform better when grouped with others doing the same task. The simulation runs for a typical work day, and the authors compare the intelligent hot-desking arrangement to a base case. Findings - The study shows that sensor data can be used for desk allocation in a hot-desking environment utilising activity-based working, with results that outweigh the costs of occupancy detection. The authors are not only able to optimise desk utilisation based on quality occupancy data but also demonstrate how overall productivity increases as individuals are allocated desks of their preference as much as possible among other enabling optimisations that can be applied. Moreover, the authors explore how an increase in occupancy data collection in the private sector could have key advantages for the business as an organization and the city as a whole. Research limitations/implications - The research explores only one possible incarnation of intelligent hot-desking, and the authors presume that all data have already been collected, and while not insurmountable, they do not discuss the technical or cultural difficulties to this end. Furthermore, final examination of the productivity benefit - because of the difficulty in defining and measuring the concept - is exploratory rather than definitive. This research suggests that not only human-centric smart building research should be prioritised over energy or space-based themes but also large-scale private sector collection of occupancy data may be imminent, and its potential should be examined. Practical implications - Findings strongly suggest that the hot-desking may cost more in lost productivity than it gains in reduced rental costs and as such many commercial offices should revaluate the transition, particularly with a view to facilitate intelligent hot-desking. Companies should begin to think strategically about the wider benefits of collecting occupancy data across their real estate portfolio, rather than reviewing use cases in silos. Finally, cities should consider scenarios of widespread collection of occupancy data in the private sector, examining the value these data have to city systems such as transport, and how the city might procure it for these ends. Social implications - This paper raises positive and negative social concerns. The value in occupancy data suggested herein, bringing with it the implication it should be collected en mass, has a noted concern that this brings privacy concerns. As such, policy and regulation should heed that current standards should be reviewed to ensure they are sufficient to protect those in offices from being unfairly discriminated, spied or exploited through occupancy data. However, the improved use of occupancy data improving workplaces could indeed make them more enjoyable places to work, and have the potential to become a staple in company's corporate social responsibility policies. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need for better understanding the specific uses of occupancy data in the smart building mantra. Several sources suggest the current research focus on energy and rental costs is misguided when the holistic cost of an office is considered, and concepts related to staff although less understood - may have an order of magnitude bigger impact. This research supports this hypothesis through the example of intelligent hot-desking. The value of this paper lies in redirecting industry and research towards the considering occupancy data in smart building uses cases including - but not limited to-intelligent hot-desking.

TI  - Lessons Learned From Participatory Land Use Planning With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images In Tanzania: Practitioners' And Participants' Perspectives
AB  - Participatory mapping (PM) solutions have become common in many sectors of society to enhance engagement of the local communities in planning processes. Especially in data scarce regions, like Africa, PM that captures local knowledge in spatially explicit form is an important tool for integrating previously non-existent spatial knowledge in to collaborative planning. Despite the increasing usage of PM solutions, there still lies a gap in our knowledge of the influence and enabling factors of PM adoption in real-world decision-making processes. We studied practitioners' and participants' perceptions on benefits and limitations of PM that uses high-resolution remote sensing imagery to engage with participants in six use cases in Tanzania. We conducted interviews and one group discussion with practitioners, and feedback surveys among PM participants. According to the experiences of the practitioners and participants, PM methods based on high-resolution remote sensing images have increased practitioners' work quality and professional competence, and enhanced participants' active participation and spatial understanding for informed decision-making. Technical challenges and lack of skilled experts and institutional support were commonly identified limitations. Based on the users' perceptions we identified previously recognized enabling factors such as supportive policy environment but also context specific factors; removal of disincentives and wider awareness raising. Moreover, advocacy among policymakers on the benefits of participatory decision-making and geospatial technologies is needed to build their ownership of the new governance practices.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes In Urban Green Space In 107 Chinese Cities (1990-2019): The Role Of Economic Drivers And Policy
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) has gained increasing attention due to its environmental and social functions. However, the compound effects of climate change, population growth and economic development on UGS are largely unknown. We selected 107 medium-sized and large cities in China to investigate dynamics in the spatial pattern of UGS in relation to government policy and other drivers based on remote sensing data for the period 1990 to 2019. To explore the effect of different levels of urbanization on changes in green space, we develop a new Normalized Urban Development Index (NUDI) to classify urban-suburban-rural gradients, viz. Long-term Builtup, New Built-up and Non-Built-up. Then, we analysed changes over time in the annual peak value of fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) for 380,000 cloud-free Landsat images, and regional UGS dynamics were evaluated using the proposed Regional Greenness Dynamic Index (RGDI). Finally, to reveal the major driver(s) of changes in UGS and estimate the extent to which patterns of urban greening are due to differences in economic development, we compared the observed UGS spatio-temporal dynamics with data on several climatic, social-economic and land use related factors for the same period. The NUDI are shown to be highly effective in mapping urban development gradients, with overall accuracy in the identified classes of 89\%. Annual maximum FVC analysis indicates that there was significant greening between 1990 and 2019 in both the long-term built up (10,667.52 km(2)) and the non-built up areas (529,310.47 km(2)), while there was a major increase in browning (25,110.43 km(2)) in the newly built-up areas. The RGDI results indicate that 65\% (71/107) of long-term built-up areas in cities trended greener over 2010 to 2019 under consideration. At the whole city scale, RGDI is negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), although when considering the long-term built-up areas only, economic growth exhibits a significant positive correlation during 2010 to 2019 (R = 0.62, p < 0.01). This study offers important insights as to the patterns of change in urban greening extent over time and its underyling drivers across urban-suburbanrural gradients against the background of urban expansion, afforestation, climate change and economic development.

TI  - Application Of Multiple-Optimization Filtering Algorithm In Remote Sensing Image Denoising
AB  - Denoising remote sensing images is crucial in the application and research of remote sensing imagery. Noise in remote sensing images originates from sensor characteristics, signal transmission, and environmental conditions, among which Gaussian noise is the most common type. In this paper, we proposed a multiple-optimization bilateral filtering (MOBF) algorithm based on edge detection and differential evolution (DE) methods. The proposed algorithm optimizes the spatial domain filtering kernel and the spatial domain Gaussian kernel by using the standard deviation and width of the edge response. By employing the DE algorithm, the individuals in the population based on the standard deviation of the gray value domain are subjected to iterative mutation, crossover, and selection operations to refine the latent solution vectors and determine the optimal color space for optimizing the standard deviation of the pixel range domain kernel. As a result, the MOBF algorithm, which does not require any parameter input, is realized. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, denoising experiments were conducted on remote sensing images by using evaluation metrics such as the mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index. The experimental results revealed that the MOBF algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms for all three evaluation metrics.

TI  - Integrated Concepts In Water Reuse: Managing Global Water Needs
AB  - Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater, and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation, recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies. The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous. Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water, co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including: the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel applications; the need for public education and increased public acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians. Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception, understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate disposal), increase in the use of '' alternative sources '', environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation and reuse projects.

TI  - A New Temperature-Vegetation Triangle Algorithm With Variable Edges (Tave) For Satellite-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation
AB  - The estimation of spatially-variable actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a critical challenge to regional water resources management. We propose a new remote sensing method, the Triangle Algorithm with Variable Edges (TAVE), to generate daily AET estimates based on satellite-derived land surface temperature and the vegetation index NDVI. The TAVE captures heterogeneity in AET across elevation zones and permits variability in determining local values of wet and dry end-member classes (known as edges). Compared to traditional triangle methods, TAVE introduces three unique features: (i) the discretization of the domain as overlapping elevation zones; (ii) a variable wet edge that is a function of elevation zone; and (iii) variable values of a combined-effect parameter (that accounts for aerodynamic and surface resistance, vapor pressure gradient, and soil moisture availability) along both wet and dry edges. With these features, TAVE effectively addresses the combined influence of terrain and water stress on semi-arid environment AET estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in one of the driest countries in the worldJordan, and compare it to a traditional triangle method (TA) and a global AET product (MOD16) over different land use types. In irrigated agricultural lands, TAVE matched the results of the single crop coefficient model (-3\%), in contrast to substantial overestimation by TA (+234\%) and underestimation by MOD16 (-50\%). In forested (non-irrigated, water consuming) regions, TA and MOD16 produced AET average deviations 15.5 times and -3.5 times of those based on TAVE. As TAVE has a simple structure and low data requirements, it provides an efficient means to satisfy the increasing need for evapotranspiration estimation in data-scarce semi-arid regions. This study constitutes a much needed step towards the satellite-based quantification of agricultural water consumption in Jordan.

TI  - Forecasting Models For Surface Water Quality Using Predictive Analytics
AB  - Modeling surface water quality has become crucial in providing better strategies for managing surface water resources, and adequate findings need accurate and geographically dispersed data. Hydrogeological modeling of these data sets is possible using empirically-based models. The other statistical models are also an alternative approach. In this study, a process with maximum probability is considered with the help of machine learning tools (MLT) to have optimized and valid output. The proposed method combines remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS and GIS) and MLT, which are appropriate for the predicament of neither small, large scale, nor long-term simulations. MLT methods such as VAR and ARIMA are developed in the Python programming with Jupyter notebook and tested according to the data in the spatial prediction for surface water quality parameters such as Tr, pH, Ec, TDS, AL, Ca++, NO3-, So, Cl, F-, Fe, and Mg2+ in the Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India-lower delta part. The delta with susceptible zones was identified using RS and GIS as those areas are prone to direct exposure to surface water contaminants from aquaculture, agricultural runoff, small- and medium-scale businesses, and household trash. Achieving effective surface water management for this ecosystem is critical for regional water management. The geographical information about the concentrations acquired via the RS and GIS was compared to the statistical modeling findings and verified using real-time measurements. MLT modeling seems more realistic than the experimental setting; data from the previous 20 years (2000-2020) were used for modeling, and the predicted values presented in the paper are predicted for the year 2021. The computed R-2 value of ranges between 0.75 and 0.96\% is recorded with ARIMA, and VAR posted range between 0.56 and 0.75\% with the trained and tested data. The findings show the potential for MLT of geographically dispersed hydrogeological data to be used for pollution-free surface water management. From the surface water management perspective, combining RS and GIS and MLT offers an alternate data analysis approach for obtaining quick results utilizing a less laborious process that produces acceptable results.

TI  - Mapping For Coral Reef Conservation: Comparing The Value Of Participatory And Remote Sensing Approaches
AB  - Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66\%; RS: 76\%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.

TI  - Mesoscale Convective Systems Monitoring On The Basis Of Msg Data - Case Studies
AB  - Analysis described in the paper were made in the frame of the PROZA (Operational decision-making based on atmospheric conditions, http://projekt-proza.pl/) project co-financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. One of its tasks was to develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena, which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model) forecasts. The paper presents analysis of exemplary MCSs in the context of near real-time prediction system development and proves that developed tool can be helpful in MCSs monitoring.

TI  - Spatial Analysis Of Early Mangrove Regeneration In The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, Using Geomatics
AB  - Successful mangrove tree regeneration is required to maintain the provision of wood for silviculturally managed mangrove forest areas and to ensure mangrove rehabilitation in disturbed areas. Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
