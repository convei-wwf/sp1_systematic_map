1,"a nearest neighbor approximation methodology was introduced to fill the integrated multi-satellite retrieval for the global precipitation measurement mission (imerg) grid points from 2001 to 2014, together with the tropical rainfall measurement mission (trmm) data points for continuous precipitation forcing for our hydrological decision support system."
1,a software tool to access and format satellite-based earth observation systems of precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures was developed and is presented.
1,our results suggest that the model-simulated streamflow utilizing trmm and imerg forcing data was able to capture the variability of the observed streamflow patterns in the lower mekong better than model-simulated streamflow with in-situ precipitation station data.
1,we also present satellite-based and in-situ precipitation adjustment maps that can serve to correct precipitation data for the lower mekong region for use in other applications.
1,"the inconsistency, scarcity, poor spatial representation, difficult access and incompleteness of the available in-situ precipitation data for the mekong region make it imperative to adopt satellite-based earth observations to pursue hydrologic modeling."

1,"introduction the complexity of managing water resource, e.g., the mekong river, stems from the fact that there are many competing interests, such as societal, cultural, economic, and environmental interests, that all need to be synchronized to achieve the goal of prosperity and sustainability [1–6]."
1,"sivapalan and blöschl [7] argued that the role of finer resolution remote sensing data and models that represent catchments as complex systems and that link time scales, is the notion that is most common in the current era (2010–2030) to address contemporary hydrological challenges."
1,"growing populations, sustaining socio-economic activities (e.g., fishery), ecological needs, the effects of climate change, and energy security are some of the complex challenges experienced in the mekong river basin [8–13]."

9,"calibration and verification of the lmrb model using trmm swat uses many parameters to describe typical soil, plant growth, land cover, reservoir, and agricultural management characteristics."
9,"in this work, the lmrb model was calibrated to the monthly average discharge at the lmrb sub-basin outlets during the 2005 and 2006, with a few parameters as outlined in table 2."
9,the reason for selecting 2005 and 2006 as the calibration years was based on the fact that the precipitation amounts in these two years were close to the average annual precipitation over the lower mekong river basin.
9,"the validation of the lmrb model was performed at the lmrb sub-basin outlets during the time period 2001–2004, and in 2007."
9,the validation time period was picked so that a common time period for the available satellite-based remote sensing and in-situ climate forcing data exists.
9,"the availability of remote-sensing, satellite-based and in-situ air temperature and precipitation forcing data is depicted in figure 4."
9,the parameters used and suggested range values for the lmrb model calibration were consulted and obtained from swat developers (r.
9,"srinivasan, personal communication) and the previous works of neitsch et al. [33] and rossi et al."
9,all other parameters in the lmrb model were left at their default values.
9,"in table 2, we provide parameter-calibrated values for the two models that we performed (model forced with satellite-based remote sensing precipitation and in-situ precipitation)."
9,"three groups of parameters related to precipitation, high flow, and base flow are presented in table 2."
9,"the range of the correction factor to grid precipitation shown in table 2 are the values used in swat-cup to adjust the forcing precipitation data (i.e., increment)."
9,the calibrated values for the soil evaporation compensation factor parameter (esco = 0.6 and 0.75) were found to be lower than the previous values reported by rossi et al. [14] for the lmrb.
9,"generally, as the value for esco is reduced, the swat model is able to extract more of the evaporative demand from lower soil layers."
9,"we argue here that the newer soil data used in this work has influenced a newer esco value for the lmrb that is different from the default value previously used (i.e., esco = 0.95)."
9,"the parameters listed in table 2 are among many parameters that describe the swat soil physical characteristics and influence the movement of water and air through the soil profile and shallow aquifer underneath it, thus they have a major impact on the cycling of water within the swat modeling unit (hru)."
9,our hydrological model showed higher sensitivity to parameters related to correction adjustment factors for precipitation forcing inputs.
9,"figure 5 provides the lmrb model precipitation forcing adjustment factor layout for the in-situ and remote-sensing, satellite-based precipitation datasets."
9,this layout could be used to guide the correction of trmm and gpm earth observations for future applications in the region.
9,"polygons with no change in precipitation forcing adjustment (i.e., shown in white color) indicate the non-existence of rain stations or rain station exclusion due to the incompleteness of data records (figure 5a)."
9,this matches earlier observation seen in figure 1 that there are a few number of rain stations over the lmrb.
9,we note here that a sequential calibration procedure was performed starting from sub-basin outlet 1 and going downstream till sub-basin outlet 6 (sub-basins 7 and 8 are the western tributary outlets for the mekong river and are draining to sub-basin 5).
9,this has resulted in the production of the correction adjustment factor layout in polygons corresponding to sub-basin outlets.
9,figure 5 serves as a quality check for the precipitation forcing data in the lmrb when applied in hydrological applications.
9,precipitation forcing data from satellite-based remote sensing tend to be more skewed in the northern part of the lmrb in comparison with the southern part.
9,"in general, we found that running our model without satellite-based remote sensing precipitation data adjustments tended to overestimate the simulated discharge by about 13%."
