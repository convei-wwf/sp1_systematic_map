1,"using satellite data for northeastern iowa, u.s."
1,"geological survey scientists modeled the relations among land uses, agricul- tural production, and dynamic nitrate (no3-) contamination of aquifers."
1,they demonstrated that information from such modeling can allow more efficient management of agricultural production without sacrificing groundwater quality.
1,"just for northeastern iowa, the value of such remote-sensing information was shown to be as much as $858 million ± $197 million per year, which corre- sponds to a current value of $38.1 billion this image shows the next satellite in the landsat program, the landsat data continuity mission, ± $8.8 billion for that flow of benefits scheduled to launch in february 2013."
