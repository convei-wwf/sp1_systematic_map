2,"the literature suggests that studies assessing the economic value the method we use for assessing the value of eo information is an of information are limited and that few empirical estimates of the expert elicitation method based on bayesian decision theory, which beneﬁts of information exist."
2,"in the ﬁeld of environmental resource measures the extent to which policy-makers are likely to actually use management there are a couple of studies assessing the value of the information to change the decisions they make (schimmelpfennig information, for example gjerde et al. (1999) and nordhaus and popp and norton, 2003)."
2,"hirshleifer and riley (1979) theoretically (1997) in the area of global warming, and borisova et al. (2005) in the elaborate how this determines the economic value of information, area of water quality management."
2,"the value of eo for environmental concluding that information only has economic value when it causes resource management has been assessed by kaiser and pulsipher real welfare impacts, which depends on the extent to which (2004), chiabai and nunes (2006), and isik et al. (2005), and others, information is used to improve the decisions made. for subjects as varied as el niño-southern oscillation, the oil price to quantify the welfare impacts of better targeted water quality disaster, forest ﬁres, geomagnetic storms, pesticide use and the management, we developed a water pollution abatement cost model internet (see macauley, 2006, for an overview)."
2,most of these studies which minimizes the costs of water pollution abatement across the compare decision-making under uncertainty with decision-making catchments discharging into the gbr lagoon.
2,"to estimate the model under perfect information, interpreting the difference as the value of we used information from existing studies and from the great barrier information."
2,this basically assumes that information is perfect and reef water quality action plan.
2,"we used the plan as baseline scenario, that decision-makers act according to the information received."
2,"since or to be more speciﬁc, as an example of a non-targeted approach: in this is not necessarily the case, hirshleifer and riley (1979) argue that the plan, catchments with stark increases in sediment and nutrient bayesian decision theory is a more appropriate analytical framework run-off have higher reduction targets than other catchments, for assessing the economic value of information. regardless of the impact of the catchment discharges on the reef."
2,bayesian decision theory is concerned with decision-making experts argue that discharges from certain catchments are likely to under uncertainty and focuses on the extent to which decision- impact reef quality more: eo images have shown that river plumes makers actually use information to update their beliefs.
2,"this depends from the burdekin and fitzroy basin, carrying sediment and dissolved on the content and availability of the information, the perceived organic matter with its associated nutrients and pesticides, reach the accuracy of the information and the prior beliefs decision-makers outer parts of the gbr, which is not surprising given that these are the have (hirshleifer and riley, 1979)."
2,inherent difﬁculties in the two largest catchments discharging into the gbr lagoon.
2,"mckergow modeling of complex decision-making processes have limited the et al. (2005) argue that targeting interventions to these two use of bayesian decision theory for empirical applications (yokota and catchments would be most effective for improving water quality in thompson, 2004)."
2,"the few studies that did apply bayesian decision the gbr lagoon. theory to estimate the value of information have done so by reducing uncertainties regarding the linkages between land use, water the complexity of the decision-making problem by using discrete quality and reef quality are substantial (wooldridge et al., 2006; instead of continuous probability functions and by limiting the brodie et al., 2008a,b), partly because, at present, ecological and water number of possible actions and states (see for example, lybbert quality information concerning the gbr is scarce."

2,"in bayesian decision theory starts by acknowledging that decision- this paper, we will assume that eo river plume information can makers are uncertain about the so-called states-of-the-world."
2,"since actually clarify whether targeting sediment reduction measures to the decision-makers are uncertain, they have to act upon their beliefs burdekin and fitzroy basin would have the same impact as reducing regarding these uncertain states of the world."
2,"the states of the world sediment loads from all catchments 1 discharging into the gbr lagoon. may be something like “it rains” or “it is dry” and decision-makers although scientiﬁc proof of this assumption is still missing, the attach a certain probability “πs” to each expected state of the world experts interviewed indicated that this would be a realistic scenario to (σπ = 1)."
2,the role of information is that it gives a message m about the assess.
2,"clearly, reducing sediments would not be sufﬁcient for state of the world."
2,"this can reduce the uncertainty of decision-making, reaching good water quality, but given that nutrients and pesticides that is, if the decision-maker uses the informational message to often stick to suspended sediment, reducing sediment is expected to “update” her beliefs about the state of the world."

3,this is a rather intuitive ﬁnding: information states (s) x1: non-targeting x2: targeting that challenges existing beliefs and that is perceived to be inaccurate s1: no spatial variability in impacts payoff (x1|s1) payoff (x2|s1) is less likely to be incorporated into decision-making than information s2: spatial variability in impacts payoff (x1|s2) payoff (x2|s2) that is perceived to be accurate and that supports prior beliefs.
3,the ‘value’ of message m is simply the difference between the utility of the action that is chosen given message m (xm) and the action 3.

3,"since estimates of the full costs of reaching the gbrs since we do not know in advance which message the information water quality action plan's targets are not available, we used studies of service will produce, the expected value of the information is the the costs of pollution abatement in individual gbr catchments (see for expected difference in utilities of actions given the likelihoods of example roebeling et al., 2009; rolfe and windle, 2009; van grieken, receiving messages m (qm): 2008) to estimate the least-cost abatement policy for total suspended h    i sediment (tss) across catchments and crops."

3,both types of interventions are intended possible states of the world.
3,"for our case study, we distinguish between to lead to lower catchment loads of suspended sediment, leading to the following two actions: a) to continue with ‘business-as-usual’, i.e. discharges into the gbr lagoon."
3,sediment discharges are especially large the (non-targeted) gbr water quality action plan (x1) or b) to target from dry tropical catchments (including the burdekin and the fitzroy sediment run-off reductions measures to the fitzroy and burdekin basin): partly this has to do with climate (long dry period followed by catchment alone (x2).
3,"the fitzroy (143,000 km2) and burdekin river heavy rain) but it also has to do with the predominant form of land use, catchments (133,000 km2) are the largest catchments discharging into i.e. livestock grazing."
3,high stocking rates of livestock resulted in the gbr lagoon.
3,"due to the dry tropical climate in these catchments, overgrazing, and lack of land cover led to increased sediment discharge: with heavy rainfall in the wet season after an extensive dry season, and since european settlement nutrient and sediment loads have increased due to the nature of the land use in these catchments these catchment 5–10 times (mckergow et al., 2005; furnas, 2003)."
3,"in the wet tropics deliver large amounts of sediments with associated nutrients and catchments discharging into the gbr lagoon, horticulture and cane contaminants to the gbr lagoon (devlin et al., in press). production are the predominant forms of land use, both causing the effectiveness, or welfare impact, of both actions depends on the substantial nutrient and sediment discharges too (roebeling et al., possible states of the world."
3,we deﬁned the following two states of the 2009).
3,in the model we distinguish between 21 catchments and 2 crops: world: a) no spatial variability in water quality impacts (s1) and b) grazing and sugar cane. spatial variability in water quality impacts (s2).
3,spatial variability in it is important to note that the costs of pollution abatement are water quality impacts can be observed through river plumes.
3,"brodie higher in the grazing sector than in horticulture and cane sectors et al. (2010) describe the spatial variability in river plumes as follows: because measures in the grazing sector often imply lower stocking “in high ﬂow events, most the rivers of north-eastern queensland ﬂow rates whereas in the cane and horticulture sector reduced discharges fresh to the mouth and estuarine processes take place on the continental carry some beneﬁts as well (roebeling et al., 2009; rolfe and windle, shelf rather than in a traditional estuary."
3,river plumes develop in the 2009).
3,gbr lagoon and most commonly spread to the north and offshore under the objective function of the model is: the inﬂuence of coriolis force and the prevailing south-easterly wind regime.

3,"when spatial variability of water quality impacts is low, targeting ac total abatement cost the fitzroy and burdekin basin is not very effective, but when spatial f(a) abatement cost for pollutant p from crop i in catchment r as variability is high it is the most effective approach."
3,"by keeping the function of abatement intensity a. total impact of the different scenarios constant, we perform a cost- effectiveness of the alternative actions under the different states."
3,we use one constraint for each pollutant.
3,"in formula: hence, we do not estimate the welfare impact of the different actions but assuming the impact of the different scenarios is similar (i.e."
3,"ap = ∑ v pr ∑ ppri ⁎apri ð6þ reaches the same total suspended sediment target), we compare the r i total water pollution abatement costs."

6,"the analysis in this paper has shown that there is a business case 40 for additional investments in eo ocean color satellites, given the potential cost savings that the australian government may derive."

6,"applying bayesian decision theory i.e. getting closer to the perfect information curve, not only increases does require an understanding of how information might contribute to its value (i.e. to maximally 55 million aud/year), 5 but also increases improved decision-making and how it could inﬂuence the perceived the range of prior beliefs over which information is considered probability distribution of the different states of the world."
