7,"the relative agreement on the top 10 critical observations by the four cross-sba ensemble methods (fig. 3) demonstrates that these earth observations represent the most critical ob- servations required by users, based on their commonality to multiple sbas; their rankings are not a function of the type of prioritization methodology employed."
7,"also of interest in fig. 3 is the mix of types of measurements in the top 25 ob- servations, including direct observations, such as precipitation, and parameters derived from multiple earth observations, such as urbanization."
7,this mix in types of observations reflects the spectrum of users whose needs were considered as part of the study.
7,"users employ earth observations for a variety of applications, such as historical trend analysis, operational tac- tical decision-making, strategic planning, and forecasting, with various organizations providing data or information products across the spectrum."
7,this study found that users can be viewed as a spectrum—a “chain of users”—from researchers to inter- mediate users to end users.
7,"for example, weather forecasters are intermediate users, who analyze and interpret earth obser- vations and typically produce forecasts or warnings."
7,"end users, such as government officials and public health managers, take the forecasts and warnings and act on them, making decisions for societal benefit."
7,many sba analysts developed lists of users or frameworks to characterize this flow of data among users to capture appropriately user needs across the broad range of user types.
7,incorporating the needs of the entire “chain of users” added complexity to the analysis but was essential to ensure that the needs of all types of users were captured in the prioritization process.
7,"the prioritization analysis focused on the commonality and criticality of observations by sba, rather than by region."
7,"thus, users’ priority needs that are unique to a single region, when documented, are not likely to be among the highest ranked ob- servations in the overall cross-sba analysis."
7,"likewise, some user needs identified as high-priority in the cross-sba anal- ysis may not be a priority for certain regions."
7,"for example, the ecosystems sba included marine ecosystems as a sub-area, but user needs related to marine ecosystems are not likely to be priorities for users in land-locked regions."
