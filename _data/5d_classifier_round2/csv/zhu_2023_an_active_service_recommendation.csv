2,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 2 of 33 has the characteristics of diversification, thematicization and perspectiveness."
2,"however, it is difficult for users to comprehensively assess and expeditiously locate the satisfying content of numerous remote sensing resources in the system."
2,"at first, the remote sensing information system is an open and negotiable resource center, in which remote sensing resources (such as data and services) from different organizations are brought together with strong professionalism and distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics."
2,"they have structural and functional differences that cannot be ignored, as well as exhibit similar characteristics, such as spatio-temporal characteristics, etc."
2,"thus, it seems difficult for non-professional users to distinguish them through in-depth information analysis."
2,"moreover, diverse users may have vastly different experiences on similar resources, due to the contrasts among users in terms of professional background, research domains, and resource requirements."
2,"additionally, the network bandwidth, server performance, access load and user location of the runtime environment are also factors that cannot be ignored."
2,"at present, most existing remote sensing information services are in the modes of a query-based and subscription- based service."
2,"to be specific, in the query-based service, users set query criteria to express their requirements including key words, product grade, satellite model, etc."
2,"then, the satisfactory resources will be provided to them accordingly."
2,"as for subscription-based service, users always encapsulate query criteria as resource orders and submit them to the remote sensing information system."
2,"once there exist remote sensing resources meeting the requirements, the system will push them to users automatically."
2,"although these two methods help to complete the process of remote sensing resource discovery to a certain extent, there are still evident shortcomings, such as high professionalism in use and low accuracy, and diversity in results."
2,"these approaches require users to have a professional background and be able to translate their needs into specific retrieval criteria, thus in- evitably setting obstacles for ordinary users."
2,"moreover, these approaches are essentially resource filtering methods based on simple metrics, which limit the search scope and make it difficult for users to access high-value resources with implicit relevance."
2,"nowadays, users pay more attention to the proactiveness, pertinence and timeliness of remote sensing information services."
2,"the contradiction between these demands and the traditional remote sensing information service, with characteristics of passiveness, posteriority and monotony, is increasingly prominent [2]."
2,"to alleviate the above problem, it is urgent to design a “fast, accurate and flexible” remote sensing information service method to help end-users in different domains make a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate judgment."
2,"a log of research has been carried out on remote sensing information services to improve user experience, in which various excellent recommendation algorithms are intro- duced to address the information filtering problem, such as collaborative filtering recom- mendation [3–7], context-based recommendation [7–12] and hybrid recommendation [13]."
2,"unfortunately, these methods always face the challenge of achieving high accuracy and novelty in remote sensing resources discovery, due to the lack of consideration for the domain characteristics in information analysis and knowledge fusion."
2,"specifically, these methods fail to recommend remote sensing resources that are truly satisfying and valuable from the perspective of remote sensing users, and especially lack the modeling analysis of remote sensing users, and quantitative evaluation of remote sensing data and remote sens- ing service resources, resulting in many valuable remote sensing resources unmined, and the remote sensing resources finally recommended to users are too popular."
2,"to address this issue, we propose an active service recommendation model for multi-source remote sensing information, using a fusion of attention and multi-perspective, to enable self-regulated filtration and the intelligent recommendation of remote sensing resources."
2,"firstly, we char- acterize remote sensing users, then we build a user behavior information model and divide user groups."
2,"on the basis of user modeling and grouping, we conduct value evaluation methods of remote sensing information from multi-perspectives."
2,"specifically, we build the user-side value evaluation function by analyzing and mining the composition, access the frequency and behavior trajectory of users, as well as the resource-side value evaluation function of remote sensing data and services by way of analyzing their characteristics, costs"
3,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 3 of 33 and actual value generated in applications."
3,"then, three different heuristic policies with multi-perspective value evaluation are defined to support resource discovery, including the user interest value policy, the expert value policy and the domain value policy."
3,the user interest value policy can help users discover high-value remote sensing resources that are highly relevant to their own historical trajectories.
3,"additionally, the expert value policy can help users discover resources that are of interest to expert users in the same group, in order to encourage users to pursue the trajectories of domain experts."
3,"the domain value policy can help the users to discover hot resources in the domain they belong to, thereby effectively expanding the scope of users’ interests."
3,"finally, based on the attention network, we propose a multi-source remote sensing information recommendation algorithm (mrs_amra) by fusion of the multi-perspective resource discovery polices."
3,"based on mrs_amra, we further implement an active service recommendation model (mrs_asrm) for massive multi-source remote sensing resources, by combining streaming pushing technology, to achieve the accurate pushing of remote sensing data and service resources."
3,contributions the main contributions of our study are as follows: 1.
3,"we optimize the remote sensing information evaluation method by modeling and analyzing actual metrics in user behaviors, remote sensing data and remote sensing services, and reduce the impact on remote sensing resource representation from the uncertainty of the cloud environment and mutual independence of disciplinary domains."
3,"we put forward a series of targeted heuristic policies to support remote sensing information discovery, which optimizes the value assessment results from multi- perspectives, and meet the demands for remote sensing resources in different domains and groups."
3,"we innovatively put forward a recommendation model, which based on the attention mechanism, fuses different resource discovery policies into the deep collaborative fil- tering technology to upgrade the “foresight” ability of the remote sensing information system platform."
3,paper organization the rest of the current paper is organized as follows: section 2 summarizes some of the previous studies closely related to our work.
3,"our proposed methodology is presented and described in section 3, including the problem formulation, information value evaluation and recommendation model design."
3,experimental evaluation and result analysis are carried out in section 4.
3,"finally, conclusions and prospects are given in section 5."
3,"related work with the continuous development of satellite remote sensing technology, various satellite systems emerge endlessly, and the comprehensive observation capability of the earth has reached an unprecedented level."
3,"remote sensing data acquisition systems are in a gradual perfection process conformably, in which the remote sensing data show exponential growth in quantity, diverseness and technical indicators, such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution and spectral resolution [14,15]."
3,"simultaneously, the updating periods of remote sensing data are gradually shortened and lead to stronger timeliness [16]."
3,"remote sensing data exhibit the obvious characteristics of big data: volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value, as well as new characteristics, such as multi-load, multi-resolution, multi-temporal and multi-feature [15,17]."
3,"remote sensing big data covers a large amount of spatio-temporal continuous global data with high-resolution, which can provide more detailed information of ground objects."
3,"their value mainly lies in the representation of ground surface in a multi-grain, multi-temporal and multi-level comprehensive manner, and potentially useful knowledges, such as geoscience, social, cultural, etc."
3,"[16] these knowledges can be mined and refined to gain insight into macro-level trends, to conduct a holistic study of the earth system, and to reveal intricate inter-connections in it [18]."
3,the unique value of remote
4,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 4 of 33 sensing big data also promotes the wide application of remote sensing technology in the fields of land resource, urban planning, agroforestry meteorology, ecological environment, disaster reduction, and defense security [15]."
4,"the research on remote sensing big data has mainly oriented to the specific applications involving information exaction [19,20], data retrieval [21,22], data fusion [23,24] and data mining [25,26]."
4,"in a broad sense, remote sensing big data consists of data from satellite remote sensing and ground sensor networks, which can reflect the characteristics of earth-surface environment, and data from social sensing equipment, such as smart phones, navigation devices, wearable devices, video surveillance devices, etc., which can illustrate the patterns in human activities, and social and economic forms."
4,"however, the characteristics of remote sensing big data such as huge volume-wide sources and complex diversity make it a difficult research task in order to analyze and utilize these data effectively."
4,"in this context, the remote sensing active service technology comes into being."
4,"active service technology can automatically generate models and rules through deep analysis, the mining and processing of remote sensing big data to assist decision makers in strategic planning and scientific research, and improve the utilization and accuracy of remote sensing big data [27]."
4,"active service technology can help decision makers better understand remote sensing big data, and thus provide more valuable decision-making support."
4,"for example, in the field of agriculture [28], active service technology can help solve the problem of wasted agricultural resources, reduce the incidence of pests and diseases, and improve the quality and yield of agricultural products."
4,"in the field of environmental monitoring [29], active service can quickly and effectively discover pollution sources, detect the condition of vegetation, etc., and provide the corresponding determination results and countermeasures, as well as quickly extract the high-precision data needed in urban planning."
4,"in conclusion, the application of active service technology can enable the transformation of massive remote sensing data into valuable information to support decision making and planning."
4,"in the future, active service technology will provide more credible and valuable data support for geoscience research."
4,"in recent years, active service technology has been continuously developed and op- timized in the field of geoscience, and is widely used in the research of remote sensing big data processing and analysis."
4,remote sensing the active service is the premise of remote sensing big data information mining and promoting the transformation of remote sensing data to remote sensing knowledge.
4,"it can help users combine the application field characteristics and their own needs to discover valuable remote sensing data resources and service resources from the remote sensing cloud platform, laying the foundations for the subsequent realization of comprehensive analysis and deep application of remote sensing resources."
4,the remote sensing active service in the traditional mode mainly pro- vides remote sensing data downloads and remote sensing service invocations by the way of catalogue search.
4,"however, the degree of remote sensing information extraction and analysis is far from enough to support the adaptive provision of remote sensing resource information according to the dynamic changes of the environment and users’ needs, which makes it arduous to realize service on demand [16]."
4,"in addition, remote sensing application scenarios are becoming more and more complicated and personalized, which requires comprehensive consideration of storage capacity, access time, scalability, data security, service quality and other aspects for resource evaluation, as well as the dynamic changes of above indicators with the environment."
4,it is also necessary to deliberate the pyramidally personalized requirements of remote sensing resources brought by the expanding user category [30].
4,"therefore, it is necessary to measure the diversity and similarity among different resources [30], analyze their intrinsic connection and the degree of matching with users’ demands, then provide users with the optimal remote sensing data resources and remote sensing service resources on this basis to enhance the resource utilization efficiency of the remote sensing cloud platform."
4,existing remote sensing services are mostly tailored towards particular utilizations.
4,"however, the potential needs of information fusion and knowledge discovery are ignored, which forms a situation of data explosion and knowl- edge shortage."
4,it is a very pressing need to upgrade from the traditional query-based
5,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 5 of 33 remote sensing service to the remote sensing knowledge service with knowledge reasoning ability."
5,"in order to address the problems above, researchers intend to provide remote sensing knowledge services, an intelligent service with significant cognitive characteristics, to proactively recommend data of potential interest to users, based on the analysis of their preferences [31]."
5,"existing studies on remote sensing knowledge service are mainly in the conceptual stage, in which remote sensing information discovery and remote sensing information recommendation are typical application scenarios and essential parts."
5,"re- mote sensing information discovery is a passive-method of service provision, which helps users find qualified remote sensing services on demand."
5,studies in this domain can be divided into two categories: content matching based discovery and semantic similarity based discovery.
5,"jordy sangers et al. proposed a service discovery method using natural language processing technology, which determined the search target according to keywords provided by users, and improved the matching degree by the word sense disambiguation method [8]."
5,manoj paul et al. calculated the matching degree and ranked the services from the perspective of service parameters and text descriptions to accomplish remote sensing service discovery [9].
5,these methods usually have low accuracy in service similarity cal- culation and therefore an enormous keyword set must be built in advance.
5,"in semantic similarity-based service discovery, the ontology method is introduced to measure the se- mantic similarity between user requests and remote sensing services."
5,an luo et al. used geographic ontology to propose a multi-level semantic-based remote sensing information matching method [11].
5,qy wu et al. achieved different levels of remote sensing informa- tion matching via hierarchical matching and ontology classification [12].
5,all above methods realize the importance of efficient remote sensing information discovery.
5,"nevertheless, their accuracy decreases significantly when users are neither professional nor purposeful."
5,remote sensing information recommendation is an active method which could push the re- mote sensing data of users’ interests despite their vague requirements [32].
5,corresponding research can be divided into two categories: the preference-based recommendation and the feature-based recommendation.
5,the preference-based recommendation analyzes the behavior patterns of users from historical records and excavates their interests for selection.
5,"ln yao. et al. adopted probabilistic generation model to collect rating data and semantic content data of internet services, and captured user tendency through large amounts of hidden variables in the model [7]."
5,"hao tian et al. used user experience, the recommen- dation effect and evaluation tendency to build trust relationships to realize personalized recommendations [33]."
5,blessina gonsalve et al. considered the user location in collaborative filtering and improved recommendation accuracy by analyzing the historical load between clients and remote sensing services [34].
5,"these methods mainly concentrate on the analysis of user behavior, ignoring the utilization of inherent spatio-temporal characteristics of re- mote sensing services, whereas the feature-based recommendation takes them into account."
5,jh hong et al. proposed a location-based remote sensing resources finding engine (life) to rank and recommend a series of relevant remote sensing images to users according to the user-specific aoi [35].
5,"xu chen et al. extracted the content information of remote sensing images to construct the topic model, and used the continuity of spatio-temporal features to enhance recommendation performance [27]."
5,"xh zhang et al. proposed a recommendation model of remote sensing data by using retrieval history records and the unstructured meta-data of them, and discussed the influences of the granularity of spatial location and the number of latent tasks on top-k recommendation, as well [36]."
5,"benefiting from the development of artificial intelligence technology, resource recommendation gradually shields the barriers in underlying domain and semantics, and helps ordinary users obtain satisfied resources conveniently."
5,it is worth noting that the migration and application of the prevalent recommendation algorithm need to be carried out on the basis of delicate knowledge mining of remote sensing resources.
5,the method we proposed can be counted as the application and the expansion of remote sensing knowledge service in the remote sensing domain.
5,"as previously mentioned, the remote sensing information system carries abundant multi-resolution, multi-temporal"
6,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 6 of 33 and multi-type remote sensing data and services."
6,"although current studies mostly focus on the integration, organization and management of these resources, they did not provide enough consideration to the explosion of information caused by the expanding scale of resources, leading to a polarization problem that remote sensing resources are huge in quantity but scarce in application."
6,"most importantly, the incredibly valuable remote sensing resources are not fully evaluated and mined out, which ultimately affects user experience."
6,"therefore, we propose a recommendation model using the fusion of attention and multi- perspective."
6,"we design a working model of remote sensing knowledge service to analyze, mine and transform the information and knowledge from both user-side and resource- side."
6,"meanwhile, relying on expert experiences and scientific research needs in remote sensing domain, we propose the recommendation method for remote sensing resources, and endow the remote sensing information platform with the ability of resource perception and scientific decision-making."
6,proposed methodology this section introduces the proposed recommendation model in detail.
6,"firstly, we point out the problems that need to be solved urgently in conventional remote sensing information service methods."
6,"then, by modeling and analyzing the actual metrics of remote sensing information system, we establish a value evaluation method of remote sensing information from multi-perspective, such as the value of remote sensing users, data and service resources."
6,"finally, we take advantage of the attention network to fuse multi-perspective resource discovery policies, and propose a neural network based rec- ommendation algorithm."
6,"based on the recommendation algorithm, we further propose and implement an active service recommendation model for massive multi-source remote sensing information by combining streaming pushing technology."
6,"problem formulation in the conventional service model of remote sensing resource, there are human- computer interface, the remote sensing resource portal, remote sensing resource catalog, remote sensing resource service and remote sensing resource database, as shown in figure 1."
6,"users access the remote sensing resource portal through the human-computer interface, and provide keywords based on specialized domain knowledge to retrieve relevant re- sources from the remote sensing resource catalog."
6,the remote sensing resource catalog uses keyword filtering to extract eligible results from the remote sensing resource service and the remote sensing resource database and return them to users.
6,"there are large amounts of remote sensing resources with similarities in features and functions, especially in the same domain or relevant domains, which may lead to high volumes of retrieval results."
6,"thus, it is difficult for users to seek relatively consistent and useful resources through filtering returned records one-by-one and repeatedly updating query criteria."
6,users who lack domain expertise are caught in a situation where they spend lots of time and still find that it is an arduous task to find satisfying resources.
6,"more importantly, many users in the remote sensing information system do not realize their implicit requirements in most cases, which limits the service ability of the system and significantly reduces the user experience."

9,"firstly, cluster all users from the two dimensions of user static attribute (profession attribute) and user dynamic attribute (behavior attribute and trend attribute) to generate two kinds of clustering results."
9,"then, the groups of target users under the two clustering methods are aggregated, that is, the associated user groups of target users are obtained after the group results are merged and de-duplicated."
9,"algorithm 1 division and association of remote sensing users input: the user attribute set u a = {udata1, udata2, . . . , udatam}, the number of groups k; output: the user group ug; 1. for udata in u a parallel do: 2. user_static_vector, user_dynmic_vector = word2vecembedding(udata); 3. add user_static_vector to user_static_vectors; 4. add user_dynmic_vector to user_dynamic_vectors; 5. end for 6. user_static_groups = kmeans(user_static_vectors, k); 7. user_dynamic_groups = kmeans(user_dynamic_vectors, k); 8."
9,"ug = combine(user_static_groups, user_dynamic_groups); 9. return ug; 3."
9,"value evaluation function of remote sensing users firstly, we decompose the composition of user value from the three aspects of user activity, system familiarity and user credibility and conduct quantitative characteriza- tion."
9,"then, we further propose the value evaluation function of remote sensing users to comprehensively identify and measure the contribution degree of users."
9,"for the set u = {u1 , u2 , . . . , u n } composed of n users, it is divided into m groups according to algorithm 1, and the set gi is used to represent the group to which the current user ui belongs, then the detailed definitions of user activity, system familiarity and user credibility are as follows: user activity refers to the intensity of the user’s memory of the system."
9,"only when users log in the system frequently and have higher levels of stickiness, the value of remote sensing information system can be reflected."
9,"we quantified user activity by counting the system login frequency and login duration, as shown in formula (1): u a(ui ) = |ω|·∑ j∈ω tj (ui )/24d2 , (1) where d represents the total number of days from the date when users registered in the system to the current date, ω represents the set of user login dates, |ω| represents the size of set ω, and tj represents the total login duration of ui on date j (unit: h)."
9,"the more days the user logs into the system and persists for a longer period of time, the more active the user will be."
9,"for cold-start users, the user activity cannot be directly calculated because the system interaction has not been carried out."
9,considering the similarity of user activity
10,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 10 of 33 between users in the same group, we use the average activity of all historical users with similarities in the group gi instead."
10,system familiarity refers to how often users interact with the system.
10,"the interactive behaviors of users in the remote sensing information system include uploading, down- loading, browsing and evaluating remote sensing data and service resources."
10,users’ active interaction behavior can bring vitality to the system and effectively promote the benign development of the remote sensing ecosystem.
10,"combined with the characteristics of user access, we tag the remote sensing users with two roles: the producers who always upload resources, and the consumers who usually consume and evaluate resources."
10,"we quantify system familiarity through formula (2): sf (ui ) = αi · dur1 (ui ) + (1 − αi )· dur2 (ui ), (2) s.t. αi = dur1 (ui )/ dur1 (ui ) + dur2 (ui ) , where resource update rate dur1 (ui ) represents the ratio of update times of remote sensing data and service resources by ui to all users."
10,resource consumption rate dur2 (ui ) is the ratio of usage times by ui to all users.
10,the weighting coefficient αi is used to balance the two.
10,"similarly, the system familiarity of cold-start users is expressed by the mean of all historical users in gi ."
10,user credibility refers to the degree to which a user can be trusted in the system.
10,"a large amount of behavioral data will be generated when users interact with the system, in which we can find with similarities via trajectory analysis."
10,we use 3-sigma [37] to detect the abnormal behavior of remote sensing users.
10,"under this hypothesis, the user behavior statistics data conform to the standard gaussian distribution."
10,"since the probability of data points falling within µ ± 3σ in the gaussian distribution is 99.73%, the behavior statistics data outside µ ± 3σ can be defined as outliers, where µ is the mean of all user behavior statistics data in group gi , and σ is its variance."
10,"we comprehensively quantify user credibility from two aspects, abnormal rate of resource access and evaluation, as shown in formula (3): uc (ui ) = β i ·(1 − ara(ui )) + (1 − β i )·(1 − are(ui )), (3) s.t. β i = 1 − ara(ui )/( ara(ui ) + are(ui )), where the abnormal rate of resource access ara(ui ) represents the ratio of abnormal access times of remote sensing data and service resources by ui to all users."
10,"additionally, the abnormal rate of resource evaluation are(ui ) represents the ratio of abnormal evaluation times by ui to all users."
10,weighting coefficient β i is used to balance the two.
10,"similarly, the credibility of cold-start users is expressed by the mean of all historical users in gi ."
10,"finally, we standardize u a(ui ), sf (ui ) and uc (ui ), respectively, and divide them into γi (1 ≤ i ≤ 3) segments, respectively."
10,the value level of each segment is defined in table 1.
10,"then the user’s comprehensive value level can be expressed as formula (4): 1 γ1 ·u a0 (ui ) + γ2 ·sf 0 (ui ) + γ3 ·uc 0 (ui ) ,  uvl(ui ) = (4) ∑3i=1 ki where u a0 (ui ), sf 0 (ui ) and uc 0 (ui ), respectively, represent the value levels of each seg- ment u a, sf and uc."

11,"data value evaluation function remote sensing data consists of unstructured image data and structured description information (metadata) attached to the image, which can be divided into raw data and thematic products from the perspective of application."
11,"the amount of raw data is huge, usually tens of gb or even tb scale."
11,the result of raw data analysis by thematic appli- cation models is called thematic products.
11,"remote sensing thematic products have been widely used in agriculture, forestry, water resources, geological environment investigation, environmental protection, land use, urban planning and major engineering construction."
11,"different from the value composition of general intangible assets, the value formation process of remote sensing data has the characteristics of creativity, fuzziness of cost and expense, and risk in the process of value transformation."
11,"by analyzing the features of remote sensing data, domain characteristics, and the actual effects produced in applications, we comprehensively evaluate the value of remote sensing data from two aspects: explicit value and implicit value."
11,"as for the explicit value, we adopt statistical analysis of the evaluation data provided by remote sensing users and use the improved bayesian average model [38] to evaluate the comprehensive value of remote sensing data, as shown in formula (5): n ·∑i,j λi,j · r(i, j) + m· r avg dvl( j) = , (5) n+m where r(i, j) represents the rating of user i on remote sensing data j, and n represents the total number of users participating in the rating of j."
11,"r avg represents the mean ratings of all remote sensing data in the same domain as j, and m is the preset number of rating users."
11,"by increasing the number of preset rating users and the mean ratings of all remote sensing data, the bayesian average model reduces the influence of the one-sided evaluation of the data value caused by the sparsity of actual ratings."
11,"in addition, considering the difference of rating contribution users, we introduce user value levels to weigh the historical ratings of remote sensing data to improve the accuracy of the bayesian average model."
11,"the weighted coefficient is shown in formula (6): λi,j = uvl(i )/ ∑ uvl(i ), (6) i ∈u j where uj represents the set of all users who have rated remote sensing data j, and uvl(i ) represents the value level of user i."
11,"formula (6) indicates that the higher the value level of users, the greater the proportion of their rating in the value evaluation of remote sensing data, which reflects the importance of high-value users’ evaluation."
11,"in the actual scenario, users’ explicit evaluation of remote sensing data is extremely sparse, but implicit evaluation data, such as clicking, browsing and collecting, are con- siderably abundant."
11,these implicit data contain valuable information that can be used to compensate for the data sparsity of explicit evaluation.
11,"we carry out explicit processing on the implicit evaluation data, as shown in formula (7): −   bni,j · r avg / n c, δi,j = 0, ni,j > 0   r(i, j) = − (7)   rmax , δi,j = 1, ni,j > n r avg , else  − where ni,j represents the number of visits to remote sensing data j by user i, and n rep- resents the average number of visits to all remote sensing data in the same domain as j."
11,r avg and rmax are the mean and maximum explicit ratings of all remote sensing data in the same domain as j.
11,"indicator function δi,j shows whether remote sensing data j is collected by user i, δi,j = 1 indicates collection and 0, otherwise, b·c is used for rounding down."
12,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 12 of 33 3.2.3."
12,"service value evaluation function remote sensing services are an important resource in the remote sensing information system, which is mainly used for remote sensing data-oriented analysis, processing, access, decision-making with a characteristic of high integration, complete platform independence and language independence."
12,"we analyze the domain characteristics, access performance and running state of remote sensing services and evaluate them in terms of application value, maintenance cost, as well as service performance."
12,the application value of the remote sensing service refers to the value of remote sensing data it carries.
12,"the remote sensing service in the remote sensing information system is mainly oriented to the analysis, processing and production of remote sensing data: the core element."
12,"therefore, the value of remote sensing data is the crucial part of the value of remote sensing service."
12,"the set of remote sensing data carried by the remote sensing service j is denoted as dg = { dg1 , dg2 , . . . , dg m }, and the set of values of them is denoted as dvl = { dvl1 , dvl2 , . . . , dvl m }."
12,"then, the application value of j can be generated, as shown in formula (8): m av ( j) = ∑i=1 dvli /m."
12,"(8) the maintenance cost can be expressed by the storage space required by remote sensing data, whereas the service performance is mainly composed of response delay, throughput, sla violation rate and request error rate of the remote sensing service."
12,"more storage space indicates that the remote sensing service consumes more resources, such as storage, computing and network, which raises operation and maintenance costs."
12,"however, longer response latency or lower throughput indicates poorer performance of the remote sensing service, which degrades the user experience."
12,it is noteworthy that the storage and service performance of the remote sensing service for diverse businesses are quite different.
12,"as an example, the remote sensing services for offline data processing are usually disk-intensive and in need of more storage overhead, while remote sensing services for data accessing are mainly bandwidth-intensive and have a smaller response latency."
12,"at this point, there is little practical significance in cross-domain and cross-business comparison."
12,"our discussion on the evaluation of different remote sensing services covers the ones in the same domain and for the same business, in terms of maintenance costs and service performance."
12,"we use the improved topsis [39] to comprehensively measure maintenance costs and service performance, in which the entropy weight method is introduced to objectify the weight of the decision-making factors accounting for low accuracy, which is caused by subjective weighting in earlier studies."
12,"the remote sensing service evaluation vector is composed of five critical metrics, as shown in formula (9):  fs( j) = q j , rt j , th j , sla j , err j , (9) where q j is the storage space of remote sensing service j, rt j is the average response time in concurrent access scenarios, and the throughput th j is the number of requests successfully processed per unit  time."
12,sla j is the sla violation rate of j and can be expressed as sla j = rt j − δ /rt j . δ is the tolerance threshold of response time.
12,"err j is the request error rate, which is the proportion of the number of failed requests to the number of requests in total."
12,"in formula (9), th j is a positive metric, while the others are negative metrics."
12,"thus, the optimal evaluation vector a+ and the worst evaluation vector a− of topsis can be expressed as formulas (10) and (11): a+ = (min( q), min( rt ), max ( th ), min(sla)), (10) a− = (max ( q), max ( rt ), min( th ), max (sla)), (11)"
13,"remote sens. 2023, 15, 2564 13 of 33  where q = q1 , q2 , . . . , q j , . . ."
13,"q n is the storage space set served by all remote sensing services, min( q) is the element with the minimum value in q, while max ( q) is the element with the maximum value, and so on, for each of the others in formulas (10) and (11)."
13,"we respectively calculate the distance between the evaluation vector of the remote sensing service and the optimal evaluation vector, a+ , and the worst evaluation vector, a− , and then get the value of the remote sensing service with respect to maintenance costs and service performance, as shown in formula (12): ri ( j) = ( d − + − j / ( d j + d j )) q 2 s.t."
13,"d + j = ∑kk=1 wk ( a+ (k) − fs( j, k )) , (12) q 2 d− j = ∑kk=1 wk ( a− (k) − fs( j, k)) − where d + + j denotes the distance between fs ( j ) and a , d j denotes the distance between fs( j) and a− ."
13,"fs( j, k) is the k-th element of fs( j), a+ (k) and a− (k), respectively, denotes the k-th element of a+ and a− , and wk is the weight coefficient of the feature of fs( j) in the k-th dimension."
13,"as shown in formula (13), the comprehensive value of the remote sensing service can be obtained by synthesizing the multi-dimensional evaluation results, such as application value, maintenance cost and service performance."
13,"m dvli d− j svl( j) = β·∑ + (1 − β)· + , (13) i =1 m dj + d− j where the first part in formula (13) is the application value, and the second part is the value in relation to maintenance cost and service performance, weighed by β."

13,definition of heuristic policies to support resource discovery the heuristic policies supporting resource discovery defines the rules for discovering high-quality remote sensing data and service resources in the remote sensing information system.
13,"these rules are based on the multi-perspective value evaluation including users, data and services, and summarized according to the characteristics of remote sensing domain, application scenarios, etc."
13,"we divide n users in the set u = {u1 , u2 , . . . , u n } into m groups using algorithm 1, and use the matrix g = gij n × m to represent the user division result, where gij = 1 if ui belongs to the j-th group, and gij = 0 otherwise."
13,"then the detailed definitions of interest value policy, expert value policy and domain value policy are as follows: 1."
13,"user interest value policy (st1) there are massive behavior trajectories that are generated during the interaction between users and the remote sensing information system, which are cross-correlated with each other and contain a wealth of valuable information."
13,"firstly, we analyze the behavior trajectories of users to capture their interest patterns."
13,then we extract the interactive resources of all members in the same group.

14,"expert value policy (st2) the experts in remote sensing information system are defined as the most valuable users in each group, who usually have higher user activity, system familiarity and user credibility."
14,"expert value policy focuses on analyzing the behavior of experts, and recalls resources which are used more frequently by experts to help unprofessional users “follow the expert track”."

14,"in the constraints, uvl gij 6= 0 calculates the value of user group members, as specified in formula (4). argmax means extracting the group member with the highest value as experts; rvl( hû ) means value evaluation of the interacted resources of û; topk means to intercept resources with the top k value ranking into set qû , and qû ∩ hui = ∅ represents to extract resources in qû that the current user has not interacted with."
14,"domain value policy (st3) as mentioned earlier, the applications of remote sensing technology have entered into many domains, such as military command, land resource, marine resource, ecological environment, urban planning, population distribution and disaster emergency."
14,"generally speaking, there are also intrinsic connections among users and remote sensing resources in related domains."
14,the domain always represents a high level of technical expertise in a certain field.
14,"thus, in the domain value policy, resources with a greater value ranking in the relevant domains will be recalled to help users “recognize the hot research in a specific field”."

29,"we record detailed system interaction information during each query, such as the time required for users to perform operations, i.e., filling in query conditions, and the query time of each execution."
29,"then, we calculate the count of system interactions, system interaction time, average query time and total query time when all queries are completed."
29,"the user provides a satisfaction rating after each query, such as “satisfied”, “slightly satisfied”, “not very satisfied” and “unsatisfied”."
29,the satisfaction rating with the highest percentage among all queries is regarded as the final result.
29,"finally, we list the characteristics and experimental results of the three service methods in table 4 to conduct comprehensive comparisons."

29,"additionally, users only need to offer a simple interaction to be provided with resources matching their interests from the massive remote sensing data and remote sensing services."
29,"however, the content-based retrieval method relies strongly on contextual input conditions, which are difficult to adapt to potential changes in user interests."
29,"furthermore, the subscription-based retrieval method requires users to specify their preferred types of resources and initiate subscriptions, but in most cases, users fail to explicitly indicate their preferences, which requires extensive retrieval operations and independent judgment by users."
29,this is mainly due to how the active service recommendation performs its optimization from two aspects.
29,"firstly, the active service recommendation carries out user behavior analysis and user grouping in real time through the daemon process."
29,users are not required to input query criteria and perform the search process manually to obtain resources.
29,"when a user logs in to the system or browses resources, the active service process is triggered to automatically recommend resources of interest, simplifying the interaction between the user and the system."
29,"secondly, instead of manually adjusting the query criteria to improve accuracy, the proactive service method will fuse and rank the results that are recalled from multi-perspectives in terms of user interest value, expert value, and domain value, and can meet user needs by capturing changes in user interests."
29,"thus, the proposed active service recommendation model can reduce interactions and save resource acquisition time effectively."
29,"when new remote sensing data resources and remote sensing service resources are released in the platform, the remote sensing resource catalog will instantly notify the resource recommendation component to execute recommendation process again via event triggering."
29,"we use the average value of other resources in the domain, to which the new resources belong as the initial value, to solve the cold-start problem caused by the lack of historical interactive information."
29,"taking user37 as an example, the recommendation results after new resources going online are provided in figure 14, and red rectangular boxes are used to indicate the new online resources."

31,"in the field of agricultural production, the recommendation of remote sensing data resources can assist users to carry out a land resource survey, precise fertilization, etc., and improve the efficiency of agricultural production."
31,"in addition, another direction of research application is to provide effective data support for other domain technologies, such as uav cluster system [46], new mechanized operation system [47], etc."
31,"although we have done lots of work on remote sensing resource assessment and real-time recommendation in this study, we were not able to bring the algorithm online to a large-scale, real production environment for a/b testing due to the limitation of the research environment, and we failed to consider the time-series process of the remote sensing user and resource value change in this study."
31,"in the following research, we will attempt to establish a sequence model of value changes on remote sensing users and resources, and adopt reinforcement learning technology for online real-time learning and update of the model, to further improve the timeliness and effectiveness of the remote sensing resource recommendation."
