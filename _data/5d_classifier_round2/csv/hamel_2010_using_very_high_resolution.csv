1,"however, despite their potential, very little use of products designed speciﬁcally for ﬁshery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limi- tations and lack of awareness on the possibilities."
1,"given the theoretical beneﬁts brought by relevant hab- itat maps in ebfm frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate ﬁshery technical services demands and local requirements."
