1,8 satellite analysis ready data for the sustainable development goals brian d.
1,killough abstract satellite data efficiently prepared into analysis ready format have the potential to exploit the growing volumes of free and open data to address the united nations sustainable development goals (sdg).
1,"combining these data with modern data management technologies, such as the open data cube, allows users to rapidly produce analytical products and utilize time series data sets for change detection and interoperable use of diverse data sets."
1,"to demonstrate the potential of these data and systems to address the sdgs, several examples will be shown from the africa regional data cube."
1,it is these use cases that demonstrate the value and impact of earth observation data for a sustainable future.
