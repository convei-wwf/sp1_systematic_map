1,"brown department of geographical sciences, university of maryland, college park, md 20742, usa; mbrown52@umd.edu; tel.: +1-(703)-855-6190 abstract: substantial investment from both the private and public sectors will be needed to achieve the ambitious sustainable development goal 2 (sdg2), which focuses on ending poverty and achieving zero hunger."
1,"to harness the private sector, high quality, transparent metrics are needed to ensure that every dollar spent reaches the most marginalized segments of a community while still helping institutions achieve their goals."
1,satellite-derived earth observations will be instrumental in accelerating these investments and targeting them to the regions with the greatest need.
1,this article proposes two quantitative metrics that could be used to evaluate the impact of private sector activities on sdg2: measuring increases in yield over baseline and ensuring input availability and affordability in all markets.

1,this level of investment requires the engagement of the private sector.
1,"key players in the private sector include agriculture technology received: 23 march 2021 companies producing high yielding seeds and the inputs needed to sustain them, as well as accepted: 20 may 2021 retailers, agronomists and agro-dealers involved in last-mile delivery to small growers [3]."

2,"metrics on yields must be able to capture climatic, economic and social outcomes of investment and changes of policy through time [23], and show clearly how new agriculture management strategies, technology and interventions can counter these pests while still reducing poverty and food insecurity (table s1) [12]."
3,"sustainability 2021, 13, 5967 3 of 6 satellite remote sensing data can be used at each stage of the agriculture value chain, but needs to be connected with high quality, spatially explicit, regularly updated field data obtained from growers that captures agricultural activities to transform it into useful metrics [24]."
3,"new initiatives such as the eo4sd, funded by the european space agency, are focused on supporting the uptake of remote sensing data in sustainable development [25]."
3,"big data approaches provide the opportunity to combine satellite remote sensing with legal, economic and food security outcomes in new and novel ways, particularly leveraging improved computing power and machine learning techniques [26]."
3,metric to estimate market size to guide investment market size is the approximate number of individuals in a certain market segment who are potential buyers of a product.
3,"in regions with dated or only national-level agricultural statistics, the size of the market for high yielding varieties and fertilizer blends designed to meet the needs of specific crops is often unknown [27]."
3,"improvements in computer power and massive reductions in cost mean that, in the near future, the scientific community should be able to create annual global maps of rainfed agriculture for the major crop types of maize, wheat, soybean and sugarcane (figure 2)."
3,"using the spectral, spatial, temporal and agronomic information about crop cultivation practices, the research community can now create high quality cultivated annual area maps for each crop in africa and asia in near-real time [28,29]."

4,metric for 4.
4,"metric measuring crop for measuring crop performance and field-level productivity high quality, accurate, annually updated information on crop production combined with field size is necessary to estimate yield."
4,"these data need to capture not only crop type and variety, but also management strategy, such as information and information on fertilizer timing and density, weeding quantity, planting density, protocols, and weeding protocols, pest and and pest prevalence."
4,"given the and disease prevalence. hundreds of hundreds millions of small growers around the world, the large number of varieties of millions available and the need to continuously update the information, keeping the cost per data possible is point as low as possible essential."
4,"high quality yield estimates underpin financing is essential. which then provides access to additional technology [31], as well as insurance products needed by millions of farmers facing increasingly uncertain weather [32]."
4,using insurance to transfer the risk of buying high quality seeds and inputs to the private sector allows for the expanded use of inputs [33].
4,this transfer of this transfer risk also of risk provides information to evaluate also provides whether these inputs provide substantially higher yields year over year. year.
