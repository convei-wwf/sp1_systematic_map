1,"since then, korea has developed 15 satellites including eight small satellites, five cost–benefit analysis low earth orbit (leo) korean multi-purpose satellites (kompsat), and two geostationary orbit (geo) satellites."
1,"network building effect korea is currently developing kompsat 6 and 7 with advanced optical and radar observation capability, geo- kompsat 2b, middle-sized compact advanced satellites (cas), and next generation small satellite (nextsat)."
1,these efforts will raise korea’s satellite technology to the next level.
1,"to prepare strategies for efficient and effective development of satellites, it is essential to elaborately assess the economic impacts of previous satellite development projects and their application."
1,"in this paper, we examine the economic impacts of korea’s in­ vestment into the research and development of national satellites, and their application in the perspective of satellite value chain."
1,"to this end, we conducted a cost–benefit analysis on the development of representative satellites."
1,"as non-economic impacts, we examined the change of technology independence and technology level, network building effect, and aerospace ecosystem activation effects."
1,introduction satellites.
1,"among those satellites, korea aerospace research institute (kari) has developed and operated the kompsat series and the geo global satellite sector has grown remarkably since sputnik, which satellite series, as shown in fig."

1,"as a part of the strategy, there is a plan for satellite development as a latecomer, but has rapidly increased the level transferring satellite technologies from the public to the private domain. of satellite technology over the last three decades."
1,"therefore, for the efficient and effective investment strategy in the south korea started to build its capacity in the space field with its future, it is necessary to assess the impacts of the investment on satellite first satellite, kitsat-1, launched in 1992."
