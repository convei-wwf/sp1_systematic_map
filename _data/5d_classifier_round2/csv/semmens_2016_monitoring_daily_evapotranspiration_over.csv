1,available online 11 november 2015 this can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotem- keywords: poral characteristics.
1,"in this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring et as applied landsat 8 over two vineyard sites near lodi, california during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early evapotranspiration 2014."
1,the system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (starfm: spatial and temporal vineyard adaptive reﬂective fusion model) combined with a multi-scale et retrieval algorithm based on the two- modis source energy balance (tseb) land-surface representation to compute daily et at 30 m resolution.
1,"in this system, fusion tseb is run using thermal band imagery from the geostationary environmental operational satellites (goes; 4- energy ﬂuxes km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, ~16 day acquisition)."
1,"estimates of daily et generated in two neighboring ﬁelds of pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based ﬂux measurements acquired in-ﬁeld during most of the 2013 season with relative mean ab- solute errors on the order of 19–23% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d−1), reducing to 14–20% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (~5 mm wk−1)."
1,"a model overestimation of et in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop."
1,"spatial pat- terns of cumulative et generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management."
1,"the results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil mois- ture status at ﬁeld-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops."

12,"fig. 8 demon- strates variability in modeled daily and cumulative et through the study period over a 4 × 4 km box, approximating the alexi pixel area, including the grapex vineyards near the center."
12,"early in the season (doy 110), et is relatively uniformly distributed over the area while the background grasslands are still green."
12,"on doy 140, the highest et rates are associated with a few young vineyards in the southeast quad- rant of the image — likely resulting from early irrigation applied to help establish the newly planted vines."
12,"on doy 170, four ﬁelds of alfalfa south of the grapex vineyards are highlighted."
12,alfalfa has a relatively high water use requirement among agricultural crops.
12,daily water use in the grapex vineyards diminishes prior to harvest (around doy 245 in 2013).
12,"et variations between ﬁelds can be a result of different crop types or irrigation practices, or may relate to different soil charac- teristics such as texture and water holding capacity."
12,"cumulative et gradually increases throughout the season as well (fig. 8, right column) but rapidly increases between doy 230 and 260, the period covering highest maturity of vines and harvest time."
12,"while most ﬁelds in the surrounding area are vineyards of varying levels of maturity, the four alfalfa ﬁelds directly south of the two grapex ﬁeld sites have a distinctly different et signal over time."
12,"the high temporal frequency of clear-sky landsat acquisitions over this study area (approximately every 9 days) enables the identiﬁcation of when these ﬁelds (together roughly 600 by 650 m2) were cut (between doy 202 and 211, fig. 9), with the et signal showing very strongly on doy 202 and a few days later is equivalent to background et."
12,note that this scale of change (sub-modis pixel scale) is not likely to be ro- bustly recovered by the landsat/modis fusion process.
12,such localized change detection can only be accomplished with sufﬁcient sampling at the landsat scale.
12,cumulative seasonal et (fig. 10) over a broader (9 × 9 km) area sur- rounding the grapex study site demonstrates the spatial detail in water use information that can be generated using sharpened l8 tirs imagery.
12,"unplanted gullies in vineyards in the southeast are detectable, as is variability in the low-density residential area in the northwest cor- ner of the image (in contrast to the dense stand of eucalyptus trees due south)."
12,"at landsat scale, it is possible to quantify seasonal water use by crop and landcover type — again, this is not possible with modis."

12,"the within-ﬁeld et variability at 5 m resolution (fig. 11b) is generally spatially similar to that apparent in the 30 m resolution et estimates (fig. 11c), albeit with much ﬁner detail, partially resolving the individual vine rows."

13,"given that these features are classiﬁed as vernal pools, this may not be unreasonable."
