2,entropy is a function that describes the status of a system.
2,the reference value and variation of entropy are usually adopted in analysis and comparison.
2,"it is widely used in cybernetics, task planning problem probability theory, number theory, astrophysics, life sciences task planning is a kind of optimization problem with and many other subjects."
2,"in different ﬁelds, entropy has multiple constraints, where heuristic algorithms are usually different deﬁnitions and different combination methods. used to ﬁnd the optimal solution such as greedy algorithm, as a variable to describe the disorder of a system, the genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithm (huicheng et al., concept of entropy was ﬁrst raised by clausius in 1865."
2,"2013; pei et al., 2011; mok et al., 2019)."
2,"the characteristic of clausius deﬁned the increase and decrease of entropy ds in the task planning problem is that it is very complex due to a thermodynamic system: in a reversible process, the total quantities of constraints so that it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the amount of heat dq used at a constant temperature t can be absolute optimal solution."
2,"some researchers focused on the expressed as equation (1): constraints and raised the tabu search heuristic algorithm to ﬁnd the most optimal schedule for the given orbit dq ds ¼ (1) (cordeau and laporte, 2005)."
2,"there were also some t researchers who adopted a kind of heuristic algorithm to work out their lifecycle model of satellite observation task from the at the same temperature, the object transfers from liquid aspect of system engineering, in which they took the whole to gas; the heat of the system increases and the entropy process of the task into consideration to shorten the execution value increases accordingly."
2,"therefore, the entropy value time so that it could meet the time requirement of emergency is a physical quantity that reﬂects the disorder of the object. conditions (gang et al., 2013)."
2,"in the solid, liquid and gas, the entropy value in gas systems is highest and the entropy value in solid systems is lowest."
2,genetic algorithm pv ¼ nrt (2) genetic algorithm (ga) is an effective intelligent algorithm for solving task planning problems.
2,"it has the characteristics of according to the ideal gas law shown in equation (2), it can simple operation and the ability to ﬁnd the global optimal be known that for a certain amount n of gas molecules at a solution."
2,"therefore, it has a wide range of applications in certain temperature t, the gas volume v and pressure p are optimization problems."
2,"at present, there are many intelligent inversely proportional and the entropy of the gas system can algorithms applied in satellite task planning, which basically be increased by increasing the energy of the gas system."
2,when meet the requirements.
2,"however, how to improve existing the pressure is under one standard atmosphere, if the gas has algorithms and reduce the number of satellite revisits has more energy, the volume will expand more."
2,"from the microscopic become a vital research focus, which is conducive to reducing perspective, the volume is determined by the distance between gas operating costs and improving response speed. molecules."
2,"when the pressure is constant, the farther distance the researcher, baek, applied a new ga to simulate the between the molecules means the larger gas volume and vice actual satellite task planning problem and designed a graphical versa. user interface for autonomous satellite task operation to raise in chemistry and thermodynamics, the entropy value the whole efﬁciency and convenience (baek et al., 2011)."
2,other reﬂects the degree of chaos in the system as shown in figure 1. researchers proposed the concept of time margin to reﬂect the higher entropy means farther molecular distance and the satisfaction degree of task urgency requirements based on the system becomes more chaotic.
2,"on the contrary, lower entropy features of emergency observation."
2,"they also constructed a means closer molecular distance and the system becomes more priority-time-based planning target and conﬁrmed a series of stable. constraints to ﬁnd the solution of the model by using ga (chao et al., 2016)."
2,"at the current stage, the longest observation time of a single figure 1 system entropy concept orbit is always regarded as the most important factor in judging the algorithm efﬁciency in task planning problems."
2,"the planning results may cause the uneven distribution of orbit tasks, the insufﬁcient utilization of satellite resources, the increase of revisit time and the low efﬁciency of single orbit observation."
2,"through applying entropy operator in ga, tasks in a single orbit can be arranged evenly and the satellite resources can be used as much as possible."
2,the gae provided by this article gives more comprehensive consideration to the whole cycle of a single orbit and allocates the task sequence more reasonably to reduce the number of satellite revisits.

3,"when the entropy value of the single-orbit and transformed to the principle of the entropy increase, the planning result is low, the gap between tasks is small, which maximum entropy principle, the minimum entropy production causes the tasks to be concentrated in a certain segment of the theorem, the information entropy and other concepts, which entire orbit and wastes other parts of the orbital resources."
3,it have a huge inﬂuence on probability theory and mathematical also makes the satellite need to surround several circles to statistics. complete other tasks.
3,"when the entropy of the single-orbit the main idea of the maximum entropy principle is that planning result is high, the tasks are evenly distributed in the when only part of the knowledge about unknown entire orbit and the overall consideration is taken into account distributions is available, the probability distribution that during planning."
3,"it means while ensuring the duration of the meets these but has the largest entropy value should be single-orbit observation at the same time, the overall efﬁciency selected (jaynes, 1957)."
3,"phillips and his team introduced the of satellite observation is improved. use of the maximum entropy method for modeling species geographic distributions with existing data (phillips et al., design of task planning genetic algorithm 2006)."
3,"holder used the maximum entropy model and imitating the natural law of survival of the ﬁttest in ga, the landscape characteristics to predict the geographic studied problem is coded by the ga and then the optimal distribution of pelagic ﬁshes (holder et al., 2020)."
3,"when individual is iterated through a certain ﬁtness function for some values under certain limited conditions are known, human manipulation and selection. there are many types of pelagic ﬁsh distributions and the  encoding distribution with the largest entropy is selected as the prediction result, which is an effective treatment method as an individual, each chromosome contains a complete set and criterion. of task sequencing and several genes."
3,"each gene represents a the minimum entropy production is based on the entropy task in each plan which includes the start time, the end time, increase theorem and can ﬁnd the optimal and stable form of the wave position and some other information. the system (rusheng, 1985; fasheng, 1995)."
3,jing used the figure 3 shows an example of a chromosome with 12 tasks in deﬁnition of individual density to measure the population one orbit.
3,the reasonable arrangement of tasks in a track will diversity of the genetic algorithm and used the elitist strategy be gotten by the ga.
3,"under many constraints, different to drive the rapid decline of population entropy (jing et al., sequences will lead to different satellite revisit times."
3,with the 2019).
3,"when the population diversity is too low, the help of ga, the chromosome with the highest ﬁtness can be selection strategy based on the minimum entropy generation found and converted into mission planning results through is used to generate a new population to ensure population decoding. diversity."
3, selection the ga calculates the ﬁtness of each chromosome to design of genetic algorithm with entropy determine whether the chromosome has a higher probability of operator being selected or not.
3,"the ﬁtness function usually includes although ga has a great performance in task planning, it still factors such as the observation time of a single orbit and the has problems in uneven distribution of single-orbit tasks and duration of key areas."
3,the algorithm gives different weights to the lack of efﬁciency in the late period of the algorithm. different indicators and artiﬁcially adjusts the expected figure 2 different entropy in task planning result figure 3 diagram of one chromosome planning result 1238
