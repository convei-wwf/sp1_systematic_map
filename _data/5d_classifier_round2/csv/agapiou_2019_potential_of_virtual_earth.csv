1,"nowadays, a variety of satellite images have become accessible to researchers, while big data cloud platforms allow them to deal with an extensive number of datasets."
1,"however, there is still difficulty related to these sensors meeting specific needs and challenges such as those of cultural heritage and supporting archaeological research world-wide."
1,the harmonization and synergistic use of different sensors can be used in order to maximize the impact of earth observation sensors and enhance their benefit to the scientific community.
1,"in this direction, the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos) has proposed the concept of virtual constellations, which is defined as “a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focuses on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the earth system”."
1,"this paper provides an overview of existing and future earth observation sensors, the various levels of interoperability as proposed by wulder et al., and presents some preliminary results from the thessalian plain in greece using integrated optical and radar sentinel images."
1,the potential for archaeolandscape studies using virtual constellations is discussed here.

1,"introduction nowadays, a variety of satellite images with different spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions are available due to the recent advancements of earth observation [1]."
1,"however, despite the increasing availability of space-borne sensors, research is sometimes restricted by the mismatch observed between the individual sensors’ characteristics in regards to their resolutions."
1,"since each sensor operates in a specific wavelength range, and it is sensitive to specific environmental conditions, the acquisition of all the required information cannot be performed by a single sensor [2]."
1,optical and radar satellite sensors have been widely applied to support archaeological investigations all around the world.
1,"optical images are used to detect archaeological proxies of subsurface remains [3,4] and to monitor landscapes from natural [5] and anthropogenic hazards, including looting marks [6,7]."
1,"optical image analysis takes advantage of the visible (400–700 nm) and near-infrared part of the spectrum (750–900 nm), while recent studies in the short wavelength infrared part of the spectrum (1500–2300 nm) can also be found [8]."
1,"the use of radar spaceborne imagery has shown a significant increase in the last decade, mainly due to the advancement of the sensors 2019, 19, 4066; doi:10.3390/s19194066 www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors"
2,"sensors 2019, 19, 4066 2 of 14 spatial and temporal resolution of sensors such as those provided via cosmo-skymed, terrasar-x, and sentinel-1 missions [9,10]."
2,"radar images are currently exploited for detecting land movements and landslides in the vicinity of archaeological sites and monuments [11], while the potential use of high-resolution radar sensors for detecting looting areas has been reported in the past [12]."
2,few publications in regards to the detection of archaeological proxies can be also found [13].
2,a general overview of the trend observed in the last years in the field of earth observation for archaeological research can be found in the works of [14] and [15].
2,"while it is essential to capitalize on the capacity of existing sensors and to understand potential synergies between them, the concurrent exploitation of radar and spaceborne optical sensors for archaeological research is still limited."
2,"in an attempt to expand the scope of space-based earth system science so as to meet the needs of particular research domains [16], the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos) has proposed the concept of virtual, space-based constellations [17]."
2,virtual constellations are a set of actions aiming to coordinate space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners related to the earth system.
2,"as [16] argue, “[virtual constellations] are formalized systems, designed to address specific scientific and operational information needs."
2,"they involve not only sensors and measurements, but also data policies and archives”."
2,virtual constellations of planned and existing satellite sensors can help to overcome current limitations in research by combining existing space observations [16].
2,"the integration of space sensors in various research studies can maximize the outcomes and support future research, going thus a step further than the processing of individual datasets."
2,this paper aims to present the concept of virtual earth observation constellations for cultural heritage and archaeological research.
2,"the proposed concept is built upon the original work carried out by the committee on earth observation satellites (ceos), which formulated the concept of virtual constellations, which was then extended by wulder et al."
2,"although fusion and integration analysis of various remote sensing datasets have been reported in the past for archaeological research (see for instance [2,18–23], the concept of virtual constellations, proposed by ceos is more than complementary observations."
2,"it is a framework for synergistic and coordinated use of earth observation sensors to increase the data availability, minimizing “unnecessary redundancy and costs” [16]."
2,the opportunities raised by such an approach are discussed in this paper.
2,ceos virtual constellations concept virtual constellations are defined as “a coordinated set of space and/or ground segment capabilities from different partners that focus on observing a particular parameter or set of parameters of the earth system” [17].
2,"virtual constellations are built upon interagency collaboration and partnerships aiming to “address observational gaps, sustain the routine collection of critical observations, and minimize duplication/overlaps . . ."
2,” [17].
2,"the mission of virtual constellations is to promote the efficient, effective, and comprehensive collection, distribution, improve monitoring, assessment, predictive capabilities, and application of space-based image data of specific domains."
2,"until now, seven virtual constellations have been formed, namely the atmospheric composition (ac-vc); the land surface imaging (lsi-vc); the ocean colour radiometry (ocr-vc); the ocean surface topography (ost-vc); the ocean surface vector wind (osvw-vc); the precipitation (p-vc), and the sea surface temperature (sst-vc)."
2,"each of these vcs are dealing with a specific area of interest, aiming to implement novel strategies and data collection methods."
2,"it should be mentioned that these virtual constellations are based on the close collaboration of the various space agencies dealing with various aspects such as data calibration and validation, merging of satellite and in-situ data, product generation, as well as development and demonstration of new and improved applications."
2,the need for such collaborations is evident by the variety of missions and instruments available today in the domain of earth observation.
2,"based on the statistics of the ceos database [24], more than 35 earth observation agencies are active around the world in more than 25 different countries/regions."
3,"sensors 2019, 19, 4066 3 of 14 sensors 2019, 19, x for peer review 3 of 14 countries/regions."

5,"for instance, for the domain of landscape topography (for supporting land surface heights measurements, e.g., dems), 75 different sensors will provide continuous satellite data until 2036."
5,the list includes 31 active sensors and 44 new sensors which have already been approved (figure 2).
5,"given these numbers and the trend observed regarding space growth, supported by various national and international space agencies, the concept of the virtual constellation is timely."

11,conclusions
12,"sensors 2019, 19, 4066 12 of 14 5."
12,conclusions new developments of earth observation sensors and the development of advanced image processing are some fundamental changes observed in the last years in the field.
12,"due to the variety of sensors available today as well as the variety of space agencies dealing with satellite missions and instruments, the ceos has proposed a conceptual framework where these could be used together for the benefit of the scientific community by providing harmonized data, filling observation gaps, and improving monitoring, etc."
12,"this concept has been lately extended by [16], aiming to include other types of sensors which are incompatible between them as in the case of active and passive space-based sensors."
12,"this framework allows researchers to explore new ways of fusion, better integration, and understanding of the environment that is essential for various scientific domains."
12,"this framework could also support heritage management and archaeological prospection, thus maximizing the benefit of space sensors in specific domains."
12,"this integration is not an easy task, but it could fill gaps observed using established methods."
12,"as the results have shown, difficulties still exist and thus further research is needed."
12,"at the same time, efforts for integrating historical data (satellite and aerial), which are essential to better understand landscape changes, are also needed."
12,virtual constellation requires the systematic efforts of the scientific community as well as space agency authorities towards the integration of various types of sensors for archaeological research.
12,"therefore, the virtual constellation concept can be the framework for this effort as this has been already implemented with success in other scientific fields."
12,"from the experience and work of other ongoing constellations [16], it is clear that the cultural heritage section needs to investigate various approaches for gap analyses and requirement assessments, building upon the existing vcs."
12,the authors will continue to investigate how the synergistic use of radar and optical datasets (level arl-1) can be further exploited in a more systematic way.
