13,"lidar systems are typically classified as either dis- crete return or waveform (lefsky et al., 2002)."
13,"discrete- return lidar systems typically illuminate a small area of ground and divide the returning laser pulse into one or more returns defined by major energy peaks in the returned signal (lefsky et al., 2002)."
13,the returned signal typically includes a distance measure and the strength of return (intensity).
13,"waveform lidar systems divide the returning pulse into a large number of predefined height bins, thus capturing changes in the intensity of reflected energy at a uniform vertical height interval."
13,a majority of forestry applications rely on discrete-return lidar due to greater data availability and established utility.
