2,"eo4agri methodology for user requirements due to the complexity of sustainable agriculture collection we need to better understand all processes involved and build for each agriculture sector a new the eo4agri methodology was initially based knowledge management system (zhao et al., on foresight approach (crehan and harper, 2020)."
2,the main focus of paper is on the use 2008).
2,"the goal was not to create new user of earth observation, and particularly on copernicus requirements, but to make sense of the great number satellite data, in support of agriculture."
2,"this of requirements that have been created in the past paper analyses the role of earth observation (eo) via the efforts of projects funded by eu framework as a knowledge management system for sustainable programmes such as h2020, esa or ad-hoc agriculture including its current gaps and limitations projects and programmes funded by eu member (anderson et al., 2017; whitcraft et al., 2015). states."
2,"foresight is a strategic management tool, the main focus is on copernicus satellite data. originally employed in the public sector as an aid copernicus is a european asset for space-based in the design of research programmes."
2,"nowadays, monitoring of the earth, consisting of a complex it is much more widely applied, not only set of systems, which collect data from multiple in the public but in the private sector as well. sources: earth observation (eo) satellites typically, a foresight exercise produces outputs and in-situ sensors such as ground stations, such as vision statements, roadmaps and actions airborne and sea-borne sensors."
2,the data are plans for implementation.
2,"in general, a foresight processed providing users with reliable exercise involves: and up-to-date information through a set - a systematic approach to generate of services related to environmental and security knowledge about the future - insights issues."
2,"as it became clear, the key to unleash about future copernicus services and how the huge potential of copernicus is easy to access these will benefit the four focus groups its data and information products."
2,"in this regard, of the eo4agri project, namely the european commission (ec) created the agrifood, public, financial and food the baseplate for establishing an integrated ground security sectors."
2,"these four groups are using system (igs) for copernicus that will empower services of technical providers including the user communities to have the maximum benefits infrastructure providers, software providers from eo data and information (annex 1 to the ga, and eo data analytics sector; part b eo4agri)."
2,"eo data needs to be augmented with local expertise and this means that a deep - a wide range of actors relevant to the domain cooperation model needs to be incorporated. of focus of the activity including decision- makers and domain experts, as well as the research in this paper was performed during enablers, beneficiaries and other stakeholders the eo4agri project funded by the h2020 from the focus groups mentioned above. programme."
2,"the main objective of this paper is the purpose of their participation is to help to catalyse the evolution of the european capacity them learn about the domain or focus for improving operational agriculture monitoring of the activity, understand how change from local to global levels based on information happens in that domain, contribute derived from copernicus satellite observation data to the shaping of the evolution of that and through exploitation of associated geospatial domain, and get ready to playa part and socio-economic information services. in the implementation of recommendations materials and methods chapter introduces that might emerge from the activity; the research methods used to gather and analyse the outputs of the four focus groups were integrated gaps in exploitation of eo data for agriculture into a set of key documents including a white paper, including the methodology for user requirements strategic research agenda (sra), policy roadmap collection, stakeholder analysis, online survey and a collaboration framework presented as results and policy and implementation frameworks."

3,"these users can be subdivided the livelihood of farmers in europe and increasing into: europe’s overall level of resilience and security - a subgroup connected directly or indirectly of food systems in europe (crehan et al., 2019). with precision agriculture."
3,"this subgroup stakeholder analysis can include agricultural producers, service providers, advisers, machinery, and also eo4agri performed an analysis of the needs the food sector."
3,"the relations between of different groups of stakeholders from the four the involved stakeholder groups are depicted focus areas including agri-food, public, financial in figure 1. and food security."
3,"these areas are connected with agriculture, not only on the level of production - a subgroup related to the analysis of agricultural products and food, but also and prediction of the food market. on the level of developing policies for agriculture currently, customers of this information and financing (cap payment system)."
3,the four are mainly in the food industry.

6,"this approach offers significant activities – is in the process of implementation, simplification and streamlining of iacs and should but implementation is not as fast as it could be. reduce the number of costly inspections in the field."
6,based on that all eu member states could each eu member state and paying agency has use data from the eu’s copernicus sentinel satellites to ensure that farmers rightfully receive subsidies and other eo data as evidence when checking for their good practices.
6,"the current practice is farmers’ fulfilment of requirements under the cap that these entities mainly perform on-farm checks for area-based payments (either direct payments (on a randomly selected and risk analysis-based to farmers or rural development support payments), sample of farmers), the so called on-the-spot as well as cross-compliance requirements, such checks, and farmers with poor performances as stubble burning."
6,"other new forms of evidence in relation to their subsidies’ requirements such as geo-tagged photos, information are subject to penalties which may include from drones and relevant supporting documentation exclusion from participation in funding schemes from farmers, such as seed labels, also are acceptable and/or monetary fines."
6,"this system partly relies for the first time, as part of a broader shift towards on control with remote sensing (cwrs) a so-called ‘monitoring approach’ that will lead with the use of eo data: very high resolution to a decrease in the number of on-farm checks."
6,"visits – vhr and high resolution – hr (10-20 m) images, to the field will be only necessary when the digital with the possibility to use the other available evidence is not sufficient to verify compliance. satellite data as complementary data source."
6,cooperation framework on-farm checks entail serious drawbacks.
6,"they provide only a “snapshot” verification of farmers’ in order to discuss our achievements practices and the state of their farmland, taken with the broader community, eo4agri was active at a specific moment in time; they are conducted in cooperation with international and european only on a small sample of farmers (in the case initiatives and projects."
6,"during the first year, of farmers applying for eu subsidies); they are eo4agri succeeded to meet most of the key time-consuming and their cost is significantly players on the global and european scene."
6,one high (especially when there is a need for follow of them is the food and agriculture organization up on-farm inspections); and when performed (fao) as the main means of communication with the support of remote sensing images at fixed with the un.
6,"the target of the discussion was time windows, they are not adequate for capturing on how eo can support global food and nutrition most of the temporal agronomic practices security and un sdgs focused on agriculture. and farming activities."
6,"the cooperation with fao was done mainly through common activity in the agricultural data aiming to solve the above-mentioned problems interest group (igad) of the research data and to make the farm inspections a more efficient, alliance (rda)."
6,"eo4agri established a contact transparent and flexible process, the cbm concept with the group on earth observations (geo) mainly was introduced."
6,cbm does not represent a standard through cooperation with geoglam.
6,"there was on-the-spot checks (neither cwrs), but rather also an intensive cooperation with the global open a different approach of integrated administration data for agriculture and nutrition (godan), where and control system (iacs) mechanism."
6,eo4agri organised a number of meetings together the ambition is to completely replace on-farm with godan mainly on igad rda meetings checks with the use of automated checks based and also cooperated in the preparation and promotion on eo data which enable specific “snapshot” of inspire hackathons.
6,"eo4agri also organised verification of sustainable agricultural practices, a common workshop with geoglam and godan applying the same logic as in the field, but through for the geo ministerial meeting in canberra. a computer-assisted environment, or the continuous the direction of the future cooperation activities (through the year) monitoring of farmland. with godan are mainly in promotion of open cbm was introduced in 2017, and the new rules data and capacity building."
6,the standardisation came into force in may 2018.
6,"starting from 2018 of information in agriculture, including eo is done (art. 40a of ec regulation 809/2014) the cbm through igad and ogc, where there is broad became part of iacs and there is now an option cooperation (druml et al., 2020). to carry out cbm on 100% of beneficiaries [112]"

7,most - two thirds of respondents state that they buy analysed projects are from the copernicus library data at a price of less than 5 euro per hectare. of research projects listed in appendix a (eo4agri the same number of respondents indicates - analysis of previous projects).
7,the requirements that the yield from hectares will rise were mapped to the stakeholder groups mentioned by up to 20 euros thanks to eo information. in the previous section.
7,"requirements that are common if we select only responses from the private to three or more stakeholder groups were labelled sector, then their answers correspond as gold requirements, overlapping requirements to answers of other stakeholder groups between two stakeholder groups were labelled with one exception."
7,"the exception is as silver requirements and bronze requirements the requirement for a higher gsd which is are those belonging to just one stakeholder group. only 50% compared to almost 90% of other the user requirements categorised as gold, silver stakeholder groups."
7,a half of the respondents and bronze requirements are presented from the private sector are satisfied in appendix b (eo4agri - user requirements with what they work with (usually and gap analysis in different sectors).
7,gsd = 10-30 m).
7,questionnaire analysis the statistical summary and responses are an online questionnaire conducted by the eo4agri in appendix c (eo4agri - the statistical project resulted in more than sixty responses that summary and response to the main user were analysed.
7,"the main results of the questionnaire requirements). include: analysis of outputs from workshops, webinars - 75% of respondents state that they are well and hackathons acquainted with eo issues."
7,this proportion the gap analysis and foresight activities started is similar in all stakeholder groups; during the year 2019 and ran until january 2020. - 80% of respondents who grow cereals are during this period eo4agri organized four in situ mainly interested in the effect of using eo meetings in order to identify gaps with the main information in the form of increased yield stakeholders groups mentioned in stakeholder and profit and sustainability of their farming analysis and provided foresight exercises to build and businesses; a new vision of eo for agriculture for future periods.
7,"the gap analysis and future vision were - 55% of respondents farm on less than 30 ha discussed during the follow up in-situ events (of which 20% for less than 5 ha) and 35% including the nairobi inspire hackathon 2019, farm on more than 250 ha; eo4agri stakeholder workshop in pilsen, geo - respondents see difficulties in interpreting week 2019 and the geo ministerial summit remote sensing data and real-time in canberra, november 19ogc tc/pc meetings unavailability of data as the main obstacles - toulouse, france 2019 and prague week on big of more extensive use of eo in agriculture; and open data and innovation hubs 2020. - 80% of respondents use data made available the covid 19 outbreak created an unprecedented through public servers and the same number and unpredictable situation that made it impossible use multispectral data from sentinel to organize face-to-face conferences, workshops, and landsat satellites for their work at least seminars and hackathons."
7,"therefore, all planned once a week; meetings and workshops were organized as fully - rgb data is used by 40% of respondents; virtual events."
7,"about ten virtual events were organised in order to validate the eo4agri results. - respondents consider the ground sample distance to be insufficient, when 32% during both in situ and virtual events new of respondents require data with a ground requirements for the agri-food and public sectors sample distance (gsd) of less than 1 m and data requirements were defined and become [113]"

11,"final recommendations - provision of super-resolution approaches to increase the spatial resolution on the basis of previous analysis, the eo4agri of the sentinel missions using commercial prepared three sets of recommendations, for future vhr/hhr data as calibration and validation better utilisation of earth observation technologies points. in agriculture."
11,it could be divided as: a major benefit would also be to integrate field - technological recommendations polygons as open government data and directly - future scientific priorities allow analysis on field level and lifting the burden - organisation recommendations on field parcel delineation.
11,"on top, the integration technology recommendations of various other in-situ data is advised: overall, a wide range of agricultural applications - agricultural in-situ data like jecam supported by copernicus data and services (joint experiment for crop assessment already exist including a long list of success and monitoring). etc. wherever possible; stories."
11,"however, there is still a large potential - option to integrate your own data: for improvements."
11,"concrete short term and long - (agricultural) machinery data, support term actions were identified including the agenda for agro-xml for future research (kolitzus, 2020). - drone data technical aspects - iot for many applications in agriculture the spatial - farm management tools such as fast and temporal resolutions of the sentinel missions as a consequence, the support and further are not sufficient, and the upcoming open satellite development of various agriculture missions will not close this gap entirely."
11,data fusion for research (ard) initiatives is recommended in with commercial data providers seems absolutely the short term.
11,"in long-term, a closer collaboration necessary and two potential copernicus products between open eo data service providers with huge added value are possible: and commercial providers are recommended: - provision of a gap-filled time series - further finance and support such as data of vegetational and biophysical parameters cube; (with s-1/s-2/s-3 and commercial vhr/ hhr data) going towards daily observation; - consider sensor alignment with commercial [117]"
12,the role of remote sensing in agriculture and future vision service providers already in the design phase limited to a narrow phenological window (1 or 2 of new sensors; weeks) where the decision-making capabilities of copernicus are needed.
12,the required temporal - invest in research dedicated to data fusion resolution for many agricultural applications is techniques and cross-sensor calibration therefore very high as well. - close collaboration with existing and possible the existing copernicus missions already future providers to ensure compatibility cover many of the identified requirements in the long run; of the agriculture domain.
12,"additionally, the foreseen - for new projects it could be suggest evolution of the existing copernicus missions and or made mandatory to contribute and upcoming candidate missions further fulfil and share available data (following standard the requirements."
12,"however, some conclusions can procedures and protocols) with one be made for the evolving mission specifications or several of the available initiatives (dias, of the sentinel programme in the long term, euro data cube); especially with regards to spatial resolution (~5m) and revisit times (1-3 days)."
12,"a number - furthermore, newly developed methods of gaps not covered were identified, in particular and applications in the field of precision concerning vhr optical data, hhr optical data agriculture and overall in the domain and high-resolution x-band sar data, all of which of remote sensing are often only trained are available from commercial providers. and tested in small areas of interest and their with respect to microwave and thermal data accuracies are often much lower or highly (i.e., lstm and cims), further developments may uncertain when applied in other geographic inform future more detailed data requirements regions."
12,the lack of standardized on these topic. and designated testing areas across the globe and the provision of reference ict aspects datasets (including ground truth) would the copernicus satellite observation capacities facilitate the comparability of existing are operational and are routinely providing methods and the assessment of their high-cadence monitoring data.
12,in addition accuracies.
12,"especially the provision of parcel/ to the copernicus open data hub, five dias are field level might will drastically improve operationally providing data access as well as usability and enable new applications. computational resources."
12,"however, it must be satellite mission noted that no certainty about sustainability of dias future operations beyond 2021 exists."
12,"the copernicus sentinel fleet is offering unprecedented data and is the most ambitious the continuation of at least one of the dias endeavour in the domain of land monitoring so far. providers is highly recommended to facilitate the use in the context of agricultural monitoring, a couple of copernicus data and services."
12,"the functionality of aspects are noteworthy. to process and provide higher pre-processing level data and (c)ard have been demonstrated and is given that for agriculture the natural unit is advised to continue. a field/parcel, the spatial resolution is dictated by this aspect."
12,"field sizes vary largely overall, the interoperability with other satellite over the globe of course, but overall, spatial data as well as in-situ data from all parts resolution is not satisfactory for a large number of the agricultural value chain still has room of applications, a spatial resolution between 1 and 5 for improvements."
12,"this includes data such as direct meters is desirable. meteorological data (forecast as well as historical data), climatic data or other machinery or ground- in contrast to the monitoring of other landscapes based soil data."
12,"activities such as the euro data and landscape objects, agriculture is highly cube and the agricultural virtual laboratory are variable (more variable than forest) and due to crop further follow-up on this approach. rotation or other management practices, it might be a different phenology every other year."
12,"future scientific priorities in addition to that, during a single growing season, on the basis of the analysis of stakeholder needs various types of plants will grow and the overall a set of future scientific priorities were defined. phenological fluctuation is larger than for other these priorities could help to policy makers land cover and land use."
12,"on top of that, the window prepare new research programmes and scientific of opportunity for precision farming is very often communities to identify new research directions."
13,the role of remote sensing in agriculture and future vision the priorities are divided into four thematic groups: and guarantee sustainability and profitability of agriculture; ◦ biodiversity - current precision agriculture is mainly - analysis of historical development focused on site specific operations (where). and understanding of interrelation between our analysis demonstrates that for future changes in biodiversity and climate.
13,"there we need much more consider right timing exists historical data from eo with relatively of operation (when), based on analysis high frequency for more than 40 years. of eo and climatic data and also for such periods are also available detailed on selection of rights species, chemicals, climatic data."
13,using artificial intelligence operations (what); on this historical data can help us to improve understanding of biodiversity decline; - combining satellite data and climatic data from different zones to build strategy - earth onservation data will be ideal source for smart farming; for real time monitoring in large scale and early warning. - build new crop growth scenarios under different weather events.
13,"plan optimal ◦ sustainable farming timing for different field operations; - there is necessary research in different - prediction of disease susceptibility of crop methods of monitoring and data fusion using the temporal crop dynamics of satellite data, with iot data and also from earth onservation data; integration of climatic data and also existing terrestrial data."
13,"it is also important - accurate monitoring of crop phenology; to include commercial very high resolution - assessment of hydrological flows through data, aerial and uaw data."
13,"there will a combination of field observations be necessary cost benefit analysis and output from satellite image analysis and selection of best monitoring methods. workflows; the research has cover selection of bands, - augmenting weather and climate analysis of time series, data fusion; monitoring through the use of affordable - future precision farming has to be focused in-situ weather sensors and remote sensed on reducing the use of usage chemicals, weather estimates; but guarantee production."
13,"so, there is - usage of satellites with very high necessary research in nutrition and crop resolution. protection, but also in methods of seeding ◦ innovation governance or tillage."
13,"research needs to compare the potential of different approaches - the research has to be focused, how eo to utilisation of precision agriculture. can support forming regional, national for example, now in fertilisation are used and local policies."
13,"the focus will be two different strategies the yield-oriented on analysis of agriculture production, strategy is based on the principle of a higher biodiversity and provide impact assessment requirement for nitrogen nutrient to cover of governmental decisions; a higher level of expected crop - to be able to fully use the potential yield, which is spatially distributed of environmental observation it is by the yield productivity zones. a necessary guarantee in global scale the second strategy homogenization easy discoverability of data."
13,metadata is based on the concept of agronomic is necessary to include all history and nutritional practice developed since of processing (provenance).
13,"there is need the 1980´s, when nitrogen is considered for supporting better interoperability a yield-limiting factor and low-yielded of earth onservation data. areas are supported by higher doses the recommendation is to organise of n."
13,"there exist number of similar coordination and support action to support agronomic problems, for example fair and interoperability among existing tillage and non-tillage, etc. and there is platforms; necessary provide comparison of all such possibilities and select, such which will - the fair principles, metadata help fulfil requirements of green deal and interoperability need to be topic; [119]"
14,"the role of remote sensing in agriculture and future vision - effective agricultural knowledge technologies; and innovation systems (akis) are key - development and integration of different drivers to enhance co-creation and thus data like data from iot technologies speed up innovation and the take-up and citizens science; of results needed to achieve the green deal - advanced 2/3/4 d visualisation methods, objectives and targets."
14,there is now a large virtual reality; investment into digital innovation hubs (smartagrihubs).
14,"the model of digital - how to guarantee storage, easy discovery innovation hubs has to be implemented and fast access extremely large data sets; to increase knowledge and awareness - hpc computing including parallelization about earth observation methods. of code; the existing infrastructures (dias, - development of new hyperspectral systems euxdat, eosc, etc.). with high resolution; ◦ enabling technologies - increase resolution of new systems; - object recognition from satellite and other - analysis of hyperspectral data including images."
14,from in situ cameras (on board new indexes; cameras on agriculture machinery) strong - temporal analysis of data; focus will be on embedding of ai directly - data fusion with other data sources; into on board computers with possibility - better utilisation of radar and lidar data. to detect objects directly on board for example to detect on the fly pest organisational recommendations or weeds.
14,this will be also closely related the last set of recommendations was focused to robotics system.
14,"similar solutions can be on organisational aspects, what has to be also applied on uav platforms; done to guarantee better utilisation of eo data - analysis of time series."
14,this time series in the agriculture segment.
14,"we defined ten key of data coming from iot technologies, recommendations: data from satellite and climatic data - organise regular workshops and conferences and their combination will be probably of all interested stakeholders."
14,"these key technologies for building future workshops and conferences have to lead scenarios taking into account, that there to the exchange of information, but they also exist historical satellite and climatic data need to educate all stakeholders about new for more than 40 years, this offers methods; large possibilities for training ai tools on historical data and then use these - support cooperation of all players technologies for building of future from the public and private sectors to fulfil scenarios."
14,"this could be used in precision the european green deal, destination earth agriculture, biodiversity, climatic changes and the un sdgs."
14,"it will also invite the food mitigation, etc.; industry, machinery, chemical industry, it industry, financing organizations to build - trust and provenance of data - it seems a common environment; that these are two independent issues, but they are linked."
14,"when we will share - support new common multi-actor research data, which are not open we need to protect involving both eo and agricul-ture/ this data, so we need tools for tracing agronomy experts to develop new methods data owners, but we also need to make that guarantee food security and agriculture evidence of any operation provided on data sustainability; and in the end, we need to store - support the farming sector with open data, this information in metadata."
14,such including copernicus and other eo data. functionality could be probably solved this will require additional investments.
14,"put by tools for data security in combination into the practice fair principles; with technologies like blockchain, - developed new metadata models and strategy which will give evidence about using for sharing all data across agriculture; data resources and their combination and analysis."
14,this could be done - reuse previous solution.
14,"on the one side, by combination metadata with blockchain continue with the development of new [120]"
15,the role of remote sensing in agriculture and future vision technologies and eo methods to build future the paper demonstrates how the eo aspect digital twins.
15,"on the other side, there exists in support of agriculture should improve. a large potential of existing technologies there is a clear need for new data, better spatial recently developed, which potential is not and temporal resolutions, new bands, and more fully exploited."
15,it’s necessary to prepare dense data.
15,"the research, however, revealed that an overview of existing technologies farmers' willingness to pay for such services and discussion among the teams on how are limited."
15,"this is one of the limiting factors to make solutions interoperable and how for the future development of eo services to re-use existing solutions; in the agriculture domain. - finance a large number of smaller independent the need for in-situ data is another important issue, projects for technical development."
15,this can helping users to use remote sensing data optimally. bring new ideas in the short term; the process of deriving useful information from satellite data that can help farmers to make - support standardization efforts and use precise decisions must be supported.
15,one of existing standards.
15,"this needs to be done of the conclusions on how to help make more in cooperation with existing standardization intensive use of eo data is the idea the dias bodies including ogc, iso, and w3c; instances will be self-financed, which could lead - spport large scale coordination actions, which to the fact that some of them will be not operational will improve cooperation among different after the end of their contracts. projects, initiatives, and standardization on the one hand, there are large investments organizations."
15,this needs to sup-port both from the public to private to build new standardisation and fair principles; solutions and delivery platforms.
15,"on the other - there exist several technical problems, hand, agriculture is highly fragmented with but the biggest problem will be enormous amounts of players in different sectors at the level of legislation and financing. (e.g., machinery, insurance, fertiliser producers)."
15,it will require a reform of the cap and also access to knowledge is limited and the current build effective strategies.
15,this cannot be investments are not efficiently utilised.
15,"there is done only on a political level, but it will an urgent need to verify the investments for all public require communication of politicians and private partners and get a deep understanding with technical experts and researchers of the return of investment for all participants to define a successful strategy."
15,"for this as well as verification of climate change and/or purpose, it is necessary to establish a forum, environmental positive or negative effects."
15,a new where all these players will meet.
15,"a new understanding of precision farming services can strategy has to be prepared based on expert not only increase production but produce products opinions and scientific results. of higher quality, have fewer negative influences on the environment, and also reduce different conclusion environmental risks."
15,satellite data is an important source of information acknowledgements for future agriculture.
15,"the aim of the research, which is emphasized in the article, was to find out the real the paper was prepared on the base state of use of eo data for all players who enter of materials collected by all members the food production process from manufacturers of the eo4agri consortium."
