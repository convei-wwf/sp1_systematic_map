1,they are highly productive ecosystems and provide numerous ecological and economic goods and services for humans.
1,"in order to develop programs for applying guided conservation and enhancing ecosystem management, accurate and regularly updated maps on their distribution, extent, and species composition are needed."
1,recent advances in remote sensing techniques have made it possible to gather the required information about mangrove ecosystems.
1,"since costs are a limiting factor in generating land cover maps, the latest remote sensing techniques are advantageous."
1,"in this study, we investigated the potential of combining sentinel-2 and worldview-2 data to classify eight land cover classes in a mangrove ecosystem in iran with an area of 768 km2 ."
1,"the upscaling approach comprises (i) extraction of reflectance values from worldview-2 images, (ii) segmentation based on spectral and spatial features, and (iii) wall-to-wall prediction of the land cover based on sentinel-2 images."
1,we used an upscaling approach to minimize the costs of commercial satellite images for collecting reference data and to focus on freely available satellite data for mapping land cover classes of mangrove ecosystems.
1,"the approach resulted in a 65.5% overall accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 0.63, and it produced the highest accuracies for deep water and closed mangrove canopy cover."
1,"mapping accuracies improved with this approach, resulting in medium overall accuracy even though the user’s accuracy of some classes, such as tidal zone and shallow water, was low."
1,conservation and sustainable management in these ecosystems can be improved in the future.

1,introduction mangrove forests are considered one of the most important ecosystems on the earth.
1,"they occur in the inter-tidal zones along coasts in most tropical and semi-tropical areas [1,2]."
1,"despite the large ecological benefits of mangrove forests, such as carbon sequestration, protection of land from erosion, purification of coastal water quality, and maintenance of ecological balance and biodiversity, mangroves have been destroyed worldwide as a result of climate change and human activities [3–6]."
1,"qeshm island, located off the southern coast of iran in the persian gulf, is dominated by the cosmopolitan mangrove species avicennia marina."
1,"many studies have focused on the ecological and physiological characteristics of a. marina [7,8]."
1,avicennia species grow in oxygen-poor sediments that cannot supply the underground roots with sufficient oxygen.
1,"consequently, their root system also includes vertically growing aerial roots (pneumatophores)."
1,"these aerial roots also anchor the plants remote sens. 2020, 12, 2684; doi:10.3390/rs12172684 www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing"
2,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 2684 2 of 17 during the frequent inundation with seawater in the soft substrate of tidal systems, and they play a significant role in sustaining mangroves [9]."
2,"sea-level rise, a main consequence of climate change, will have a significant influence on future growing conditions [10]."
2,"recent estimates of the extent of mangrove forests indicate that their total area has already decreased substantially, by 50% during the last half-century [11–13]."
2,"identification of the aerial root system at a high spatial resolution would enable efficient planning of reforestation in mangrove ecosystems, but this detailed information is currently missing."
2,image resolution is directly correlated with the ability to identify objects of the same type [14].
2,"despite the great value of landsat images for numerous applications, the specifications are inappropriate for distinguishing mudflats with aerial roots from mudflats without aerial roots."
2,this is also due to the spectral similarities of these classes and the influence of the soil in the tidal zone (dry and wet conditions).
2,"a more detailed mapping of the mangrove ecosystem, e.g., trees and aerial root systems, is required to improve assessments of their status and recommend appropriate protection measures."
2,"in the last years, a range of low- to high-resolution aerial images [15–17], hyperspectral images [18], synthetic aperture radar (sar) data [19], and light detection and ranging (lidar) data [20] has been used to map the extent and distribution of mangrove cover classes."
2,"in the past decade, data have become available from very high-resolution (vhr) satellites, such as worldview-2 and pléiades-1, leading to improved mapping of mangrove cover classes [21,22]."
2,"however, the main limiting factor is the high cost of data acquisition."
2,"consequently, alternatives have been investigated, in particular combining satellite data of different spatial resolutions [23]."
2,"only recently, studies focusing on the use of freely available vhr data have been completed [24–28]."
2,"for example, in the forestry sector, a combination of commercially available worldview-2 (wv-2) images and landsat time-series data has been used to map tree species [29]."
2,"different classification techniques, such as traditional statistical regression [30], machine learning [31], artificial neural networks [32], and tree-based methods [33,34], have successfully been used with a large geographic extent and high level of detail."
2,"machine learning techniques such as random forest (rf), artificial neural networks (ann) and support vector machine (svm) have gained exceptional attention to classify land cover/land use and identify mangrove forests because they perform better than traditional techniques [33,34]."
2,"these techniques use algorithms to learn the relationship between a response and its predictors and have been categorized into two sub-types: supervised and unsupervised techniques, respectively [35]."
2,a main advantage is that they are all nonparametric classification techniques that require no assumptions about the distribution of the data and thus no prior knowledge about the characteristics of feature data is needed either [31].
2,many studies in the field of land cover/land use classification have been carried out using different machine learning algorithms as well as comparing them among each other [35].
2,"in the last decade, rf has recently become preferred for mapping land cover classes in several realms [36,37]."
2,rf is a nonparametric technique based on a set of decision trees.
2,"unlike parametric techniques, rf can be used to predict land cover classes even based on a small sample size and therefore reduces both cost and time [38]."
2,"moreover, embedded feature selection in the model generation process makes it possible to obtain high mapping accuracy."
2,"several studies have demonstrated that rf, in combination with satellite data (landsat) [37] and a high spatial resolution [16], can be used to successfully map mangrove cover classes."
2,"moreover, the latest advances in remote sensing data and techniques, i.e., increasing availability of datasets in combination with higher temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions (e.g., esa copernicus program sentinel-1/-2), enable improved characterization of mangrove ecosystems."
2,"they make it possible to derive leaf area index, height and biomass, map the mangrove forest extent, and monitor mangrove status over time [39]."
2,"several studies have been carried out to explore satellite data of different spatial resolutions for improving land cover maps, i.e., in forestry that have combined data sets from landsat and avhrr [40] or landsat and modis [41]."
2,"however, to the best of our knowledge, no study exist that combine worldview-2 and sentinel-2 images to classify mangrove ecosystems in greater detail which is a prerequisite for managing this ecosystem."
2,"therefore, freely available sentinel-2 data, in combination with commercially available"

12,discussion 4.1.
12,general comments mangrove forests typically grow in zones that are marshy and inaccessible [11].
12,"therefore, collecting gps points as training data through field surveys is difficult [14]."
12,"nowadays, new developments in remote sensing techniques have great potential to overcome the problem of acquiring field data in inaccessible areas of mangrove ecosystems [58]."
12,"between 1970 and 2018, approximately 435 studies mapping the area of mangroves were conducted, and after the year 2000 the majority used landsat images [14]."
12,"while landsat imagery has the advantages of free availability, a large archive and extensive coverage, its relatively coarse spatial resolution of 30 m can be a major limitation."
12,"the potential of different datasets from landsat, alos avnir-2, worldview-2 and lidar to map a detailed land cover of mangrove ecosystems was recently evaluated [59]."
12,"the results clearly demonstrated the importance of a higher spatial resolution for mapping specific mangrove features, such as individual tree crowns and species communities."
12,"with the present study, we contribute to this research with an efficient mapping of mangrove features using multi-resolution datasets."
12,"we add to existing knowledge gained in a previous study [37], which focused on comparing four classification algorithms based on landsat images for predicting six land cover classes in the mangrove ecosystem: mangrove forest, mud flat, other land cover, tidal zone, water and settlement."
12,the results of this earlier research demonstrated that using landsat data enables to potentially distinguish between different mangrove forest stands and can be useful for detecting their changes over time.
12,"however, since mangrove forests usually consist of small patches, landsat images are not suitable for extracting more details and are mainly only appropriate for detecting changes in mangrove forest canopies."
12,"this is in accordance with [14,59], in that only high-resolution images can be used to map more detailed land cover classes."
12,"by increasing the number of spectral bands and the spatial resolution, it is possible to discriminate between small objects and to detect small objects, such as individual trees and mudflats with aerial roots."
12,"several studies have shown the potential of worldview-2 data for detailed land cover mapping, including mangrove forest ecosystems [16,39,59–61]."
12,"however, the main reason for the limited use of such imagery is its high"
13,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 2684 13 of 17 cost–in particular, for developing countries."
13,"thus, in our study, an upscaling approach was applied that reduces costs while still enabling the generation of a more detailed map of land cover classes."
13,"modelling approach in the last decade, several studies have been carried out combining satellite data of different spatial resolutions to improve land cover maps in the forestry sector."
13,"some investigations have considered the combination of landsat data with datasets of higher spatial resolutions such as ikonos [62], geoeye-1 data [63] or worldview-2 [29]."
13,comparison of the two confusion matrices clearly demonstrated that the accuracy and kappa of the upscale approach were lower than the accuracy and kappa of the map that had the same extent as the one based on the worldview-2 imagery.
13,the use of a large amount of reference data to predict the subset of sentinel-2 data helped to reduce misclassification.
13,"the confusion matrix of the upscaling approach (table 4, figure 8) indicates that the overall accuracy and kappa decreased with increasing map scale."
13,there was a high incidence of misclassification of individual trees and tidal zone when sentinel-2 data were used.
13,several possible reasons for this error exist.
13,"first, it might be due to the amount of reference data because the worldview-2 data only cover about 27% of the sentinel-2 image."
13,"on the other hand, in the worldview-2 image, the area of these two classes is less than that of the other classes."
13,it is well known that the number of reference samples from the worldview-2 image affects classification accuracy.
13,"in a recent study, it was demonstrated that the large amount of reference data obtained from the worldview-2 image was the main driving factor for the accuracy of the classification of two pine tree species by landsat data [29]."
13,future work could include the collection of more training samples in order to further improve the distinction of these land cover classes.
13,"second, the error could be a result of the similarity of the spectral profile of individual trees and open canopy mangrove forest."
13,the use of fewer reference samples decreases the spectral separability of classes and potentially decreases the accuracy.
13,"third, the decrease in accuracy could be related to the level pre-processing and viewing geometry of sentinel-2 imagery."
13,"nevertheless, the present study demonstrates that areas with different canopy densities and mudflat areas (occurrence of aerial root systems) can be accurately classified using the upscaling approach with sentinel-2 images."
13,"overall, high accuracies were obtained for mapping closed canopy mangrove (75% user’s accuracy, 94% producer’s accuracy) and aerial roots (72%, 66%)."
13,"moreover, the combined use of worldview-2 and sentinel-2 images further increases map accuracies–in particular when the overall accuracy is not very high, and the user’s accuracy is low in problematic classes."
13,importantance of mapping of detailed information on mangrove forests detailed maps of mangrove ecosystems are a prerequisite for successful protection and management.
13,"since mangroves occur in areas with a high salt concentration in the soil, they have developed aerial roots for physiological functions and cover a large area within the hara protected area [64]."
13,"this specialized root system reduces the power of sea waves and guarantees sustainable establishment of mangrove communities, as well as providing a protected place for aquatic animals [42]."
13,"in order to plan the development of mangrove forests, both naturally or artificially, the selection of potential suitable land is relevant."
13,the land areas on the map that show the mangrove forests and mudflat with aerial roots are preferred to other areas that are not covered by vegetation.
13,"moreover, the occurrence of mangrove is an indication that the land provides optimal conditions for the development of mangrove forests in terms of soil parameters such as salinity and ph."
13,"mapping the details of mangrove ecosystems is an effective way to visualize, evaluate and better understand mangrove ecosystem development."
13,"changes over a long period, as well as the recognition of unexpected changes due to natural or dramatic anthropogenic impacts, can be assessed at an early stage [65,66]."
13,"moreover, assessing changes in the aerial root area can indicate the status of these forests because these roots are destroyed by an increase in water level or sediments."
14,"remote sens. 2020, 12, 2684 14 of 17 5."
14,"conclusions in the present study, we demonstrate that field surveys in mangrove ecosystems are not always feasible, due to the high costs and inaccessibility of the area."
14,mangrove distribution mapping is a hot topic in the field of mangrove remote sensing [14].
14,"based on field observations, the mangrove forests in the present study have a uniform composition of the species avicenna marina and the detectable differences are limited to canopy density, which consists of mangrove zonation patterns including forests of immature trees and of mature trees, and isolated trees."
14,the use of vhr satellite imagery for sampling reference data in combination with freely available satellite data and machine learning is an effective and straightforward approach to further improve the details of land cover maps and to assess relevant forest parameters.
14,upscaling is a cost-efficient tool for producing accurate large-scale land cover maps in inaccessible ecosystems.
14,the findings of the present study support the sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems and can be used to assess the efficiency of ecosystem services.
14,"although the upscaling approach produced low user accuracies for the shallow water and tidal zone classes, overall accuracies were generally high."
14,"with the proposed method, it is possible to distinguish between the two most relevant classes for management, i.e., canopy mangrove canopy and mudflat."
14,our findings confirm that advances in remote sensing data and techniques are favorable for developing novel methods to map mangrove ecosystems in greater detail.
14,"we conclude that the selection of appropriate images remains an important factor and that sentinel-2 images have great potential for identifying different land cover types, thanks to their high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution."
14,continuity of the presented approach is guaranteed since sentinel-2 data will be continuously acquired.
