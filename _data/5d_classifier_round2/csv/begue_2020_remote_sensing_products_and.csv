1,"however, the path from satellite *correspondence: images to public policy decisions is not straightforward, and today, only few operational agnès bégué information services are available in ssa countries (e.g., early warning systems for food agnes.begue@cirad.fr security and desert locust plagues prevention, rangeland production forecasting)."
1,"this specialty section: paper aims to analyze the gap between the technical aspects of the remote sensing this article was submitted to sciences and the pragmatic need for relevant data to address agricultural policies in land, livelihoods and food security, africa and produce operational recommendations."
1,"to achieve this goal, the authors a section of the journal frontiers in sustainable food systems (1) determine the information, and in particular the geoinformation, needed to develop, received: 15 october 2019 implement and evaluate agricultural public policies (2) illustrate the role of remote sensing accepted: 09 april 2020 as a public policy tool in ssa through an overview of the current off-the-shelf products published: 14 may 2020 and services derived from earth observation systems, and (3) propose an analysis citation: bégué a, leroux l, soumaré m, of the existing gap between the remote sensing research community and the policy faure j-f, diouf aa, augusseau x, makers."
1,"based on this review, the authors conclude that to benefit from this technological touré l and tonneau j-p (2020) advancement and bridge the gap between technical analysts and policy makers, some remote sensing products and services in support of agricultural key points are fundamental: capacity building, political will and institutional commitment, public policies in africa: overview and public-private partnership, and proofs of concept."

3,"in is neither a simple solution to africa’s underproduction of addition, the african agricultural system will have to increase foodstuffs, nor a single answer, that will bring food security to the competitiveness of its agricultural exports to contribute more everyone."
3,"agricultural policies must be adapted to diversity, and efficiently to the global trade system and thus to the continental information is needed to enable this adaptation. economic growth."
3,"the final challenges that african agriculture according to knowledge-based decision-making (hale will have to face are to retain the economically active population et al., 2002), accurate, timely, and comprehensive information in rural areas (losch and freguin-gresh, 2011; conceição et al., is required for guiding the conception, implementation, 2016), particularly by creating employment for young people and monitoring, and evaluation of these agricultural policies containing regional and international migration and by reducing (wilson and gapsiso, 2018)."

4,the reasons agricultural monitoring for the discrepancies between products are mainly related to the baseline maps specificities of smallholder agriculture in the african context (see metric and sub-metric resolution images are used to produce section the african agriculture challenges for remote sensing). baseline maps that provide geographically localized information waldner et al.

7,"geospatial products and services in africa diversified and much less documented than agricultural systems images, data and tools; (2) training and capacity building; (3) in industrialized countries."
7,"the environmental conditions, the national/regional strategies. diversity of agricultural systems, the scarcity of free images at all satellite images (recent and historical), adapted processing very high spatial resolutions, the paucity of ground databases, and procedures and computing capacities required must be easily the challenges of partnerships are just some of the transfer and accessible."
7,"the satellite images and derived products, which are adaptation constraints. often financed by public funds, need to be pooled in order to there are also other reasons that compromise the quality capitalize on existing resources and to foster innovation."
7,another of the services available.
7,"many of these challenges have been need is to update and make available “basic” geographic data such reported during the un information for meeting africa’s as topographic maps, land use maps and cadastral maps."
7,"some agricultural transformation and food security goals conference work is often necessary to improve these maps, which are “often (imaafs, 2014)."
7,remote sensing projects for national and out of date and in analog form.
7,"cadastral maps or databases are regional public institutions have been supported by international mostly unavailable; coherent and standardized geographic names donors, in only a few countries."
7,"these projects have equipped are not available yet; and in most cases geodetic controls are centers, trained managers and technicians and have launched not yet unified and adjusted and are not in sufficient density applications for agricultural development, but their limited for information management in africa” (uneca, 2017)."
7,"this duration has not always ensured the maintenance of the raises the question of whether or not these services should equipment, the preservation of human resources and the incur a fee: do they constitute a public service or should users upgrading or transfer of skills."
7,"in some extreme cases, the work participate financially?"
7,"in any case, the pooling of resources is carried out by experts from the north with no interaction with helps to reduce costs."
7,pooling of resources is also recommended and thus no transfer to the local partners.
7,"these projects are more for georeferenced updated field data, that are indispensable driven by technological aspects than by developmental needs. for developing sustainable services based on remote sensing."
7,"furthermore, geospatial information in africa is hampered by simple and free mobile phone data collection systems (e.g., the dispersal of activities, mainly in the form of one-off projects, the sms system developed by act against hunger for pastoral which are often in competition for funding uncoordinated monitoring15 , or crowd sourcing (e.g., geowiki16 , have enabled planning, design, and implementation of development projects rapid progress in field data collection, but an open data due to donor preferences."
7,"closed focus areas or sectors, and policy should facilitate the cross-sector sharing of the publicly coordination gaps between the national and regional levels, often funded data. result in duplication of efforts and resources and avoidable cost building a critical mass of technicians, professionals, and increases (uneca, 2017). researchers will enable african countries to control and adapt finally, local capacity is insufficient."
7,"the geospatial domain is technologies, and to propose services in line with their very dynamic, and the data offer and technologies change very socioeconomic and geographical environments."
7,this implies quickly.
7,"organizations and people are not always able to keep up first investing in initial and vocational training and, second, with them, because of cost constraints in purchasing or updating increasing the number and quality of courses."
7,"this capacity equipment, or because of insufficient networking and training. building will also benefit consultancies and non-governmental technicians and scientists who were trained abroad on novel organizations, as well as national public institutes. methods and high-tech equipment are sometimes assigned to coordination by public institutions or regulatory bodies unrelated tasks and cannot use or transfer the knowledge gained imparts coherence to this ecosystem."
7,"the public authorities (uneca, 2017). need to ensure upfront investment to this end."
7,"national and/or saah et al. (2019) summarize these observations: however, regional geospatial strategies are required to encourage the technical, capacity, and institutional challenges inhibit the creation pooling of data and of human and material investments, of consistent and relevant land cover maps for use in developing and to thereby avoid redundant investments."
7,as in the case regions.
7,"many developing regions lack coordinated capacity, of senegal with its plan national géomatique (png), these infrastructure, and technologies to produce a robust land cover strategies can coordinate action, define a regulatory framework monitoring system that meets land management needs."
7,"local for the production and use of geographical data and information capacity may be replaced by external consultants or methods which and, finally, ensure the technical and economic sustainability lack long-term sustainability. of services."
7,"interaction with the end-users establishing an environment favorable to without denying the importance of a favorable environment operational sustainability for the development of operational and sustainable services, the challenge here is to develop user services that meet the lack of interaction with the end-users is the main the priority needs of stakeholders of the agricultural sector. difficulty."
7,the co-development of information services within most authors insist on the minimum conditions necessary the framework of community of practices is required.

9,"the sustainability and success of geospatial information the arrival of very promising tools and approaches, such as management in africa requires effective funding."
9,"it is necessary machine learning or deep learning algorithms applied to satellite to ensure the effective participation of the private sector imagery, in conjunction with relatively high frequency and in the production and management of spatial data through resolution data, should boost the earth observation market in the task outsourcing and public-private partnerships."
9,"in addition, upcoming decade, provided that massive training databases are private structures are probably better able to hire new available, which is not yet the case for many countries in africa geomatics graduates. and in other regions of the world."
9,"for all this to succeed, the link between the decision-making to benefit from this technological advancement and bridge level and geomatics expertise must be strengthened."
9,"this includes the gap between technical analysts and policy makers, some raising awareness about the benefits of space information key points are fundamental: capacity building, political, will and technology applications and proofs of concept associated with institutional commitment, public-private partnership, and proofs the economic evaluations."
9,these proofs of concept must emerge of concept. from participatory approaches to better define and prioritize the capacity building should move away from traditional models actionable information needed and identify the most relevant focused exclusively on training technical specialists and focus information dissemination channels according to the different on building institutional capacity and creating an enabling issues.
9,"from the authors’ experience, one priority could be to environment (uneca, 2017)."
9,"it is necessary to train computer produce an annual agricultural land use map for each african scientists with a specialization in geomatics not only because country at a scale between 1:50 000 and 1:100 000 based the mastery of computer languages and systems communication on remote sensing data, local knowledge and expertise, and takes an increasing amount of expertise but also to reinforce ground data. the geomatics skills of specialists (agronomists, hydrologists, geographers, etc.)."
9,this capacity building cannot be a singular event because it will always be necessary to train and educate author contributions people to be able to replace staff who leave.
9,"capacities do ab, ll, and j-pt conceived the paper, conducted the literature not develop in a vacuum."
