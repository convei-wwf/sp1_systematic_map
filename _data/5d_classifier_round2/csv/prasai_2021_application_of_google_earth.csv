2,"ecological informatics 66 (2021) 101474 the history of lulc analysis extends back to the 1930s, when in­ vestigators began looking at lulc change as a result of human activities (araya and hergarten, 2008)."
2,"however, land cover can also be caused by factors other than anthropogenic, such as flooding, fire, ecosystem changes, weather, climate fluctuations."
2,"land use affects land cover and land cover affects land use, however land use is not a sole cause for land cover change and vice versa (kitalika et al., 2018)."
2,"in mid-1970s, re­ searchers found that the land cover change modifies the earth's surface, affecting atmosphere energy exchanges and, in turn impacting regional climate (araya and hergarten, 2008)."
2,"this period coincided with the introduction of markov stochastic process analysis to study land change and trend (araya and hergarten, 2008), mainly emphasizing planning and management of land use (koldunov and cristini, 2018)."
2,"prior to the early-1980s, lulc analysis utilized traditional surveying methods (araya and hergarten, 2008), but after that analysis of remotely sensed data (e.g., aerial photography) became more common (inman and lyons, 2020)."
2,"researchers also started building databases using data of various resolutions and scales to meet the needs of envi­ ronmental change research (john et al., 2019)."
2,"after 1990, interdisciplinary research flourished and two aspects of lulc grew rapidly: study of lulc mechanisms, and regional and global change model research (medjahed et al., 2016)."
2,"united nations envi­ ronment program launched the land cover assessment and planning project in 1996 (araya and hergarten, 2008)."
2,"the united states global change research council linked lulc research with climate change and ozone layer depletion (araya and hergarten, 2008), and it remains a priority in the area of global change research (medjahed et al., 2016)."
2,"some hurdles to lulc change research remain however (koldunov and cristini, 2018), including how land use is influenced by weather, pre­ cision, drawing, technician's skill, and a perceived neglect of non- remotely sensed data (araya and hergarten, 2008)."
2,"quality land cover classification is essential for land planning and management (kitalika et al., 2018)."
2,"land cover provides information on how people are using/utilizing the land (chang et al., 2018)."
2,"current, accurate, and detailed land cover information is vital for land managers and policy makers responsible for developing and implementing con­ servation strategies and policies (kitalika et al., 2018)."
2,"despite the need for quality land cover information, mapping of large-area, especially high spatial-resolution land cover mapping, is a difficult task for a va­ riety of reasons including large data volumes (köhl et al., 2006), complexity of developing training and validation datasets (köhl et al., 2006), data availability (koldunov and cristini, 2018), heterogeneity in data (leroux et al., 2018) and landscape conditions (medjahed et al., 2016)."
2,"the challenges of analytical workflow of large data for land- cover mapping are arguably addressed by few dedicated software pro­ grams that intend to develop precision lulc while incorporating expert knowledge into the process (bartłomiej et al., 2017; köhl et al., 2006)."
2,"of those that are available, even fewer are open-source (medjahed et al., 2016; midekisa et al., 2017)."
2,"a software is regarded as an open-source software (oss) if its source code is made available and its license grants the “rights to use and modify the software to anyone and for any purpose, including non-exclusive commercial exploitation and redistri­ bution of derivate works of the software itself” (mutanga and kumar, 2019)."
2,"this lack of oss for lulc development may present obstacles to users, especially those lacking extensive financial resources."
2,"however, recent years have seen the proliferation of a variety of oss with lulc potential such as google earth engine (gee) and python."
2,researchers can access gee and its datasets on either an application programming interface for javascript and python or via an online web-hosted code editor with an integrated development environment that uses the fig.

3,"in addition, the creators of gee also made significant making."
3,"following the free availability of the naip imagery in 2003 efforts to ease the burden of image pre-processing, i.e., the tedious and the landsat series in 2008, google archived both datasets and linked procedures such as mosaicking and image averaging that are necessary them to its cloud computing engine for open-source use (bartłomiej prior to analysis (inman and lyons, 2020). et al., 2017)."
3,"today, gee's public data archive contributed by 50 gee can be useful for a variety of applications, including vegetation different data providers comprises of multi-petabyte catalogue of im­ mapping and monitoring (inman and lyons, 2020), land-cover mapping agery and scientific datasets covering more than forty years of climate (hanberry, 2020), crops mapping (medjahed et al., 2016), disaster and weather, satellite imagery, and geophysical characteristics, many of management (bartłomiej et al., 2017; chang et al., 2018), earth which updated and expanded daily (wesson, 2021)."
3,"the launch of this sciences-related studies (owen et al., 2015), and many others (inman high-performance cloud computing platform has provided accessibility and lyons, 2020)."
3,"the easily accessible and user-friendly front-end to global-scale, high efficiency geospatial data storage (bartłomiej et al., provides a convenient environment for interactive data and algorithm 2017), processing, and analysis for free or at low cost (gorelick et al., development (bartłomiej et al., 2017; chang et al., 2018; hanberry, 2017; inman and lyons, 2020)."

4,"nlcd classes (2016) description merged classes python is one of the most popular open-source object-oriented pro­ gramming languages (sidhu et al., 2018; stephen, 2018)."

5,training data we assumed that most researchers using the described workflow may not have prior knowledge of the study area or are unable to complete the fieldwork necessary to create supervised training sites.
5,"therefore, we used predefined national land-cover database (nlcd) 2016 data, available in gee database, to train the naip imagery."
5,"national land- cover database provides lulc data for the usa at a 30-m resolution (tiwari et al., 2017)."
5,we addressed the difference in resolution by specifying the ‘scale value’ of naip imagery to 30 in training function to match the resolution of nlcd data while training the dataset.
5,this resampled the original naip imagery matching the spatial resolution of nlcd landcover product.
5,the model training was achieved with 10 iterations of the model.
5,"for the model training, we randomly sampled the data from 147,467 loca­ tions distributed across the study area."
5,"this dataset was randomly split into a training dataset (70% of the total, 103,226 points) and validation dataset (30%, 44,240 points) to ensure an independent validation of the model trained with training data (fig."
5,image classification we predicted the lulc classes with the predictor variables of naip imageries; this required extracting the values of 2017 naip bands and associated landcover for each of the locations in training data (the same was done for validation data for model evaluation).
5,"once the training data was prepared, we predicted all the 19 lulc classes of nlcd product."
5,the resulting prediction of 19 classes were merged into 8 broad classes to produce the final map of prediction (table 1).
5,"landcover prediction was performed with a random forest (rf) classifier (vali et al., 2020) (fig."
5,"random forest is one of the most common classifiers used for the land-cover classification based on the remote sensing data, owing to its simplicity and power in yielding robust models (vali et al., 2020; venkatappa et al., 2019)."
5,"like other non- parametric supervised classifiers, rf does not make any assumptions about the distribution of data (28) and has shown promising results in classifying remote sensing data, overtaking the field's earlier classifiers such as linear regression, maximum likelihood, k-nearest neighbor and classification and regression tree (cart) (vollrath et al., 2020; wang et al., 2015)."
5,"random forest is an ensemble classifier made of a set of tree-structured predictors (carts) such that each tree depends on a random subset of training observations that are sampled independently with replacement (vali et al., 2020; venkatappa et al., 2019)."

5,"we changed labels of analysis is needed and it produces satisfactory accuracy (phan et al., nlcd classes to 1–19 such as nlcd ‘11’ to ‘1’ prior to running validation 2020)."
