1,"however, to what extent prediction these satellite-based sif products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking forecasting against other existing satellite data remains unclear."
1,here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based machine learning sif products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the u.s.
1,"midwest: gap-filled sif from orbiting carbon observatory 2 (oco-2), new sif retrievals from the tropospheric monitoring instrument (tropomi), and the coarse-resolution sif retrievals from the global ozone monitoring experiment-2 (gome-2)."
1,"the yield prediction performances of using sif data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (vis), including normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), enhanced vegetation index (evi), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (nirv), and land surface temperature (lst)."
1,five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables.
1,we found that high-resolution sif products from oco-2 and tropomi outperformed coarse-resolu- tion gome-2 sif product in crop yield prediction.
1,"using high-resolution sif products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution sif products for crop yield prediction."
1,"however, using currently available high-resolution sif products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases."
1,"the relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (five- fold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data."
1,"we also found that using nirv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using ndvi, evi, or lst, and using nirv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using oco-2 or tropomi sif products."
1,we concluded that satellite-based sif products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolu- tion and good-quality sif products accumulated in the future.
