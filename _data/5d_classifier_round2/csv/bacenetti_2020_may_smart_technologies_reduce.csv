1,"e-mail: livia.paleari@unimi.it, jacopo.bacenetti@unimi.it 14 15 abstract 16 precision agriculture is increasingly considered as a powerful solution to mitigate the 17 environmental impact of farming systems."
1,this because of its ability to use multi-source 18 information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management.
1,"19 among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in 20 research and operational contexts, variable rate (vr) nitrogen fertilization plays a key role."
1,"21 a promising approach to make quantitative, spatially distributed diagnoses to support vr n 22 fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart 23 scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (nni)."
1,"in this study, 24 a new smart app for field nni estimates (pocketnni) was developed, which can be 25 integrated with remote sensing data."
1,the environmental impact of using pocketnni and 26 sentinel 2 products to drive fertilization was evaluated using the life cycle assessment 27 approach and a case study on rice in northern italy.
1,"in particular, the environmental 28 performances of rice fertilized according to vr information derived from the integration of 1"
2,29 pocketnni and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform n 30 application.
2,primary data regarding the cultivation practices and the achieved yields were 31 collected during field tests.
2,32 results showed that vr fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0% to 33 13.6% as compared to uniform n application.
2,"for climate change, the impact is reduced 34 from 937.3 to 832.7 kg co2 eq/t of paddy rice."
2,the highest environmental benefits – mainly 35 due to an improved ratio between grain yield and n fertilizers – were achieved in terms of 36 energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of n compounds.
2,"although 37 further validation is needed, these preliminary results are promising and provide a first 38 quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital 39 technologies are used to support n fertilization."

3,"introduction 45 precision agriculture (pa) – i.e., the use of multi-source information in decision support systems 46 to increase the efficiency of farm management (blackmore, 1994; bouma et al., 1999) – is 47 increasingly catalysing the attention of scientists and farmers because of its potential to 48 reduce environmental pollution while increasing farm profits and product quality (srinivasan, 49 2006)."
3,"the adoption of pa techniques proved to enhance the economic return of farming 50 activities by improving the efficiency in the use of technical inputs (balafoutis et al., 2017a; 51 van evert et al., 2017), although to a different extent according to the crop, the technical 52 input considered, and the cost of the technology used to implement pa principles 53 (lowenberg-deboer and erickson, 2019, griffin and lowenberg-deboer, 2005)."
3,"in practical 54 terms, pa aims at managing variability in space and time (mcbratney et al., 2005), that is, 55 doing the right thing in the right place at the right time, and in the right way (pierce et al., 56 1994)."
3,"a variety of studies confirmed the positive expectations behind the application of pa 57 techniques, for both herbaceous (e.g., basso et al., 2016) and tree species (e.g., balafoutis et 58 al., 2017b; van evert et al., 2017)."
3,"however, pa often requires the adoption of advanced 59 machineries and technological systems, whose construction, maintenance and use could, to 60 a certain extent, reduce the potential environmental and economic benefits deriving from its 61 implementation (sadler et al., 2005)."
3,"as an example, the application of pa principles to water 62 management normally requires the use of drip irrigation (e.g., smith and baillie, 2009; mafuta 63 et al., 2013; prathyusha et al., 2013; kisekka et al., 2017), which may have a higher 64 environmental impact (evaluated through lca) compared to less sophisticated irrigation 65 systems characterized by lower water use efficiencies (guiso et al., 2015) because of the 66 production, laying and disposal of part of the plastic pipes."
3,"67 these considerations are far from being aimed at casting a shadow over pa and, in general, 68 over technology."
3,they rather underline the need of evaluating in a quantitative way the 69 actual economic and environmental impacts of technologies in specific production contexts.
3,"70 among agricultural practices, variable rate (vr) nitrogen (n) fertilization is likely one of those 71 for which the largest number of studies was performed (e.g., basso et al., 2016)."
3,"vr fertilization 72 can be based (i) on static information derived from soil data (e.g., grisso et al., 2009), remote 3"
4,"73 sensing (casa et al., 2017) or yield maps from previous years (e.g., stafford et al., 1999), or (ii) 74 on dynamic crop monitoring using real-time or near-real-time information (nutini et al., 2018)."
4,"75 the latter refers to topdressing n fertilization and can be based on sensors mounted on the 76 operating tractor (e.g., greenseeker, trimble, ca, usa; raun et al., 2005), on remote sensing 77 information (schwalbert et al., 2019), or on diagnostic portable instruments (rogovska et al., 78 2019)."
4,"79 the most quantitative approaches for dynamic vr fertilization are based on the combined 80 use of remote sensing information and smart scouting-based ground data collection for 81 estimating n nutrition index (nni) (e.g., chen, 2015; huang et al., 2015; ata-ul-karim et al., 82 2014; nutini et al., 2018), the latter being defined as actual (pnc) to critical (ncrit) plant n 83 concentration ratio (lemaire et al., 2008)."
4,"the integration of few ground measurements and 84 remote sensing information allows obtaining spatially distributed maps of nni (i) with a limited 85 effort compared to using only ground data and (ii) with a quantification of crop needs more 86 reliable compared to the sole use of remote sensing data (nutini et al., 2018)."
4,"87 besides the need of species- or cultivar-specific calibration curves to derive pnc values from 88 indirect proximal or remote estimates (varinderpal et al., 2011), obstacles to the adoption of 89 systems to support vr fertilization deal – like for many decision support systems (rose et al., 90 2016) – with their time- and cost-effectiveness and usability (korsaeth and riley, 2006)."
4,"a 91 system to support vr topdressing fertilization based on smart apps – pocketn (confalonieri et 92 al., 2015) for pnc estimates and pocketlai (confalonieri et al., 2013) to derive ncrit according 93 to confalonieri et al. (2011) – and satellite data was recently proposed and evaluated for rice 94 (nutini et al., 2018)."
4,"the system is scientifically sound (based on the nni concept) and 95 inexpensive, being based on free-of-charge sentinel 2 products and smartphones for ground 96 data collection."
4,"97 this study aimed at (i) evaluating a new smart app for determining nni (pocketnni) under 98 operational farming conditions, and (ii) evaluating with a dedicated case study the 99 environmental performances of fertilization strategies based on the integration of pocketnni 100 and satellite data for vr fertilization in rice as compared to adopting standard n 101 management."
4,given pocketnni allows to explicitly account for crop n nutritional status while 4
5,"102 applying vr top-dressing fertilizations, it has the potential to increase n use efficiency and, in 103 turn, the environmental sustainability of rice-based cropping systems."
5,"pocketnni (figure 1) 104 integrates pocketlai, pocketn and the calibration curves to derive pnc from pocketn 105 readings developed for european rice cultivars by paleari et al."
5,(2019).
5,"being estimates geo- 106 referenced, pocketnni can be easily coupled to satellite data or used as a standalone tool in 107 case of production contexts characterized by small fields."
5,pocketnni is the first standalone 108 tool able to directly estimate nni without the need of integrating readings from different 109 instruments and without the need of transforming variables in external environments.
5,"110 moreover, this is the first time lca was performed to evaluate vr fertilization in rice, the only 111 two studies available – to our knowledge – being for pear orchards (vatsanidou et al., 2017) 112 and maize (li et al., 2016)."
5,113 114 2.
5,"material and methods 115 2.1 the smart app pocketnni 116 pocketnni (figure 1) estimates the actual (pnc) to critical (ncrit) plant n concentration ratio 117 (nni) by integrating the algorithms of the smart apps pocketlai (confalonieri et al., 2013) and 118 pocketn (confalonieri et al., 2015), the calibration curves needed to estimate pnc values 119 from pocketn readings (paleari et al., 2019), and the model to derive ncrit as a function of 120 leaf area index (lai) (confalonieri et al., 2011)."
5,"121 122 figure 1 – around here 123 124 pocketn derives an index that quantifies leaf greenness (dark green colour index, dgci, 125 unitless; karcher and richardson, 2003) by using the hue (h), saturation (s) and brightness (b) 126 values (hsb colour space) of a 25-pixel portion of leaf images acquired on a dedicated 127 expanded polyvinyl chloride background panel that flats reflectance across the visible 128 spectrum."
5,this allows characterizing leaf greenness on images acquired under consistent 129 exposure regardless of the illumination conditions.

6,"1) 3 132 133 in pocketnni, dgci is automatically converted into pnc values by using the calibration 134 curves developed for european rice varieties by paleari et al."
6,(2019).
6,"135 ncrit is estimated according to the model proposed by confalonieri et al. (2011), which uses 136 the inverse of the fraction of radiation intercepted by the canopy to reproduce the dilution 137 of n in plant tissues due to the remobilization of n from senescent leaves (eq."
6,"2): 138 𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑡 139 𝑁𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 = (2) 1−𝑒 −𝑘∙𝐿𝐴𝐼 140 141 the parameter nmat (%) represents the value of ncrit at maturity, and k (-) is the extinction 142 coefficient for solar radiation."
6,as in confalonieri et al.
6,"(2011), nmat and k were set to 1% and 143 0.5, respectively."
6,"within pocketnni, lai is derived by implementing the algorithms of 144 pocketlai (confalonieri et al., 2013)."
6,"according to this method, the gap fraction (p0) is 145 estimated through the automatic segmentation of images acquired at 57.5° zenith angle 146 from below the canopy while the user is rotating the smartphone along its main axis."
6,"the 57.5° 147 angle is identified in real time, by applying plain vector algebra to the components of the g 148 vector provided by the 3-axis accelerometer of the device."
6,lai values are then derived by 149 inverting the light transmittance model proposed by baret et al.
6,"(2010) (eq. 3): 150 𝑐𝑜𝑠(57.5°) 151 𝐿𝐴𝐼 = − [ ] 𝑙𝑜𝑔[𝑃0 (57.5°)] (3) 0.5 152 153 this model uses the gap fraction estimated at 57.5° because it has been proved that the 154 information acquired from this particular view angle are independent from the leaf angle 155 distribution (baret et al., 2010)."
7,"156 further details on pocketlai, pocketn and on the pocketn calibration curves are provided as 157 supplementary material (figure s1, s2 and table s1) and by confalonieri et al. (2013, 2015) 158 and paleari et al."

7,"159 160 2.2 description of the field experiment 161 rice (oryza sativa l., cv."
7,"volano) was scatter seeded on 7 may 2018 in a 2 ha field in 162 gaggiano (milan province; 45°23’n, 9°02’e, 126 m a.s.l.) and grown under continuous 163 flooding conditions."
7,"rice was grown in the field since the last decade, reflecting the high 164 level of specialization of rice farms in northern italy."
7,the site is representative of the conditions 165 experienced by rice in the eastern part of the main european rice district.
7,"soil was silt loam 166 (usda), subacid, with medium organic matter content and cation exchange capacity, and 167 unlimiting values for available p and exchangeable k."
7,"crop management allowed a 168 complete control of weeds, pests and diseases."
7,"169 in general, temperatures during the 2018 rice season were in line with the 10-year average in 170 the site (figure s3) and, despite mean daily temperatures during summer months were 171 sometimes higher than the average, they never exceeded the optimal range for rice 172 (sanchez et al., 2014)."
7,"the 2018 season was consistent with mean climatic conditions in the 173 study area also in terms of precipitations (figure s4), with spring and autumn rainfall peaks, 174 and drier conditions during summer."
7,"175 two different fertilization strategies were considered (table 1), each applied to half of the 176 field, with the latter divided along the same direction of a fertility gradient generated by the 177 union of two fields and by the levelling of the resulting one."
7,"in the first fertilization strategy 178 (baseline scenario - bs), topdressing n fertilization was applied based on the standard 179 farming practices in the study area and on the farmer’s perception of crop needs."
7,"for this 180 scenario, n was distributed without differentiating the dose in the different parts of the field."
7,"181 in the second strategy (alternative scenario - as), pocketnni and satellite data were used to 182 derive spatially distributed estimates of nni, whose values were grouped in five classes: (i) 183 severe n stress (nni < 0.7), (ii) light n stress (0.7 ≤ nni < 0.9), (iii) neutral (0.9 ≤ nni ≤ 1.1), (iv) light 184 luxury consumption (1.1 < nni ≤ 1.3), and (v) severe luxury consumption (nni > 1.3)."
8,"185 membership of field portions to the nni classes was used by the farmer to define the n dose 186 corresponding to each portion (i.e., prescription map), in light of the fertilization strategy 187 adopted (how many fertilization events), of the cultivar features and of his knowledge of the 188 specific field (e.g., soil drainage, organic matter content)."
8,"as demonstrated and discussed by 189 paleari et al. (2019), indeed, differences in cultivar features, and the variability in soils 190 properties and management strategies mostly prevent using constant relationships to derive 191 n doses from nni values."
8,"192 the clustering of sentinel 2 ndre (normalized difference red-edge) images acquired before 193 the topdressing fertilizations allowed driving ground data collection with the aim of finding 194 the best compromise between the need of properly capturing field variability and the need 195 of keeping to the minimum the number of ground measurements (nutini et al., 2018)."
8,"in 196 practice, one site in the field was identified for each of six ndre clusters, and pocketnni 197 readings were taken at each site."
8,"198 in case of directly spatializing nni values via relationships with vegetation indices (fitzgerald 199 et al., 2010; cao et al., 2013), nni values provided by pocketnni can be directly used."
8,"in this 200 study, we chose to indirectly estimate nni values at pixel level (huang et al., 2015) based on 201 ndre-pnc and ndvi-lai relationships derived using ground pnc and lai values provided by 202 pocketnni at the six scouting sites (nutini et al., 2018)."
8,"these relationships were then used to 203 estimate pnc and lai values for each pixel, with pnc values derived with the calibration 204 curve implemented in pocketnni for cv."
8,"volano: 𝑃𝑁𝐶 = 6.77 ∙ 𝑃𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑁 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 − 2.25 (paleari et 205 al., 2019)."
8,"lai was converted into ncrit by using the approach described above (confalonieri 206 et al., 2011), and the nni map was derived from pixel-level pnc to ncrit ratios."
8,207 details on management practices – including those not related with n fertilization – are 208 provided in table 1.
8,"209 at harvest, yield of the baseline and alternative scenario was determined with a combined 210 harvester, sampling eleven subplots along each half of the field."
9,"212 2.3 life cycle assessment 213 the life cycle assessment (lca) approach is a holistic method defined by two iso standards 214 (iso, 2006a; iso, 2006b) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts related to a 215 product or a service throughout its entire life cycle."
9,"216 217 2.3.1 goal and scope 218 in this study, lca was applied to rice production in northern italy in order to compare two 219 different fertilization strategies: one based on conventional practices in the area (uniform n 220 distribution according to farmer’s perception of crop needs), the other based on the 221 combined use of a new smart app and of satellite data to get a spatially-distributed, real- 222 time diagnosis of n nutritional status."
9,"in developed countries, the outcomes of this study can 223 support rice growers in increasing nitrogen use efficiency and policymakers in defining public 224 subsidy frameworks targeting the reduction of the environmental impacts of rice-based 225 cropping systems."
9,"226 specifically, this lca study was aimed at: 227 - evaluating the potential environmental impact of rice production in a case study 228 carried out in northern italy during 2018, 229 - quantifying the potential environmental benefits achievable by applying vr fertilization 230 through the combined use of satellite data and of a new smart app developed to quantify 231 nni."
9,"232 233 2.3.2 functional unit 234 according to iso standards, the functional unit (fu) is defined as the main function of the 235 system expressed in quantitative terms (iso, 2006a)."
9,"in this study, it was considered as 1 t of 236 rice grain at the commercial moisture (86% of dry matter)."
9,"the choice of the fu is in 237 agreement with previous studies on rice in italy (fusi et al., 2014; bacenetti et al., 2016a; 238 bacenetti et al., 2016b), iran (khoshnevisan et al., 2014), usa (brodt et al., 2014, fertitta- 239 roberts et al., 2019), korea (jeong et al., 2018), japan (hokazono and hayashi, 2012), 9"
10,"240 thailand (thanawong et al., 2014), and brazil (coltro et al., 2017), thus allowing a direct 241 acomparison of results."
10,242 243 2.3.3 system boundary 244 a “from cradle to farm gate” approach was applied in this study.
10,the system boundary 245 includes all the activities carried out from the extraction of the raw materials to the drying of 246 rice grains.
10,"in particular, the following stages of the production process were considered: i) 247 extraction of raw materials (e.g., fossil fuels, metals and minerals); ii) manufacture, 248 maintenance and disposal of the capital goods (e.g., tractors, agricultural machines, shed 249 and grain dryer); iii) production of the different inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, electricity, diesel, 250 etc.); iv) emissions related to the use of input factors (e.g., emissions due to fertilizers 251 application, diesel fuel emissions related to diesel combustion in the tractor engine)."
10,"252 distribution, processing, packaging, use and end-of-life were excluded from the system 253 boundary because they are the same in the two scenarios."
10,allocation was not applied since 254 straws are left into the field in both scenarios.
10,255 figure 2 shows the system boundary for the rice production process.

10,"258 259 2.3.4 inventory data collection 260 two different types of inventory data were used: primary data directly collected at the farm 261 during field tests and surveys and secondary data retrieved from databases, literature or 262 estimated using specific models."
10,"the collected primary data refer to the consumption of the 263 different inputs (e.g., diesel for the different field operations and for drying, seeds, fertilizers, 264 plant protection products, machinery and tractors, infrastructures such as the dryer and the 265 sheds for equipment)."
10,table 1 reports the main data concerning the cultivation practice.
10,266 267 table 1 – around here 10
11,268 269 secondary data were instead considered for the emissions of methane and nitrogen and 270 phosphorous compounds.
11,"for the emissions of methane in atmosphere, the ipcc model 271 (ipcc, 2006) was used and different scaling factors (for pre- and in-season water 272 management, application of organic fertilizer and soil type) were applied to the baseline 273 emission value for continuously flooded field without organic amendments (1.3 kg ch 4 ha-1 274 day-1)."
11,table 2 reports the main information used for the estimation of methane emissions.
11,"275 although the cultivation practice is the same, the as showed a slightly higher methane 276 emissions per unit area (113.0 and 122.7 kg ch4 ha-1 day-1, in bs and as, respectively) 277 because of a higher amount of straw1 produced and incorporated into the soil."
11,278 279 table 2 – around here.
11,"280 281 nitrogen emissions (nitrate leaching; ammonia volatilization, and nitrous oxide emissions in 282 atmosphere) were computed following the ipcc guidelines (2006), whereas the phosphate 283 emissions in water (leaching to groundwater and surface runoff) were calculated following 284 prahsun (2006)."
11,"285 pesticide emissions were estimated according to the product category rules for arable 286 crops (environdec, 2013) and, consequently, the active ingredient of pesticides was 287 considered totally released into the soil."
11,"288 background data regarding the production of the different inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, 289 diesel, electricity, tractors and agricultural machines, dryer) were retrieved from the 290 ecoinvent database® v.3.5 (weidema et al., 2013; moreno ruiz et al., 2018)."

12,"295 2.3.5 impact assessment 296 using the characterisation factors reported by the midpoint ilcd method (ilcd, 2011), the 297 following impact categories were considered: climate change (cc), ozone depletion (od), 298 human toxicity, cancer effects (htc), human toxicity, non-cancer effects (htnoc), particulate 299 matter formation (pm), photochemical oxidant formation (pof), terrestrial acidification (ta), 300 freshwater eutrophication (fe), terrestrial eutrophication (te), marine eutrophication (me), 301 freshwater ecotoxicity (fex), mineral fossil and renewable resource depletion (mfrd)."
12,"302 the ilcd (2011) midpoint method was released by the european commission joint research 303 centre and supports the correct use of the characterisation factors for impact assessment as 304 recommended in the ilcd guidance document ""recommendations for life cycle impact 305 assessment in the european context - based on existing environmental impact assessment 306 models and factors” (hauschild et al., 2011)."

12,"results and discussions 310 3.1 pocketnni/satellite-driven n management 311 the combined use of pocketnni and satellite data allowed to effectively explore the in-field 312 variability of pnc, ncrit, and nni (figure 3)."
12,"313 in general, the observed within-field heterogeneity in n nutritional status was representative of 314 intensive rice-based cropping systems, with most nni values close to 1 even before top- 315 dressing fertilizations (paleari et al., 2019)."
12,"the real-time diagnosis of n nutritional status via the 316 combined use of pocketnni and satellite data allowed capturing the spatial variability in nni 317 and, thus, to fine tune n distribution in the different areas of the field."
12,"this turned into a 12.8 % 318 higher grain yield for as as compared to bs, with only 2% more n applied (table 1), thus 319 demonstrating the system effectiveness in preventing both n stress (decreasing yield 320 potential) and luxury consumption."
12,321 322 figure 3 – around here 323 12
13,"324 the increase in productivity is similar to what reported for cereals by other authors (koch et 325 al., 2004; biermacher et al., 2006; sharf et al., 2011), although it is likely larger than what could 326 be achieved on average for rice in the area because of the pronounced heterogeneity that 327 characterized the experimental field, in turn due to the fertility gradient generated by the 328 union of two smaller fields."
13,this – as mentioned in the description of the field experiment –may 329 have increased the positive effect of vr n fertilization.
13,the total amount of n applied for as 330 was slightly higher (+3 kg ha-1 over the entire season).
13,"this is probably due to the tendency of 331 many italian formers to limit n fertilization to reduce the risk of increasing the susceptibility to 332 fungal pathogens, given tricyclazole – a fungicide widely used to tackle rice blast disease 333 since many years – has been recently banned (titone et al., 2015)."
13,"334 besides the potential for increasing productivity and n use efficiency, other advantages of 335 pocketnni derive from its technological features."
13,"indeed, although other methods are 336 available to support topdressing n fertilization based on the nni concept (e.g., huang et al., 337 2015, chen, 2015), pocketnni is the first tool able to provide directly nni as output, without 338 the need for dedicated instruments and for data export and analysis in external 339 environments."
13,"this allows farmers being independent in assessing n nutritional status, with 340 clear advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and timeliness of the analysis."
13,"moreover, 341 when coupled with satellite data and smart-scouting techniques (nutini et al., 2018), 342 pocketnni allows deriving high resolution nni maps with just few ground measurements."
13,"the 343 system is scientifically sound, being based on the nni concept, and the information provided 344 (nni) is easy to interpret."
13,"all these aspects make the proposed system highly promising for 345 overcoming most of the barriers that limit the adoption of pa techniques in operational 346 contexts (lowenberg-deboer and erickson, 2019)."
13,"347 348 3.2 life cycle assessment 349 figures 4 and 5 show the relative contributions to the overall environmental impact of the 350 production factors and of the emissions sources for bs and as, respectively."
13,351 352 figure 4 and figure 5 – around here 13
14,353 354 different main contributors (namely “environmental hotspots”) were identified for the different 355 impact categories: 356 - the main responsible of cc were the emissions of methane and dinitrogen monoxide 357 from the soil (44-45% of the total impact).
14,"methane emissions contributed also to pof 358 (7.9% and 8.4% in bs and as, respectively); 359 - the emissions related to the fertilization were the main hotspot for pm, ta and me."
14,"in 360 particular, ammonia emission was responsible for pm, ta and me, nitrate leaching for 361 me and phosphorous run-off for fe; 362 - the mechanisation of field operations was the responsible for ht-noc, mainly due to the 363 emissions of pollutants (e.g., hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides) in the exhaust gas of the 364 tractor engine and pof, mainly because of the consumption of diesel and the 365 emission of non-methane volatile organic compound (nmvoc); 366 - fertilizers production was the main responsible of mfrd, given the high energetic cost 367 for the production of n fertilizers; 368 - the impact of seed and pesticides production was lower than 10% for all the evaluated 369 impact categories but od (mainly due to herbicides production), ht-c, fe and fex 370 (seed production); 371 - for fex, it was related to the emissions of pesticides into the soil (about 35%) to the 372 production of fertilizers (about 30%)."
14,"373 despite the main contributors to the overall environmental impact were similar in the two 374 scenarios, some differences can be highlighted: 375 - for od, the grain drying was responsible for 27.8% of the impact in bs, whereas its 376 contribution was larger in as (32.4%) because of the higher transpiration (768 kg in bs 377 and 956 kg in as) due to the higher crop growth, which – beside the final yield - 378 affected the amount of transpiring tissues; 379 - the impact related to transport was higher (both in relative and absolute terms) in as 380 because of the higher biomass produced."
15,"381 table 4 reports the absolute environmental impact for the two scenarios, figure 6 shows the 382 comparison between the two scenarios."
15,"regardless of the evaluated impact categories, as 383 showed the best results, with impact reduction ranging from 11.0% for od to 13.6% for mfrd."
15,"384 the impact reduction, mainly due to the yield increase (7.97 and 8.99 t ha-1 at commercial 385 moisture in bs and as, respectively), was considerable and it was only related to the 386 combined use of pocketnni and satellite data."
15,"this reduction was larger for the impact 387 categories more affected by the energy consumption for fertilizer production (mfrd) and by 388 the emissions of n compounds due to fertilization (ta, te, fe and me)."
15,"the impact reduction 389 was lower for: 390 - od, the impact category mainly affected by grain drying, because of the higher 391 amount of water to be removed given the higher yield; 392 - cc, since the higher yield involves a higher production of straw that, being 393 incorporated into the soil, leads to higher methane emissions."
15,"394 395 396 figure 6 – around here 397 398 table 4 – around here 399 400 3.2.1 uncertainty analysis 401 to test the robustness of the results achieved while comparing the two scenarios, a 402 quantitative uncertainty analysis was carried out by using monte carlo techniques as 403 sampling method (1,000 iterations and a confidence interval of 95%)."
15,the results are reported 404 in figure 7.
15,the bars represent the probability that the environmental impact of bs is higher 405 than (or equal to) the one of as.
15,"the uncertainty due to selection of the data from 406 databases, partial model adequacy and variability of data does not significantly affect the 407 quantification of the environmental impact for all the categories, the only exception being 408 the toxicity related ones."
16,409 410 figure 7 – around here 411 412 4.
16,"conclusions 413 among the different agricultural activities, fertilisation is responsible of serious environmental 414 concerns because of the impacts deriving from the processes of fertilizer production 415 (especially for n-based ones) and from the emissions of nitrogen and phosphorous 416 compounds in ground- and surface water and in the atmosphere."
16,this context is generating a 417 growing demand for smart solutions able to drive the timing of fertilisation events and the 418 amounts of products distributed.
16,"419 in this study, a vr fertilization strategy based on pocketnni (a new smart app for nni 420 estimates) and satellite data was compared – in terms of environmental performances – with 421 a strategy based on the uniform distribution of n according to standard practices in the area."
16,"422 the combined use of pocketnni and remote sensing products allowed achieving a 423 considerable increase in yield at the cost of a negligible increase in the amount of nitrogen 424 fertilisers consumed, thus reducing the amount of n used per unit of product."
16,"this, from an 425 environmental point of view, leads to a double benefit: the reduction of the impact for all the 426 categories considered due to the increase in productivity and – especially for acidification 427 and eutrophication – the reduction of the emissions of n compounds."
16,"428 in terms of economic sustainability, the proposed system has both direct (higher yield to 429 fertilizer ratio) and indirect (lower risk of losses due to diseases and lodging) benefits."
16,future 430 development will refer to the automatic integration and processing of satellite data.
16,"431 despite the analysis was performed using data from only one growing season, the achieved 432 results are promising and highlight how the environmental impact of agricultural activities can 433 be effectively reduced by using smart technologies (cost-effective and familiar for potential 434 users) to improve fertilisation efficiency."
