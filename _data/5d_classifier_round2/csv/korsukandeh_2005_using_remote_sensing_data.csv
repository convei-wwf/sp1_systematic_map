1,"given the rugged and mountainous nature of the country and the location of villages, towns and cities, there is propensity for widespread death and destruction due to landslides whenever an earthquake occurs."
1,"use of satellite imagery by humanitarian agencies in afghanistan in preparation for and response to natural and man-made disasters has been very limited, mostly to international organizations such as the united na- tions."
1,earth observation satellites (eos) due to their vantage position have demonstrated their ability to rapidly provide vital information and services in a disaster situation.
1,eos has been used in emergency situations where the ground resources are often lacking.
1,the perception amongst humanitarian agencies and civil protection au- thorities in most developing countries is that the cost of satellite imagery is not cheap.
1,"with limited budgets available for purchasing satellite data, they tend to opt for less expensive solutions such as interagency survey teams to assess damages."
1,"the rugged and mountainous nature of afghani- stan and the lack of roads in most parts of the country, survey teams are most often hampered, leading to delays in delivery of information from the field to the decision makers."
1,recent earthquake in the hindu kush of the country in april 2004 wit- nessed the triggering of the international charter for free delivery of satel- lite imagery.
2,"830 joseph maada korsu kandeh, abdul wali ahadi and lalit kumar image analysis and interpretation of both pre and crisis data did not show observable features of damages."
2,the damage assessment maps were used by the humanitarian community for decision-making.
2,availability and access to space technology in addressing natural disas- ters have been the main obstacles facing developing countries particularly those poor countries without their own space programs.
2,this problem has been solved through the introduction of the international charter for ma- jor disasters.
2,"however, knowledge about the charter is not common knowledge in most developing countries; disaster management authori- ties, the academic institutions, humanitarian agencies and the affected communities have very little idea about the availability and access to free satellite imagery."
2,there is need for a massive awareness campaign to educate decision makers about the international charter and the potentials of using space technology in addressing problems relating to disaster man- agement and the environment.
2,the skills to process satellite imagery and integrate it with other gis layers are lacking in most developing countries; there is need to embark on a massive capacity building exercise to ensure optimization of the benefits of the technology.
2,the charter needs to find innovative ways of quickly sending value added information products to disaster management authorities instead of relying on in-country skills in image processing.
2,"this paper elaborates on the experiences gained working with images received from the international charter, and the immense pressures from the humanitarian community for rapid delivery of information."
2,"1 introduction natural disasters are extreme events within the earth's system that result in death or injury to humans, and damage or loss of valuable goods, such as buildings, communication systems, agricultural land, forest, natural envi- ronment etc (van westen, 2002)."
2,"alexander (1993) distinguished between a disaster from a hazard when the disaster occurs in a populated area, and brings damage, loss or destruction to the socio-economic system."
2,afghanistan is located in a zone of high-seismic activity.
2,"given the rug- ged and mountainous nature of the country and the location of villages, towns and cities, there is always a high propensity for widespread death and destruction whenever an earthquake, landslide, mudslide, avalanche, or flooding occurs."
2,"according to the em-dat international disaster database (http://www.cred.be/), about 1,919 people have been killed, and a total of"
3,"using remote sensing data for earthquake damage assessment 831 76,550 made homeless due to yearly flooding since 1972."
3,"landslides and avalanches have also made their mark on the lives and properties of af- ghans; 1,373 people have been affected with 799 killed."
3,"the red cross estimates that since the early 1980s, natural disasters in afghanistan have killed an estimated 19,000 people and displaced 7.5 million people (ifrc/rc, 2002)."
3,"decades of war and civil conflict, as well as environmental degradation, have all contributed to increasing vulnerability of the afghan people to natural disasters."
3,"several assessments by the humanitarian agencies in afghanistan have revealed significant shortcomings in the areas of water, sanitation, health, security and natural resource management."
3,"furthermore, the high level of poverty, lack of livelihood and income generating opportunities, chronic health problems, and poor state of the in- frastructure all add to the burden of natural disasters on the people of af- ghanistan."
3,the government of afghanistan is so weak it relies heavily on the humanitarian community particularly the un in responding and man- aging major natural disasters.
3,"there is lack of coordination amongst gov- ernment departments, and clear-cut strategy for disaster management in the country."
3,"the success of disaster management depends largely on availability, dissemination, and effective use of information for decision-making."
3,"the information needs will vary depending on the users, and the scale, but gen- erally will include information on weather and climate, all elements at risk, socio-economic and demographic data, and past information on previous disasters depicting their location, characteristics, extent, and impact."
3,"since the overthrow of the taliban government in 2001 which, witnessed the re- turn of the united nations and international non governmental organiza- tion into the country, disaster management data are being generated by multiple users, stored in different formats and media, making it extremely difficult to bring the data together to support disaster management activi- ties."
3,lack of critical and timely information for disaster reduction is typical of developing countries particularly those emerging from decades of war and civil conflict; afghanistan is not an exception.
3,"reliable information in a timely manner saves lives and properties as actionable decisions are made that lead to fore warning of populations, provision of relief and mak- ing communities resilient and knowledge based."
3,"space technologies have proved to contribute unique and significant so- lutions in disaster management: disaster mitigation, disaster preparedness, disaster relief and also disaster rehabilitation."
3,space technology based so- lutions have become an integral part of disaster management activities in many developed and some developing countries

4,"in afghanistan, use of satellite imagery by humanitarian agencies in the country in preparation for and response to natural and manmade disasters has been very limited."
4,the humanitarian community generally assumes that the cost of satellite imagery is not cheap.
4,"with limited budgets avail- able for purchasing satellite data, they tend to opt for less expensive solu- tions such as interagency survey teams to assess damages."
4,"the rugged and mountainous nature of the country and the lack of roads in most parts of the country, survey teams are most often hampered, leading to delays in delivery of information from the field to the decision makers."
4,"in march 2002, an earthquake measuring 6 on the richter scale occurred in the northeast part of afghanistan killing about 1000 people (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/activity/past.html)."
4,"for the first time in af- ghanistan, satellite imagery was used to assess damages as over 35,000 people were affected."
4,recent earthquake in the hindu kush of the country (5th april 2004) witnessed the triggering of the international charter1 for free delivery of satellite imagery.
4,aims2 requested a set of satellite imagery through unosat covering both pre and post earthquake periods.
4,"pre disaster im- agery was immediately released, but it took over a week before crisis data could be taken and delivered."
4,problems of availability of cloud free im- ages and too much snow cover delayed delivery of crisis data.
4,the objectives of the satellite imagery received from the international charter for major disasters were as follows: 1.
4,"to provide information on damage assessment as a result of the 6th april 2004 earthquake through the use of satellite imagery, 2."
4,"to show the extent and impact of the earthquake on lives and properties, 3."
4,"to inform the key players of disaster management in afghanistan, the government of the transitional islamic republic of afghanistan and the humanitarian community of the role of the international charter, 4."
4,"to educate key players of disaster management in afghanistan, the government of the transitional islamic republic of afghanistan and the humanitarian community of the potentials of satellite imagery in dam- age assessment, 5."
4,"provide a decision support system for government authorities and the humanitarian agencies in addressing rescue, relief, rehabilitation, re- construction and mitigation."

5,"schematic representation of the methodology using erdas imagine 8.4, both pre and post earthquake images (crisis data) were pre-processed, rectified and a change detection map derived."
5,"in arc- view gis 3.2a, the change detection map, and the pre, and post earthquake im- ages were each overlaid with the following gis layers; major fault lines, popula- tion density, settlements, topographic datasets (1:50k), slope and aspect maps to produce damage assessment maps."
5,"2 results table 1 shows that since 2000, about 9 major earthquakes have occurred in afghanistan, of which 8 occurred in the northeast of the country."
5,"the most disastrous earthquake was in march 2002 where about 1000 people were killed and over 35,000 affected."
5,table 2 shows the turn around time in the delivery of satellite image fol- lowing the request for data.
5,table 2 shows a considerable delay in the de- livery of satellite imagery particularly the crisis data after the occurrence of the earthquake (05/04/04) and the request of the imagery from the inter- national charter.
5,the delay in delivery imagery consequently resulted in the late delivery of processed value added disaster damage maps for deci- sion-making.
6,"834 joseph maada korsu kandeh, abdul wali ahadi and lalit kumar image analysis and interpretation of both pre and crisis data did not show observable features of damages."
6,change detection performed also did not reveal any structural change.
6,"the change maps overlaid with the other gis layers such as major fault lines (1:6,000,000), slope and as- pect maps generated from dem (90 x 90m), topographic dataset (1:50,000), settlements, population density, and ground surveys produced a number of value added products."
6,the damage assessment maps were widely distributed and used by the humanitarian community for decision-making relating to planning of relief assistance.

6,"earthquake statistics, 2000-2004 source: (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/activity/past.html) disaster damage maps overlaid with major fault lines (figure 2) and slope maps proved valuable inputs to the development of disaster man- agement plans ranging from national plans to sub-national levels particu- larly in an earthquake prone country."
6,"50 km buffer analyses (figure 3) showed less densely populated settlements, which according to reports from the limited ground surveys were barely affected by the earthquake."
6,lack of baseline data makes comparability of damage assessment maps to pre-disaster phase extremely difficult except if local knowledge and ground truthing is used for validation.
6,change detection analysis (figures 4 and 5) of images taken in 2003 and those taken few days after the earth- quake of 6 april 2004 showed little or no structural changes.
7,"using remote sensing data for earthquake damage assessment 835 the mountainous and rugged terrain makes most areas inaccessible ex- cept by donkeys, which might take weeks to get there."
7,"due to its vantage position, eos provided crucial data, which would have taken quite a while due to the inaccessibility of the areas to vehicles."

11,"using remote sensing data for earthquake damage assessment 839 3 conclusion though there has been a remarkable improvement in the turn around time in delivery of space data, there are still notable delays in image data acqui- sition and delivery particularly due to problems of availability of cloud free images and too much snow cover."
11,"most disaster management authori- ties in developing countries lack the infrastructure to access, process and deliver operational products."
11,"lack of near real time data to monitor, assess and map the extent and impact of natural disasters has also hampered dis- aster management authorities in responding in a timely manner."
11,the spatial and temporal resolution of the imagery provided by the charter makes it difficult to monitor and assess the damage if the earthquake occurred in a built-up area with high population density.
11,availability and access to space technology in addressing natural disas- ters has been the main obstacles facing developing countries particularly those poor countries without their own space programs.
11,this problem has been solved through the introduction of the international charter.
11,knowl- edge about the charter is not common knowledge in most developing countries; there is need for a massive awareness campaign to educate deci- sion makers about the charter and the potentials of using space technology in addressing problems relating to disaster management.
11,the skills to process satellite imagery and integrate it with gis are lacking in most de- veloping countries; there is need to embark on a massive capacity building exercise to ensure optimization of the benefits of the technology.
11,"the needs of the users are varied, and most often the users themselves do not know what they want."
11,"data and information providers, and disseminators need to be fully aware of user requirements when space technology based applications are developed."
11,it is often assumed that disaster reduction information once acquired would be disseminated to the affected communities and the operational de- cision makers.
11,a simple mechanism should be designed to ensure that in- formation based on the needs of the users at the various levels is dissemi- nated in a timely manner.
