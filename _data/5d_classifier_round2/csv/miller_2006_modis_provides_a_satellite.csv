3,"miller et al. satellite sensors, and their associated high data rates/volumes, the hardware and computational overhead required for remotely deployed users to process data in the field is becoming increasingly prohibitive."
3,"one solution to this problem is the ‘reach-back’ concept, whereby remote users may connect to centralized sites that synthesize large volumes of data into compact, salient information."
3,"the concept implies an end-to-end system capable of (1) gaining rapid access to all available satellite data, (2) quickly deriving useful applications, and (3) effectively distributing/communicating the results to remote users, e.g. via internet protocols."
3,"military weather analysts require environmental information that is timely, intuitive, pertinent to mission objectives, and easily accessed."
3,successful products tailored to this user must minimize interpretation time while maximizing information content.
3,"through multi-spectral, multi-sensor, and model- fusion algorithms designed to exploit the underlying physics and isolate specific parameters of interest, large amounts of information from a potentially complex scene must be converted into a few readily interpretable applications."
3,the ‘satellite focus’ effort described herein was developed by the naval research laboratory as an attempt to accomplish the reach-back task within the scope of its research and development framework.
3,stephens and matson (1993) detail the use of national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) advanced very high resolution radiometer (avhrr) (from the operational polar orbiting environmental satellite (poes) system) data in observing from space some aspects of the 1991 persian gulf war.
3,"the current work provides an analogous application for the 2003 operation iraqi freedom (oif) conflict, based on new and improved research-grade satellite data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis, king et al. 1992) carried aboard the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) earth observing system (eos) program."
3,"modis is regarded as a heritage sensor to the future visible/infrared imaging radiometer suite (viirs) instrument to fly aboard the national polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite system (npoess) in ,2010."
3,"this paper describes the satellite focus system in terms of modis data acquisition, value-added application development, automated processing, and end- product distribution, used in the context of operational weather support to coalition forces during oif."
3,"modis data acquisition the modis instruments carried aboard eos terra (1030 local equatorial crossing, descending node) and aqua (1330 local equatorial crossing, ascending node) satellites offer high spatial resolution, multi-spectral observations and onboard calibration."
3,modis features 36 narrow-band channels within in the optical (0.4–14 micrometer wavelength) part of the electromagnetic spectrum of high value in characterization of the surface and atmosphere.
3,"modis spatial resolutions range from 1000 m (infrared bands 8 to 36) and 500 m (visible bands 3 to 7) to as high as 250 m (red and reflective infrared, bands 1 to 2)."
3,a growing list of universities (e.g.
3,"university of wisconsin-madison, university of miami, oregon state university) and research organizations (e.g."
3,"goddard space flight center (gsfc) and the united states geological survey (usgs) earth resources observation & science (eros)) are making their direct broadcast capture of modis available online, and the space, science, and engineering center (ssec; located at university of wisconsin-madison) has spearheaded the effort to"
4,modis provides a satellite focus on operation iraqi freedom 1287 augment direct broadcast capabilities worldwide via the international modis/ airs processing package (imapp; e.g.
4,strabala et al.
4,2003).
4,"prior to the events of 11 september 2001, however, no conduit or protocols existed to provide global observations from modis (a research satellite) to operational processing facilities in near real-time."
4,it was the sudden need for improved observational capabilities in support of responding forces in the middle east that catalysed the near real time processing effort (nrtpe; e.g.
4,haggerty et al.
4,(2003)).
4,"co-ordinated between noaa, nasa, and the dod, the nrtpe was designed to enable turn-around of calibrated modis data in a timeframe relevant to operational users."
4,figure 1 depicts the flow of the modis data stream through the nrtpe framework—from raw sensor (rate-buffered) data to calibrated level-1b radiances/brightness- temperature sensor data records (sdrs).
4,"for the terra-modis telemetry, downlink contacts with the tracking and data relay satellite system (tdrss; a geostationary-based communications satellite constellation) were increased from once to twice-per-orbit."
4,"in the ground-processing segment, software upgrades, dedicated hardware acquisition, and installation of optical fibre communication lines resulted in significant latency reductions."
4,"aqua (which does not have tdrss connectivity) data were down-linked to svalbard, norway, once per orbit and followed a subsequent processing flow similar to terra."
4,"during the active military phase of oif, average terra/aqua global data latencies were less than 3 hours—a vast improvement in comparison to pre-nrtpe modis latencies of 1–2 weeks."
4,"the satellite focus system to handle the computational burden of processing high volumes of data (totalling approximately 50 gigabytes/day for the southwest asia domain alone), a multi- processor portable batch system (pbs) queuing architecture with an onboard 300 gb raid storage system was implemented."
4,"the pbs operates as a load-balanced cluster, wherein jobs are distributed and processed in a serial fashion across any of the available free or lowest-tasked nodes (each having dual 2.8 ghz processors with 4 gb memory cards)."
4,local storage of the large satellite datasets (a single modis 5-minute daytime granule set containing all 36 spectral channels at native figure 1.

5,"miller et al. resolutions is on the order of 1 gigabyte) minimizes data transfer delays, and the system is self-contained to minimize network file system (nfs) mounting and maximize system stability."
5,mirrored system discs and a dual power supply provide additional fail-safes.
5,"the system is fully scalable, accepting additional processing nodes as computational demands increase."
5,"upon receipt of new data (e.g. a 5-minute modis ‘granule’), a series of pre- processing steps performs quality checks, converts the data into standard formats and units, and removes sensor artefacts (e.g. a de-striping correction applied to modis thermal infrared and 1.38 mm channels using software developed by ssec, following the empirical distribution function normalization method described by weinreb et al."
5,1989).
5,"then, a series of science algorithms (examples provided below) convert the digital data into a suite of value-added products mapped to common earth projections over specific areas of interest (e.g. based on user requests)."
5,"finally, these products are transferred to the globally deployable satellite focus web page interface for immediate user access."
5,"to accommodate requirements for information at a variety of spatial scales, satellite focus adopts a hierarchical data storage structure (figure 2)."
5,"in the top three levels of this structure, earth is partitioned into a set of nested domains, enabling users to zoom into any available area while observing environmental conditions on a variety of scales."
5,the product-centric design appeals to users who are interested primarily in the information itself as opposed to the means used to obtain it (i.e. several independent observing systems may be capable of rendering the same product).
5,"dotted lines in figure 2 denote pattern continuity, implying that an figure 2."
5,"the general architecture of product storage on satellite focus, wherein earth is partitioned into an arbitrary number of nested domains containing co-registered products produced from a variable collection of satellite observing systems."
6,modis provides a satellite focus on operation iraqi freedom 1289 arbitrary number of domains (of arbitrary spatial scale) containing any number of products and sensors may contribute to those general product categories.
6,"satellite focus operates at the interface between research, application develop- ment, and operations—providing a previously unavailable conduit between cutting- edge satellite products and operational users far in advance of conventional technology-transfer time frames."
6,"while this is a potentially powerful system for communicating information in the net-centric environment, it is only as useful as the clarity of materials being presented."
6,"due to the broad scope of backgrounds and levels of expertise held by military users, and particularly in light of the novelty of many of the products being shown, information displayed on satellite focus needed to be communicated in as simple, direct, and comprehensive terms as possible."
6,"to this end, online tutorials explaining the purpose, utility, and limitation of each satellite application presented were included on the website."
6,"the tutorials, written at a sufficiently high level to ensure comprehension by laypersons and experts alike, included multiple examples taken from the specific geographic areas of relevance."
6,"these built-in user guides, including tutorials for how to navigate the page itself, were intended to provide users of satellite focus with the basic familiarity and proficiency necessary to integrate with confidence the new satellite products as part of their standard operating procedures."
6,selected applications from oif the high spatial and spectral resolution modis data provide superior capabilities to contemporary operational radiometers in characterizing the diverse and often complex southwest asian environment.
6,the following examples illustrate a subset of modis capabilities in the context of weather events observed during the oif campaign.
6,"4.1 true colour to novice interpreters of satellite imagery, making sense of a complicated earth/ atmosphere scene using grey-scale or false colour imagery can be a very difficult task."
6,true colour imagery (depicting the scene in a similar fashion to a colour photograph) allows users to make sophisticated interpretations of meteorological phenomena with relatively little training.
6,"true colour imagery is created by combining atmospherically corrected (subtraction of the molecular atmosphere signal as a function of solar/sensor geometry, as provided here from radiative transfer simulations) narrowband red, green, and blue light information (from modis bands 1, 4, and 3, respectively) into a signal that approximates how human vision would perceive the same scene."
6,"the resultant imagery portrays blue oceans, brown soils, tan deserts, white clouds, green vegetation, grey smoke (or black, in the case of oil fires)."
6,figure 3 demonstrates these high spatial resolution true colour capabilities over iraq.
6,"in figure 3a, dark smoke plumes (designated by yellow arrows) over the city of baghdad are more clearly delineated from other dark features of the scene (e.g. vegetation)."
6,"in figure 3b a dust front passes over the northern arabian gulf, while shallow/turbid water near the coast and river outlets produces a cyan/green appearance."
6,"it is readily apparent in this example how true colour facilitates the distinction of land properties, ocean turbidity features, and cloud/dust discrimination over water."
6,readers interested in viewing additional high- quality true colour examples from modis are encouraged to visit the gsfc modis rapid response system (http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov).

7,"4.2 desert dust storms beyond simple enhancements such as true colour, miller (2003) demonstrates the capability of modis to distinguish airborne dust from the surface and other atmospheric features, resulting in a revised enhancement useful in observing and tracking the dust storms frequent to southwest asia."
7,"the algorithm takes advantage of several well-established physical principles of dust detection, providing reflectance contrast in visible and near infrared, and thermal contrasts in infrared."
7,"the enhancement is created by replacing the red channel of the true colour composite with a multispectral term derived from seven channels from the visible, shortwave and thermal infrared spectrum."
7,"assigning dust regions a bright orange/ pink tonality in contrast to cyan clouds and dark green land, the enhancement applies to significant dust concentrations (having visible optical depths greater than about 0.5, or corresponding roughly to horizontal visibility below 6 km when assuming a 1 km thick dust layer) over both land and water backgrounds."
7,"an example of this application is shown in figure 4, compared with the corresponding true colour rendition to demonstrate the conventional over-land detection challenges."
7,"the intent of the dust product was to provide a quick-look of the dust-obscured portions of the scene, particularly in moderate-to-heavy dust conditions over smooth desert backgrounds."
7,"when available, low-level winds from numerical weather prediction models were overlaid to provide a superior nowcasting tool for dust location and short-term advection."
7,4.3 aircraft contrails aircraft condensation trails (contrails; e.g.
7,"minnis et al. 2004) form when warm, moist jet exhaust mixes with the cold and dry upper troposphere environment."
7,"depending on the upper tropospheric humidity (uth), contrails may either dissipate rapidly or persist and spread over time (forming extensive cirrus shields)."
7,contrails are of special interest to military analysts from the standpoint of air traffic monitoring and conducting flight operations.
7,several papers (e.g.
7,"lee 1989 and weis et al. 1998) illustrate the ability to detect contrails from space, based on the"

8,strabala et al.
8,1994).
8,"since contrails are subject to drift and wind shear, their appearance at any single point in time may be displaced and distorted with respect to the actual aircraft flight trajectories."

9,1292 s.
9,miller et al. altitude is a useful metric for assessing the maturity and severity of these storms.
9,we constructed a convective cloud top product through the combination of infrared window (11.0 mm) information with modelled (nogaps/coampsh) temperature profiles.
9,"retrievals of cloud top height are valid only for opaque clouds, such that infrared brightness temperatures are assumed to be representative of the cloud top temperature."
9,"to isolate deep convection in the retrieval, we enlist a convective diagnostic outlined by schmetz et al. (1997), based on a threshold difference between the 6.7 mm (water vapour absorbing) and 11.0 mm (infrared window) channels."
9,"as shown in turk and miller (2005), small differences of this quantity imply the presence of optically thick clouds in the upper troposphere."
9,"to conform to the convention of pilots, retrieved heights were converted to equivalent altimeter readings (i.e. pressure altitudes) for convective tops."
9,"figure 6 demonstrates the convective cloud top heights retrieved from a line of thunderstorms entering the arabian gulf, revealing details of the cloud-top structure."
9,half-hourly resolution loops were available at reduced spatial resolution (4 km) from metoesat-5.
9,aircraft carriers deployed in this region used these convection products to navigate ships safely away from the deepest cells during aircraft launch and recovery.
9,"4.5 fires prins et al. (1998) and kaufman et al. (1998) demonstrate the utility of the 4.0 mm band (available from modis, goes, and avhrr) in the detection of fires."
9,"combining 4.0 and 11.0 mm data (e.g. to avoid misclassification of cloud edges as hot-spots during the day) we produced a graphic revealing small burning/ smouldering features within the scene, even in the presence of clouds or smoke."

10,"as a result, fires that are very small compared to the detector footprint, such as gas flares (on the scale of several metres) in southern iraq, can readily be detected in the 1 km imagery (figure 7)."
10,nwp wind fields were overlaid upon these fire products to enable short-term prediction of smoke transport.
10,"during oif, these products assisted analysts in monitoring the oil fields of southern iraq for possible environmental sabotage (similar to what occurred during the 1991 gulf war, e.g. as depicted by stephens and matson 1993)."

10,the storm crossed the region over a three-day period spanning 25–27 march 2003.
10,"as a powerful squall line entered the persian gulf, northwesterly winds lifted heavy post- frontal dust throughout iraq, bringing operations to a virtual standstill."

12,modis provides a satellite focus on operation iraqi freedom 1295 post-deployment reports from these ships cited reduced visibility dust storms as the most significant and persistent challenge encountered throughout the southwest asia domain during oif.
12,"by no coincidence, the modis dust products were among the most widely used for a variety of applications: the dust product was invaluable—we were able to track the progression of dust through southern iraq and kuwait."
12,[…] we used model data in conjunction with the dust product to nail down the forecast in regards to the possibility of dust being advected to the [aircraft carrier].
12,"uss nimitz (cvn-68) here, satellite focus modis dust products served to reduce the risk of aviation mishaps and potential collateral damage associated with visibility reductions."
