3,"tracking data and conservation policy the advent of reliable technology to track individual animals long-term (often >1 year), early engagement among the data col- lectors and the stakeholders involved in throughout marine and terrestrial environments, has produced a golden era for animal tracking policy development and implementa- studies [1,2]."

3,one driver behind growth in marine animal tracking studies is the need for distribution and movement data to inform conservation policy and management.

3,"however, the value of tracking data to inform policy is often presented australia as a ‘given’, yet not explicitly demonstrated [4]."
3,"for example, a review of the conservation 2 chesapeake biological laboratory, impact of sea turtle tracking studies highlighted that of 369 papers published between 1982 university of maryland center for environmental science, solomons, and 2014 (supported by a questionnaire-based survey of 171 sea turtle researchers), there md 20688, usa were only 12 instances where tracking ﬁndings led to clearly identiﬁable real-world changes in 3 noaa southwest fisheries science conservation practice, even though >120 papers identiﬁed conservation as a rationale for the center, environmental research division, monterey, ca 93940, usa work [5]."

9,"tracking data alone is insufﬁcient to estimate the threats the 1970s as part of the us department of commerce to guide that species face in different areas, so synergistic use of tracking along with threat and the use and protection of the ocean resource maps might help drive the use of tracking data to gain conservation beneﬁts [10]. and coastal resources, monitor the our collective case studies illustrate that tracking data can take various pathways into oceanic environment and policy and management, and sometimes engagement with stakeholders is not established atmosphere, and do research in the areas of ecosystems, climate, by the original data collectors (box 3)."
9,"in certain cases, progress depended on access to weather and water, and commerce the original tracking data and metadata."
9,"in other cases, the accumulated knowledge from and transportation. many projects (e.g., buffer zones around sea turtle rookeries) was required to shift policy."
9,data sharing and availability are likely to become increasingly important for fast and successful translation of tracking data into policy.
9,"data sharing is especially important because migratory marine animals often travel vast distances through many geopolitical boundaries, requiring international coordination of conservation efforts to cover their complete distributions [62,63]."
9,"while the knowledge of species movements increases with the sample size of tracked animals, sometimes relatively small sample sizes (e.g., <10 basking sharks tracked in example 25 in figure 1), can be sufﬁcient to drive important conservation actions."
9,"in addition to the more direct pathways between tracking data collection and policy change illustrated here, there are many indirect pathways that are difﬁcult to quantify."
9,tracking data can often make a contribution to decisions via what is termed the ‘web of inﬂuence’ [64].
9,"for example, tracking data can increase public awareness and under- standing of animal movements, which in turn can change government actions."
9,"often tracks are displayed on widely viewed websites or through other media, which helps broaden dissemination and impact."
9,"through effective science communication [65], the results of conservation-related tracking studies are being integrated into the consciousness of stakeholders, whose opinions can inﬂuence policy [9,66]."
9,tracking data are often a small but integral component of a larger suite of tools that are implemented in policy and management such as mpa design [67].
9,"tracking data can also provide unexpected information, which is used later to guide management."
9,"for example, illegal ﬁshing of sharks within a shark sanctuary was uncovered when satellite tags afﬁxed to sharks transmitting from a boat indicated illegal capture, at-sea transfer, and transport to port [68]."
9,"animal tracking information is also used for a number of purposes not directly linked to conservation, such as observing the physical structure of the world’s oceans using sensors incorporated into tags (e.g., [69])."

10,widespread use of marine animal tracking data for conservation policy or management.
10,"tracking data are used in many ways to help species conservation, including being used to help designate protected area boundaries, to reduce bycatch, minimize vessel strikes, assess abundance, and quantify demographic parameters such as mortality rates."
10,"pictured are examples of this breadth of recent research showing the general location of some of our case studies, including data on seabirds (e.g., penguins, albatrosses, and shearwaters), marine mammals (e.g., whales, manatees, dugongs, dolphins, and seals), reptiles (sea turtles), and ﬁsh (bony ﬁsh and sharks)."

11,"seabirds are among the most threatened of all birds [70] and, for the medium-sized to large species, a major threat is incidental mortality (bycatch) in commercial ﬁsheries [16,18]."
11,"some of the earliest deployments of satellite transmitters on seabirds were made on wandering albatrosses (diomedea exulans) in south georgia [71] and have continued to recent years (figure 1, example 1)."
11,"overlap of bird movements and haul locations of longline vessels targeting patagonian toothﬁsh (dissostichus eleginoides) indicated that bycatch risk for wandering albatrosses was greatest during the brood-guard period, leading to a recommendation that ﬁshing should cease from the end of february to mid-may [72]."
11,"as a direct consequence, in 1998 the convention on (or commission for) the conservation of antarctic marine living resources (ccamlr) implemented a closed ﬁshing season for toothﬁsh, which resulted in a near tenfold reduction in seabird bycatch rates."
11,"this ﬁshery remains an exemplar of effective ecosystem-based approach to management [73], with further bycatch mitigation measures being adopted as subsequent tracking results have emerged [16,18]."

11,"photo-id as a tool to record marine mammal movements for conservation beneﬁt in some cases the movements and distribution of marine animals are assessed through repeated documentation of scars and natural markings [77], including through photo-id studies with multiple resightings of individuals used in the same way as tracking data (i.e., visual telemetry; [78])."
11,"for example, photo-id of humpback whales (megaptera novaeangliae) and north atlantic right whales (eubalaena glacialis) revealed they returned each year to the gulf of maine, and these data contributed, in 1992, to the declaration of the stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary in the usa [79]."
11,"the value of photo-id as tracking data to inform management became clear with the growing awareness of the threat of ship strike, which was impacting the endangered north atlantic right whale as well as humpback and ﬁn whales (balaenoptera physalus)."
11,"working with the international maritime organisation, various us government ofﬁces, including branches of noaa and researchers working with the stellwagen bank national marine sanctuary, largely used whale watching data to determine and mandate the best routing and hull speed for ships to decrease the probability of hitting whales [80,81] (figure 1, example 21)."
11,similar scenarios using photo-id and sometimes acoustic data to track whales and dolphins have been employed elsewhere around the world.
11,"among those that have led to policy implementation are: (i) southern right whales (eubalaena australis) off patagonia, argentina (figure 1, example 22), where photo-id led to management regulations for whale watching and creation of a nursery area off-limits to tourist activities; (ii) gray whales (eschrichtius robustus) from mexico to alaska (figure 1, example 23), where observer counts tracked the whales and led to expansion of whale watching and initiatives in mexico and california, in particular to manage whale watching and protect the species; (iii) killer whales (orcinus orca) in british columbia and washington state waters (figure 1, example 24) where photo-id and acoustic tracking led to cessation of killer whale captures for aquariums and multiple conservation initiatives from us and canadian governments to address the declining numbers (e.g., critical habitat identiﬁcation by the canadian department of fisheries and oceans and noaa, and the vancouver harbor low noise directive to reduce noise pollution impacts)."

13,using tracking data to inform conservation at different spatial scales tracking data have been used to effect policy change over scales of a few kilometers up to massive ocean areas.
13,"for example, around the seychelles island of d’arros and atoll of st joseph, a detailed understanding of shark and turtle spatial ecology is being used to greatly extend the boundary of a no-take mpa [82] (figure 1, example 26)."
13,"using acoustic tags relaying data to an array of passive acoustic receivers, 116 sharks of ﬁve different species and 25 hawksbill turtles were tracked during 2012–2015."
13,"based on these movement data, increasing the size of the mpa from 42.3 km2 to 64.9 km2 was justiﬁed."
13,"initial results were shared in meetings with the ministry of environment, energy, and climate change, which contributed to the government of seychelles adopting the larger mpa and continuing to use the acoustic tracking data in ongoing mpa reﬁnements."
13,"similarly, acoustic tracking of juvenile bull sharks (carcharhinus leucas) and smalltooth sawﬁsh (pristis pectinata) in the caloosahatchee river, florida, revealed direct responses of individuals to changes in river ﬂow rates, which were altered through the opening and closing of a lock on the river [83,84] (figure 1, example 27)."
13,"the observed redistribution of ﬁsh based on the water ﬂow regime resulted in the southwest florida water management district changing their practices to release water from the lake more slowly rather than large pulse events, reducing physiological stress in bull sharks and sawﬁsh."
13,"at a much larger scale, tracking data for several seabird species, along with sea turtles, sharks, and marine mammals, showed that the original boundaries of two large-scale mpas, papahanaumokuakea and the paciﬁc remote islands marine national monuments, were not capturing the entire habitat of these species and were key components of the scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the expansion of these mpas [85–87]."
13,"in 2016, papahanaumokuakea was extended to 1.5 million km2, which is three times its original size, and the paciﬁc remote islands increased to 1.27 million km2, six times its original size (figure 1, example 28)."
13,figure 3.
13,tracking data driving the international conservation status of marine animals.
13,"in 2001, basking shark (cetorhinus maximus) (a) migration was studied for the ﬁrst time using pop-off satellite-linked archival transmitters (psat tags; b) (figure 1, example 25)."
13,"sharks were shown to be highly migratory, travelling thousands of kilometers in a few weeks, but at the same time remaining faithful to rich feeding areas on the continental shelf and shelf edges (c; redrawn from [74])."
13,"circular markers on tracks denote sharks tagged in 2001; diamonds, 2002."
13,this research informed a key re-interpretation of the basking shark catch declines seen worldwide during the 20th century by revealing that area-focused ﬁsheries could potentially overexploit a population.
13,"the uk government, through their department for environment, food, and rural affairs global wildlife division, incorporated the new results and interpretations into its 2002 proposal to attain listing of basking sharks on appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species of fauna and flora (cites)."
13,appendix ii requires that international trade of these species is monitored through a licensing system to ensure that trade can be sustained without detriment to wild populations.
13,"previous attempts to list the basking shark on cites had failed, including in the year 2000, prior to the tracking research being undertaken."
13,"however, in november 2002 at the cites conference of parties meeting in santiago, chile, the uk government-led proposal for basking shark appendix ii listing was passed, effective from february 2003."
13,this was a landmark for cites in that it addressed commercially exploited marine ﬁsh for the ﬁrst time.
13,further tracking data showed that basking sharks moved regularly across many national boundaries before coming back to ‘home’ areas [75].
13,this research underpinned the successful uk-led proposal in november 2005 to list basking sharks on appendix ii of the convention for the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (cms) (the bonn convention).
13,listing under the convention means that nation states with basking shark populations must work with adjacent member states to introduce strict legislation to prevent capture and landing of the shark.
13,"the listing of basking shark on cites and cms also played a key role in putting in place an outright ban on eu vessels catching, keeping on board, or landing basking sharks inside and outside european waters from 2007 (article 5.6, european commission regulation no."
13,41/2007) [76].
13,the research has contributed to the basking shark becoming one of the most protected species of shark.

14,"pathways for uptake of tracking data into policy and management are varied and often follow efforts to identify ‘important areas’ often a key step in the implementation of conservation policy from tracking data has been the objective identiﬁcation of key areas (e.g., high use by animals or where threats are high) by international conservation bodies."
14,"for example, the birdlife international database (http://seabirdtracking.org) has been used to identify marine important bird and biodiversity areas (ibas) worldwide [88,89]."
14,"these areas have been used to inform marine policy processes at national, regional, and global scales [89]."
14,"in europe, many ibas are now part of the network of sites designated as special protection areas under the birds directive [90]."
14,"since 2012, birdlife international has also been working in collaboration with the convention on biological diversity (cbd) in the process of describing ecologically or biologically signiﬁcant areas (ebsas) globally."
14,"to date, more than 600 marine ibas, mostly identiﬁed using tracking data, are included in ebsas."
14,"while the description of ebsas by the cbd is a technical exercise that has no direct management implications, the information generated during the ebsa process has been conveyed to the parties (i.e., countries), the united nations, and to regional and sectoral organizations with management competency in areas beyond national jurisdiction [91]."
14,"this can lead to uptake of that information and the development of conservation management measures, such as mpas and marine spatial planning."
14,"for example, tracking the year-round movements of streaked shearwaters (calonectris leucomelas) breeding in japan using leg-mounted geolocators [92] identiﬁed a key wintering area to the north of northern new guinea, which was approved as an ebsa in 2011 (cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/rwebsa-wspac-01/ofﬁcial/ rwebsa-wspac-01-sbstta-16-inf-06-en.pdf) and has now been selected as a priority area of conservation interest by the government of papua new guinea [93] (figure 1, example 29)."
14,"likewise in 2016, a new tool for the spatial conservation of marine mammals was launched by the international union for conservation of nature: important marine mammal areas (immas)."
14,"for example, presence of ﬁn whale feeding habitat has been identiﬁed as the ‘north west mediterranean sea, slope, and canyon system’ imma (figure 1, example 30)."
14,"a recent resolution (resolution 12.13 adopted in october 2017 by the 12th conference of parties to the cms [94]), made immas a formal part of the cms agreement mandate, asking countries to help with the identiﬁcation and implementation of immas and are depicted in figure i (refer to glossary and main text for deﬁnitions)."
