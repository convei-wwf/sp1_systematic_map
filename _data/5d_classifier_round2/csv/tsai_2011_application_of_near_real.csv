15,a schematic diagram of the near real-time image processing mechanism of formosat-2. by the wms release system and all data can be integrated in the 3d space information application near real-time and simulation platform.
15,the advantage of this system is that the automation processing of satellite images processing time is minimal and can be controlled.
15,"the five-band wide area imaging is a new image limitation, however, is that the processing unit is based acquisition function developed after the launch of on the scene and is only appropriate for applications in formosat-2, and to which the national space small areas and rapid images of disaster areas."
15,image organization has added a parallel processing mechanism processing can be divided into six time stages from the [3].
15,"this eliminated the overloading of the original initiation of image processing to image releasing, which system caused by the five-band wide range imaging, and comprises the total time required for processing and the processing time decreased to that of single band releasing satellite images (figure 17)."
15,the major imaging.
15,"products generated by the image processing processing time at the current stage includes the parallel system of formosat-2 at the 1a and the second stages processing of multiple-band images, orthophoto are sufficient for preliminary discrimination of the processing of accelerator hardware, and the release of disaster prevention and rescue procedures."
15,"however, image data by wms. additional orthophoto processing is required to obtain consider the kaohsiung flooding caused by further combined geographical information, such as typhoon fanapi in 2010 for example (figure 18), a near roads and boundaries between counties and cities, or for real-time formosat-2 image releasing exercise was 3d displays of overlaid elevation data in this platform conducted with multiband parallel and orthophoto system."
15,"the national space organization significantly processing hardware accelerators; the near real-time reduced the time required to generate orthophotos by image processing of 14 scenes located in the flooded introducing an orthophoto processing accelerator areas in kaohsiung was conducted after three-band wide hardware kit previously used by the u.s. military, and by area imaging."
15,the entire processing procedure met the controlling the automatic matching gears to address the goal of downloading images and delivering products need for human intervention.
15,"the time required to within 6 h, providing images to disaster prevention and generate an orthophoto was reduced from rescue units for identification and analysis in the shortest approximately 15 min to less than 1 min."
