1,the international mine action community is concerned with received in revised form the relief of this threat.
1,"the space assets for demining assistance (sada) undertaking is 21 june 2012 a set of activities that aim at developing new services to improve the socio-economic accepted 14 august 2012 impact of mine action activities, primarily focused on the release of land thought to be available online 28 november 2012 contaminated, a process described as land release."
1,sada was originally initiated by the keywords: international astronautical federation (iaf).
1,it has been implemented under the integrated applications integrated applications promotion (iap) program of the european space agency (esa).
1,"demining land release in mine action is the process whereby the demining community landmines identiﬁes, surveys and prioritizes suspected hazardous areas for more detailed inves- mine action earth observation tigation, which eventually results in the clearance of landmines and other explosives, gnss thereby releasing land to the local population."
1,"sada has a broad scope, covering activities, such as planning (risk and impact analysis, prioritization, and resource management), ﬁeld operations and reporting."
1,sada services are developed in two phases: feasibility studies followed by demonstration projects.
1,three parallel feasibility studies have been performed.
1,"they aimed at deﬁning an integrated set of space enabled services to support the land release process in mine action, and at analyzing their added value, viability and sustainability."
1,the needs of the mine action sector have been assessed and the potential contribution of space assets has been identiﬁed.
1,support services have been formulated.
1,"to test their ﬁeldability, proofs of concept involving mine action end users in various operational ﬁeld settings have been performed by each of the study teams."
1,the economic viability has also been assessed.
1,"whenever relevant and cost-effective, sada aims at integrating earth observation data, gnss navigation and satcom technologies with existing mine action tools and procedures, as well as with novel aerial survey technologies."
1,"such conformity with existing user processes, as well as available budgets and appropriateness of technology based solutions given the ﬁeld level operational setting are important conditions for success."

2,"/ acta astronautica 83 (2013) 239–259 solutions and in some cases, satellite communication, indeed can provide added value to mine action activities if properly tailored based on close user interaction and provided through a suitable channel."
2,"such added value for example includes easy and sustained access to earth observation data for general purpose mapping, land use assessment for post-release progress reporting, and multi-source data fusion algorithms to help quantify risks and socio-economic impact for prioritization and planning purposes."
2,the environment and boundaries of a hazardous area can also be better speciﬁed to support the land release process including detailed survey and clearance operations.
2,"satellite communication can help to provide relevant data to remote locations, but is not regarded as strongly user driven."
2,"finally, satellite navigation can support more precise non-technical surveys, as well as aerial observation with small planes or hand-launched uav’s."
2,"to ensure the activity is genuinely user driven, the geneva international center for humanitarian demining (gichd) plays an important role as esa’s external advisor."
2,"esa is furthermore supported by a representative ﬁeld operator, the swiss foundation of mine action (fsd), providing esa with a direct connection to the ﬁeld level end users."
2,speciﬁcally fsd has provided a shared user needs baseline to the three study teams.
2,"to ensure solutions meet with end user requirements, the study teams themselves include mine action representatives and have interacted closely with their pre-existing and newly established contacts within the mine action community."
