1,"the data used in this paper was collected through administration of 101 questionnaires to public servants in town planning, architecture, estate management and surveying in five local governments in ibadan metropolitan area and at the oyo state government secretariat between august and october, 2015."
1,"frequencies, descriptive and inferential statistics which include kolmogorov-smirnov test, chi- square test and correlation methods were used to analyze the data."
1,results indicated that majority of public servants in the selected professions were computer literate and had interest in gis/remote sensing techniques and technologies.
1,they were aware of the benefits than the costs of gis/remote sensing techniques and technologies.
1,"lack of time, inadequate finances, and lack of permission from the place of work were the three top constraints in building their gis/remote sensing knowledge."
1,"the use of gis/remote sensing applications was constrained by financial problems, followed by power supply (electricity) problem, lack of knowledge about gis/remote sensing applications, lack of incentives/motivation, and technical nature of the applications."
1,"key words: public servant, geographical information systems (gis), remote sensing, human capacity building, nigeria 1."
1,"introduction scholarly literature shows that the areas in which gis and remote sensing are applied are widespread (heywood et al, 2006; esri, 2006; dangermond, 2011; coetzee et al., 2013; mhangara and odindi, 2013; inggs, 2014; woldai, 2014; olwoch, 2014; keita, 2014; murwira, 2014, bamutaze, 2014; ademola, 2015): land use management, management of traffic, crime control, flood control, fire hazard control, hazardous materials, storm control, urban planning and management, tourism development and management, business and marketing analysis, etc."
1,"consequently in various african countries, there are efforts to adopt the use of gis and remote sensing."
1,"in nigeria, the federal government took a bold decision in 2003 to embark on complete computerization of the cadastral and land registry of the federal capital territory (fct) – abuja."
1,this decision led to the establishment of an agency known as abuja geographic information systems (agis).
1,some state governments are also trying to do the same.
1,a number of government parastatals are also introducing 31

2,"in 1999, federal government established the national space research and development agency (narsda) to pursue the development and application of space science and technology for the socio-economic benefits of the nation."
2,in addition six centres were created to act as the operational limbs of the national space research and development agency (narsda).
2,"also in nigeria, there are some private firms and government institutions offering consultancy and training in gis and remote sensing (asiyanbola, 2014; akingbade and keita, 2016)."
2,"in recent time, there have been an increasing number of researchers and publications on remote sensing in nigeria (asiyanbola, 2014)."
2,"studies in other african countries such as south africa indicate that geographical information science (gisc) is widely included in south african tertiary degree programmes related to the environmental balance dimension of sustainable development (coetzee et al., 2013)."
2,"nevertheless, there has not been full adoption, implementation and use of remote sensing/gis in nigeria (asiyanbola and adeoye, 2013; fabiyi, 2001)."
2,"according to campbell and masser (1995) diffusion is an umbrella concept which has elements including awareness, adoption, and utilization."
2,"awareness mean ‘’knowing something’’, ‘’noticing or realizing something’’, or ‘’knowledgeable about something’’."
2,"adoption mean “choose and decide to use something’’, while utilization mean ‘’make use of something’’."
2,the difference between adoption and utilization is shown in the argument of campbell and masser (1995) that the purchase of innovation is no guarantee that the equipment that has been acquired will actually be utilized.
2,"as observed in the literature (heywood et al., 2006), successful application of large-scale geospatial technology projects such as gis/remote sensing, depends not only on technical aspects, but also on human and organizational factors relating to the implementation and management of systems."
2,"this according to heywood et al., (2006) has been recognized since the 1970s (tomlinson et al., 1976) and there has been considerable research into the human and organizational factors that may impede the implementation of gis (department of the environment, 1987; onsrud and pinto, 1991; medyckyj-scott and hearnshaw, 1994; campbell and masser, 1995; hernandez et al., 1999)."
2,as revealed in the literature propensity of individuals or organizations to adopt a particular technology is important for successful application.
2,"in fact the literature reveals that personal, organizational and even cultural interests are important in successful adoption of gis/remote sensing technology (campbell and masser, 1995; kurwakumire, 2014)."
2,"kurwakumire (2014) in his discussion on social constructivist perspective of technology notes that, to understand the technology, it is important to identify relevant social groups or social actors who interact with the technology."
2,he proposed a benefit oriented approach to gis evaluation which is a mechanism for measuring the success derived from implementing gis.
2,"in his study he observed that gis develops from grass-root, intermediate, mature to integrated systems."
2,for gis/remote sensing to migrate to full development stage there is the need to assess the human issues associated with the gis/remote sensing technologies adoption and utilization with a view to enhancing human capital development in geospatial technologies.
2,this study examines empirically some of the human issues associated with the gis/remote sensing in nigeria.
2,study that examines human issues associated with the gis/remote sensing is rare in nigeria.

11,"as observed in the literature successful technology-led innovation depends not only on proper organizational/management support and infrastructure but also on culture, that is, propensity of individuals to adopt a particular technology (campbell and masser, 1995; heywood et al., 2006)."
11,"kurwakumire (2014) in his study observed that gis develops from grass-root, intermediate, mature to integrated systems."
11,"presently, there has not been full development of gis/remote sensing in nigeria."
11,for gis/remote sensing to migrate to full development stage there is the need for development of human capital in geospatial technologies.
11,"originating from the findings of this study and in order to enhance human capacity development in geospatial technologies, there is the need for implementing policies that will increase the propensity of public servants’ use of gis/remote sensing."
11,there is the need for government to provide stimulating and enabling environment that will encourage increase interest in gis/remote sensing in nigeria in general.
11,such expected actions include provision of financial support for the public servants for training and retraining programmes in gis/remote sensing.
11,there is also the need for the provision of necessary facilities and equipment that will increase the use of gis/remote sensing technologies.
