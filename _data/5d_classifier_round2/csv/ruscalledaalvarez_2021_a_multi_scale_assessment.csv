1,"fire management is increasingly acknowledged as a necessary tool to maintain diversity in desert environments such as the great victoria desert of australia, but it needs to be informed by accurate fire history data."
1,"we compared and assessed the utility of landsat-derived and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (modis)- derived burnt area mapping (30 m and 250 m resolution, respectively) for sub-regional, landscape and habitat scale management."
1,"we did so by using sentinel-2-derived, 10 m resolution, burnt area mapping as a reference, to determine the most appropriate product to support land management planning."
1,"at the landscape scale, landsat had significantly lower average omission and commission errors (3.4% and 8.0%, respectively) compared with that of modis (42.2% and 19.9%, respectively)."
1,"at the habitat scale, landsat burnt area percentage was more accurate, in plots of 500 m  500 m (root mean square error (rmse) 0.6% to 8.6%), but offered lower accuracy when estimating partially burnt habitat plots of 120 m  120 m (rmse 14.1% to 23.9%)."
1,"only landsat-derived fire scar mapping provided enough detail to produce reliable fire history maps to inform fire management and biodiversity conservation operations at a sub-regional scale, landscape scale and a habitat scale of 500 m by 500 m."

6,"differences between landsat suffered a reduction in nir reflectance when these are actually and modis accuracies are tested for significance through a t-test unburnt areas (e.g. ephemeral water bodies, fig. 7b)."

8,"although sentinel-2-based over- or under-estimated by more than 10 years could have sig- datasets offer a higher resolution option (and implicitly nificant negative implications in terms of survey planning and higher accuracy) for smaller areas, managers need to factor in field operations and, ultimately, conservation outcomes."
8,our the higher time and therefore cost associated with processing results at the plot scale indicate that fire history can be predicted the data.
