2,"this study applies and demonstrates the utility of the remote sensing communication model (rscm) to improve a tactical wild- ﬁre remote-sensing system to better meet the time-sensitive infor- mation requirements of emergency response managers in san diego county, usa."
2,a thermal infrared airborne remote-sensing system designed and operated by the united states forest service paciﬁc southwest research station for active wildﬁre monitoring is documented and updated based on the rscm.
2,analysis of the thermal infrared remote-sensing system in the context of the rscm identiﬁed three conﬁguration changes that can improve the eﬀectiveness of the information produced when employed by wildﬁre incident commanders for suppression prioritization: (1) limit spectral sampling collection to a single waveband; (2) complete image processing steps on-board the aircraft; and (3) provide information on wildﬁre locations to incident commanders in the form of a static map.
2,introduction remote sensing holds signiﬁcant promise to address the time-sensitive information requirements of hazard response managers (joyce et al.
2,2009; brucewicz 2003; ceos 2005).
2,"the use of remote sensing to address time-sensitive information requirements, however, requires that acquisition, transmission, processing, and product dissemination methods be optimized to take place within time frames that permit response to the observed phenomenon (bernsdorf et al."
2,"2010; lippitt, stow, and clarke 2014a; stow et al."
2,2015).
2,"given that research into the eﬀective use of giscience to inform hazard response has shown that all data sources, transmission channels, and processing ﬂows must be determined a priori for hazard response managers to adopt the technology (cutter 2003; contact christopher d."

3,"international journal of remote sensing 3273 brucewicz 2003), remote-sensing methods appropriate to time-sensitive information requirements must be optimized a priori."
3,"the remote sensing communication model (rscm) provides a framework for the design and optimization of remote-sensing systems (rsss) that maximize the eﬀective- ness of information they produce with respect to a given user (lippitt, stow, and clarke 2014a)."
3,it also provides a tool (i.e. capacity) for estimating the consequences of changes in rss conﬁguration on the timeliness of information delivery to a user.
3,"here, the rscm is applied to evaluate and recommend reﬁnements for some uses of an extant wildﬁre rss operated by the united states forest service (usfs)."
3,"the usfs-operated fire imaging system (fis) is described, evaluated based on the rscm, updated based on evaluation results, and then original and updated fis information timeliness estimates are compared to meet the two objectives of this study: (1) to assess the utility of the rscm for the optimization of the fis to meet the time-sensitive information require- ments of wildﬁre response managers in southern california and (2) to identify conﬁg- urations of the fis that better meet some of the information requirements of wildﬁre response managers."
3,the remote sensing communication model the rscm is a conceptual model useful for relating remote-sensing methods and tools to the decision contexts in which they are employed and for the design of time-sensitive rsss.
3,"it employs the metaphor of a communication system relaying information to conceptualize the collection of hardware, software, and people required to acquire, transmit, analyse, and employ remote-sensing data as fundamentally a system for the relay of information, where that information produces a varied eﬀect depending on its and its employer’s nature."
3,it draws on shannon’s (1948) mathematical model of com- munication and the concept of information eﬀectiveness proposed by shannon and weaver (1963) to relate rss conﬁguration to decision quality.
3,"the rscm considers remote sensing a communication system where the reality of scene conditions and states is the information source, the sensor is the transmitter, data transmission and distribution systems the channel, the analyst the interpreter, and the user the destination, as illustrated in figure 1."
3,"the sensor samples and encodes reality, the channel transmits that encoded reality to an analyst, and the analyst interprets what the sensor has encoded and passes it to a user."
3,"based on the three levels of communication identiﬁed by shannon and weaver (1963) to determine the eﬀectiveness of information, the rscm dictates that to max- imize the value of information produced by a rss, the data delivered to an analyst must accurately characterize the phenomena of interest (a), the analyst must properly inter- pret those data into information that is relevant to the user (b), and the information must produce an eﬀect when delivered to the user (c)."
3,"through the concept of information travelling over a channel, where that channel has a given capacity in volume per unit time, rscm highlights the eﬀect of various rss parameters on information timeliness."
3,"the rscm considers transmitters (sensors), chan- nels (i.e. transmission and distribution systems), and receivers (i.e. analysts) to all have a capacity that, in aggregate, determine the capacity of the system (lippitt and stow 2015b)."

4,the remote sensing communication model.
4,"information ﬂows from reality to a user through the remote-sensing system, where the properties of that user and the decisions they intend to inform determine the optimal conﬁguration of the remote-sensing system."
4,"remote sensing of hazards disaster management is typically conceptualized as a cycle with four phases: (1) reduc- tion, (2) readiness, (3) response, and (4) recovery, in all of which gis and remote sensing can play a signiﬁcant role (cutter 2003)."
4,"while it is easy to see the potential beneﬁts of access to remote-sensing-derived information in all phases of disaster management, the response phase presents a unique challenge to the remote-sensing community; infor- mation in the response phase is always time-sensitive."
4,the adoption of remote-sensing techniques to address information requirements in the time-sensitive response phase has therefore been slow when compared to other phases (joyce et al.
4,2009; ceos 2005; alexander 2002).
4,programmes to provide information in support of the response phase are increasing in number (joyce et al.
4,2009; ceos 2005).
4,"the founding of several programmes seeking to better enable the use of remote sensing for hazard response, such as sentinal asia (kaku et al. 2006) and the international space charter (stryker and jones 2009), make evident the growing importance of remote sensing as a hazard response tool."
4,see joyce et al. (2009) and gillespie et al. (2007) for a thorough review of remote sensing of natural hazards.
4,the most common hazard response remote-sensing application is wildﬁre detection (ambrosia et al.
4,"1998; galindo, lopez-perez, and evangelista-salazar 2003; visser and dawood 2004; laneve, castronuovo, and cadau 2006; davies et al."
4,2009).
4,remote sensing of wildﬁre satellite-based wildﬁre occurrence monitoring has matured to provide a sophisticated suite of information products to managers and continues to improve in terms of the size
5,"international journal of remote sensing 3275 ﬁres that can be detected and the frequency of observation (schroeder et al. 2014), but remote sensing for tactical wildﬁre response remains a challenge."
5,"tactical remote sensing of wildﬁre was demonstrated by the wildfire programme (ambrosia et al. 1998), which developed a rss that transmitted data from the airborne infrared disaster assessment system (airdas) thermal line scanner to a portable incident command centre nearby via cell phone modem."
5,maps of the controlled burn were produced at the portable command centre and made available within 20 min of acquisition.
5,"building on wildfire, the first response experiment (fire) again demonstrated tactical wildﬁre imaging with the airdas thermal line scanner, but from the altus ii unmanned aerial system (uas) platform (ambrosia et al."
5,2003).
5,"autonomous sensor control, on-board orthorectiﬁcation, and an integrated ground-satellite communication system enabled delivery of orthorectiﬁed image products within 10 min."
5,"building on the developments of fire, the western states fire mission (merlin 2009) deployed a modiﬁed modis simulator known as the autonomous modular scanner (ams) on board a modiﬁed predator a, known as ikhana."
5,the mission demonstrated operational tactical wildﬁre mapping over series of ﬁres in the western united states and consistently delivered orthorectiﬁed thermal image data to incident commanders (ic) in less than 10 min.
5,"these programmes demonstrate the potential use of remote sensing to address tactical wildﬁre response information requirements, but they are all experimental in nature."
5,"there are, however, operational tactical ﬁre mapping programmes, the two most well tested of which are the united states forest service (usfs) national infrared operations program (nirops, nirops 2015b) and the fis (fm, riggan and hoﬀman 2003; riggan, tissell, and hoﬀman 2003) operated by the usfs paciﬁc southwest research station (psw)."
5,"nirops is a long-standing thermal imaging programme that began at project fire scan in the 1960s (nirops 2015a) while fis began operations in 2001 (riggan, tissell, and hoﬀman 2003)."
5,nirops primarily images at night during periods of relatively low ﬁre activity to provide updated ﬁre perimeters to ﬁreﬁghters at their morning brieﬁng.
5,fis operates at all times of day and is the focus of this study.
5,"the united states forest service ﬁre imaging system the usfs-psw operates the fis to map active wildﬁre and wildﬁre-related properties such as vegetation density, burn severity, and structure damage."
5,"the conﬁguration of the system when assessed in this study consisted of a king air ﬁxed-wing, twin propeller aircraft equipped with computing hardware, a northrop-grumman ln100gt inertial navigation system, and thermal infrared and multispectral imaging sensors."
5,"while the various imaging sensors on board (see table 1 for a detailed description of the sensors) are useful for the variety of tasks conducted with the system, it is the thermal infrared imaging sensor, firemapper 2.0®, that is primarily used to map intensity, spread, and extent of active wildﬁres."
5,"fis is, among other activities, used to support the prioritization and allocation of ﬁreﬁghters and equipment by leveraging its ability to provide informa- tion on wildﬁre intensity and extent to wildﬁre ics in time scales appropriate to support tactical wildﬁre suppression prioritization."
5,"while fis is operated for a variety of wildﬁre remote-sensing tasks, the rscm requires identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc user or class of user in order to assess the eﬀectiveness of a given rss to inform that user’s decision."
5,analysis of the fis is therefore limited to its use for monitoring of active wildﬁre for tactical

7,"when deployed in tactical wildﬁre mapping mode, fis is tasked by wildﬁre ics."
7,"typical deployments consist of the standard operating procedure (sop) and estimated operation times depicted in table 2, according to fis operators (p."
7,"riggan, personal communication, may 12, 2011; san diego, ca)."
7,note that only steps 1–8 are completed for tactical ﬁre response while steps 9–12 are typically conducted for applications out- side of suppression prioritization.
7,"the decision context information from fis has been used to make decisions about where to deploy ﬁre- ﬁghters and airborne ﬁre retardant tankers, where to light backﬁres, and who should be evacuated."
7,"decisions made using this information aﬀect the safety of citizens and property (eg&g technical services 2008) and, as recent events have demonstrated (karels and dudley 2013), ﬁreﬁghters."
7,"those critical decisions require a range of informa- tion; at a minimum, information on terrain, infrastructure, resources available, and wild- ﬁre location."
7,wildﬁre extent information derived from fis is used by ics in conjunction with these and other ancillary information sources to allocate resources.
7,resources are reallocated as often as is required.
7,"when asked how quickly they need information on wildﬁre progression, ics will always answer with some variant of ‘yester- day’, but major strategy decisions typically take place during brieﬁngs held every 6 or 12 h as personnel change shifts."
7,"during these brieﬁngs, maps play a critical role in both the strategic allocation of resources and in the relay of orders to subordinates (alexander 2002)."
7,"absent the data from fis, the primary source of wildﬁre location information available to ics at these brieﬁng sessions is typically a wildﬁre perimeter line."
7,"wildﬁre perimeter lines are derived from a range of sources, typically including visual estimation of the wildﬁre boundary, global positioning system (gps) equipped"

8,the user the primary decision-maker that fis serves is the ic of the wildﬁre being mapped.
8,"typically from calfire or the usfs in the case of california, ics are experienced ﬁre- ﬁghters who are specially trained to manage the range of ﬁreﬁghting assets at their disposal to protect life and property."
8,this often but not always means extinguishing the wildﬁre to which they are assigned.
8,ics are deployed to and responsible for a single wildﬁre.
8,"for the duration of that wildﬁre ics are in the ﬁeld, which typically means a remote area with limited connectivity and computing resources."
8,"in some instances, mobile command centres with satellite broadband connectivity and computing resources are available."
8,"geographic information system (gis) and image processing capacity is beginning to be available to ics, but expertise and availability are variable; the paper map remains the preferred medium of display for many ics (r."
8,"serabia, personal communication, june 29, 2009; ramona, ca)."
8,"fis as a communication system the fis can be analysed in terms of how well it addresses problems associated with the three levels of communication identiﬁed by the rscm (i.e. eﬀectiveness analysis): (1) the technical problem of communicating appropriate data, (2) the semantic problem of interpreting those data into appropriate information, and (3) the eﬀectiveness problem of employing that information to produce an eﬀect of value."
8,an evaluation of how well fis addresses these three problems is intended to identify portions of the fis conﬁg- uration that are not optimized to address the information requirements of ics and suggest alternative conﬁgurations that better meet those requirements.
8,the timeliness of fis is estimated using rscm capacity analysis under both current and proposed conﬁgurations to determine the eﬀect of proposed conﬁguration changes on informa- tion timeliness (lippitt and stow 2015a).
8,2.2.1.
8,"the technical problem the rscm describes the technical problem (level a) as the problem of acquiring, transmitting, storing, and distributing remote-sensing data of appropriate spectral, spatial, radiometric, and temporal resolution and of suﬃcient ﬁdelity to address a given information requirement (lippitt, stow, and clarke 2014a)."
8,"to optimize level a, sensors at appropriate wavelengths must sample the land surface at suitable spatial and radiometric detail and at an appropriate point in time over a suﬃcient extent, and data must be delivered to the analyst with a minimal level of compression related noise or errors."
8,"the technical capacity of the fis programme to acquire, transmit, and distribute remote-sensing data has been demonstrated through extensive ﬁeld campaigns."
8,the firemapper ii® sensor (fm) records wavebands appropriate for the detection and inten- sity measurement of both active wildﬁre fronts (i.e.
8,ir3) and cooler smouldering ﬁres (i.e.
8,"a focal length of 26.4 mm results in a nominal ground sampling resolution of 8.75 m from the fis standard operating ﬂight altitude above ground (agl) of 5000 m,"
9,international journal of remote sensing 3279 which can be reﬁned to 2.6 m nominal ground sampling distance by reducing agl to 1500 m.
9,"image data are recorded at 16-bit radiometric resolution, which is suﬃcient to diﬀerentiate wildﬁre occurrence and intensity (riggan, hoﬀman, and brass 2009)."
9,"as an airborne asset, fis has the ability to image areas on time scales limited only by the ﬂight speed of the aircraft (cruise airspeed = about 472 km h−1, or 255 kn) relative to wind speed and swath width of the sensor."
9,"processing and transmitting those data, however, limits the rate at which image data or other information products can be provided to ics."
9,"in the case of deploying fis to provide wildﬁre location information for tactical suppression decision support on a six-hour (360 min) brieﬁng cycle, the time- liness of information delivery is the primary constraint on the utility of fis produced information to ics."
9,"this suggests that rss conﬁguration changes that reduce the time required to transmit fis acquired information to analysts, currently estimated to require 75–420 min, will better address the technical problem."
9,2.2.2.
9,"the semantic problem the rscm describes the semantic problem (level b) as the problem of interpreting the received data into information of an appropriate type, reliability, and timeliness to meet the information requirements of a given user."
9,"to optimize level b, data must be interpreted or processed in such a manner that information that is relevant to the user is produced."
9,"for fis, addressing the semantic problem requires that the data collected be interpreted by the receiver into information appropriate for the prioritiza- tion of suppression activities by ics."
9,"in the fis rss, the receiver is a system of people, computers, and algorithms that complete steps 3–5, 7, and optionally steps 9 and 11 of the sop described in table 2."
9,"the information produced by steps 3–5 and 7 of the sop are all of suﬃcient spatial and thematic reliability to allow ics to allocate resources, though steps 9 and 11 improve the thematic and spatial reliability, respectively."
9,"the type of information produced (i.e. apparent kinetic temperature estimates) provides ics with detailed information on wildﬁre extent, intensity, and progression."
9,"the timeliness with which the data are interpreted into information and the multiple transmissions (i.e. extended channel) that are required mean that from the time data capture is complete, 130–720 min are required to present information to ics."
9,"given a 6 h (360 min) brieﬁng cycle and preference for information as quickly as possible, there is potential that the information will not reach ics within the required time period; suggesting that the timeliness of analyst portions of the rss should be targeted for improvement to better address the semantic problem."
9,the single most time consuming analysis step of the fis sop is not analysis at all but rather the transfer of data between various portions of the analysis sequence.
9,the transfer of data from a local airport nearby an incident to an oﬀ-site analyst (i.e.
9,sop step 5) requires 60–360 min.
9,"to deliver the ﬁrst viable information product to ics, the analyst uses a custom script within a legacy image processing package to project apparent kinetic temperature estimates to ground coordinates and mosaics the resultant projected frames (sop step 7)."
9,that mosaic is then uploaded to a publically available web site for viewing or download by ics.
9,"to eliminate step 6, step 7 can be conducted on board the aircraft."
9,using a software utility that permits projective orthocorrection of image frames on low-resource computers like a laptop (e.g.
9,fraley 2011) will eliminate
10,3280 c.
10,lippitt et al. the need for redundant data transfer.
10,software can also readily automate the correlation of image frames and inertial navigation system (ins) records (step 5).
10,"elimination of step 6 and optimization of steps 5 and 7 hold potential to improve the timeliness of information to ics without changing the type or reliability of that information and, therefore, better address the semantic problem."
10,2.2.3.
10,"the eﬀectiveness problem the rscm describes the eﬀectiveness problem (level c) as the problem of providing information to a user that enables a decision-maker, whether human or machine, to make a decision that produces an eﬀect of value."
10,"to produce an eﬀect of value, the decision-maker (i.e. user) must be able to readily ingest and understand the information presented, which requires consideration of the decision-maker’s properties."
10,"for the fis to produce information that maximizes the eﬀectiveness of decisions prioritizing resources for the suppression of wildﬁre, the information presented to ics must be readily ingestible, understood, and related to other key information sources."
10,"the proper- ties of a given information product that might inﬂuence the ability of a decision-maker to ingest information are numerous, but in the case of wildﬁre ics in california, there are some well-understood needs owing to an established sop."
10,"currently, fis supplies information to ics by making available web viewable map products and downloadable gis ready temperature products."
10,"these oﬀer several advan- tages: ease of use, ﬂexibility, and straightforward production."
10,"assuming that there are appropriate analyst, computing, and connectivity resources available, the current deliv- ery mechanism provides the required information in a highly ﬂexible format that can be adapted to the needs of ics."
10,"the availability of analyst, computing, and connectivity resources to ics in the ﬁeld is highly variable, however."
10,"in particular, connectivity can be a challenge in the remote locations in which wildﬁres often occur."
10,"given this, the variable proﬁciency of ics with digital mapping technologies, and general reliance on paper and other static map media, the optimal format to provide information on wildﬁre presence is in the form of a static map, either paper or ﬁle (ambrosia et al."
10,1998).
10,"since a static map does not easily integrate with other critical information (e.g. elevation, slope, critical infrastructure, roads), wildﬁre presence information must be integrated with appropriate ancillary information prior to delivery."
10,the standard operat- ing procedure of ics points to a ready solution in this case also; ics in california regularly use maps produced under the thomas series by rand mcnally (san diego county 2010) (r.
10,"serabia, personal communication, june 29, 2009; ramona, ca)."
10,"these maps, known more commonly as ‘thomas brothers maps’, provide detailed elevation contours, road- ways, and location information."
10,"integration of wildﬁre temperature information with thomas brother’s maps, or similarly formatted maps with similar information, allows ready ingestion of wildﬁre presence information by ics and should, subsequently, improve the eﬀectiveness of resource allocation decisions made by ics."
10,figure 2 shows an example of one such map.
10,"system capacity the timeliness of the fis can be estimated based on the capacity of the sensor, transmission system, and receiver."
10,"we can estimate the sensor, channel, and receiver"

11,"to explore the net eﬀect of various possible fis conﬁgurations, system capacity is estimated for sop steps 2–8 under current fis conﬁguration and alternate conﬁgurations suggested by the eﬀectiveness analysis above."
11,"to explore the bounds of possible missions, the capacity of the fis is estimated for two contrived wildﬁres: a 809 ha (2000 acre) ﬁre and a 121,406 ha (300,000 acre) ﬁre."
11,the ﬁrst is intended to simulate smaller more typical wildﬁres in southern california while the second is intended to simulate larger more catastrophic wildﬁres like the cedar fire of 2003 (eg&g technical services 2008).
11,"the time required to deploy to a wildﬁre from lancaster, ca (td) will have a linear eﬀect on the time requires to image a scene (tacq), but given that the aircraft can also operate from other airports closer to the ﬁre, we hold"

12,"td constant at 12.71 min, or the time required to travel 100 km, as an estimate of the distance from a given wildﬁre to a nearby staging airport."
12,2.3.1.
12,"sensor capacity the fis employs a king air a100 aircraft; a dual engine, pressurized cabin, ﬁxed wing aircraft with a maximum operating altitude of 10,700 m and max cruise speed of about 472 km h−1."
12,"while there are a series of sensors operated on fis, thermal infrared data from the fm sensor are prioritized when deployed in the context of tactical suppression decision support."
12,the cruise speed and altitude of the aircraft interact with the camera model of the fm sensor to determine the sensor capacity (cacq) in bits per unit time: cacq ¼ βba ; (1) where β is the rate of acquisition in area per unit time assuming no end lap or side lap and ba is the number of bits per unit ground area.
12,"acquisition time (tacq) can then be estimated by bs tacq ¼ þ td þ tm ðn  1þ; (2) cacq where bs is the number of bits required to image a scene, td is the time required to deploy the sensor to the scene, and tm is the time required to manoeuvre the platform between ﬂight lines or paths, and n is the number of ﬂight lines or paths required to image the scene."

12,"with typical total redundancy of 68% and all three channels (ir2–4) captured (i.e. conﬁgurations 1–4), sensor capacity (cacq) can be calculated as 203,265 bits s−1 with an acquisition rate (β) of 324,218 m2 s−1."

12,"adjusting the sensor conﬁguration to acquire only ir4 results in unreliable kinetic temperature estimates for hot ﬁres because of saturation, but still allows accurate retrieval of active ﬁre location for both cool and hot ﬁres."
12,"limiting acquisition to only the ir4 channel (i.e. conﬁgurations 1 s–4s), sensor capacity is reduced (cacq = 67,755), while the time required to image (tacq) the example 809 and 121,406 ha scenes remains the same."

14,"for automated receivers, receiver capacity"
15,international journal of remote sensing 3285 (creca) is estimated based on the complexity of the algorithms employed.
15,"‘big o’ notation can be used to describe the complexity of algorithms in terms of the upper bound of the computation ‘work’ required, and subsequently estimate the maximum number of computational cycles per record (ϕ) required to process a given data set using those algorithms (burger and burge 2008)."
15,"adding two bands, for example, can be described as having a linear complexity, or o(n), meaning the number of computations required is linearly related to data volume."
15,"the single operation of addition must be performed rc times, where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns, such that ϕ increases linearly with the number of records input."
15,"in remote sensing, the number of records is a function of the number samples collected, ps, so adding two bands can also be said to have complexity of o(ps), or more simply stated, ps."
15,conversion of raw data to image formats and conversion from thermal radiance to apparent kinetic temperature estimates are both automated procedures.
15,conversion of raw data to image formats is a simple conversion that requires query of each pixel once.
15,"estimation of apparent temperature requires relating each pixel to its associated black body calibration value by regression, which requires query of all pixels in the image once and all pixels in the black body calibration image once."
15,the algorithm complexity for steps 3 and 4 can therefore be estimated as ps and collectively 3ps.
15,the correlation of image data to ins data is conducted by brute force matching after initial data organization.

15,the correlation of image data to the appropriate ins record requires a query of all gps time ﬁeld entries once for each image frame time stamp.

15,the total number of ins records (rins) can be estimated by rins ¼ hins ta ; (5) where hins is the sampling rate of the ins in hertz.

15,"under the current sop, direct projection of image data to ground coordinates based on the sensor model and orientation (i.e."
15,"sop step 7) requires several steps from an algorithmic perspective: (1) initial data reformatting for import into a legacy image processing software, (2) projection of image coordinates to a surface described by a digital elevation model, (3) resampling of kinetic temperature values to the new projected grid, and (4) mosaicking of the resultant images into a single product."

16,"projection of image coordinates is completed by projecting the location of each pixel to a digital elevation model and requires query of each pixel, p, and its corresponding value in the digital elevation model once."
16,the complexity of projection can be estimated to be ps log2 ps.
16,nearest neighbour resampling of projected images requires query of each pixel and its nearest neighbour in the unprojected image as deﬁned by the projective camera model and can be estimated to have a complexity of ps.
16,"mosaicking with a ‘most nadir’ rule requires calculation of angle for each sample, followed by a sorting to determine the sample of lowest angle, followed by population of a new grid encompassing the scene, and can be considered to have a complexity of ps2."
16,"to deﬁne the upper bound of complexity for the fis receiver conﬁguration outlined here, complexities are aggregated to the most complex weighting, ps2."
16,"if we consider the problem as the upper bound of all complexities, the computational cycles per record (ϕ) can be estimated as ðps þ rins þ fs þ2 ¼ : (7) ps þ rins þ fs for the estimated 532,797 records (ps) required to image an 809 ha scene at 8.75 m ground sampling distance with ir2–4 (i.e. system conﬁguration 1), ϕ is estimated as 532,953 cycles per record."

16,imaging a 809 ha scene at 2.62 m ground sampling distance with ir2–4 (i.e. system conﬁguration 3) requires 5.94 million records (ps) and receiver time (trec) is estimated to be ≤6.62 h including the 5 min required for the sensor operator to organize ins and image time stamps.
16,"for the approximately 297.13 million pixels (ps) required to image a 121,406 ha scene with ir2–4 (i.e. system conﬁguration 4), total receiver time is estimated to be ≤981,212.76 h, or 16,353.55 days."
16,"when only ir4 is utilized (i.e. conﬁgurations 1scr–4scr), the number of records (ps) is reduced signiﬁcantly, resulting in increased receiver capacities (creca) and therefore reduced receiver time (trec)."
16,see table 2 for details.
16,"assuming that ancillary data for the scene are compiled in advance of the imaging mission, integration of the kinetic temperature mosaic into a map product that approx- imates thomas brother’s maps requires that the analyst open the required data sets in an appropriate gis or mapping software and output the resultant product into a printable document format, such as the portable document format ®adobe."

17,it also reveals that information is provided in a format that is not readily ingested by some ics.
17,"to modify the fis to better meet the timeliness require- ments imposed by a six-hour brieﬁng cycle and provide information that is readily ingested by all ics, changes to the fis sensor, channel, and receiver are proposed and the impact of the proposed changes on fis timeliness is estimated in table 4."

18,"lippitt et al. temperature estimates to a map, however, requires an estimated 20 min to complete, and therefore increases receiver time (trec) proportionally."
18,see tables 3 and 4 for details.
18,"given that the time savings introduced by updating the fis sensor conﬁguration to only acquire ir4 and that doing so still allows fis to produce suﬃciently reliable information on the location of active wildﬁre, acquiring only ir4 is recommended when imaging in support of suppression prioritization."
18,"as ics identify ways to take advantage of the more detailed temperature information permitted by acquiring ir3 and ir4 and transmission rates increase with technological innovation, however, this recommendation is likely to change."
18,"similarly, given the reduction in transmission time (tchan) and no change in information reliability oﬀered by the proposed changes to fis channel conﬁguration, it is recommended that sop step 6 be eliminated by conducting image processing steps on board the aircraft."
18,"given the widespread reliance on paper map products by ics, it also recommended that the current receiver conﬁguration be amended to allow the integration of the fis produced information into a static medium map with appropriate ancillary information (e.g. roads, terrain, structures)."
18,"production of a map product does necessitate additional receiver time, but also ensures that the information produced can be eﬀectively employed by all ics, even in limited connectiv- ity or computing resource environments."
18,discussion and conclusions the rscm provides a useful framework for identifying portions of the fis that should be targeted for optimization or reconﬁguration.
18,"analysis of a rss such as the fis, in terms of how well it addresses the three problems of eﬀective communication (i.e. eﬀectiveness analysis) clariﬁes the dependencies between technical conﬁguration, analysis proce- dures, and the needs of the user for which the information is intended."
18,"coupled with the ability to test assumptions about the impact of proposed changes on the timeliness of information delivery, the rscm provides an eﬀective framework in which to consider the design of rss for time-sensitive applications."
18,"while the fis for active wildﬁre monitoring is the case study presented here, there is no reason to suggest that the rscm will not adapt readily to the evaluation or design of any tsrss with a clearly deﬁnable user and decision context."
18,"the ability to readily model a matrix of rss conﬁguration options on information timeless is useful for the design of tsrsss a priori, but also holds potential to enable on-the-ﬂy re-conﬁguration of tsrsss to satisfy unanticipated information requirements or, perhaps more importantly, to enable design of ﬂexible tsrsss using networks of sensors, channels, and receivers."
18,a key limitation of the rscm is that it does not make explicit the eﬀect of various rss conﬁgurations on the reliability or type information produced.
18,"it does make clear that information type, reliability, and timeliness must be considered when conﬁguring an rss to meet the information requirements of a given user (lippitt, stow, and clarke 2014b), but limits the quantitative estimation of rss conﬁguration impacts to timeliness."
18,"in the case of fis, the reliability of information produced from the fm sensor is well under- stood, which enabled ready estimation of the impact of proposed changes (i.e. change from ir1–3 to ir4 only) on reliability."
18,"in many hazard response cases where extraction of certain information from remote-sensing data of various characteristics is well under- stood (hodgson, davis, and kotelenska 2005), the eﬀect of rss conﬁguration changes on"
19,international journal of remote sensing 3289 reliability can be readily estimated.
19,"for applications where the reliability of information extraction from remote-sensing data are less well understood, the inability of the rscm to directly estimate the impact of conﬁguration changes on information reliability represents a substantial limitation."
19,the sizes of the example ﬁres used in these analyses were selected to encompass the upper and lower bound of ﬁre extents for which fis might be called into service.
19,"timeliness estimates for imaging an 809 ha ﬁre fall well below those provided by fis operators and time estimates for imaging a 121,406 ha ﬁre are orders of magnitude higher than those provided by fis operators, suggesting that modelled timeliness estimates, particularly for large scenes, exhibit substantial error."
19,"the time estimates provided by fis operators are based on their aggregate experience imaging ﬁres of variable size, but the degree of deviation of modelled timeliness from fis operator estimates, particularly for receiver time (trec), suggest that: (1) empirical validation of rscm-capacity-based timeliness is warranted, (2) receiver complexity estimates for fis and other automated receivers require validation, or (3) that factors beyond algorithm complexity (e.g. write speed, disk latency, bus speed, existing computational load, etc.) employed by ‘big o’ notation need to be accounted for to accurately estimate receiver capacity (creca)."
19,analysis of the fis in the context of the rscm revealed several conﬁguration changes that can be readily made to improve the eﬀectiveness of the information produced when employed by ics for wildﬁre suppression prioritization.
19,limiting spectral sampling collec- tion to a single waveband (i.e.
19,ir4) reduces the total quantity of data to be transmitted and processed.
19,completion of image-processing steps on-board reduces the length of the channel and therefore transmission time.
19,"providing the information to ics in the form a static map requires more receiver time, but guarantees that all ics are able to readily employ the produced information."
19,"collectively, the identiﬁed changes will provide reﬁne- ments that enable delivery of information on wildﬁre locations in a timelier manner than the current sop and will better ensure that fis produced information is used to its potential."
19,"at the time of this submission, the fis is currently being upgraded by: using small jet propulsion aircraft as platforms, enabling on-board analysis, automated on-the-ﬂy projection of image frames and quick mosaicking (sop steps 5, 7, and 8)."
19,"the rscm holds potential to improve the timeliness, and subsequently eﬀective- ness, of remote sensing for many time-sensitive applications, particularly hazard response."
19,"the development of rsss for speciﬁc time-sensitive applications (e.g. wild- ﬁre, earthquake, and, oil spill response) and emergency response areas, such that those predetermined rsss can be activated during an appropriate event, is likely the only way to ensure timely and eﬀective use of remote sensing in a hazard response context (leifer et al."
19,2012; stow et al.

19,this does not require that the conﬁg- uration of a tsrsss be static.
19,"in fact, enabling the design of ﬂexible rsss based on a network of platforms, sensors, channels, and receiver’s, such that the rss can adapt (i.e. be re-conﬁgured) to diﬃcult-to-anticipate user requirements, likely represents one of the most important contributions of the rscm."
19,"the rscm provides a framework for conﬁguring such systems to meet the speciﬁc information requirements of users, weather those user requirements are static and well understood or dynamic and diﬃcult to anticipate."
