1,the conclusion of this benchmark study is that the use of nasa/usgs optical/thermal satellite imagery can considerably improve hydrologic decision support tools compared to their traditional implementations.
1,"the benefits of improved decision making, resulting from more accurate results of hydrologic support systems using optical/thermal satellite imagery, should substantially exceed the costs for acquiring such imagery and implementing the remote sensing algorithms."
1,"in fact, the value of reduced error in estimating average annual groundwater recharge in the san gabriel mountains, california alone, in terms of value of water, may be as large as $1 billion, more than sufficient to pay for one new landsat satellite."
