3,"this is the state enterprise “kazhydromet”), the annual precipitation depletion of phosphorus reserves and the deterioration rate is 340 mm."
3,the total amount of precipitation during of the environment due to excess phosphorus.
3,"excessive the warm period, including april-october, was 71.2% of phosphorus content can be dangerous for freshwater the annual total."
3,"in the second half of summer, there is systems."
3,"on the other hand, agricultural production more precipitation (rse “kazhydromet”, 2023). should be provided with phosphorous fertilizers in the reporting year 2021, the amount of precipitation that need it (asadi et al., 2020; grant et al., 2004; for the period (october-september) was 322.6 or 94.9% martens et al., 2022). of the annual norm (table 1)."
3,"considering the moisture we must emphasize that organic farming is quite supply of agricultural crops for the growing season of 2021, attractive from the point of view of providing the population it is worth noting that most of the precipitation fell in the with high-quality food products."
3,"at the same time, the second decade of july (88.9 mm - july 11-12, 21), while in negative impact of chemically synthesized products on may only 5.5 mm fell."
3,such conditions created significant the environment and human health is reduced.
3,"this difficulties in sowing at the optimal time, since the seeds significantly improves the environmental situation. did not have enough moisture to produce friendly shoots."
3,organic farming contributes to the development of small light precipitation in june affected the appearance and and medium-sized businesses and increases the export development of cultivated crops.
3,"in august, the amount potential of agricultural products. of precipitation was only 15.4% of the long-term average."
3,"therefore, the search for new ways of greening it should be noted that our analysis of the relationship agriculture at the lowest cost, one of which is the transition between grain yield and the amount and time of precipitation to an organic farming system, is of great interest. showed that in the northern region of kazakhstan, its height one of the methods used to improve crop management (among other factors) was determined by precipitation in and production is the use of various remote methods june-july, and grain quality was determined by precipitation based on satellite images from space, air and unmanned in august-september."
3,"in the first case, more precipitation aerial vehicles, which are used all over the world."
3,"these in june-july led to an increase in yield, in the second case, methods make it possible to evaluate soil fertilization, less precipitation and a higher temperature at the end determine the content of organic matter, water and salt, of ripening and harvesting led to an improvement in the as well as the vegetation of agricultural crops (mzid et al., technological qualities of grain (table 2)."

9,a map of studies to various agricultural crops in northern kazakhstan. the distribution of plant nutrition elements was compiled it was shown that remote sensing allows it to evaluate to and the crop yield was determined within the study area. evaluate potential for obtaining different soil and producing the average yield was 4.0 c / ha. different various on and effect of different factors on crop the possibility of using permitted phosphorus-containing performance.
9,"as part of the present work, we have obtained fertilizers in organic farming, in order to optimize the results that can be used to further develop organic farming phosphorus nutrition of plants, is considered. approaches, as the influence of this spread in different soil as a result, a visual map of the location of zones in the properties on linum usitatissimum productivity has already field was obtained, which was supplemented by sampling been analyzed. and results of agrochemical data analysis."
