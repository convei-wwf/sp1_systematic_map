2,"in the early satellite telemetry (st) has been widely used to determine the 2000s, global positioning system (gps) capability movements, distribution, and habitat selection of mammals, revolutionized satellite tracking by providing locations accurate birds and ﬁshes (hart and hyrenbach, 2009; gaidet et al., to 30 m (schwartz and arthur, 1999; frair et al., 2010; 2010; harcourt et al., 2019; hays et al., 2019; davidson et al., tomkiewicz et al., 2010) compared to, at best, 400 m accuracy 2020; sequeira, 2020)."

2,"in 2011, implement ecosystem-based management by providing data on advent of the iridium satellite system (iridium satellite how animals use the landscape and respond to current or communications, mclean, virginia, usa) allowed more data expected environmental changes (e.g., block et al., 2016)."
2,"st to be transferred at a lower cost than the argos system (e.g., data are particularly important for long-lived species that are thomas et al., 2011; lone et al., 2018b; pagano et al., 2020) and mobile, difﬁcult to observe directly, or have complex life cycles enabled two-way communication with slrts."
2,"this allowed that complicate other forms of monitoring (e.g., species that feed slrts to be programmed remotely (e.g., changing the duty and reproduce in different locations)."
2,"in the case of the polar bear cycle) and opened the possibility for release devices that could (ursus maritimus), a marine carnivore that ranges widely across be triggered by the user."
2,"the addition of salt-water sensors, international boundaries and occurs at low densities across a vast thermometers, accelerometers, and video cameras further and sparsely populated arctic (amstrup, 2003), st has been a extended the types of data provided by slrts, allowing critical research tool for management, conservation, and detailed behavioral and ecological investigations (fancy et al., informing international agreements on environmental 1988; lone et al., 2018a; pagano et al., 2018). protection (pbrs, 2015)."
2,"most slrts used in polar bear research have been attached as satellite-linked radio tags (slrts), which transmit to polar- collars, and almost exclusively to adult female bears as their neck orbiting satellites, have been a key tool in the study of polar bears and head morphology maximize retention (figure 1)."
2,"subadult because remote habitats and harsh arctic conditions preclude bears are generally not collared to avoid potential injury during the use of other methods (e.g., very high frequency [vhf] growth, and adult males are not collared because their necks are signals) that require the transmitter and receiver to be in larger in circumference than their heads, which causes collars to proximity."
2,"as early as 1965, scientists suggested that slrts slip off."
2,"other attachment methods including harnesses, ear- had the potential to provide reliable location data for polar bears, mounted transmitters (wiig et al., 2017), glue-to-fur transmitters regardless of season or geographic area (pbsg, 1966; flyger and (rode et al., 2014a), and subcutaneous implants (mulcahy and townsend., 1968)."
2,"the ﬁrst successful use of st to track polar garner, 1999; amstrup et al., 2001) have been used with bears was in 1977 using the nimbus 6 satellite system to follow limited success. three adult females in alaska for 8-390 days (kolz et al., 1980)."
2,"in the international association for bear research and 1979, four female polar bears in lancaster sound, canada management (iba; https://www.bearbiology.org/) and the (schweinsburg and lee, 1982) and four bears (one male and international union for conservation of nature (iucn) three females) in the greenland sea (larsen et al., 1983) were species survival commission (ssc) bear specialist group tracked using the nimbus 6 system for 40-266 and 18-63 days, (bsg) support science-based management and conservation of respectively."

2,"in recent decades, indigenous since those initial studies, advances in technology, communities in parts of the canadian and united states arctic attachment/release methods, and satellite systems have made have expressed concern about the application of slrts on polar slrts less cumbersome and improved their ability to remotely bears."
2,"often, opposition to chemical immobilization, handling, monitor polar bears, resulting in widespread and diverse use. and collaring is based on concerns about possible negative establishment of the argos data collection and location system physical and behavioral impacts to individual bears, such as in 1978 (cls, 2016) facilitated st as a tool for wildlife research collars that become too tight if the bear grows or changes body (fancy et al., 1988; harris et al., 1990; garner et al., 1994; belikov condition (itk, 2009; henri et al., 2010; wong et al., 2017; et al., 1998; schwartz and arthur, 1999; tomkiewicz et al., 2010), aewc, 2019), and on potential health risks to humans who which for polar bears included a new ability to identify consume the meat of polar bears that have been immobilized frontiers in marine science | www.frontiersin.org 2 april 2022 | volume 9 | article 816666"

5,"currently, all handling of handling have longer-term effects on polar bear body condition wildlife, including immobilization and deployment of slrts on (i.e., fatness) and reproduction."
5,"rode et al.

5,"similarly, the body condition 2.2 slrt types of 309 polar bears captured twice in different years did not differ various attachment types for satellite transmitters, including collars, from the body condition of 734 bears at initial capture (rode glue-to-fur, implants, and ear tags, can be used on polar bears et al., 2014a)."

5,"there are trade-offs between retention, operational life, based capture on polar bear body condition."
5,"litter size and mass data quality, and the animal’s tolerance of the different attachment of cubs was unaffected by single or multiple captures of the types."
5,"collars are most frequently used because their size (currently mother, and capture of the mother was not found to inﬂuence ~1.5 kg; https://www.telonics.com/) can accommodate a battery that cub survival (amstrup, 1993; rode et al., 2014a)."

5,"additionally, collars allow for the attachment of devices dependent young (rode et al., 2014a)."
5,"these results suggest that for monitoring behavior, such as video cameras and activity sensors effects on activity, movement, and feeding behavior post-capture with high spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., whiteman et al., do not translate to reduced body condition or survival for most 2015; pagano et al., 2018)."

5,ramsay and mounted transmitters can be deployed on subadults and adults of stirling (1986) and amstrup (1993) indicated that some both sexes.
5,"however, low battery capacity associated with the small pregnant females captured at dens before giving birth relocated size of ear-mounted transmitters (≤70 g) and the propensity of bears to a new den site, while lunn et al. (2004) found that pregnant to remove the transmitters has resulted in a mean functional life of polar bears at dens seldom relocated if not disturbed by capture. 70 days (wiig et al., 2017), which is too short to evaluate seasonal capturing females at dens is now largely avoided. patterns in movements and habitat use."
