1,"we emphasize that the differences we found are associated with the selection process and that other aspects, such as long-term survival of species, may rank the strategies differently."
1,"we conclude that the cost-effectiveness of a selection strategy depends on the size of the planning area for selection of conservation areas, the size of the conservation areas, the objective of the agent making the selection, and the amount and type of information on which the selection is based."
