1,"such understanding is needed to determine whether concerns raised in the literature about poor adoption and use of dists are correct, to understand why, and to remedy them."
1,"this paper presents a thematic analysis of 31 exploratory interviews with representatives of 14 desertiﬁcation policy keywords: desertiﬁcation and management organisations operating at different scales about their use of dists; speciﬁcally gis, dist remote sensing, simulation models, statistical models and dss."
1,"dists of all types were found to be used decision and information support tool along with other sources of decision and information support including hard-copy maps, aerial decision support photography, databases, academic literature and local participation."
1,"gis was most widely used, by 9 of information system the organisations interviewed."
1,"from the interview data a generic conceptual model identifying the implementation organisational drivers for, constraints on and impacts of dist use in desertiﬁcation policy and adoption management organisations is developed and discussed."
1,"drivers were grouped into those concerned with impact system attributes (e.g. ease of use, ﬂexibility) and those concerned with how information is used organisationally (e.g. to facilitate communication, assessment of desertiﬁcation)."
1,"barriers including dist information attributes such as reliability and uncertainty, and additional ﬁnancial investment arising from training, employment and infrastructure procurement were identiﬁed."
1,"impacts were grouped into structural changes, individual work changes and ﬁnancial investment needs."
1,"no systematic variation was evident in the drivers, constraints or impacts of use according to dist type, although gis was the most widely used dist and consequently was associated with a larger number of each."
1,"results are discussed in relation to existing theory and evidence on information system and dss adoption and use, and found to be in agreement."
