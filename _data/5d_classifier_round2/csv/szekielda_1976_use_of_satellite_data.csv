1,special emphasis was given to the data obtained during the landsat mis- sions.
1,"the use of satellite images in natural marine resources, management, mapping of coastal areas, water quality, and upwelling and currents is described."
1,the economic bene- fits of remote sensing from satellite altitudes are evaluated for the marine sector.
1,introduction the d e v e l o p m e n t o f sensors f l o w n on satellites for r e c o n n a i s s a n c e o f natu- ral resources has progressed rapidly d u r i n g the last few years and results g a t h e r e d b y o r b i t i n g satellites have r e a c h e d an increasingly large c o m m u n i t y o f users.

2,(now called landsat) are able to detect targets on the ground with a size of about 100 m.
2,"colour pictures taken during manned space flight missions and infrared re- cordings taken from orbiting unmanned satellites showed the high potential for detecting the presence of biomass concentrations and upwelling areas in the ocean as well as features in the near-coastal regions such as vegetation, beaches, erosion and suspended sediment."
2,"the detection of chlorophyll, as a representative pigment in p h y t o p l a n k t o n , has been used to estimate the standing stock of fish."
2,"in the field of pollution monitoring, the importance of the air--sea inter- face has been recognized as a concentration plane for pollutants and as a contributing medium for transport of such agents across this layer."
2,"surface anomalies, such as slicks, fronts and foam, are amenable to remote sensing and can be recognized in satellite imageries obtained over oceanic re- gions."
2,"the most successful spacecraft mission for monitoring the near-coastal areas was conducted under the erts programme, the technical background of which will be briefly described in the following paragraphs."
2,cloud distribution the major advantages of spacecraft observations are the coverage of a wide area and the possibility of having repeated coverage of a region.
2,"how- ever, these advantages are limited in m a n y regions by a characteristic pattern in the cloud distribution which is the result of persistent wind systems."
2,the imagery in fig. 1 is based on recordings by the application technology sat- ellite over the pacific ocean.
2,"the horse latitudes (or the subtropical calms of descending air) between the equator and about 30°n and 30 ° s, respectively, karl-heinz szekielda received his ""docteur d'univer- sit~"" at the university of marseille, france."
2,"as a fel- low with the national academy of sciences-ncr, washington, he worked for two years at the nasa- goddard space flight center, maryland, usa."
2,"as a faculty member at the university of delaware, dr."
2,szekielda was principal investigator on erts-1 and skylab.
2,"since 1974 he has been with the ocean eco- nomics and technology office of the united nations department of economic and social affairs, new york."
3,recordings by the application technology satellite (ats) over the pacific ocean. have low cloud coverage as a result of the trade winds which are constantly transporting air masses.
3,"examples o f areas with dry, nearly cloudless atmospheres are shown in fig."
3,"these include parts o f the northeast african continent, the arabian peninsula and parts o f iran."
3,"although the ground resolution of this re- cording (by essa-9) was n o t sufficient for use in the reconnaissance o f ma- rine resources, it is an i m p o r t a n t input in selecting the p r o p e r conditions for f u r t h e r detailed studies."

4,erts had as its main payload a high-resolution multispectral 1 scanner subsystem (mss) and a three-camera return beam vidicon camera system (rbv) which provided for the repetitive acquisition of multispectral data from surface characteristics of the earth.
4,"the overall observatory configura- tion is illustrated in fig. 3, which shows erts with its payload (rbv and 1 the word multispectral indicates that recordings were d o n e in discrete steps o f the elec- t r o m a g n e t i c spectrum."

5,"during the erts-1 mission, only a few rbv camera images were obtained because o f electronic interference between the mss and the rbv."
5,this m e a n t th at mo s t of the material was m o n i t o r e d by the mss.
5,"the mss used an oscillating mirror to scan c ont i nuous l y the field spectral bands (0.5--0.6 pm, 0.6--0.7 pm, 0.7--0.8 pm and 0.8--1.1 pm) while spacecraft m o t i o n pro- vided the long-track progression."
5,data were transmitted as t h e y were ac- quired {in real time) if the spacecraft was in the vicinity of a ground-receiv- ing station.
5,"out of the range of a ground station, the data were recorded al- ternately on two wideband video tape recorders with a recording capacity of 30 min each and played back to a ground-receiving station at a later time."
5,er ts was placed into a near-polar orbit at an altitude of a b o u t 490 nauti- cal miles and c o m p l e t e d 14 orbits per day with a coverage of the total earth surface every 18 days.

7,"typical data results are in the form of imageries, which make up a com- posite of the original scanlines, and also computer-compatible tapes for machine processing."
7,"the capability of five operational receiving stations in the u.s.a., canada and brazil showed that the whole north american conti- nent and about 90% of south america can be covered."
7,"additionally, nine stations located in regions, as indicated in fig. 4, would provide coverage of all coastal areas, excluding antarctica."
7,"with a single antenna, an area of 23 • 106 km 2 could be repeatedly covered by erts or a similar monitoring sys- tem."
7,"n a t u r a l marine resources the fast acquisition of multidisciplinary data from an orbiting platform facilitates especially the monitoring of time-dependent features, such as near coastal erosion, changes in vegetation, current patterns, plankton blooms, etc., and also has the advantage of being useful in the exploration of natural resources."
7,the application of remote sensing technology to environmental problems and coastal resources was studied by thompson et al.
7,(1973).
7,"coastal re- sources, such as productive salt marshes, shell and sand deposits, timber and water were evaluated using remote sensing techniques, photography and in- frared scanning imagery)."
7,"impact problems related to highway location, dredge spoil placement, industrial and recreational development were con- sidered in the light of data acquired at various seasons• austen et al. (1973) studied the application of remote-sensing systems in earth-resource explora- tion."
7,the information thus obtained makes possible more efficient planning and decision-making.
7,a synopsis of marine resources and ocean surveys from the erts-1 pro- gramme was made by greaves (1973).
7,it was demonstrated that sediments are the most visible features and can be used to differentiate water masses.
7,"in clear water, b a t h y m e t r y can be estimated by using contrast enhancement as well as a technique called optical and digital density slicing."
7,"a sample of an aerial photograph taken over key west, florida (u.s.a.) during a manned spacecraft mission is shown in fig. 5 which mainly portrays the topography of the area."
7,"much more detail can be recognized in separated spectral bands, such as in erts images, as shown in fig. 6 using the four dif- ferent channel imageries over the little bahama bank."
7,"channel 4, with the highest penetration of light in water, shows that the bank has its shallowest part in the north."
7,"although the northern section is partly cloud-covered, it is easy to differentiate between those structures ~vhich are created by clouds."
7,"with increasing wavelengths, the water penetration depth of light decreases and only near-surface features and coastlines can be identified, as is apparent 37"
8,"t o p o g r a p h y o f t h e o c e a n floor as i n d i c a t e d in imagery o b t a i n e d over key west, florida. by comparing channel 4 with channel 7."

8,"during the time of overpass, the predicted tidal currents had an ingoing c o m p o n e n t {klemas et al., 1973) which is reflected in the small tongue of ocean water with low particle load entering the centre of the bay."
8,"with the increasing demand for fresh water, remote sensing will be an im- portant tool for water inventory and water-resource investigations."
8,"land uses related to water-resources management can easily be identified and mapped using erts-1 data at a scale of 1 : 250,000 (salomonson, 1973)."

9,the data collection sys- tem (dcs) on erts-1 collected and relayed data rapidly enough to have a significant input in management situations.
9,size limits for bodies to be de- tected are in the order of one hectare and rivers as narrow as 70 m in dia- meter can easily be detected and monitored.
9,"variations in reflection are at- tributable to variations in depth and concentration differences in suspended matter, such as plankton and suspended sediments."
9,many other studies have been undertaken to demonstrate the applicability of satellite data to natural-resource inventory and assessment.
9,"liere (1973), for example, used erts imageries for water-resource planning in the lower mekong basin and demonstrated that spacecraft are providing data from areas which have been inaccessible in the past."
9,"included is information on the mechanism of flooding and drainage of the delta, changes in siltation and salinity in the lower delta and fisheries in the estuarine areas."
9,the repetitive coverage by satellites makes the data particularly valuable in studying the gradula transformation of changing regional features.

11,"management agencies (salomonson and rango, 1974)."
11,use of erts images in the field of geology and water resources was tested by akhavi and ebtehadj (1973) for the purpose of mapping natural re- sources.
11,"a number of geological and hydrological features, such as u n k n o w n faults, streams and lakes, were mapped."
11,more detailed information can be de- tected from the original computer-compatible tapes as recorded by the multispectral scanner on erts-1.
11,yarger and mccauley (1974) used passes over kansas reservoirs and demonstrated that sun angle and atmospheric con- ditions have to be considered if erts data are to be used for water-quality evaluation.
11,geological evaluation of erts-1 imagery over diverse geological terrains can also be applied in coastal regions.
11,"for instance, geological mapping of terraces of new york state revealed bedrocks and surficial geological infor- mation (isachsen et al., 1973)."
11,"such information can also be used in the ex- ploration of minerals and petroleum (saunders et al., 1973)."
11,"due to the ground resolution of recent satellite technology, living re- sources such as fish shoals cannot be directly detected."
11,"however, environ- mental factors, which can be correlated with the appearance of marine re- sources and which can be monitored from space, provide reliable sources of indirect information."
11,"sharma et al. (1973), for instance, investigated water and sediment movements and factors controlling sea mammal distribution."
11,kemmerer and benigo (1973) attempted to relate satellite-acquired im- ageries to selected oceanographic parameters.
11,initial results demonstrated t h a t information monitored from space might have important implications for fisheries-resource assessment in the mississippi sound and adjacent off- shore waters.
11,"in the same analysis, relationships were established between water transparency, as established from erts-1 data, and fish availability."
11,an investigation to establish the feasibility of using data acquired from or- biting satellites to determine the distribution and abundance of oceanic gamefish has been undertaken by savastano et al.
11,(1974).
11,stevenson and pas- tula (1973) used data from erts-1 to examine factors affecting living ma- rine resources in the mississippi sound.
11,"preliminary results indicated a corre- lation between back-scattered light and water transparency, changed by chlorophyll and other materials."
11,"this allowed eight empirical menhaden dis- tribution models to be constructed, taking into consideration parameters such as water depth, transparency, colour and salinity at the surface, thus demonstrating the potential for the management of natural marine resources."
11,maughan and marmelstein (1974) in relating erts-1 data to transparency and depth of the water also concluded that remotely acquired data can play a role in commercial fisheries.
11,"besides the interest in monitoring ice conditions for marine traffic, sea-ice conditions are of special scientific interest because they can act as carriers of 41"

13,"sediments and may influence the water circulation as well as changing the hydrography (barnes and reimnitz, 1973)."
13,patterns as detected in erts-1 imagery showed a close relationship between geomorphic processes and the influence of sea ice along alaska's northern coast.
13,sea ice is detectable in all the mss channels b u t the near-infrared measurements provide the most de- tail.
13,"barnes and bowley (1973) identified ice flows, pack ice, ice belts, brash ice, fast ice, leads, fractured, cracks, puddles, thawholes and flooded ice."
13,classification of the ice types is based upon the multispectral c o m p o n e n t in the erts data.
13,fig. 8 gives in example of how the ice patterns can be viewed from space.
13,"during the break-up, the pattern of ice distribution changed con- siderably during a 24-h period."
13,hult and ostrander (1973) investigated the applicability of erts to ant- arctic iceberg resources and the possibility of determining environmental conditions which might influence the harvesting of icebergs.
13,additional investigations have applied erts data to polar-region studies.
13,graves {1972) used erts data for ice detection and map correction.
13,"mac- donald (1973) examined the cartographic application of erts' rbv im- agery in polar regions, and demonstrated that detected changes in the northern limits of the ice shelves as well as the discovery of unmapped geo- graphic features in antarctica were possible with the use of satellite imagery."
13,"features such as glaciers, ice tongues and ice shelves were monitored for changes in sice, shape and position."
13,"management erts data were applied to the protection and management of the new jersey {u.s.a.) coastal environment (yunghans et al., 1974)."
13,it was demon- strated that rapid access to erts data resulted in the application of com- puter-compatible tapes within 60 h following the overpass.
13,this operational demonstration of the rapid availability of satellite data and subsequent data processing illustrated the application of spacecraft data to environmental protection and management programmes.
13,"within these programmes, comput- erized analysis techniques have been used for the recognition and monitoring of offshore waste disposal, drift direction and speed and the dispersion rates in the new york bight area."
13,"for example, the density slicing from erts data was used to identify the intensity level of waste."
13,verger and demathieu {1973) used erts data to study the ocean front of france between cap gris-nez and south of arcachon.
13,"an assessment of erts-1 imagery, as an aid in land-resource planning, was reported by keech et al."
13,(1974).
13,land-use maps were prepared at a medium scale and some veg- etation complexes could be defined with the spacecraft data.
14,"mapping of the coastal area erts imageries were used for the cartographic mapping of land, at a scale of 1 : 500,000 by mooneyhan (1973)."
14,the map was used to complement existing line maps and to support the revision of existing maps.
14,"objects as small as 100 m in diameter, and linear features as narrow as 15 m, were de- tected."
14,"in conjunction with automatic pattern recognition, schematic land- use categories could be established."
14,"for instance, in urban areas three to four different categories were mapped."
14,"for producing classification of imageries and thematic maps, digital data from erts are processed using ground-truth observations during the over- pass (conrod, 1973)."
14,"the procedure can be handled by contracting the pro- cessing, which means that the results may be obtained by personnel who are data users and not data-processing specialists."
14,"klemas (1973) applied the classification imagery for ecological, geographical and oceanographic investi- gation in the delaware coastal resource planning."
14,"the results obtained by analysis of digital erts data are: (1) statistical outputs indicating the reliability of discriminating eight coastal vegetation and land-use classes on a given group of training sets which included: (a) mean and standard deviation of response in each class chosen, (b) contribution tables indicating importance of each channel in discrimi- nating each thematic class from the background, (c) scatter diagrammes showing relationships of thematic spectral signatures in spectral space, and (d) classification table showing reliability (in per cent) of identification of each thematic class; (2) thematic colour maps at a scale of 1 : 1,000,000, showing vegetation and land-use categories for delaware's entire coastal zone; and (3) thematic computer plots at specified smaller scales {i.e., 1 : 24,000) for comparison with existing map data such as u.s."
14,geological survey topo- graphic maps.
14,a thematic map obtained from erts data is shown in fig. 9 and demon- strates that the main features can be recognized as in high-altitude aircraft photographs.
14,kritokos et al. (1974) used the magnetic digital tapes of the imagery ob- tained by erts for an analysis of resuspended solids in the potomac river.
14,channel 6 was used to determine the water-to-land interface while in channel 5 the existence of three distinct water masses could be detected.
14,greater re- flectivity correlated with high concentrations of suspended solids and regions of low-reflectivity could be identified as having lower concentration of parti- culate material.

15,littoral drift and the recognition o f sedimentation patterns have led to the evalution o f beach and nearshore features in areas o f little or no data.
15,erts multispectral scanner data were used by flores et al. (1973) for the classification and d e t e r m i n a t i o n o f the areal e x t e n t of coastal features on the texas (u.s.a.) coast.
15,"features such as water masses, salt marshes, beaches, forest and vegetation and exposed soil or construction material could be analyzed."
15,the accuracy o f the measurements o f the percentage o f wetland along a salt-marsh b o u n d a r y ranged from 89 to 99%.
15,"water q u a l i t y from the distribution p a t t e r n o f particulate m a t t e r in water, conclusions have been drawn concerning the circulation o f water masses in near-coastal 45"
16,areas.
16,"magoon et ah (1973) concluded that the data from different spectral bands, when used in conjunction with other available data, are very useful for studying coastal processes and for coastal-engineering planning in the in- dian river inlet (delaware, u.s.a.)"
16,similar analysis was done in near-coastal waters in alaska where water flow was inferred from the plume shape of suspended material.
16,differentia- tion between water masses was also detected in channel 4.
16,suspended sedi- m e n t plumes which were generated by the welland canal and the genesee river were identified by pluhowski (1973).
16,"although the niagara river dis- charge could not be detected in any of the erts-1 frames, the river dis- charges from the oswego river was identified after storms but was n o t visi- ble during low flow periods, showing that high turbidity levels are created by storm runoff."
16,"sediment distribution and coastal processes in cook inlet, alaska, were in- vestigated by anderson et al."
16,(1973).
16,"the coastline configuration was well defined in the red band while in the near-infrared band, current patterns were visible which were attributed to different concentrations of suspended sediment."
16,"oceanic turbidity and chlorophyll, as inferred from erts-1 observations, were reported by curran {1973)."
16,"curran compared surface ship measure- ments of chlorophyll concentration with the ratios of channels 4 and 5, as obtained from the erts-1 multispectral scanner."
16,it was concluded that the plankton distribution found with erts-1 was comparable to the ship mea- surements.
16,bowker et al. (1973) correlated erts multispectral imageries with sus- pended matter and chlorophyll in lower chesapeake bay.
16,"while greater detail in the distribution pattern of suspended material was revealed by the multi- spectal scanner in channel 5, near-surface suspended material associated with chlorophyll was observed in bands 6 and 7."
16,the discharge of sediment-loaded water from the james river entering the chesapeake bay could be traced as a plume along the shore extending seaward of cape henry and variation in turbidity in the lower bay could be related to a strong tidal current.
16,"the author pointed out that the mss imagery could be used in monitoring the character 8 estuarine water for the assessment of siltation, productively and water types."
16,"similar conclusions were drawn by klemas et al. (1973), by using satellite imagery of delaware bay during different tidal cycles."
16,"sea surface circulation, as indicated by the sediment distribution and as monitored from erts, was investigated by wright et al. (1973) in cook in- let, alaska."
16,a high turbidity stream entering the upper inlet provided a tracer for the circulation in the inlet and channels 4 and 5 were used to plot sedi- ment and pollution trajectories.
16,"in another study, the distribution of sus- pended sediment in the gulf of mexico, off the coast of texas, was exam- 46"
17,"ined (hunter, 1973)."
17,"a general decrease in turbidity in the offshore direction was noted, while more complex concentrations of sediment could be classi- fied as plumes of bands."
17,separate plumes from river outlets were caused by tidal action especially at the end of a tidal cycle when the plumes became de- tached from the river outlets.
17,"data from the return beam vidicon camera (rbv) were analyzed while a shell-dredging barge was operating in tampa bay, florida (u.s.a.)."
17,the pathway of the dredged material could be recog- nized at each rbv band.
17,"upwelling and currents nearly 90% of the world's fisheries are in near-coastal waters and in con- nection with upwelling ecosystems (ryther, 1969)."
17,"although only a small percentage of the world's oceans are considered as upwelling regions, they are the major fishing grounds in the world, e.g. off the coasts of peru, north-west africa, somalia and south-west africa."
17,"for better management of fishing resources, the monitoring of the upwel- ling areas with chlorophyll-sensing and measurements of additional para- meters, such as temperature, to understand the fluctuations in biomass as a function of time and space, are a very promising approach."
17,"estimation of biomass in upwelling areas, including the dynamics of environmental factors, and the determination of the time required for changes to affect the biomass, are criteria for evaluating the potential use of an oceanic region."
17,an example of sea-surface temperature change in the upwelling area of the somali coast is shown in fig.
17,"by periodic comparisons, data could be devel- oped on the response time of chlorophyll and biomass production to change in environmental factors, including pollutants."
17,such information is very dif- ficult to obtain from sporadic and scattered ship observations.
17,"dfiing and szekielda (1971) used infrared data to demonstrate that the response time of current systems and upwelling to the wind field can be monitored from orbiting platforms (see also warnecke et al., 1971; szekiel- da, 1972)."
17,this plays an important part in monitoring fishery potential as well as the management of near-coastal processes.
17,"although individual tem- perature measurements from space are still less accurate than the convention- al measurements (szekielda, 1973), repeated coverage of a test site with mul- tispectral sensors or the application of statistical methods leads to more pre- cise data (smith et al., 1970; shenk and salomonson, 1972; szekielda et al., 1974)."
17,fig. 11 is a typical example of a synoptic view of the temperature patterns viewed from spacecraft altitudes over the cloud-free regions of the gulf stream.
17,it must be stressed that the position of sharp temperature gradients over a large area cannot generally be determined by classical ship measure- 47

20,"upwelling and plankton patterns, north-west africa. example of the patterns observed in the upwelling area is shown in fig."
20,"from the erts programme, flow patterns and the direction of sediment- loaded surface water could be correlated with the major current systems."
20,maul {1974) used computers and enhanced images to observe the loop cur- rent by colour or sea-state effects which are associated with the cyclonic boundary.
20,the observations were in agreement with experimental measure- ment.
20,"in another study, maul (1973) located the cyclonic edge of the cur- rent by surface chlorophyll concentration which contributed to the shift in colour from blue to green in the open ocean."
20,he observed that sea state in the current is frequently higher than in the surrounding waters which have different reflecting properties.
20,upwelling and cold-water eddies were investigated by strong et al. (1972) with the noaa environmental satellite.
20,upwelling off mexico's pacific coast has been detected and cold eddies off cape hatteras have been tracked as they move soutwest in the sargasso sea.
20,satellite imagery was also used by teleki et al. (1973) in the gulf of car- pentaria (australia) to study the nearshore circulation and demonstrate that sediment disposal can be studied and mapped on a seasonal basis.
20,the author 50
21,identified the transport direction for coastal sediment and confirmed a hypo- thesis about the bidirectional nature of non-tidal currents along the east coast of the gulf.
21,richardson et al. (1973) observed gulf stream eddies in the western sar- gasso sea.
21,a cyclonic gulf stream eddy was tracked by infrared data and the observations over a time period of 14 months indicated that the eddy moved southwestward at an average speed of one mile per day.
21,strong and derycke (1974) employed the visible channel on the noaa-ii satellite to observe the shoreward edge of the gulf stream from florida to cape hatteras.
21,the visible pattern was due to an abrupt change in sea surface roughness as a result of the opposition of waves propagating against the flow of the gulf stream.
21,economic e v a l u a t i o n of remote sensing data studies relating to cost were done on the erts-1 programme but those conducted prior to the launching are not very relevant because of broad gen- eralizations and of the speculative nature of the studies.
21,studies conducted after the launching are more realistic and are summarized in a report by the united nations (1975).
21,"specific coasts were given in this report which, how- ever, cannot be applied to all regions."
21,"for instance, the reconnaissance of ice conditions by satellite is of importance specifically for countries in the high latitudes, having marine transportation problems, like canada, u.s.a. and the u.s.s.r."
21,"for developing countries, summers et al. (1974) reported preliminary re- sults of a study which was conducted under the sponsorship of the us agen- cy for international development {aid) to assess the benefits and costs of the utilization of erts data."
21,"the study focussed mainly on rice crop fore- casts, range-land management, watershed management and cartographic map- ping."
21,"for range-land management in kenya, for instance, the benefits over a 20-year period were estimated to be about $8--26 million."
21,price estimates of aircraft and satellites for operational earth resources sys- tems were reported by cheseman {1973).
21,data pertaining to satellite costs are given below.
21,cost (million $) satellite: low-altitude geostationary data-relay recurring procurement costs plus launch vehicle 14.5 .50 15 command and control operations costs per year 1 1 0.5 51
22,"although many countries are not able to invest the capital necessary for the development and the operations of satellites and launch vehicles, they may nevertheless benefit from spacecraft remote-sensing programmes, i.e., by collecting data from ground stations."
22,imageries produced from satellites are also available at a low price.
22,"morley (1972), for instance, reported that the canadian air photo library markets 9-square inch black and white prints for u.s. $1 each, a black and white transparency for $2, and a colour trans- parency for $3."
22,"imagery materials may be obtained from other sources, such as the national space data bank which guarantees the supply of spacecraft data at a low price."
22,"hindrances, based mainly on lack of information, can be overcome by broader application of spacecraft data."
22,"the customer profile for data request in fig. 13, established by the united states department of the interior {eros data center, sioux falls, south dakota), shows that a total of 129,288 frames for the period july 1973 to december 1973 were acquired."
