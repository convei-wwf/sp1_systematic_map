1,the results indicate that remote sensing plays an 23 april 2015 important role in ecosystem service valuation in the large areas where mangroves and aquaculture are accepted 24 april 2015 mixed.
1,we estimated the value of mangrove ecosystem services using market price and replacement available online 24 may 2015 cost approaches to determine an initial assessment of the overall contribution of mangroves to human keywords: well-being.
1,"the total estimated value was us$ 600 million/year for 187,533 ha (approximately us$ 3000/ mangrove ha/year), which is slightly smaller than the gross domestic product (gdp) of the province (us$ 0.69 valuation billion in 2010)."
1,"however, this is only a partial estimate that does not consider other services (tourism, ecosystem services biodiversity, cultural and social values), due to the absence of primary data."
1,the main contribution of this remote sensing household survey study is that it is the ﬁrst to combine the approaches of remote sensing and household survey for the quantiﬁcation of mangrove ecosystem services in the mangrove-shrimp integrated system.
1,our ﬁndings indicate that the continued expansion of aquaculture has reduced the beneﬁts to local communities provided by the mangrove ecosystem.
