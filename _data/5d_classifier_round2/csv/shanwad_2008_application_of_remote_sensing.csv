2,"thus, the repetitive use / land cover and biomass that have changed coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent over a period of five years (1997 – 2002)."

2,"the objective of of images for the watershed at different periods. the present study was to impact assessment of iwdp programme in katangidda nala watershed using remote sensing, gis and gps technologies."
2,introduction watershed management is perceived by many as a materials and methods viable approach for increasing agricultural production in rainfed marginal areas on sustainable basis.
2,many location and climate countries in the world including india are investing the katangidda nala watershed is located in billions of rupees in treating several millions hectares northern part of chincholi taluk of gulgabrga district of land on watershed approach.

2,"nearly people due to these programmes and in the long run 70% of the total annual precipitation, i.e. 755 mm, is to justify the need for these schemes (kallur, 1991; received during the monsoon season (june – ranadhir and ravichandran, 1991; anonymous, september) and 18% during the post-monsoon 1998)."
2,there is often not enough room for mid term season (october to november). adjustments in ongoing programmes due to lack of a katangidda nala watershed receives rainfall in proper monitoring system.
2,"the need therefore arises almost all the months, except december, january, to identify a quick and cost effective technique for february and march."
2,the mean annual rainfall of the monitoring the impact of such schemes on a ‘before watershed is 823.16 mm.
2,"the rainfall data of 1997 and project – after project’ temporal scale as well as during 2002 reveals that the watershed received good rain project implementation stage (agnohotri et al., 1986; during june to october with a total mean annual singh et al., 1989; sabins 2000). rainfall of 825 mm during 1997 and 618 during 2002."
