2,"animal-borne telemetry has revolutionised our ability to study animal 45 movement, species physiology, demography and social structures, changing 46 environments and the threats that animals are experiencing."
2,"while there will 47 always be a need for basic ecological research and discovery, the current 48 conservation crisis demands we look more pragmatically at the data required to 49 make informed management decisions."
2,"here, we define a framework that distinguishes how research using animal 51 telemetry devices can influence conservation."
2,we then discuss two critical 52 questions which aim to directly connect telemetry-derived data to applied 53 conservation decision-making: (i) would my choice of action change if i had 54 more data?
2,(ii) is the expected gain worth the money and time required to collect 55 more data?
2,policy implications.

3,2015; kays et al.
3,2015).
3,"what is remarkable about animal-borne 70 telemetry is its ability to illustrate how individuals, ranging from bees to whales, 71 interact with each other and the natural environment and reveal information 72 73 author manuscript about species habitat use, movement patterns, behaviour, physiology and the environment they inhabit (cooke et al."
3,2004).
3,"these studies have documented 74 ocean-wide dispersal events (block et al. 2011), identified the use of unexpected 75 habitats (raymond et al. 2014), fundamentally changed our understanding of 76 physical processes in the natural environment (roquet et al. 2013), and revealed 77 unknown life history characteristics of threatened and cryptic species 78 (davidson-watts et al."
3,2006).
3,it is indisputable that animal-borne telemetry has 79 enriched our understanding of the natural world and the animals that inhabit it.
3,80 with these advances there comes an opportunity to use animal telemetry- 81 derived data to combat global species declines (ceballos et al.
3,2015).
3,"much of the 82 published literature using telemetry technologies claim conservation 83 implications, yet the link between many of these studies to direct conservation 84 actions remains tenuous (campbell et al."
3,2015; jeffers & godley 2016).
3,"here, we 85 challenge the assumption by many scientists that more data will invariably lead 86 to better management and suggest an evaluation of the return-on-investment 87 from research using animal-borne telemetry devices (runge et al."
3,2011; maxwell 88 et al.
3,2014).
3,"89 given the potential of telemetry-derived data to inform resource 90 management and conservation, and the various costs involved in collecting these 91 data (e.g. financial costs of equipment and salaries, impact on mortality and 92 reproduction of animals involved (cooke et al."
3,"2004; mcmahon et al. 2012)), it is 93 essential to evaluate the conservation benefit of these research techniques."
3,"as 94 conservation science is an explicitly applied field, our aim is to differentiate 95 between telemetry-derived data that improves ecological knowledge with 96 implications for broad conservation efforts versus data that have direct impact 97 on conservation decision-making."
3,our objective is to encourage researchers 98 utilising telemetry technology with an underlying conservation rationale to 99 target their research towards gathering information that is more likely to change 100 actions and maximise species persistence.

4,101 s 102 the use of telemetry devices to monitor free-ranging animals can affect 103 species conservation in many ways.
4,"to differentiate these impacts according to 104 conservation specificity and time-scale of impact, we draw from a conceptual 105 106 author manuscript model developed for ecological monitoring activities (possingham et al."
4,2012).
4,"we present this framework to distinguish how animal-borne telemetry studies, 107 specifically, can influence conservation."
4,"we frame this discussion around the 108 distinctions made among six types of graduated impact, ranging from long-term 109 and diffuse to short-term and direct (fig 1)."
4,"110 p 111 discovering new facets of life history, biology or ecology motivates many 112 scientists conducting animal-borne telemetry research."
4,the driver of this work is 113 often pure ecological enquiry (hart & hyrenbach 2009; donaldson et al.
4,2014).
4,"114 through exploratory science, telemetry-derived data can generate novel findings 115 or improve existing knowledge."
4,it is possible that this knowledge will indeed 116 influence conservation actions at some point.
4,"for example, radio-tracking 117 studies in the uk revealed that protected species of pipistrellus bats, which 118 cannot be distinguished through observational studies, actually exploit distinct 119 species-specific habitats and thus require individually tailored conservation 120 measures (davidson-watts et al."
4,2006).
4,"new insights of this nature will certainly 121 change conservation goals and thinking, yet the impact is often serendipitous, 122 diffuse and over long time scales."
4,"123 124 unlike other forms of monitoring, where members of the public can easily 125 participate and volunteer in the data collection process (i.e. citizen science), the 126 tagging and tracking of individuals requires special expertise and can limit the 127 role of the public to be intimately involved in data acquisition."
4,"although public 128 engagement would rarely be the sole purpose of a telemetry-based animal study, 129 the application is exciting and often engages and captivates a broad public 130 audience through social media campaigns (http://www.ocearch.org) and 131 cultural events (fig 2.)"

5,"although 135 changing perceptions and improving commitment to nature is an important 136 component of a society’s willingness to commit resources to species 137 conservation, the process can be unpredictable."
5,"138 139 author manuscript p visual aids, such as maps, can be vital knowledge brokering tools for 140 issues of conservation concern (hebblewhite & haydon 2010)."
5,maps of animal 141 movements and habitat use provide evidence of the ecological connectivity 142 between disparate geographies.
5,these findings provide visual support to unify 143 politically diverse regions or groups towards a common conservation goal and 144 encourage cross-boundary collaboration.
5,"for example, telemetry-derived data 145 reveal the movements of long-distance migrants that connect countries, 146 continents and hemispheres."
5,"these studies underpin multi-lateral initiatives 147 such as the east asian australasian flyway (http://www.eaaflyway.net/), the 148 convention for migratory species (www.cms.int), as well as species focused 149 initiatives such as sea turtle conservation under the coral triangle initiative for 150 coral reefs, fisheries, and food security (beger et al."
5,2015).
5,"151 152 tactical research is research that is not of immediate use to solve a 153 management problem, but is prioritized because a researcher uses their 154 experience to determine that it is likely to be important in the near future."
5,"for 155 example, we know that many animals experience different and varied 156 magnitudes of threats across migration routes."
5,"therefore, the success of an 157 action taken in a nesting site may prove futile if threats at important stopover, 158 bottleneck or refugia sites are not identified and mitigated."
5,"committing 159 resources to monitor and learn about unknown spatial processes using 160 telemetry technologies, such as identifying migratory pathways, can determine 161 what state- and time- dependent actions will deliver the greatest benefit to the 162 population’s viability (runge et al."
5,2014; cooke et al.
5,2016).
5,"however, there is a 163 point where investing in tactical research returns marginal benefits to 164 conservation decision-making relative to solving urgent problems (possingham 165 et al."
5,2012).

6,167 telemetry-derived data can also identify which conservation actions to 168 take -or not take- within the adaptive management framework (holling 1978; 169 mcfadden et al.
6,2011).
6,adaptive management capitalises on opportunities to 170 improve the effectiveness of management strategies as new knowledge is gained 171 172 author manuscript (mccarthy & possingham 2007; grantham et al.
6,2009).
6,"this may be a “passive” process, which involves reviewing the performance of past or current actions to 173 alter future actions, or “active”, where there is a conscious effort to balance 174 knowledge acquisition and conservation action."
6,these management programs 175 maintain well-established monitoring protocols and are capable of responding to 176 observed changes in populations.
6,"for example, biotelemetry research on 177 anadromous salmon has led to an improved understanding of mortality events 178 from catch and release fishing interactions, and physiological factors influencing 179 spawning failure, which in turn justify restrictions on fished populations (cooke 180 et al."
6,2012).
6,181 - 182 state-dependent management requires monitoring the state of a system 183 or population to determine how best to manage it.
6,"state-dependent 184 management, such as quota setting for harvestable species is the most direct way 185 for telemetry derived-data to influence species conservation."
6,these research 186 techniques are already powering new approaches that integrate individual- 187 based movement information and decision theory.
6,"for instance, dynamic ocean 188 management is an approach that changes in space and time in response to the 189 shifting nature of the ocean, the animals in it, and its users based on the 190 integration of current biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data 191 (maxwell et al."
6,2015).
6,some of these applications use telemetry-derived data to 192 alter spatial management over short timeframes (lewison et al.
6,2015).
6,this has 193 benefits for mitigating dynamic threats such as bycatch from seasonal fishing 194 effort (hobday et al.
6,2010).
6,195 - 196 it is clear that many studies using animal-borne telemetry have the 197 potential to inform conservation.
6,we have discussed several classes of impacts 198 delivering important benefits to society and species.

7,200 the research.
7,"here, we present a framework that can allow researchers to ask: “if 201 that effort could have been placed directly into management and 202 implementation, would the species be better off?”"
7,"203 we focus the remaining discussion on how to improve the conservation 204 205 author manuscript return-on-investment in research using animal-borne telemetry and argue that to do so, the ecological knowledge derived from these studies needs to inform 206 and guide management actions (mcdonald-madden et al."
7,2010).
7,several 207 excellent reviews discuss the potential of using telemetry technology for species 208 management (cooke 2008; godley et al.
7,2008; metcalfe et al.
7,2012; hays et al. 209 2016) and policy (barton et al.
7,2015).
7,"yet, these reviews underemphasise the 210 importance of defining clear links from research to actions."
7,"similarly, allen and 211 singh (2016) recently developed the movement management framework - a first 212 attempt to formally integrate movement information into a decision-making 213 process."
7,"however, the authors overlooked critical aspects of modern decision 214 science, namely the importance of setting explicit quantitative objectives, and 215 how movement data can help screen and select actions at the beginning of the 216 planning process based on their associated costs, social and economic 217 acceptability and likelihood of success (mcgowan & possingham 2016)."
7,figure 3 218 highlights two key questions that serve to directly connect research using 219 animal-borne telemetry to applied conservation decision-making.
7,"220 221 to know this, quantifiable objectives must first be established so that 222 actions can be evaluated based on their ability to improve the overall benefit of 223 the conservation intervention (tear et al."
7,2005).
7,"table 1 provides some 224 examples of how the results from animal research using telemetry technology 225 enables managers to choose between conservation actions that abate threats to 226 population growth rates, habitat quantity, quality, connectivity, and deliver 227 outcomes for specific objectives."
7,"we also note that telemetry techniques can play 228 a major role in reducing uncertainty about threats themselves, which may be a 229 necessary step before mitigating actions can be prescribed."
7,"however, we stress 230 that just because there is uncertainty in an ecological variable, parameter, or 231 threatening process, it does not mean that reducing that uncertainty facilitates 232 better decisions or leads to better management (runge et al."
7,2011).

8,233 we draw from a trend in the movement ecology literature to track 234 individual occupancy within and around established protected areas to illustrate 235 this point.
8,"the rationale underlying these studies is often to inform protected 236 area design, as data reveal that changes are needed to better capture the 237 238 author manuscript movements and habitat-use of the tracked population."
8,"a fundamental yet often ignored aspect of these studies is that once established, protected area 239 boundaries are very slow to change."
8,"given that planning horizons can be decades 240 long (grantham et al. 2009), these findings likely fall within the diffuse impact 241 category of raising public concern and awareness about protection deficiencies 242 rather than delivering direct benefits in the near-term."
8,"243 while telemetry-derived data may reveal major gaps in contemporary 244 conservation practices, a mechanism to take the recommended action is also 245 required to achieve direct influence over conservation."
8,"for example, if the 246 objective is to maximize the population size of a marine species, money spent on 247 tracking individuals around a protected area could be more optimally spent on 248 threat mitigation, such as fisheries regulations outside the boundaries, 249 nesting/breeding site patrols, or bycatch reduction strategies."
8,"from a decision 250 science perspective, we don’t necessarily need to know the movements of 251 individuals to best achieve the objective."
8,"252 i 253 our imperfect knowledge of natural systems often leads to the assertion 254 that a greater understanding of ecological processes, spatial data and/or detailed 255 parameters will always improve decisions."
8,"however, from a conservation 256 decision-making perspective, investments in advancing basic ecological science 257 to aid conservation can redirect resources away from management."
8,"given this 258 quandary, how does one decide whether or not to invest in more data collection?"
8,"259 we can resolve this using an approach relatively new to ecology and 260 conservation – value of information analysis (voi), a quantitative tool for 261 incorporating uncertainty into decision making (canessa et al."
8,2015; williams & 262 johnson 2015).
8,value of information analysis can be used to examine the trade- 263 off between the ability of new information to reduce decision uncertainty and 264 the costs of collecting more data; which uncertainties may be most important to 265 reduce in order to improve gains in management outcomes (runge et al.
8,2011); this article is protected by copyright.

9,266 or what the financial value of gaining new information is worth to management 267 (maxwell et al.
9,2014).
9,268 maxwell et al. (2014) provide an excellent example of using value of 269 information analysis for wildlife conservation.
9,"in this study, the authors 270 271 author manuscript considered several possible actions that can be taken to maximize the growth rate of a declining koala phascolarctos cinereus population."
9,"these include 272 building wildlife passages to avoid vehicle collisions, allocating resources to dog 273 owners to prevent attacks, and securing koala habitat."
9,the management decision 274 relied on uncertain information about demography and movement so one could 275 easily have argued for a tracking study to inform the decision.
9,"however, 276 investing in telemetry devices for research a priori would have been misguided 277 as the value of information analysis showed optimal management decisions were 278 not sensitive to these uncertainties, but were primarily driven by the cost- 279 efficiency of the actions and the management budget (maxwell et al."
9,2014).
9,"280 i - - - 281 - 282 to date, there are only a few examples of using value of information analysis 283 to inform management decisions, and even fewer using telemetry–derived data."
9,284 the potential benefits from this field are rarely being systematically 285 incorporated into conservation decision-making or spatial prioritisation (mazor 286 et al.
9,2016).
9,"while there will always be a need for basic ecological research and 287 discovery, the extent of the current conservation crisis demands we look more 288 pragmatically at the data required to make decisions."
9,"given the global 289 investment in telemetry devices for threatened species, we have an ethical and 290 practical obligation to maximise this investment’s benefit to conservation."
9,"to 291 improve the conservation return-on-investment in these techniques, we need 292 new tools and frameworks to effectively link the growing catalogue of animal 293 telemetry-derived data to conservation and management."
9,value of information 294 and other approaches that explicitly evaluate the value of science should play an 295 increasingly important role.
