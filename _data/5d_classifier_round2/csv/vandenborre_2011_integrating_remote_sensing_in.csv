1,"remote cepted 27 july 2010 sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited."
1,one reason for this appears to be the know- ywords: ledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community.

1,they look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation.
1,"based on our ﬁndings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into natura 2000 habitat monitoring could beneﬁt from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved."
