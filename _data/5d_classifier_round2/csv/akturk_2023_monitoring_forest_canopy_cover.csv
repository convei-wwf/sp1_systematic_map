10,this issue can be is considered one of the largest fires in turkish addressed by altering the atl08 segment history (guler & kalkan 2022).
10,the frequent size with the help of additional software forest fires in the region and subsequent (malambo & popescu 2020) and also using rehabilitation efforts make the area suitable higher-resolution satellite images such as for this study while potentially subjecting the sentinel-2.
10,"however, decreasing the resolution results to spectral misclassification during the can introduce storage-related challenges and image processing."

10,"this can be achieved by exploring alternative within the scope of this study, some areas methods for integrating datasets with varying where fcc change was observed were resolutions or by leveraging advancements in examined using google earth to verify the actual remote sensing technology that provide higher- existence of the change."
10,"however, obtaining resolution data."
10,"additionally, developing more high-resolution satellite imagery for both 2019 efficient storage and processing techniques may and 2022 for the region was only possible help overcome the challenges associated with in some instances, resulting in inconclusive large-scale studies in the gee environment. findings that were not included in the final conclusions results of this study."
