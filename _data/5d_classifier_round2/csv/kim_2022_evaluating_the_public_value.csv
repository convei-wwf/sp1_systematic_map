3,the explanation interviewees are demanded to report their residence address and presented in the questionnaire regarding the elicitation of wtp is mobile phone number at the end of the questionnaire.
3,this was as follows. required for a veriﬁcation process in which a supervisor belonging to the survey company directly called the respondent's cell phone “to improve the accuracy of early detection of cumulonimbus by after the survey was completed to ensure that each respondent had utilizing a geostationary satellite costs a considerable amount of responded to the survey properly. money.

4,in order to determine the hanemann [26].
4,"however, this model may suffer from a problem of bid amounts, the following three steps were performed."
4,"first, data low statistical efﬁciency because of considering only one question on wtp were obtained by asking the wtp in an open-ended response."
4,"for the sake of overcoming the problem, a one-and-one- question through a focus group survey of 50 people."
