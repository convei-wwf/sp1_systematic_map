2,"in europe, rice is mostly cultivated is one of the most efﬁcient manures for rice fertilization (amanullah in the mediterranean countries, with a total harvested area of et al., 2016; anisuzzaman et al., 2021). approximately 608,000 ha, 17% of which is in spain (faostat, organic fertilizers are usually quite low in nutrients, and n 2021)."
2,"the ebro delta (catalonia, ne spain) is the third largest rice release is slow compared to mineral fertilizers (hirel et al., 2011; area in spain with 21.125 ha, representing approximately 19% of the iqbal et al., 2020)."
2,"mineralisation and nutrient release rates from total rice growing area in spain (mapa, 2017). organic compounds should be considered for animal manure nitrogen (n) has been a major contributor to crop yield fertilization because these processes are essential for the increases since the 1950s, as it is one of the most important availability of nutrients to rice plants (schmidt and knoblauch, limiting nutrients for primary production in many terrestrial 2020)."
2,"thus, they may not meet the n requirement in a short period ecosystems."
2,"therefore, increased n input often leads to a higher for rice growth, especially during the mid to late rice growth period, net primary production (geisseler and scow, 2014)."
2,about 21–25% causing substantial yield losses.
2,"it must also be considered that, of the total globally consumed n fertilizer is used in rice crops although it has been extensively reported that the application of (chauhan et al., 2017)."
2,"although n application increases rice livestock manure can have very positive effects on soil fertility productivity, poor n use efﬁciency is a characteristic of irrigated (reimer et al., 2023), its intensive application can pose rice systems, mainly due to the rapid loss of applied n via ammonia environmental and human health risks since it has been volatilisation to a greater extent, and also due to surface runoff, associated with water pollution, accumulation of potentially toxic leaching, and denitriﬁcation (peng et al., 2006)."
2,"furthermore, the elements, pathogen spreading and soil nutrient imbalance long-term application of mineral fertilizers to rice contributes to (rathnayake et al., 2023)."
2,"exhaustive analysis must be carried out considerably higher production costs and to environmental before the manure application and keeping track of the effects of pollution by increasing soil acidiﬁcation, degradation, and their continuous application on the soil and on the ﬁnal product compaction of arable soils, thereby restricting future plant growth that reaches consumer."

15,"these practices effectively increased n availability to rice crops as curtailed surface ammonia volatilization (mutters et al., 2010; compared to organic fertilizer strategies gaihre et al., 2023)."
15,"previous studies show the nue improvement that involves the application of n fertilizers in multiple split doses the agronomic efﬁciency associated with total nitrogen for (li et al., 2018; phongchanmixay et al., 2019; jiang-ming, 2023). the cm and ps strategies was lower than that for the min strategy, however, many split fertilizations also increase farmer’s labour primarily due to differences in the nitrogenous forms present in output and crop damage, reducing net beneﬁts."
15,"in addition, there is these fertilizers."
15,"in the min strategy, the agronomic efﬁciency no machinery available to apply the animal manures used once the associated with total nitrogen was 22.2 grain kg/kg n, which ﬁeld is ﬂooded, which hinders the fractionation of organic exceeded the values observed in both animal manure strategies fertilization."
15,"therefore, a more efﬁcient schedule must be but fell within the optimal range established in previous studies reconsidered based on plant nutrient status, crop demand and (ladha et al., 2005; xie et al., 2007; moreno-garcı́a et al., 2017). fertilizer composition, to improve yield and reduce n loss."
15,"notably, there was no signiﬁcant difference in agronomic efﬁciency ammonium-n is the dominant and preferred form for rice associated with ammonium among the three strategies."
15,"this result because it requires less energy for metabolism compared to nitrate, aligns with the ﬁndings of moreno-garcı́a et al. (2017), who although rice can still utilize nitrate."
15,"the majority of absorbed concluded that rice crops primarily utilize inorganic n in the ammonium is integrated into organic compounds within the roots. short term, with limited uptake of organic n."
15,"both cm and ps conversely, nitrate-n is more mobile within the xylem, necessitates contain a higher proportion of organic nitrogen (approximately conversion to ammonium through nitrate and nitrite reductases, 42% and 34%, respectively) compared to mineral forms, with a and is stored in the vacuoles (dobermann and fairhurst, 2000; slightly higher percentage of ammonium nitrogen in ps than in mahboob et al., 2023)."
15,interestingly our study has shown that cm.
15,"in summary, the application of organic fertilizers in rice during ﬂooding in all years, both the min and cm strategies cultivation can provide long-term nutrient beneﬁts when properly exhibited signiﬁcant peaks of water nitrate at depths of 30 and managed in agricultural practices."
15,"however, this approach comes 60 cm."
15,"this likely resulted from nitrate produced through with trade-offs, including slower nutrient release and the potential mineralization occurring between the basal fertilization and for early growth limitations if not properly managed."
15,various pre- ﬂooding stages.
15,"much of this nitrate is susceptible to leaching, treatment techniques, such as mineralization, acidiﬁcation, and with only a small fraction being potentially taken up by plants (qiu digestion, have been developed to convert nitrogenous forms and et al., 2022)."
15,"meanwhile, the min and ps strategies showed an organic compounds into more readily accessible n formulations for ammonium peak during ﬂooding."
15,"ammonium is less prone to plants (bosshard et al., 2010)."
15,improved nue could also contribute leaching due to its positive charge.
15,"additionally, ammonia losses to reduced pollutant emissions."
15,"however, the practical beneﬁts of through volatilization can be substantial, reaching up to 60% of the pre-treated animal slurry in terms of n availability for nue applied nitrogen."
15,"this is because ammonium-n is loosely bound to enhancement have shown variability under ﬁeld conditions, as water molecules and can convert into non-ionized ammonia (nh3), reported by previous studies (moeller and mueller, 2012). which can escape from water in gaseous form (choudhury and additionally, it is crucial that such treatments do not substantially kennedy, 2005; gu and yang, 2022). increase fertilizer costs, as is often the case with current methods the levels of detected ammonium were considerably lower in requiring expensive equipment and signiﬁcant energy demands the min strategy, likely due to oxide nitrate-n reduced soil (dadrasnia et al., 2021)."
15,"further research into animal manure mobility, as it readily adsorbs to clay minerals, is subject to loss pre-treatment technologies is warranted, as they hold the through volatilization, and is preferentially taken up by rice plants potential to enhance n efﬁciency in manure while simultaneously (giehl and von wiré n, 2014; gu and yang, 2022)."
15,"in contrast, cm reducing n emissions into the environment. did not provide the same quantity of available ammonium in the soil nitrate-n levels before applying any amendment vary soil, resulting in a reduced agronomic efﬁciency associated with annually due to their sensitivity to rainfall and environmental total n for this fertilizer."
15,"root system architecture varies greatly conditions (liang et al., 1991; zhao et al., 2023)."
15,"during the between cultivated rice lines (uga et al., 2013; verma et al., 2022). period from sowing to ﬂooding, nitrate n undergoes although it has been reported that root length can reach 50 cm denitriﬁcation and quickly releases as n2 and n2o following (uga et al., 2009; kawai et al., 2022; fao, 2023), previous studies ﬂooding (ponnamperuma, 1972; li et al., 2018)."
15,"in contrast, have suggested that the upper layer (0 -20 cm) of rice roots plays a ammonium n, produced through n mineralization under these key role in absorbing moisture and nutrients, which can increase the ﬂooded conditions, tends to accumulate (dobermann and grain ﬁlling rate and grain weight (deng et al., 2020)."
15,"thus, higher fairhurst, 2000; alam et al., 2019)."
15,"consequently, to prevent concentrations of nitrate below the effective rooting zone in the nitriﬁcation and subsequent denitriﬁcation, it is advisable to apply min strategy than in the other strategies suggested that nitrate basal n fertilizers as close to ﬂooding as possible."
15,"in this study, rice leaching poses a risk of groundwater pollution (huang et al., 2017; was sown well in advance of ﬂooding, a period spanning 38 days."
15,"amin et al., 2021)."
15,"cm fertilization can also pose a risk of pollution, during this time, nitrate generated through mineralization although it has a lower impact than the min strategy."
15,"moreover, processes persisted in the soil, making it accessible to the crop leaching reduced the nue of the applied fertilizers."
