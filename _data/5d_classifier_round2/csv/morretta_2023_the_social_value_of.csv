1,"as national agencies invest in high-tech infrastructures remote sensing like eo, there is a growing need for evaluate their socio-economic returns (not to be confused with their financial socio-economic impact research infrastructure returns)."
1,"however, there is no clear consensus on how to assess such social impact."
1,"building on a new field of studies of social cost–benefit analysis of research infrastructures and the socio- economic impact of investment in the space economy, we propose a new evaluation framework that considers the various stakeholders along the eo value chain."
1,"this approach can be adapted to evaluate the socio-economic returns of other high-tech public infrastructures, such as telescopes, particle accelerators, genomic platforms, synchrotron light sources, supercomputers and cloud infrastructures."
1,introduction processes through which the benefits manifest.
1,"this community includes a variety of new agents whose benefit estimation has never been evaluating the socio-economic impact of public projects and policies contemplated beyond the usual notion of science as a public good in fields such as transport, water, energy, health and environmental (salter and martin, 2001). services has a long tradition dating back to seminal works over the past a second crucial challenge relates to assigning a value to intangible centuries (dupuit, 1844; prest and turvey, 1965; sassone and schaffer, items, such as the value of knowledge generated through infrastructure; 1978; drèze and stern, 1987, boardman et al., 2018)."
1,"however, until however, while transport or energy infrastructure provides services easy very recently, economists have been unable to provide a comprehensive to identify and quantify, knowledge is not always measurable with proxy framework for analysing the benefits of government investment in indicators for quantitative analysis, e.g. patents."
1,"thus, the socio- science-based and high-tech fields generating new knowledge such as economic value of such output is often unknown because the market particle accelerators, genomic platforms, synchrotron light sources, as­ signals are uncertain or absent. trophysics and space exploration."
