1,regional planning relies on broad-scale data but ﬁne-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level.
1,this study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for ﬁne-scale implementation.
1,"two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using c-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning."
1,"the ﬁrst conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large planning units deﬁned by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha)."
1,"the second system was identiﬁed at a ﬁner scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the ﬁeld), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha)."
1,"using classiﬁcation trees, this study compared reserve-design eﬃciency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns of con- servation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales."
1,a similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identiﬁed using minimum set analysis) at the broad and ﬁne scale.
1,there was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of ﬁne-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan.
1,"however, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the ﬁne scale."
1,the use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a ﬁne scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape.
1,"the implications of moving from broad- to ﬁne-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective beneﬁts are discussed."
1,maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and ﬁne-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.

14,"planning units encompass most of the biodiversity levels (noss, 1987), most approaches to systematic conservation planning but this has been tested in very few studies (wessels et rely on planning units with various sizes and shapes. al., 1999; araujo et al., 2001)."
14,"land classes (such as this study conﬁrms that broad-scale planning units (in bhus) appear to be good surrogates for biodiversity this case, 1/16th degree square) are less eﬃcient in (cowlings and heijnis, 2001; lombard et al., 2003) achieving conservation targets than smaller units (and but they are only surrogates."

14,"large planning units are therefore more selection algorithms based on 11 vegetation types costly to implement (pressey and logan, 1998)."

14,systematic conservation planning should there- with much more ﬂexibility in choices of boundaries and fore aim at representing biodiversity patterns in its conﬁguration than larger units.
14,"when these small units hierarchical form (from land classes to species) and are linked to land tenure, they greatly facilitate the incorporating biodiversity persistence (cowling et al., implementation phase (pence et al., 2003). 1999a)."
