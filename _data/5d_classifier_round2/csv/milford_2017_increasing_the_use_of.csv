2,"aqast revised october 7, 2016 accepted october 10, 2016 aims to increase the use of earth science products in air quality-related research and to help meet air quality managers’ information needs."
2,"we conducted a web-based survey and a limited number of follow-up interviews to investigate federal, state, tribal, and local air quality managers’ perspectives on usefulness of earth science data and models, and on the impact aqast has had."
2,"the air quality managers we surveyed identified meeting the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, emissions from mobile sources, and interstate air pollution transport as top challenges in need of improved information."
2,"most survey respondents viewed inadequate coverage or frequency of satellite observations, data uncertainty, and lack of staff time or resources as barriers to increased use of satellite data by their organizations."
2,"managers who have been involved with aqast indicated that the program has helped build awareness of nasa earth science products, and assisted their organizations with retrieval and interpretation of satellite data and with application of global chemistry and climate models."
2,aqast has also helped build a network between researchers and air quality managers with potential for further collaborations.
2,"implications: nasa’s air quality applied science team (aqast) aims to increase the use of satellite data and global chemistry and climate models for air quality management purposes, by supporting research and tool development projects of interest to both groups."
2,our survey and interviews of air quality managers indicate they found value in many aqast projects and particularly appreciated the connections to the research community that the program facilitated.
2,"managers expressed interest in receiving continued support for their organizations’ use of satellite data, including assistance in retrieving and interpreting data from future geostationary platforms meant to provide more frequent coverage for air quality and other applications."
2,"introduction beyond aqast, what are opportunities and obstacles to further interactions and use of nasa science products?"
