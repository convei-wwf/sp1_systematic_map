1,"ramsar reporting pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for sentinel land and water, and due to climate change."
1,"stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, copernicus stop and reverse these processes."
1,"however, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and diﬃcult to ﬁnd and access."
1,"the freely available sentinel satellite data of the copernicus programme, as well as the landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics."
1,"however, making use of these earth observation (eo) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation."
1,"in this respect, the satellite- based wetland observation service (swos), a horizon 2020 funded project (www.swos-service.eu) has devel- oped and made disseminated monitoring approaches based on eo data, speciﬁcally designed for less experienced satellite data users."
1,"the swos monitoring tools aim at assisting countries in conducting national wetland inventories for their sustainable development goals (sdg) reporting and monitoring obligations, and additionally facilitates other monitoring obligations such as those required by the ramsar convention and supports decision-making in local conservation activities."
1,the four main components of the swos approach are: map and indicator production; software development; capacity building; and initializing the geo wetlands community portal.
