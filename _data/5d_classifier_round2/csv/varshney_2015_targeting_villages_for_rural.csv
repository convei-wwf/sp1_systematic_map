1,effective planning in poor rural areas beneﬁts from information that is not available and is difﬁcult to obtain at any appreciable scale by any means other than algorithms for estimation and inference from remotely sensed images.
1,we discuss two cases in depth: the targeting of unconditional cash transfers to extremely poor villages in sub-saharan africa and the siting and planning of solar-powered microgrids in remote villages in india.
