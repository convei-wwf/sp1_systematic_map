7,"in the non-geoss scenario, with coarse by up to 11.9 % because the coarse land rent data masked data on both wetland habitats and land rents, reserves were the heterogeneity of land costs within countries."
7,"second, cost allocated mainly to serbia and the baltic states of estonia, errors due to land allocation inefficiencies ranged from +0.3 latvia and lithuania."

7,the species losses due to incorrect habitat data were substantial.
7,"in the non-geoss discussion scenario, only 43–53 species out of 72 were covered according to the respective conservation target."
7,"several species (3–19) this study corroborates that the value of conservation were not covered at all throughout the targets, the reason planning tools (margules & pressey 2000; possingham et al. being that with coarse-scale habitat data, the model exploited 2000) depends on the availability and spatial resolution of https://doi.org/10.1017/s0376892912000331 published online by cambridge university press"

8,"conversely, the cost of acquiring the fine-scale data on land rent and wetland habitats was € 7000."
8,"while the land rent has to be paid yearly, the investment on better data is made only once."
8,"taking into consideration the magnitude of errors related to the coarse-scale data (fig. 3) and the shortcomings of target achievement (fig. 4), the benefits to conservation do essentially exceed the costs of acquiring better data."
8,trapp et al. (2012) showed that the financial benefits achieved by using eo data from a range of studies were on average four times larger than the costs.
8,a specific aspect of the habitat model in this context is the endogenous representation of reserve sizes (see also jantke et al.
8,2011).
8,"common reserve selection tools apply the basic formulation of the set-covering problem from operations research, where planning units are only selectable (c) (d) in their entirety as priority areas for conservation (see early & thomas 2007; tognelli et al."
8,2008; nhancale & smith 2011).
8,"however, there is a considerable gap between the resolution of european-wide species occurrence data and the land area available for conservation purposes in europe."
8,"therefore, the habitat model selects only those fractions of a planning unit which are necessary to fulfil the respective conservation target and are theoretically available for reservation under the given land-use pattern."
8,"if species’ area requirements cannot be fulfilled within a single planning unit, further habitat is selected in adjacent planning units."
8,marianov et al. (2008) proposed a method to select reserves for species with differential habitat size needs exceeding planning units’ areas.
8,our approach goes beyond that by also considering the fact that species’ area requirements may be smaller than per cent of total area a planning unit’s area.
8,the total area selected as priority 0 - 0.9 area for conservation in a planning unit considers mvp 1 - 10 sizes of all species protected in it.
8,this procedure allows 11 - 20 easy implementation of planning units with varying sizes.
8,"21 - 30 thus, the habitat model does not only address persistence figure 5 allocation of habitat area to european countries using criterions directly, but also does this regardless of the planning conservation target 5 as an example. (a) non-geoss scenario. (b) unit’s size."
8,"when better resolved species distribution data are habitat-data scenario. (c) cost-data scenario. (d) geoss scenario. available for europe, the analyses could easily be refined."
8,there were both advances and limitations in the data generated.
8,the empirical distribution model of wetland ecosystems at the european scale (swedi) distinguishes required data.
8,coarse or incomplete data on biodiversity and several wetland types.
8,"for the determination of existing socioeconomic aspects may hinder the effective allocation of wetland locations, several spatial datasets were jointly conservation resources (grand et al."
8,2007; bode et al. 2008; analysed.
8,potential wetland restoration sites were evaluated reside et al.
8,"2011). through geographic data analysis using rule-based statements however, the benefits of improved data come at the costs of (schleupner 2010)."
8,the orientation towards physical acquiring them.
8,the real question of importance is whether parameters and the allowance of overlapping wetland types the benefits from improved conservation plans outweigh the within the suitable restoration areas characterizes the swedi expenditure on better data.
8,"for instance, the costs of habitat model."
8,"however, the accuracy of swedi model results protection for conserving only one viable population of each of is strongly restricted by the availability and quality of the 72 included wetland species is estimated at € 45 million per geographical data."
8,soil information is generally poor and often year for the non-geoss scenario with coarse-scale datasets misleading with regard to wetland functionality.
8,another (fig. 2a).
8,the analysis of this solution with the fine-scale uncertainty involves the current state of existing wetland data reveals that 19 species were erroneously omitted from ecosystems.
8,swedi is unable to assess the naturalness of the proposed reserve system (fig. 4) and that costs and the site.
8,"nevertheless, validation with independent datasets https://doi.org/10.1017/s0376892912000331 published online by cambridge university press"

9,"the second dataset generated for this study included land rents at a 5 resolution based on hrus, which arranged acknowledgements heterogeneous land attributes into discrete classes."
9,"each combination of altitude, soil and slope class was considered we thank the many volunteer fieldworkers who contributed to be unique."
9,"however, within a certain class element, the to the species atlas records."
9,the helpful comments of three response was considered to be homogenous.
9,"thus, depending anonymous reviewers on earlier versions of the manuscript on the number of classes for each attribute, hrus involved greatly improved the paper."
9,this study has received financial more or less approximation error.
9,"for example, the first support from the michael otto foundation for environmental altitude class of our classification scheme ranged from the protection, the cluster of excellence integrated climate lowest level to 300 m above sea level."
9,"all locations within this system analysis and prediction (clisap) and the european range were represented through the same weighted average commission through the fp6 projects, european non- altitude value."
9,"furthermore, we used weighted, productivity- food agriculture (enfa), global earth observation – based, marginal value differences as proxies for differences benefit estimation: now, next and emerging (geobene), in land rental values between hrus."
9,"in reality, other factors and the fp7 project, a european approach to geoss related to markets and local policies may influence local land (eurogeoss). rental values."
