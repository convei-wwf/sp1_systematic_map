1,their assessments were used to direct a supervised classiﬁcation of the image and create habitat maps with indigenously deﬁned habitat classes.
1,results show that these participatory remote sensing techniques produce accurate broad-scale marine habitat maps that can be useful to managers and decision makers.
1,participatory methods that draw from indigenous habitat deﬁnitions also have the potential beneﬁt of generating new insights about socio-ecological processes and enhancing local acceptance and understanding of conservation projects by allowing stakeholders to actively contribute in management planning.
