<p>I put this list of topic terms into ChatGPT with the prompt similar to: “Here is a list of topics, each with a set of terms associated with each topic. For each topic, provide a topic name of three words or fewer.” I then provided the list of topics, with associated terms saved above, to the ChatGPT interface. The results were saved in <code>_data/chatgpt/three_word_topics.csv</code>.</p>
