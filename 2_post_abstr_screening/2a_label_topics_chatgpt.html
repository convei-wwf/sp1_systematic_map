<p>I put this list of topic terms into ChatGPT with the prompt similar to: “Here is a list of topics, each with a set of terms associated with each topic. For each topic, provide a topic name of three words or fewer.” I then provided the list of topics, with associated terms saved above, to the ChatGPT interface. The results were saved in <code>_data/chatgpt/three_word_topics.csv</code>.</p>

<p>For each article, how many topics were identified, and what is the probability distribution of membership in each topic? Articles where no topics were dominant might be only tangentially related to our search. Keep the highest probability topics that add up to at least 75% probability (e.g., if one topic prob is greater than 75%, keep it; if two topics add up to 75%, keep those, etc).</p>
