Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya is
   performed by integrating 28 causative factors on C-28(28) combinations
   on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression
   (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random
   forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the
   terrain is classified into `None' (with: 0.0 < LSI <= 0.17), `Low'
   (with: 0.17 < LSI <= 0.34), `Moderate' (with: 0.34 < LSI <= 0.51),
   `High' (with: 0.51 < LSI <= 0.68),'Very High' (with: 0.68 < LSI <= 0.85)
   and `Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated
   through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation
   analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing
   comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best
   integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of
   0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like
   population density, number of households, building types, building
   height and building density has demarketed approximately 21\% of the
   region under `Very High' to `Severe' socioeconomic risk zone while about
   36\% area are classified under `Very High' to `Severe' structural risk
   zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region.
   Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in
   the `Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein
   near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and
   microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified
   debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface
   conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure
   analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value
   that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is
   seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the `Low to Moderate' landslide
   susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the `High'
   landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the `Very High
   to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both
   gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability
   analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2)
   and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these
   parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison
   demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the `High to Severe'
   landslide susceptible zones.},

Title = {Measuring the U.S. outdoor recreation economy, 2012-2016},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND
   MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper summarizes the methodology and results of newly-released
   federal statistics describing the U.S. outdoor recreation economy. These
   new statistics show that outdoor recreation represented 2.2\% of the
   U.S. economy from 2012 to 2016, similar in size to the utilities and
   mining industries. Boating/fishing contributed \$38.2 billion to gross
   output in 2016, followed by game areas (includes golfing and tennis)
   (\$36.3 billion) and RVing (\$30.8 billion). Additionally, more than 4.5
   million jobs were generated by the outdoor recreation economy in 2016,
   resulting in \$213.6 billion of compensation paid to U.S. workers. These
   new statistics provide for the first time a comprehensive and consistent
   measure of the value of outdoor recreation to the U.S. economy. Any
   future updates to these statistics may consider adding regional data and
   a longer time series to provide even more meaningful statistics to
   researchers and policymakers.
   Management implications: New statistics provide estimates of the outdoor
   recreation economy from an unbiased source: the outdoor recreation
   satellite account (ORSA). The ORSA provides a solid framework to measure
   the outdoor economy and can be used
   -To show the significance of the outdoor recreation economy
   -To compare its relevance with other economic sectors
   -To examine the growth of the outdoor recreation economy over time in a
   detailed manner
   -To pay attention to specific outdoor recreation activities and their
   respective changes over time.},

Title = {Interannual variation in commercial oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming
   in the sea (Florianopolis, Brazil, 27 degrees 44 ` S; 48 degrees 33 ` W)
   in relation to temperature, chlorophyll a and associated oceanographic
   conditions},

Abstract = {Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful
   conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of
   high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely
   dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g.
   temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be
   related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined
   with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas)
   reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in
   a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W
   30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea
   surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects
   of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four
   consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07,
   2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time
   during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to
   juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture
   management and genetics were standardized significant differences
   verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental
   effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing
   data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual
   variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed
   to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main
   factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of
   negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other
   hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected
   by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased
   by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW,
   related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on
   occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater
   penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity
   nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may
   also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino
   period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a
   levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number
   of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain
   northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the
   La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher
   chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and
   penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased
   occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the
   potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an
   important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture.

Title = {Mapping Oyster Reef Distribution Using Kompsat-2/3 and Linear Spectral
   Unmixing Algorithm - A Case Study at Hwangdo Tidal Flat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {102},
Pages = {246-253},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Oyster areas are widely used as species of biological indicator, and
   they are also the most important shellfish in terms of ecosystem
   economic valuation. Oysters are production on the west coast before 2007
   accounted for about 5 \% of the nation's total production, but the 2007
   Hebei Spirit oil spill caused production to plunge to less than 1 \%.
   Therefore, spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs are required to
   help local authorities define management strategies. In this study,
   Kompsat-2/3 was used to map oyster reef distribution and analyze the
   distribution of oyster reefs based on linear spctral unmixing in Hwangdo
   tidal flat. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions
   with a field spectroradiometer, was used to conduct linear spectral
   unmixing classifications on Kompsat-2/3 data. The classification result
   shows very high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 95 \% or more, and
   there were misclassifications in some areas. The most causes of
   misclassification are the similarity of spectral characteristics and the
   limitations of the spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite images.
   For this reason, it was difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs
   and area distributed with many macrobenthos, and small-young oyster
   reefs were difficult to classify due to very weak reflectivity. In
   addition, the sand bar, it was is difficult to distinguish between
   oyster reefs related to dead reefs and sandbars because of the high
   reflectivity of these areas in the imagery. As a result of analyzing the
   change in the oyster reef area, it increased in 2019 compared to that in
   2015. Especially, the oyster reef area increased in 30-50 \% sand
   content and decreased in 20-30 \% and 60-70 \%. The changes of sand
   sediment seem to affect the distribution of oyster reefs. This study may
   be useful for mapping the distribution of oyster reefs and understanding
   the spatial variation of their habitat.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Variations and Influencing Factors of Country-Level
   Carbon Emissions for Northeast China Based on VIIRS Nighttime Lighting
   Data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This paper constructs a county-level carbon emission inversion model in
   Northeast China. We first fit the nighttime light data of the Visible
   Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with local energy consumption
   statistics and carbon emissions data. We analyze the temporal and
   spatial characteristics of county-level energy-related carbon emissions
   in Northeast China from 2012 to 2020. At the same time, we use the
   geographic detector method to analyze the impact of various
   socio-economic factors on county carbon emissions under the single
   effect and interaction. The main results are as follows: (1) The
   county-level carbon emission model in Northeast China is relatively more
   accurate. The regression coefficient is 0.1217 and the determination
   coefficient R-2 of the regression equation is 0.7722. More than 80\% of
   the provinces have an error of less than 25\%, meeting the estimation
   accuracy requirements. (2) From 2012 to 2020, the carbon emissions of
   county-level towns in Northeast China showed a trend of increasing first
   and then decreasing from 461.1159 million tons in 2012 to 405.752
   million tons in 2020. It reached a peak of 486.325 million tons in 2014.
   (3) The regions with higher carbon emission growth rates are
   concentrated in the northern and coastal areas of Northeast China. The
   areas with low carbon emission growth rates are mainly distributed in
   some underdeveloped areas in the south and north in Northeast China. (4)
   Under the effect of the single factor urbanization rate, the added
   values of the secondary industry and public finance income have higher
   explanatory power to regional emissions. These factors promote the
   increase of county carbon emissions. When fiscal revenue and expenditure
   and the added value of the secondary industry and per capita GDP
   interact with the urbanization rate, respectively, the explanatory power
   of these factors on regional carbon emissions will be enhanced and the
   promotion of carbon emissions will be strengthened. The research results
   are helpful for exploring the changing rules and influencing factors of
   county carbon emissions in Northeast China and for providing data
   support for low-carbon development and decision making in Northeast
   China.},

Title = {LiDAR as a Tool for Assessing Timber Assortments: A Systematic
   Literature Review},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Forest ecosystems strongly contribute to the mitigation of climate
   change impacts through the carbon stored in forests and through
   harvested wood products, such as sawed wood and furniture, which are
   obtained from many types of timber assortments. Timber assortments are
   defined as log sections of specific dimensions (log length and
   maximum/minimum end diameters), gathered from felled trunks, that have
   both specific commercial timber utilisation and economic value. However,
   it is challenging to discriminate and assess timber assortment types,
   especially within a forest stand before the forest has been harvested.
   Accurate estimations of timber assortments are a fundamental
   prerequisite in supporting forest holdings and assisting practitioners
   in the optimisation of harvesting activities and promoting forest wood
   chains, in addition to forest policy and planning. Based on the
   georeferenced points cloud tool, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is
   a powerful technology for rapidly and accurately depicting forest
   structure, even if the use of LiDAR for timber assortments estimation is
   lacking and poorly explored. This systematic literature review aimed to
   highlight the state-of-the-art applications of the LiDAR systems
   (spaceborne; airborne, including unmanned aerial UASs; and terrestrial)
   to quantify and classify different timber assortment types. A total of
   304 peer-reviewed papers were examined. The results highlight a constant
   increment of published articles using LiDAR systems for forest-related
   aspects in the period between 2000 and 2021. The most recurring
   investigation topics in LiDAR studies were forest inventory and forest
   productivity. No studies were found that used spaceborne LiDAR systems
   for timber assortment assessments, as these were conditioned by the time
   and sample size (sample size = similar to 12 m/similar to 25 m of laser
   footprint and 0.7 m/60 m of space along the track for ICESat-2, GEDI and
   time = since 2018). Terrestrial LiDAR systems demonstrated a higher
   performance in successfully characterising the trees belonging to an
   understory layer. Combining airborne/UAS systems with terrestrial LiDAR
   systems is a promising approach to obtain detailed data concerning the
   timber assortments of large forest covers. Overall, our results reveal
   that the interest of scientists in using machine and deep learning
   algorithms for LiDAR processes is steadily increasing.},

Title = {Drivers of Land Use Change in Lantapan, Bukidnon, Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been the key in addressing the growing
   demand for food production both for home consumption and supplying the
   market. The market demand on agricultural production has therefore
   triggered change in land use. For farmers, it makes a lot of economic
   sense to venture on high value agricultural products where land and
   labor capital is limited
   This study provided a temporal analysis that would describe the land use
   changes in Barangay Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, with emphasis on the
   driving forces and how they influence the farming decision of farmers.
   Participatory mapping and focused group discussion were conducted with
   selected farmer-residents, and a satellite image to generate the
   historical land use map of barangay Songco. Maps were digitized and land
   areas were computed using the ArcGis9 field calculator to derive the
   estimated area occupied by a certain land use.
   Land use change in Songco is influenced by a high demand of agricultural
   products. Furthermore, inappropriate farming systems such as up and down
   planting that vegetable growers practice has caused severe soil erosion,
   leading to the decline on crop yield due to the removal of soil
   nutrients. Moreover, the off-site effect of soil erosion are siltation
   and sedimentation which carry traces of pesticides and chemical
   contaminants into water bodies which are likely to degrade water quality
   and may create health problems for farm families and those living
   downstream (Coxhead et. al. 2005).},

Abstract = {Vegetation species maps are useful for forestry managements and
   environmental ecological study. From the forestry management, broad and
   conifer leaf forest should be mapped. In addition to them, land-cover
   mapping data with high resolution is needed as validation data sets for
   low resolution's land-cover mapping results. SGLI sensor on board GCOM-C
   satellite, which will be launched in 2014, has 250m spatial resolution
   and it's data will be used for making global land-cover data set. ALOS
   satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor and PRISM sensor.
   AVNIR-2 sensor has four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830nm with 10-m
   spatial resolution. PRISMsensor has panchromatic band from 520nm to 770
   nm with 2.5m spatial resolution. If use the both of image, pseudo high
   spatial multi-spectal image can be processed. Because of the spatial
   resolution and multi-spectral information, these sensor data are
   expected to useful for making high resolution land-cover data set. We
   have developed Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM)(Zhang, L.F.
   et. al, 2006 (Zhang et al., 2006)) and Modified Vegetation Index based
   on UPDM (MVIUPD)(Zhang, L. F. et. al, 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) and
   Xiong, Y., 2005 (?)) for satellite sensor data analysis for land cover
   mapping and vegetation monitoring. In the UPDM method, three
   coefficients of water, vegetation and soil is calculated using three
   standard patterns of water, vegetation and soil. One of this method's
   characteristics is the UPDM coefficients from different sensors for the
   same object being same as each other. The capability of vegetation
   species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR-2 data and UPDM method.
   Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest,
   orchard and grass land can be classified using AVNIR-2 summer and winter
   data. In this study, AVNIR-2 and PRISM data are used for vegetation
   types mapping using universal pattern decomposition method. Firstly, the
   pan-sharpen image was processed using AVNIR-2 and PRISM data. Each
   band's Digital Number (DN) value of AVNIR-2's band is calculated using
   DN of PRISM and AVNIR-2. The reflectance of AVNIR-2 is calculated from
   calculated DN values. UPDM method is applied to the set of re-calculated
   reflectance. Using the coefficients of UPDM and vegetation index,
   evergreen forest and deciduous forest were classified using two seasonal
   data. These results are compared with forest resource information. The
   tendency was agree with each other, although detailed validation is
   needed. From these results, the UPDM method can be applied to
   pan-sharpen image and the pan-sharpen image can be used for vegetation
   type classification. In the near future, calculation methods with
   retaining the original reflectance should be improved.},

   Species in the Gulf of Mexico},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Effective management of human activities affecting listed species
   requires understanding both threats and animal habitat-use patterns.
   However, the extent of spatial overlap between high-use foraging areas
   (where multiple marine species congregate) and anthropogenic threats is
   not well-known. Our modeling approach incorporates data on sea turtle
   spatial ecology and a suite of threats in the Gulf of Mexico to identify
   and map ``hot spots{''} of threats to two imperiled turtle species. Of
   all 820 ``high{''} threats grid cells, our tracked turtles foraged at
   least 1 day in 77\% of them. Although threat data were not available
   outside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, our map of turtle and threat
   ``hot spots{''} can be incorporated in future more comprehensive threat
   analyses for the region. Knowledge of these shared foraging- and
   threat-areas can assist managers charged with designing effective
   conservation and population recovery strategies, in future habitat
   modeling efforts, and in designations of Gulf of Mexico habitat with
   high conservation value.},

Title = {Tempo-Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment from the Perspective
   of Human Engineering Activity},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The expansion of mountainous urban areas and road networks can influence
   the terrain, vegetation, and material characteristics, thereby altering
   the susceptibility of landslides. Understanding the relationship between
   human engineering activities and landslide occurrence is of great
   significance for both landslide prevention and land resource management.
   In this study, an analysis was conducted on the landslide caused by
   Typhoon Megi in 2016. A representative mountainous area along the
   eastern coast of China-characterized by urban development,
   deforestation, and severe road expansion-was used to analyze the spatial
   distribution of landslides. For this purpose, high-precision Planet
   optical remote sensing images were used to obtain the landslide
   inventory related to the Typhoon Megi event. The main innovative
   features are as follows: (i) the newly developed patch generating
   land-use simulation (PLUS) model simulated and analyzed the driving
   factors of land-use land-cover (LULC) from 2010 to 2060; (ii) the
   innovative stacking strategy combined three strong ensemble
   models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
   Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-to calculate the distribution
   of landslide susceptibility; and (iii) distance from road and LULC maps
   were used as short-term and long-term dynamic factors to examine the
   impact of human engineering activities on landslide susceptibility. The
   results show that the maximum expansion area of built-up land from 2010
   to 2020 was 13.433 km(2), mainly expanding forest land and cropland
   land, with areas of 8.28 km(2 )and 5.99 km(2), respectively. The
   predicted LULC map for 2060 shows a growth of 45.88 km(2) in the
   built-up land, mainly distributed around government residences in areas
   with relatively flat terrain and frequent socio-economic activities. The
   factor contribution shows that distance from road has a higher impact
   than LULC. The Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM model obtained the optimal AUC value
   of 0.915 in the landslide susceptibility analysis in 2016. Furthermore,
   future road network and urban expansion have intensified the probability
   of landslides occurring in urban areas in 2015. To our knowledge, this
   is the first application of the PLUS and Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM models in
   landslide susceptibility analysis in international literature. The
   research results can serve as a foundation for developing land
   management guidelines to reduce the risk of landslide failures.},

Title = {Improved estimate of the policy-relevant background ozone in the United

Abstract = {The policy-relevant background (PRB) ozone is defined by the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the surface ozone concentration
   that would be present over the US in the absence of North American
   anthropogenic emissions. It is intended to provide a baseline for risk
   and exposure assessments used in setting the National Ambient Air
   Quality Standard (NAAQS). We present here three-year statistics
   (2006-2008) of PRB ozone over the US calculated using the GEOS-Chem
   global 3-D model of atmospheric composition with 1/2 degrees x 2/3
   degrees horizontal resolution over North America and adjacent oceans (2
   degrees x 2.5 degrees for the rest of the world). We also provide
   estimates of the US background (no anthropogenic US emissions) and
   natural background (no anthropogenic emissions worldwide and
   pre-industrial methane). Our work improves on previous GEOS-Chem PRB
   estimates through the use of higher model resolution, 3-year statistics,
   better representation of stratospheric influence, and updated emissions.
   PRB is particularly high in the intermountain West due to high
   elevation, arid terrain, and large-scale subsidence. We present for this
   region a detailed model evaluation showing that the model is successful
   in reproducing ozone exceedances up to 70 ppbv. However, the model
   cannot reproduce PRB-relevant exceptional events associated with
   wildfires or stratospheric intrusions. The mean PRB estimates for spring
   summer are 27 +/- 8 ppbv at low-altitude sites and 40 +/- 7 ppbv at
   high-altitude sites. Differences between the PRB simulation and the
   natural simulation indicate a mean enhancement from intercontinental
   pollution and anthropogenic methane of 9 ppbv at low-altitude sites and
   13 ppbv at high-altitude sites. The PRB is higher than average when
   ozone exceeds 60 ppbv, particularly in the intermountain West. Our PRB
   estimates are on average 4 ppbv higher than previous GEOS-Chem studies
   and we attribute this to higher lighting, increasing Asian emissions,
   and improved model resolution. Whereas previous studies found no
   occurrences of PRB exceeding 60 ppbv, we find here some occurrences in
   the intermountain West. The annual 4th-highest PRB values in the
   intermountain West are typically 50-60 ppbv, as compared to 35-45 ppbv
   in the East or on the West Coast. Such high PRB values in the
   intermountain West suggest that special consideration of this region may
   be needed if the ozone NAAQS is decreased to a value in the 60-70 ppbv
   range. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Eighty-metre resolution 3D soil-attribute maps for Tasmania, Australia},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {8},
Pages = {932-955},
Abstract = {Until recently, Tasmanian environmental modelling and assessments
   requiring important soil inputs relied on conventionally derived soil
   polygons that were mapped up to 75 years ago. In the `Wealth from Water'
   project, digital soil mapping (DSM) was used in a pilot project to map
   the suitability of 20 different agricultural enterprises over 70 000 ha.
   Following on from this, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries
   Parks Water and Environment has applied DSM to existing soil datasets to
   develop enterprise suitability predictions across the whole state in
   response to further expansion of irrigation schemes. The soil surfaces
   generated have conformed and contributed to the Terrestrial Ecosystem
   Research Network Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia, a superset of
   GlobalSoilMap.net specifications. The surfaces were generated at 80-m
   resolution for six standard depths and 13 soil properties (e.g. pH, EC,
   organic carbon, sand and silt percentages and coarse fragments), in
   addition to several Tasmanian enterprise-suitability soil-attribute
   parameters.
   The modelling used soil site data with available explanatory state-wide
   spatial variables, including the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
   digital elevation model and derivatives, gamma-radiometrics, surface
   geology, and multi-spectral satellite imagery. The DSM has delivered
   realistic mapping for most attributes, with acceptable validation
   diagnostics and relatively low uncertainty ranges in data-rich areas,
   but performed marginally in terms of uncertainty ranges in areas such as
   the World Heritage-listed Southwest of the state, with a low existing
   soil site density. Version 1.0 soil-attribute maps form the foundations
   of a dynamic and evolving new infrastructure that will be improved and
   re-run with the future collection of new soil data. The Tasmanian
   mapping has provided a localised integration with the National Soil and
   Landscape Grid of Australia, and it will guide future investment in soil
   information capture by quantitatively targeting areas with both high
   uncertainties and important ecological or agricultural value.},

Title = {The feasibility study of offshore wind energy potential in Kijal,
   Malaysia: the new alternative energy source exploration in Malaysia},
Journal = {ENERGY EXPLORATION \& EXPLOITATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {329-344},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many countries have been endeavoring to explore and exploit
   the offshore wind energy in terms of solving the problem of limitations
   of onshore wind energy. Wind energy is one of potential alternative for
   generating electricity in Malaysia. The offshore wind speed is better
   compared to onshore, so there is more potential contribution by offshore
   wind power in terms of electricity generation. This paper provides a
   summary of the offshore wind resources of the Kijal, Malaysia by
   analyzing the QuikSCAT satellite data which is available and can be
   downloaded from the WindPRO application. Based on these datasets, wind
   resources are assessed, and economical efficiency is evaluated by means
   of the expected capacity factor. Research was conducted using WindPRO
   and WAsP software to assess the potential of wind energy along the South
   China Sea in Kijal, Terengganu. Seven models of the wind turbines with
   different rated power; 110kW, 225kW, 275kW, 600kW, 850kW, 1000kW and
   1250kW are taken for energy and economic feasibility analyses. The wind
   turbine with rated power 850 kW was indicated as the best wind turbine
   for installation in Kijal based on its best capacity factor, 26.8\% In
   economical aspect, Malaysia does not have Feed in Tariff (FiT) rates for
   offshore wind projects, thus the range of predicted FiT rates, RM 0.30
   to RM 2.00 were tested by using Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback
   Period (PBP) calculation. Finally, the conducive FiT rates for wind
   projects with secured investment were identified and the rates were in
   range RM 0.80 to RM 1.38. The overall results suggest that the wind
   energy has a bright future for use as an alternative source for
   generating electricity in Kijal, Malaysia.},

Title = {Rapid evolution of water resources in the Senegal delta},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {34-47},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent decades major water developments have led to an agricultural
   transformation of the Senegal delta both in Senegal and Mauritania. This
   otherwise, semi-arid region of the Sahel band now has an abundant supply
   of freshwater all year round mostly used for irrigation and urban water
   supply, including for the capital cities of the two countries. Archives
   from the Landsat satellites and in-situ hydrographs were used in this
   paper to retrace and analyse the hydrological changes that have taken
   place in the region since the middle of the 20th century. The satellite
   archives indicate that the area covered by irrigation increased by one
   order of magnitude from 73 km(2) in 1973 to similar to 770 km(2) in
   2010. The observed hydrological changes are complex, multi-faceted and
   often of great magnitude. If the water cycle was representative of
   natural conditions in the early 1980s, it is now representative of a
   heavily modified system controlled and impacted by human activities. The
   first hydraulic infrastructure was installed in 1947 to enable the Lake
   of Guiers to become the main water supply for Dakar. Two large dams were
   built on the Senegal River in the mid-1980s that modified the
   hydrological regime of the river by 1) preventing seawater intrusion, 2)
   raising the stage of the river and-of Lake of Guiers and 3) moderating
   floods. Another recent hydrological change in the delta was the opening
   of river mouth in 2003, which has led to a reduction of the average
   water level while increasing the semi-diurnal tidal wave between the
   river mouth and Diama. Each phase of these river regime changes and each
   step of the irrigation expansion are expressed in localised changes in
   the physical groundwater system. Increasingly, the retroaction from the
   shallow aquifer systems is observed as a rise of the saline water table.
   This poses a threat to the environmental and agricultural value of the
   region, and the salinization of the soils. Mitigating actions for this
   threat are currently being envisaged by the authorities. (C) 2016

Title = {Detecting collective behaviour in animal relocation data, with
   application to migrating caribou},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Collective behaviour can allow populations to have emergent responses
   to uncertain environments, driven by simple interactions among nearby
   individuals. High-throughput ethological studies, where individual
   behaviour is closely observed in each member of a population (typically
   in the laboratory or by simulation), have revealed that collective
   behaviour in populations requires only rudimentary cognitive abilities
   in individuals and could therefore represent a widespread adaptation to
   life in an uncertain world. However, the ecological significance of
   collective behaviour is not yet well understood, as most studies to date
   have been confined to specialized situations that allow intensive
   monitoring of individual behaviour.
   2. Here, we describe a way to screen for collective behaviour in
   ecological data that is sampled at a coarser resolution than the
   underlying behavioural processes. We develop and test the method in the
   context of a well-studied model for collective movement in a noisy
   environmental gradient. The large-scale distribution patterns associated
   with collective behaviour are difficult to distinguish from the
   aggregated responses of independent individuals in this setting because
   independent individuals also align to track the gradient. However, we
   show that collective idiosyncratic deviations from the mean gradient
   direction have high predictive value for detecting collective behaviour.
   We describe a method of testing for these deviations using the average
   normalized velocity of the population.
   3. We demonstrate the method using data from satellite tracking collars
   on the migration patterns of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), recovering
   evidence that collective behaviour is a key driver of caribou migration
   patterns. We find moreover that the relative importance of collective
   behaviour fluctuates seasonally, concurrent with the timing of migration
   and reproduction.
   4. Collective behaviour is a potentially widespread dynamic property of
   populations that can, in some cases, be detected in coarsely sampled
   ecological data.},

Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},

Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Reliable and accurate environmental state prediction can help in
   long-term sustainable planning and management. Enormous land-use/
   land-cover (LULC) transformation has been increasing the carbon
   emissions (CEs) and land surface temperature (LST) around the world. The
   study aimed to (i) examine the influences of land specific CEs on LST
   dynamics and (ii) simulate future potential LULC, CEs and LST pattern of
   Khulna City Corporation. Landsat satellite images of the year 2000, 2010
   and 2020 were used to derive LULC, LST and CEs pattern and change. The
   correlation between land-use indices (NDBI, NDVI, NDWI) and LST was
   examined to explore the impacts of LULC change on LST. Unplanned
   urbanization has increased 11.79 Km(2)(26.10\%) buildup areas and 25,268
   tons of CEs during 2000-2020. The calculated R-2 value indicates the
   strong positive correlation between CEs and LST. To simulate the future
   LULC, CEs and LST pattern for the year 2030 and 2040, multi-layer
   perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC)-based artificial neural network model
   was utilized with the accuracy rate of 94.12\%, 99\% and 98.48\% for
   LULC, LST and CEs model, respectively. The simulation shows that by
   2040, buildup area will increase to 87.33\%, net CEs will increase by
   19.82x 10(4)tons, and carbon absorptions will decrease by 23. 55 x
   10(4)tons and 69.54\% of the total study area's LST will be above 39
   degrees C. Such predictions signify the necessity of implementing a
   sustainable urban development plan immediately for the sustainable,
   habitable and sound urban environment.},

Title = {Distribution and extent of benthic habitats in Puck Bay (Gulf of Gdansk,

Journal = {OCEANOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-320},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The majority of the southern Baltic Sea seabed encompasses homogenous
   soft-bottom sediments of limited productivity and low biological
   diversity, but shallow productive areas in the coastal zone such as
   wetlands, vegetated lagoons and sheltered bays show a high variety of
   benthic habitat types offering favourable biotopic conditions for
   benthic fauna. Within Polish marine areas, semi-enclosed Puck Bay (the
   western part of the Gulf of Gdansk) features an exceptionally diverse
   environment covering a range of benthic habitats which underscores its
   unique biological value and aesthetic quality and providing an impetus
   for conservation and ecosystem-based development. Full-coverages maps on
   benthic habitats in this area are therefore a necessary foundation for
   maritime spatial planning and implementation of strategies for
   sustainable management and protection of the coastal environment. This
   study presents the first comprehensive description and distribution of
   benthic habitats in Puck Bay which were categorised using the revised
   EUNIS 2019 classification system. Typological analyses were carried out
   based on inventory datasets from 1995 to 2019 including scientific
   publications, satellite images, open databases, topographic and
   geological maps, reports, theses, information available on websites and
   unpublished data shared willingly by individual researchers and
   administrative institutions. Collating various spatial data sources,
   that were first georeferenced and then visualized using techniques
   available in ArcMap 10.4.1 software (Esri), resulted in the mapping of
   benthic habitats and sites of important and protected plant species,
   which can contribute to the high confidence in environmental assessments
   and monitoring activities. (C) 2021 Institute of Oceanology of the

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to develop a methodological approach to the
   problem of a quantitative assessment of the technical level (technical
   excellence) of geostationary telecommunication satellites (GTS). The
   technical level indicator is a quantitative measure for assessing the
   perfection of the design of a product and the quality of products
   (services) produced with its use. This is an important technical and
   economic indicator of experimental design work. The value of the
   technical level indicator is one of the determining factors in the
   competitiveness of the created space system. The paper discusses the
   existing methodological approaches to the quantitative assessment of the
   technical level of science-intensive and technically complex products.
   We present a new approach to determine the composition of technical
   performance markers for calculating the GTS technical level indicator
   allowing a formal description of the beneficial effect and a logical
   scheme for quantifying the technical level. The methodological approach
   to calculate the degree of influence of technical efficiency indicators
   on the value of the beneficial effect of the use of GTS is stated as
   well. It is based on a mathematical model of the hierarchy analysis
   introduced by T Saaty, complemented by us with mathematical models for
   the best consideration of GTS technical features. It allowed us to
   ensure control of errors and contradictions in expert judgments involved
   in the preparation of initial data of =measurable or hardly measurable
   techno-economic indicators of GTS. Due to the higher level of
   formalization of the process of quantifying the technical level and the
   application of mathematical methods used in modern decision theory, the
   developed methodological approach serves to improve the quality of
   calculations significantly and to reduce the influence of the subjective
   factor in determining the value of the technical level indicator. Based
   on the above, we developed a method for quantitative assessment of the
   GTS technical level that meets the modern requirements.},

Title = {A design of real-time unipath polarization imaging system based on
   Wollaston prism},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {A real-time polarization imaging system employing the Wollaston prism
   and a single charge-coupled device (CCD) chip covering a wavelength
   range of 400-650 nm is proposed to avoid the false polarization
   information from dynamic scenes in non-real-time polarization detection
   imaging method. An architecture consisting of telescope lens,
   collimation lens, Wollaston prism, the imaging lens and a single CCD
   chip is employed in the system. The telescope lens is used to focus the
   incoming light on an intermediate image. And after collimation, the beam
   is angularly separated by the Wollaston prism. Two beams corresponding
   to ordinary light and extraordinary light are subsequently focused on
   the CCD plane via the imaging lens. The telescope lens is designed to
   have a telecentric structure in the imaging space, and the invert of
   which is used as the collimation lens, the completely symmetrical
   structure design is used to reduce the influence of aberrations. More
   abundant details from this system can be obtained by using matched image
   post-processing strategy, which is beneficial to high-quality target
   detection with enhanced working distance and improved environment
   adaptability. After joint-designing and optimization, the system
   modulation transfer function value at cutoff frequency is higher than
   0.55, and the root-mean-square radius of the system is less than 5.3 mu
   m, which is smaller than the pixel size of the CCD detector.
   Additionally, the lateral chromatic aberration of the system is much
   smaller than the diameter of airy disk, and the absolute values of all
   kinds of aberrations are kept smaller than 0.02 at the same time. The
   calculation results show that all the aberrations are mostly corrected.
   The system imaging is numerically modeled and analyzed, and it is
   demonstrated that two intensity images with perpendicular polarization
   states appear adjacently on the CCD plane simultaneously in the imaging
   simulation. One image is formed with the fraction of the backscattered
   light polarized parallelly to the incident light, and the other with
   light polarized orthogonally to the incidence, indicating that the
   expected design is accomplished. Compared with the traditional
   amplitude-split polarization imaging system, the proposed real-time
   polarization imaging system shows that the improved performance for
   real-time detection with promoted power efficiency, spatial resolution,
   and the light crosstalk in focal plane is well handled. Moreover, the
   joint design of the whole system can compensate for the distortion
   aberration in the vertical direction of the CCD detector, which means
   that a further improvement of image quality can be expected. The
   proposed system has a promising perspective in the fields of underwater
   imaging detection, astronomical observation, remote sensing, biological
   tissues inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Title = {Quantitative estimation of sentinel-1A interferometric decorrelation
   using vegetation index},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Sentinel-1A data are widely used in interferometric synthetic aperture
   radar (InSAR) studies due to the free and open access policy. However,
   the short wavelength (C-band) of Sentinal-1A data leads to decorrelation
   in numerous applications, especially in vegetated areas. Phase blurring
   and reduced monitoring accuracy can occur owing to changes in the
   physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation during the satellite
   revisit period, which essentially makes poor use of SAR data and
   increases the time and economic costs for researchers. Interferometric
   coherence is a commonly used index to measure the interference quality
   of two single-look complex (SLC) images, and its value can be used to
   characterize the decorrelation degree. The normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) is obtained from optical images, and its value
   can be used to characterize the surface vegetation coverage. In order to
   solve the problem that Sentinel-1A decorrelation in the vegetated area
   is difficult to estimate prior to single-look complex interference, this
   paper selects a vegetated area in Sichuan Province, China as the study
   area and establishes two two-order linear quantitative models between
   Landsat8-derived normalized difference vegetation index and Sentinel-1A
   interferometric coherence in co- and cross-polarization: When NDVI at
   extremely high and low levels, coherence is close to zero, while NDVI
   and coherence show two different linear relationships in co- and
   cross-polarization in terms of NDVI at the middle level. The models
   global error basically obeys the normal distribution with the mean value
   of -0.037 and -0.045, and the standard deviation of 0.205 and 0.201 at
   the VV and VH channels. The two models are then validated in two
   validation areas, and the results confirm the reliability of the models
   and reveal the relationships between Sentinel-1A InSAR decorrelation and
   vegetation coverage in co- and cross-polarization, thus demonstrating
   that the NDVI can be applied to quantitatively estimate the InSAR
   decorrelation in vegetated area of Sentinel-1A data in both polarization
   modes prior to SLC interference.},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate acquisition of crop area is of great significance
   for monitoring crop growth and estimation of crop yields. And it's
   important for strengthening agricultural management, ensuring food
   security and supply of agricultural products. The combination of remote
   sensing data with traditional sampling methods is an effective way to
   monitor and estimate crop area on a large scale. The traditional
   sampling method, on the basis of traditional statistics theory which
   studies the laws of random variables, requires that the sampling units
   should satisfy the principle of mutual independence. However, the
   regional crops, which are affected by natural conditions and
   socioeconomic factors, are often spatial variable. There is no report on
   whether and how spatial variability will influence the sampling
   efficiency of crop acreage. Therefor the further improvement of sampling
   efficiency is limited. To solve this problem, a variation function model
   was constructed with the area ratio between maize or rice and sampling
   units as object variable on 10 sampling unit scales combining remote
   sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods with
   Dehui, Jilin as study area. Selecting base value as index for spatial
   variability within the sampling unit, the effect of sampling unit scales
   on spatial variability of maize and rice were quantitatively analyzed.
   Three commonly used sampling schemes (random sampling, systematic
   sampling and stratified sampling) were selected for sample selection,
   overall extrapolation and error estimation. The sampling efficiency was
   quantitatively evaluated using overall relative error (r) of the
   sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total
   estimate and the sample size (n) on different sampling unit scales. The
   results show that the spatial variability of maize and rice decreases
   with the increase of the sampling unit scale. The range of base value is
   {[}0.15, 0.20] and {[}0.05, 0.14] for maize and wheat respectively.
   Using the three sampling methods to extrapolate the maize and rice area
   separately: 1) Under the same sampling ratio, the relative sampling
   errors of the two crops' area estimations gradually increase with the
   decrease of spatial variability (the sampling unit size increases), the
   coefficient of variation also shows an increasing trend, and the
   sampling accuracy and extrapolation stability is affected by spatial
   variability; 2) The relative error in estimation of the two crop areas
   varies with the sampling method,when using simple random sampling and
   systematic sampling, the relative error of the two crops was within the
   range of (1`)/0, 50\%) and (0.5\%, 40\%), and the coefficient of
   variation was limited to (1\%, 75 A) and In the range of (1\%, 88\%),
   the relative errors at all scales were limited to 10\% or less with
   stratified sampling, and the fluctuations of the coefficient of
   variation were small (both within 0.3\% and 20\%). Therefore, the
   stratification was selected. Sampling is the best sampling method; 3)
   When the sampling method is determined, the sampling ratio is the main
   factor determining the sampling efficiency.
   As the sampling ratio increases, the rate of change of the relative
   error of the two crop area estimators gradually decreases, when the
   sampling fraction reaches S\%, The relative error is basically limited
   to 5\%, and the coefficient of variation is stable within 12\% On this
   basis, the effect of increasing the sampling ratio to increase the
   sampling progress is minimal; 4) According to the conclusions of 2) and
   3), Stratified sampling method is used to extrapolate crop area by 5\%
   sampling ratio. The sampling efficiency decreases with the increase of
   sampling unit size. When the sampling unit size is limited within
   3500mx3500m, the overall sampling satisfies 95\% sampling accuracy
   requirements., And the coefficient of variation is stable within 7\%,
   the stability of the extrapolation of the area is also high; 5) Based on
   the above research conclusions, the quantitative evaluation sampling
   efficiency scheme and the optimal sampling model composed of the
   combination of sampling unit scale (spatial variability), sampling
   fraction, extrapolated total relative error, and variation coefficient
   were finally obtained. This study provides a reference for the design of
   a rational spatial sampling schemes of spatial variable crops.},

Title = {Techno-economic assessment of application of solar PV in building sector
   A case study from Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Purpose The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is facing a rapid growth in
   energy demand mainly because of factors like burgeoning population,
   economic growth, modernization and infrastructure development. It is
   estimated that between 2000 and 2017 the power consumption has increased
   from 120 to 315 TWh. The building sector has an important role in this
   respect as it accounts for around 80 percent of the total electricity
   consumption. The situation is imposing significant energy, environmental
   and economic challenges for the country. To tackle these problems and
   curtail its dependence on oil-based energy infrastructure, KSA is aiming
   to develop 9.5 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. The campus of
   the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) has been
   considered as a case study. In the wake of recently announced
   net-metering policy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   prospects of rooftop application of PV in buildings. ArcGIS and PVsyst
   software have been used to determine the rooftop area and undertake PV
   system modeling respectively. Performance of PV system has been
   investigated for both horizontal and tilted installations. The study
   also investigates the economic feasibility of the PV application with
   the help of various economic parameters such as benefit cost ratio,
   simple payback period (SPP) and equity payback periods. An environmental
   analysis has also been carried out with the help of RETScreen software
   to determine the savings in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of PV
   system. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the buildings of
   the university campus for utilizable rooftop areas for PV application.
   Various types of structural, architectural and utilities-related
   features affecting the use of building roofs for PV have been
   investigated to determine the corrected area. To optimize the
   performance of the PV system as well as space utilization, modeling has
   been carried out for both horizontal and tilted applications of panels.
   Detailed economic and environmental assessments of the rooftop PV
   systems have also been investigated in detail. Modern software tools
   such as PVsyst, ArcGIS and RETScreen have also been used for system
   design calculations. Findings Saudi Arabia is embarking on a massive
   solar energy program as it plans to have over 200 GW of installed
   capacity by 2030. With solar energy being the most abundant of the
   available renewable resource for the country, PV is going to be one of
   the main technologies in achieving the set targets. The country has,
   however, unlike global trends, traditionally overlooked the small-scale
   and building-related application of solar PV, focusing mainly on larger
   projects. This study explores the prospects of utilization of solar PV
   on building roofs. Building rooftops are constrained in terms of PV
   application owing to wide ranging obstacles that can be classified into
   five types - structural, services, accessibility, maintenance and
   others. The total building rooftop area in the study zone, calculated
   through ArcGIS has been found to be 857,408 m(2) of which 352,244 m(2)
   is being used as car parking and hence is not available for PV
   application. The available roof area, 505,165 m(2) is further hampered
   by construction and utilities related features including staircases,
   HVAC systems, skylights, water tanks and satellite dish antennas.
   Taking into account the relevant obstructive features, the net rooftop
   area covered by PV panels has been found to be in the range 25-41
   percent depending upon the building typology, with residential buildings
   offering the least. To optimize both the system efficiency and space
   utilization, PV modeling has been carried out with the help of PVsyst
   software for both the tilted and horizontal installations. In terms of
   output, PV panels with tilt angle of 24 degrees have been found to be 9
   percent more efficient compared to the horizontally installed ones.
   Modeling results provide a net annual output 37,750 and 46,050 MWh from
   21.44 and 28.51 MW of tilted and horizontal application of PV panels,
   sufficient to respectively meet 16 and 20 percent of the total campus
   electricity requirements. Findings of the economic analysis reveal the
   average SPP for horizontal and tilted applications of the PV to be 9.2
   and 8.4 years, respectively. The benefit cost ratio for different types
   of buildings for horizontal and tilted application has been found to be
   ranging between 0.89 and 2.08 and 0.83 and 2.15, respectively. As
   electricity tariff in Saudi Arabia has been increased this year by as
   much as 45 percent and there are plans to remove \$54bn of subsidy by
   2020, the cost effectiveness of PV systems will be greatly helped.
   Application of PV in buildings can significantly improve their
   environmental performance as the findings of this study reveal that the
   annual greenhouse gas emission in the KFUPM campus can be reduced by as
   much as 40,199 tons carbon dioxide equivalent. Originality/value The PV
   application on building roof especially from economic perspective is an
   area which has not been addressed thus far. Khan et al. (2017) studied
   the power generation potential for PV application on residential
   buildings in KSA. Asif (2016) also investigated power output potential
   of PV system in different types of buildings. Dehwas et al. (2018)
   adopted a detailed approach to determine utilizability of PV on
   residential building roofs. None of these studies have covered the
   economics of PV systems. This study attempts to address the gap and
   contribute to the scholarship on the subject. It targets to determine
   the power output from different types of building in an urban
   environment by taking into account building roof conditions. It also
   provides detailed economic assessment of PV systems. Subsequent
   environmental savings are also calculated.},

Title = {Improved Classification Models to Distinguish Natural from Anthropic Oil
   Slicks in the Gulf of Mexico: Seasonality and Radarsat-2 Beam Mode
   Effects under a Machine Learning Approach},

Abstract = {Distinguishing between natural and anthropic oil slicks is a challenging
   task, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where these events can be
   simultaneously observed and recognized as seeps or spills. In this
   study, a powerful data analysis provided by machine learning (ML)
   methods was employed to develop, test, and implement a classification
   model (CM) to distinguish an oil slick source (OSS) as natural or
   anthropic. A robust database containing 4916 validated oil samples,
   detected using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was employed for this
   task. Six ML algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural
   networks (ANN), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes
   (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR).
   Using RF, the global CM achieved a maximum accuracy value of 73.15. An
   innovative approach evaluated how external factors, such as seasonality,
   satellite configurations, and the synergy between them, limit or improve
   OSS predictions. To accomplish this, specific classification models
   (SCMs) were derived from the global ones (CMs), tuning the best
   algorithms and parameters according to different scenarios. Median
   accuracies revealed winter and spring to be the best seasons and ScanSAR
   Narrow B (SCNB) as the best beam mode. The maximum median accuracy to
   distinguish seeps from spills was achieved in winter using SCNB (83.05).
   Among the tested algorithms, RF was the most robust, with a better
   performance in 81\% of the investigated scenarios. The accuracy
   increment provided by the well-fitted models may minimize the confusion
   between seeps and spills. This represents a concrete contribution to
   reducing economic and geologic risks derived from exploration activities
   in offshore areas. Additionally, from an operational standpoint,
   specific models support specialists to select the best SAR products and
   seasons for new acquisitions, as well as to optimize performances
   according to the available data.},

Title = {Monitoring and control of water-ecological space in the Dongting Lake
   region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {The territorial spatial planning in the new era strengthens the control
   of different functional spaces and emphasizes integrated and coordinated
   development of each functional space. Therefore, it is important to
   monitor the ``structure-function{''} characteristics of water-ecological
   space based on the context of territorial spatial planning and develop a
   management and control framework. Based on land use and social
   statistics, and with the help of ArcGIS analysis, this paper examined
   the structure and function of the water-ecological space in the Dongting
   Lake study for 2010, 2015, and 2020, generating a control framework and
   proposing key initiatives. The main results are as follows: 1) The
   overall scale of the water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study
   is over 7,300 km(2). Water bodies had the largest share, followed by
   coastal terrestrial areas, while the land-water ecotone was the
   smallest. There was a small decrease in the water ecological space
   during the study period. Yueyang had the largest overall scale of water
   ecological space, while Linli had the smallest. 2) The comprehensive
   function of water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study was about
   0.4000, increasing somewhat during the study period. Among the units,
   the comprehensive function value was highest in Yuanjiang City, while
   Jincheng City had the lowest. 3) From the structural elements of water
   ecological space, scientific planning of functional zoning of water
   ecological space should be carried out and combined with the delineation
   of ``three zones and three lines.{''} Key initiatives such as
   multi-scale and multi-level planning and control, use control and access
   restrictions, determination of water ecological space ownership,
   pollution control and accountability, and comprehensive water ecological
   treatment and restoration should be promoted.},

Abstract = {For the last two decades, since the Rio Conference on Environment and
   Development, land-use planning (LUP) has been carrying the hopes of
   providing a concrete instrument to translate sustainable development
   discourses into practice. In the Lao PDR, it is being seen as a way to
   provide alternatives to swidden agriculture and more recently, as an
   instrument to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
   (REDD). However, when assessing the impact of past LUP, many observers
   have noted the discrepancy between good intentions, as displayed in
   policy and project documents, and actual implementation due to the
   limited capacity of local institutions (Lestrelin et al., 2011a).
   Overcoming such a problem requires an objective analysis of its extent
   and its potential negative consequences. To avoid blind trust in
   delusive success stories, evaluation methods assessing the quality of
   the LUP process (i.e. level of community participation and understanding
   of LUP activities by local stakeholders) have been designed (Lestrelin
   et al., 2011b). From the perspective of developing a country-wide
   monitoring system for participatory land use planning (PLUP), this paper
   addresses two main research questions:
   How to assess the quality of a PLUP output, i.e. measuring the gap
   between principles and practice in PLUP?
   What can be done to increase the credibility, and therefore the
   practicality and feasibility, of the proposed land use plans?
   By analysing land zoning outputs from past and recent PLUP this paper
   underlines the irrationality of village LUP maps which often appear
   inconsistent with the principles of land use policies. In general the
   management of rural landscapes in the uplands of Lao PDR is difficult to
   grasp due to a tacit agreement between villagers willing to minimize
   land taxes and district authority lacking proper human and financial
   resources.
   Acknowledging the gap between the declared agricultural land from
   household surveys and what can be observed from satellite or village
   land use maps, the paper proposes a new approach to increase planning
   realism while reinforcing local participation in the PLUP process. An
   innovative participatory platform involving local communities in
   learning the complexities of LUP through a role-play was proposed by
   Bourgoin and Castella (2011). The authors argued that a landscape
   simulation exercise can help disclose the landscape management and
   livelihood strategies of different stakeholders at different scales.
   Building on this knowledge, this paper describes a negotiation platform
   allowing villagers discuss land zoning and management practices.
   Adaptive and accessible, the method is assisted by a participatory 3D
   model combined with a village socio-economic and geographic information
   system providing feedback about cost/benefit associated with each land
   use plan. Through successive iterations, villagers gradually refine
   their plans by exploring land use change scenarios.
   Beside its contribution to enhanced participation in landscape planning,
   the proposed method, which was successfully tested in six study villages
   of Viengkham District, can support the introduction of innovative land
   use systems in the northern uplands of Lao PDR. Furthermore, this
   instrument can be used to certify land use plans and provide a standard
   procedure for PLUP implementation.},

Title = {AIRBORNE LIDAR IN SUPPORT OF COASTAL MAPPING AND HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING},
Booktitle = {GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {175-195},
Abstract = {Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play
   a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by
   recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and
   feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are
   being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to
   mankind is not fully acknowledged.
   The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France
   (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This
   trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely
   the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed
   a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas.
   Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the
   return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation
   with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system
   is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system.
   The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density
   reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are
   respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground.
   Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in
   integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of
   tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among
   which:
   - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the
   bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion
   and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone
   or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to
   shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal,
   transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been
   carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic
   models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont
   Saint Michel and Morbihan bays.
   - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and
   facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has
   been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites.
   By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne
   ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced
   describing sediment facies and habitat units to a high level of detail.
   Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the
   flooding frequency, a key driver to the presence of sea weed belts or
   salt marsh vegetation.
   - Coastal morpho-dynamics are concerned with understanding coastline and
   seashore changes under natural or human pressure. Natural events include
   storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal
   developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in
   shellfish fanning areas. Repeated LIDAR surveys would allow monitoring
   the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to
   risk management.},

Number = {1-3},
Pages = {65-75},
Month = {FEB 5},
Note = {International Conference on Integrated Concepts on Water Recycling,
   Wollongong, AUSTRALIA, FEB 14-17, 2005},
Abstract = {Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to
   increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater,
   and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation,
   recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water
   resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies.
   The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous.
   Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries
   around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of
   the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In
   addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are
   considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural
   return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water,
   co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well
   as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse
   provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into
   creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits
   of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go
   unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the
   value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water
   resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the
   implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term
   sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which
   involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health
   risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant
   challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal
   influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water
   reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of
   significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of
   water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers
   experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including:
   the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel
   applications; the need for public education and increased public
   acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the
   lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the
   media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians.
   Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting
   water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging
   pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments
   including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception,
   understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and
   aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate
   disposal), increase in the use of `' alternative sources `',
   environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of
   nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since
   these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation
   and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these
   topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop
   innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for
   communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation
   and reuse projects.},

Title = {Quantitative Precipitation Estimation of Extremes in CONUS With Radar
   Data},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale,
   long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal
   changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the
   extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative
   precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily
   return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky
   Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than
   similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether
   rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate
   extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between
   gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at
   locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges
   is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics
   derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial
   resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern
   United States.
   Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of
   precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is
   crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and
   resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is
   desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on
   average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event,
   such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that
   certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated
   on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This
   means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings
   of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to
   accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is
   imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way
   that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest
   requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step
   toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term,
   high-resolution precipitation data set.},

Title = {Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables for Spatially
   Predicting the Risks of Bark Beetle Disturbance},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects
   on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests.
   Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest
   management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the
   influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle
   infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral
   trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator
   of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with
   commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come
   from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border
   region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas
   of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs
   taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental
   predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and
   distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic
   factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance
   spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of
   Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated
   from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until
   one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression
   and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for
   each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in
   importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two
   pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness
   slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle
   infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power,
   even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in
   its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in
   the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these
   pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors,
   and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model.
   Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time
   progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle
   outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions.
   The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for
   assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of
   long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Estimate of daytime single-layer cloud base height from advanced
   baseline imager measurements},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter to describe cloud
   state and is highly related to the vertical motions in the atmosphere.
   CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic
   analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from
   Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16)
   Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis
   (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine
   learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as
   GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16
   and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from
   the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard
   Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations
   (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class
   of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine
   learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine
   learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning
   technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH
   estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE)
   of 1.87 km and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) of 0.92
   before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low
   confidence (19.2\% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km,
   Pearson's r increases to 0.97, and 96\% of the estimates are within 2 km
   of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance,
   cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate,
   although all input features have positive impact on the estimate
   accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for
   clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy
   (Pearson's r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud
   optical depth {[}COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained
   in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds
   with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded.
   Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat
   measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of
   1.41 km and Pearson's r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian,
   CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with
   small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low
   clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are
   not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence
   with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65\% of cloudy
   pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH
   with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived
   from ABI measurements using this methodology.},

Title = {3D ground-use optimisation for sustainable urban development planning: A
   case-study from Earls Court, London, UK},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {144-164},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {By 2050, almost 70\% of the world's population will live in towns and
   cities. This places increasing pressure on land to support development
   whilst minimising environmental impact and providing long-term
   sustainability. Prior knowledge of the ground at the planning and
   development stage is needed to assess its suitability to meet planned
   subsurface uses and avoid subsurface conflicts at an early stage of
   design.
   This research tested the development and application of a 3D engineering
   geological model and its spatial integration with 2D (hydro)geological
   datasets to support sustainable development decision-making at Earls
   Court, London, UK. The 3D engineering geological model consists of seven
   geological layers extending from Made Ground to the top surface of the
   Chalk Group. The 3D geological model, and 2D datasets derived from it,
   are combined with 2D geospatial datasets of urban underground space
   (UUS) indicators to identify potential uses of urban underground space
   based on its suitability to do so. This is complimented by a qualitative
   assessment of the potential subsurface interactions between UUS
   indicator uses and their implications for delivering the sustainability
   and energy objectives specified in the Earls Court masterplan.
   Infiltration sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), ground source heat
   potential and foundation condition potential were chosen as suitable UUS
   indictors against which to test the outputs of the methodology.
   Infiltration SuDS potential was assessed using nationally-available
   (hydro)geological 2D GIS datasets. Ground source heat potential was
   assessed using national-available 2D datasets and estimates of thermal
   properties of each geological layer revealed by the 3D geological model.
   Potentially suitable foundation conditions were assessed using density
   data from existing ground investigations and depth of suitable
   geological layers derived from the 3D geological model.
   The results reveal constraints for the development of rapid infiltration
   SuDS but opportunities for bespoke design that considers the thickness
   of overlying permeable sand and gravel. It identifies the susceptibility
   of the London Clay Formation to potential volume change and ground
   movement based on an assessment of its plasticity. Closed-loop ground
   source heat pump opportunities exist depending on site-specific thermal
   and hydraulic properties and heat exchange design. Opportunities for the
   use of the Kempton Park Gravel Member for ground source heating and
   cooling and combined use of thermal regulation and pile design via
   thermopiles are identified. A qualitative assessment of potential
   benefits and conflicts between UUS indicator uses reveals that the
   Kempton Park Gravel Member and London Clay Formation are likely to have
   the highest, relative, UUS value.
   The results demonstrate that there is potential to modify the energy and
   sustainability components of the Earls Court masterplan prior to
   invasive ground investigation and development. It is further suggested
   that this approach can be used to compliment research-tested,
   semi-qualitative means of valuing UUS indicators. The implications of
   the methodology for mainstreaming UUS into city masterplans is also
   assessed. It is concluded that opportunities now exist for the
   integrated 3D and 2D spatial assessment of UUS indicators into
   city-scale masterplans.},

Title = {Long Range Correlation in Vegetation Over West Africa From 1982 to 2011},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {119151-119165},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) data
   records offer important sources for long term correlation modelling over
   West Africa. In this study, we assessed long range correlations in half
   monthly NDVI records over West Africa from 1982 to 2011 using GIMMS
   NDVI. In our analysis, we assessed (a) the annual and seasonal trends
   obtained using Ordinary Linear Regression, (b) the detrended
   lag-1-autocorrelation C(1), (c) the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
   scaling Hurst exponent h and (d) the Multifractal (MF) characteristics
   of NDVI. Results show that there exist some patterns or trends in the
   records that persist over time. The value of C(1) for NDVI was obtained
   as 0.989 is significant at 95\% confidence interval. Consequently, the
   scaling h values of the Hurst DFA showed that about 37.4, 20.5, 41.7 and
   0.5\% of the vegetated areas are anti-correlated (h < 0.5),
   un-correlated (h = 0.5), correlated (0 :5 < h < 1) and uncorrelated
   random walk (h = 1), respectively. The trend analysis from Ordinary
   Least square Regression (OLR) shows that about 54.3, 0.1 and 45.6\% of
   the vegetated areas are positively, uncorrelated and negatively
   correlated, respectively. Our findings revealed that the DFA method
   performed better than OLR and the findings could be useful in
   identifying areas with improved and degraded vegetation, which cannot be
   properly captured by the OLR method. Accordingly, the comparison of the
   MF-DFA results of original data to those of shuffled and surrogate
   series indicated that the multifractal nature of considered time-series
   is both from PDF and long-range correlations but arguably, MF due to
   long range correlation dominates over West Africa. The research is
   therefore helpful in the formulating crop and environmental management
   policies that may be used to improve ecosystem management using a long
   term plan (inter-annual) or short term (inter-seasonal) planning.},

Title = {An integrated economic-ecological index based on satellite-derived
   carbon sequestration and carbon price: A case study during 2015-2020 in
   Shaanxi, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Carbon sequestration reflecting vegetation productivity is essential for
   global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystems. Exploring the spatial
   and temporal variation of carbon sequestration and corresponding
   ecological values yields insights for policy formulation to mitigate
   carbon emission and achieve carbon neutrality. Hence, taking Shaanxi
   China as the case study, we developed an integrated index (named C-GDP)
   based on vegetation carbon sequestration estimated by the CASA model and
   carbon prices acquired from carbon trading market in China to explore
   tradeoffs between economic and ecological development. The
   spatiotemporal distributions of carbon sequestration and C-GDP were
   characterized using hotspot analysis and variation coefficient during
   2015-2020. The estimated carbon sequestrations were assessed with
   promising accuracy, depicting high values in the south and low values in
   the north, with provincial averages of 1761.37gC/m2a. Temporally, carbon
   sequestrations increased with fluctuation between 2015 and 2020, with
   significant seasonality. Summertime, especially July, has the highest
   sequestration, while winter is the season with the lowest values. The
   C-GDP calculated by carbon sequestration and carbon price exhibited a
   distinct pattern with sequestration, with the highest C-GDP in Central
   Shaanxi and the lowest in the south. The multi-year provincial-mean
   C-GDP is 20.44 billion yuan. The C-GDP exhibited an increase trend with
   miniscule fluctuation, peaking at 23.66 billion yuan in 2020. The
   results imply the ecological value of carbon sequestration monetizing by
   carbon prices is much lower than economical value of production,
   suggesting that strict carbon policies, such as improving carbon prices
   or taxes, may be warranted for China because of high carbon mitigation
   costs.},

Title = {Spatial Management Measures Alter Vessel Behavior in the Aleutian
   Archipelago},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Aleutian Archipelago and surrounding waters have enormous
   ecological, cultural, and commercial significance. As one of the
   shortest routes between North American and Asian ports, the North
   Pacific Great Circle Route, which crosses through the Aleutian
   Archipelago, is traveled by thousands of large cargo ships and tanker
   vessels every year. To reduce maritime risks and enhance navigational
   safety, the International Maritime Organization built upon earlier
   offshore routing efforts by designating five Areas To Be Avoided (ATBAs)
   in the Aleutian Islands in 2016. The ATBAs are designed to keep large
   vessels at least 50 nautical miles (93 km) from shore unless calling at
   a local port or transiting an authorized pass between islands. However,
   very few studies have examined the effectiveness of ATBAs as a mechanism
   for changing vessel behavior and thereby reducing the ecological impacts
   of maritime commerce. In this study, we use 4 years of satellite-based
   vessel tracking data to assess the effectiveness of the Aleutian ATBAs
   since their implementation in 2016. We determined whether vessels
   transiting the North Pacific Great Circle Route changed behavior after
   ATBA implementation, both in terms of overall route selection and in
   terms of compliance with each ATBA boundary. We found a total of 2,252
   unique tankers and cargo vessels >400 gross tons transited the study
   region, completing a total of 8,794 voyages. To quantify routing changes
   of individual vessels, we analyzed the 767 vessels that transited the
   study region both before and after implementation. The percentage of
   voyages transiting through the boundaries of what would become ATBAs
   decreased from 76.3\% in 2014-2015 (prior to ATBA designation) to 11.8\%
   in 2016-2017 (after implementation). All five Aleutian ATBAs had
   significant increases in compliance, with the West ATBA showing the most
   dramatic increase, from 32.1\% to 95.0\%. We discuss the framework for
   ATBA enforcement and highlight the value of local institutional capacity
   for real-time monitoring. Overall, our results indicate that ATBAs
   represent a viable strategy for risk mitigation in sensitive ecological
   areas and that through monitoring, spatial protections influence vessel
   route decisions on multiple spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) plays an important role by pole and
   line fishery in the Bone Gulf, Indonesia, since it has a high economic
   value and wide market acceptance. The purpose of this paper was to
   assess the seasonal changes of skipjack tuna potential fishing ground in
   the Bone Gulf. We used pole and line fishery and oceanographic data of
   sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a derived from satellite
   to figure out the seasonal formation of the potential fishing areas. We
   developed the spatial model to determine the potential fishing ground
   based on different levels of oceanographic preferences. The results
   showed that potential fishing grounds were mostly formed in the first
   transition season (particularly in May) as well as the west season
   (especially in November), which have a good association with the
   specific SST and chlorophyll-a of near 30 Deg C and 0.2 mg m-3,
   respectively. Most of the potential skipjack fishing ground formation
   developed along with the specific oceanographic signatures. It was
   likely that the potential seasonal changes of fishing grounds
   corresponded with enhanced feeding opportunity distribution pattern for
   skipjack schools. This suggested that these potential areas play an
   important for conservation and skipjack fishing management within the
   study area.},

   Quantification of these multiplication effects is one of the greatest

   in the territorial administrative units that overlap the Apuseni
   Mountains, based on a data source processed from satellite images, for
   the period 2000-2017. The data source is the Global Forest Change
   database, designed to monitor forest dynamics and in particular forest
   loss. The raster images processed for the study area were extracted from
   this database. As a case study, we chose the Apuseni Mountains, which
   are part of the Western Carpathians, where forest exploitation has been
   particularly significant in recent years. The forest images were
   processed and then the forest dynamics was calculated for all
   administrative units overlapping the analyzed area. The obtained results
   highlighted the added value of the methodology proposed in the
   assessment of cut forests in each territorial administrative unit, it
   also highlights the advantages and limitations given by this spatial

Title = {A 6-year-long (2013-2018) high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset
   in China based on the assimilation of surface observations from CNEMC},

Abstract = {A 6-year-long high-resolution Chinese air quality reanalysis (CAQRA)
   dataset is presented in this study obtained from the assimilation of
   surface observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring
   Centre (CNEMC) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Nested Air
   Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS).This dataset contains
   surface fields of six conventional air pollutants in China (i.e. PM2.5,
   PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) for the period 2013-2018 at high spatial
   (15km +/- 15km) and temporal (1 h) resolutions. This paper aims to
   document this dataset by providing detailed descriptions of the
   assimilation system and the first validation results for the above
   reanalysis dataset. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is adopted
   to demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis. The CV results show that
   the CAQRA yields an excellent performance in reproducing the magnitude
   and variability of surface air pollutants in China from 2013 to 2018 (CV
   R 2 D 0 :52-0.81, CV root mean square error (RMSE) D 0 :54 mg =m3 for
   CO, and CV RMSE D 16 :4-39.3 mu g =m(3) for the other pollutants on an
   hourly scale). Through comparison to the Copernicus Atmosphere
   Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) dataset produced by the European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), we show that CAQRA
   attains a high accuracy in representing surface gaseous air pollutants
   in China due to the assimilation of surface observations. The fine
   horizontal resolution of CAQRA also makes it more suitable for air
   quality studies on a regional scale. The PM2.5 reanalysis dataset is
   further validated against the independent datasets from the US
   Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program over China, which
   exhibits a good agreement with the independent observations (R 2 D 0
   :74-0.86 and RMSE D 16 :8-33.6 mu g =m3 in different cities).
   Furthermore, through the comparison to satellite-estimated PM2.5
   concentrations, we show that the accuracy of the PM2.5 reanalysis is
   higher than that of most satellite estimates. The CAQRA is the first
   high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China that
   simultaneously provides the surface concentrations of six conventional
   air pollutants, which is of great value for many studies, such as health
   impact assessment of air pollution, investigation of air quality changes
   in China, model evaluation and satellite calibration, optimization of
   monitoring sites, and provision of training data for statistical or
   artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting. All datasets are freely
   available at https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00053 (Tang et al.,
   2020a), and a prototype product containing the monthly and annual means
   of the CAQRA dataset has also been released at
   https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00092 (Tang et al., 2020b) to
   facilitate the evaluation of the CAQRA dataset by potential users.},

Abstract = {Featured Application This study proposes the features of mangrove forest
   variations in relation to anthropogenic activities under the forms of
   land use land cover changes around three ecological zones of a Biosphere
   Reserve area, using Sentinel-2 Imagery and spatial regression approaches
   that have wide application in natural resources, land use planning, and
   environmental management. This study aimed at evaluating the
   spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove forest variations for three
   ecological zones of the Can Gio biosphere reserve (i.e., core, buffer,
   and transition zones) and its relation to land use/land cover changes.
   Time series Sentinel-2 Imagery-which presents the Normalized Different
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained through the Google Earth Engine and
   Overlap Similarity Algorithm-was used to characterize vegetation cover
   in the study area. Furthermore, the Cohen's Kappa agreement was applied
   to examine the accuracy of mangrove classification, and the Mann-Kendal
   (MK) significance was used to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of
   mangrove forests. The results showed that an NDVI value greater than 0.3
   recorded the reflected signal of mangrove population in the study area
   with anO-index greater than 0.85. A Cohen's Kappa statistic of agreement
   of 0.7 and an overall classification accuracy of 83\% was obtained.
   Regarding the trend in mangrove forest patterns, an increase in area of
   669 ha and 579 ha explored at the buffer and core zones, respectively,
   while the largest declined mangrove area of 350 ha was investigated at
   the buffer zone, followed by a transition at 314 ha during the study
   period due to the interconversion of shrimp farming and the expansion of
   built-up areas. Moreover, the study also described the negative impacts
   of the sea-encroached urban-tourism zone on mangrove patterns in the
   foreseeable future. The results from this study will act as a basic
   fundamental authentic report for local governments in proposing
   strategies for the shielding of mangrove forests and economic
   development from negative consequences in foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {The knowledge management, like a strategic resource, has gained great
   importance for business development and knowledge transfer processes
   became a key issue in allowing firms to get new sources of information.
   The study looks at the reality of industrial districts, where, normally,
   equality and fairness create the conditions upon which firms share their
   own knowledge. However, often, these contexts, in contrasts to the
   traditional Marshallian industrial district (Marshall, 1879, Becattini,
   1981), are characterized by an asymmetric power relationship among the
   parties, according to the Hub and Spoke district (Markusen, 1996). The
   case study of Val d'Agri, the most important Italian oil district, is an
   example of Hub-and-spoke District, with the dominance of a bigger firm
   (Eni) to manage all the relationship along the chain. The discovery of
   the Val d'Agri was made by ENI, in 1988.
   Purpose - Starting from the description of Val d'Agri district, our
   paper aims at mapping the local relationships, in order to define the
   way firms relate along the district value chain, with reference to both
   their position, and their own ``contractual power{''}; and to understand
   how firms position, as well as their different contractual power, affect
   knowledge transfer process within the district. Taking into account the
   ``Hub and Spoke{''} morphology, we support the idea that knowledge
   transfer is deeply affected by firms' contractual power, as well as by
   their position within the district. Explicit knowledge transfer is
   mainly linked to the development of production process; on the contrary,
   the transfer of tacit knowledge depends, above all, by the action people
   place within the district; so, human capital plays a very important role
   in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social
   interaction.
   Design/methodology/approach - We propose an empirical approach. This
   work will start providing an analysis of the main characteristics of the
   relational structure of Val d'Agri, in order to identify the main issues
   that can impact the development process of knowledge transfer. The study
   consists of two parts: in the first part, it will develop an analysis of
   the main national and international literature on the field, from both
   economic and managerial perspectives; in the second part, an empirical
   analysis will be developed. For the analysis were contacted about 100
   firms of satellite ENI industries (the biggest ones), both the same ENI.
   Were sent questionnaires for asking questions about the company
   structure, specialization, the typology of formal relationships exists
   with the leader, the company's distinctive knowledge, the existence of
   knowledge management systems.
   Originality/value - Since the importance that both industrial districts
   and knowledge transfer have for firms competition, the paper aims at
   giving a new and valuable framework useful to understand, not only the
   district dynamics, but also the way knowledge transfer may be fostered
   among all the firms related along a given value chain.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the application puts in
   evidence the peculiarity of an oil district, because the birth of this
   form of district is closely related to land resources. In addition,
   national laws and regulations that govern the exploitation of oil in
   Italy, create positions of power within the production chain, which
   alter the relationship between the companies, compared to what happens
   in the traditional type of Marshallian districts.},

Title = {Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological
   systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and
   built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly
   prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and
   undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological
   systems. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the
   extent and spatial patterns of LULCC in Fako sub-region of Cameroon. In
   addition, we explored the likelihood of LULCC and magnitude of impact of
   the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engaging 25
   stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of
   cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by
   21,360 ha (10.5\%), 3152 ha (1.6\%), 5721 ha (2.8\%), and 1823 ha
   (0.9\%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased
   by -44,945 ha (-22.1\%), -15,557 ha (-7.7\%), and -110 ha (-0.1\%),
   respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was
   caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by
   smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of
   agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of
   LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and
   agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones,
   respectively, while expansion of built-up areas and decrease in
   agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and
   western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial
   patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to
   differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography,
   size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic
   opportunities, and strength and resilience of local economy. The
   presence of the Mount Cameroon (4095 m), with high value forests,
   endemism, and conservation attractiveness restricted increased LULCC
   with elevation, while LULCC increased with nearness to the sea and
   national road networks. The likelihood of change from one LULC to oil
   palm plantation, banana plantation, and other cultivated areas and from
   rubber plantation, dense forest, lowland grassland to other land uses
   was 95\% and 90\%, respectively. Population growth, agricultural and
   farmland expansion, and infrastructural development were ranked as the
   three most important drivers of degradation under the business as usual
   scenario, while sustainable land management, good governance, and
   reforestation were ranked as the three most important predictors of
   LULCC reduction under the green economy scenario. In general, production
   and living space functions significantly increased at the expense of
   ecological land cover. Prioritising and increasing the legal protection
   of the mountain and coastal land-boundary ecosystems while providing for
   production and living land are invaluable for the sustainability of the
   social-ecological systems in the western highlands of Cameroon.},

Title = {Estimation of actual evapotranspiration and water stress in the Lijiang
   River Basin, China using a modified Operational Simplified Surface
   Energy Balance (SSEBop) model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {41},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Due to the simultaneous impacts of economic development and climate
   change, the Lijiang River Basin in China-the largest karst tourist
   attraction in the world-has experienced dramatic water shortages during
   the dry season. As actual evapotranspiration (ETa) plays a critical role
   in the water cycle, accurate estimation of ETa and water stress are
   important for sustainable water resources management. In this paper, we
   mapped the distribution of daily ETa using a modified Operational
   Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model in combination with
   Landsat 8 images and assessed water stress using the Crop Water Stress
   Index (CWSI) during the dry season in the Lijiang River Basin. In
   general, the daily ETa simulated by the SSEBop model with aerodynamic
   resistance value of 110 s m(-1) was higher than that of satellite-based
   actual evapotranspiration products (i.e., MOD16A2 and
   Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML)\_V2 actual evapotranspiration products in
   this study). Aerodynamic resistance plays a critical role in the
   estimation of energy fluxes in the SSEBop model and should be readjusted
   and calibrated with available datasets to improve the model's
   performance in estimating actual evapotranspiration for particular
   regions. Readjusted values between 20 and 35 s m(-1) of aerodynamic
   resistance produced reasonable agreement with satellite-based actual
   evapotranspiration products in the Lijiang River Basin. In addition,
   insufficient ground-level measurements of actual evapotranspiration
   might have increased the uncertainty of the SSEBop model's performance.
   The achievement of higher accuracy in the estimation of actual
   evapotranspiration and water availability will require establishing
   local flux towers, particularly in forested areas, to collect
   evapotranspiration, temperature and other in situ data. For different
   land-cover classes, forest areas exhibited the highest actual
   evapotranspiration, whereas farmland and built-up areas had the lowest
   actual evapotranspiration values compared to the other land-cover
   classes. All land-cover classes, especially farmland areas, experienced
   severe water stress. Inadequate precipitation as a result of climate
   change, combined with high actual evapotranspiration will result in less
   water being available for the Lijiang River Basin. Additional water is
   required to compensate for evapotranspiration and support plant growth
   in the Lijiang River Basin during the growing season.},

Abstract = {Flooding is the most costly type of natural disaster, as well as the
   most frequent. To provide risk-based flood insurance, providers must be
   able to accurately determine an asset's risk of flooding. Additionally,
   after a flooding event, providers need to quickly determine the direct
   damages that occurred to verify insurance claims and assist affected
   communities. Many current approaches to flood risk and flood damage
   estimation use data or statistical extrapolation that add various
   sources of uncertainty into the final damage estimate. To reduce
   uncertainties in flood risk analyses, the objective of this research is
   to outline an approach to flood damage estimation conducted on a
   statewide scale while still estimating flood risk and damage on a
   structure-by-structure basis. This approach uses the observed flooding
   extent during and after Hurricane Irma in Florida, extracted from a
   collection of satellite images over the course of 8 days. The results
   show that residential structures had the largest exposure to flooding
   during Hurricane Irma, with estimates ranging from \$300 million to \$2
   billion per county, for the three counties that were studied in depth.
   For agriculture, fruit crops were estimated to have a potential at-risk
   revenue of \$38.2 million, and vegetables were estimated to have a value
   at risk of \$940 million across all crops. With improvements in the data
   used, this approach can offer a quick and accurate assessment of flood
   damages directly after a flood hazard, which could reduce the recovery
   time and economic impacts to the affected communities.},

Title = {Differential Impact of Climate Change on the Hydropower Economics of Two
   River Basins in High Mountain Asia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Water stored in the form of snow and glaciers in the High Mountain Asia
   (HMA) region regulates the water supply, and resultant water-based
   economies, that support the livelihoods of millions of people. Trends in
   the seasonal and long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by
   initial ice reserves, meteorological factors and geographic features,
   vary across sub-basins in the HMA region. We examined the economic
   impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins, one
   each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an
   integrated assessment framework to estimate the changes in economic
   value of the hydropower generation from hydropower plants on rivers fed
   by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins. The framework, developed
   under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical models (a
   suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower model)
   with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river
   flow over historic and future time using the water balance model in
   sixteen scenarios (eight climate models and two emissions scenarios) for
   rivers upstream of hydropower plants in each sub-basin. Using the
   hydropower model we developed, we estimated the changes in hydropower
   generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity,
   located in Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a
   19.6 MW capacity, in Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their
   baselines, the estimated impact of climate change and temporal
   variability were higher for the Naltar plant than for the Trishuli
   plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with water
   storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated
   impacts are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides
   an example of the differential impacts of climate change on hydropower
   plants located in rivers fed by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt
   at different decades in this century. This type of integrated assessment
   of climate change impact will support the scientific understanding of
   hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various
   climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource
   management in a changing climate.},

Title = {Micro-Spatial Analysis of Maize Yield Gap Variability and Production
   Factors on Smallholder Farms},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Site-specific land management practice taking into account variability
   in maize yield gaps (the difference between yields in the 90th
   percentiles and other yields on smallholder farmers' fields) could
   improve resource use efficiency and enhance yields. However, the
   applicability of the practice is constrained by inability to identify
   patterns of resource utilization to target application of resources to
   more responsive fields. The study focus was to map yield gaps on
   smallholder fields based on identified spatial arrangements
   differentiated by distance from the smallholder homestead and understand
   field-specific utilization of production factors. This was aimed at
   understanding field variability based on yield gap mapping patterns in
   order to enhance resource use efficiency on smallholder farms. The study
   was done in two villages, Mukuyu and Shikomoli, with high and low
   agroecology regarding soil fertility in Western Kenya. Identification of
   spatial arrangements at 40 m, 80 m, 150 m and 300 m distance from the
   homestead on smallholder farms for 70 households was done. The spatial
   arrangements were then classified into near house, mid farm and far farm
   basing on distance from the homestead. For each spatial arrangement,
   Landsat sensors acquired via satellite imagery were processed to
   generate yield gap maps. The focal statistics analysis method using the
   neighborhoods function was then applied to generate yield gap maps at
   the different spatial arrangements identified above. Socio-economic,
   management and biophysical factors were determined, and maize yields
   estimated at each spatial arrangement. Heterogeneous patterns of high,
   average and low yield gaps were found in spatial arrangements at the 40
   m and 80 m distances. Nearly homogenous patterns tending towards median
   yield gap values were found in spatial arrangements that were located at
   the 150 m and 300 m. These patterns correspondingly depicted
   field-specific utilization of management and socio-economic factors.
   Field level management practices and socio-economic factors such as
   application of inorganic fertilizer, high frequency of weed control,
   early land preparation, high proportion of hired and family labor use
   and allocation of large land sizes were utilized in spatial arrangements
   at 150 and 300 m distances. High proportions of organic fertilizer and
   family labor use were utilized in spatial arrangements at 40 and 80 m
   distances. The findings thus show that smallholder farmers
   preferentially manage the application of socio-economic and management
   factors in spatial arrangements further from the homestead compared to
   fields closer to the homestead which could be exacerbating maize yield
   gaps. Delineating management zones based on yield gap patterns at the
   different spatial arrangements on smallholder farms could contribute to
   site-specific land management and enhance yields. Investigating the
   value smallholder farmers attach to each spatial arrangement is further
   needed to enhance the spatial understanding of yield gap variation on
   smallholder farms.},

Title = {Global patterns and influencing factors of post-fire land cover change},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {223},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fire, as a strong disturbance type, can exert significant impacts on the
   biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere and human
   society. It can inherently trigger both critical transitions in
   ecosystems and dramatic changes in land cover. However, the general
   patterns and possible influencing factors of post-fire land cover change
   remain largely unclear at a global scale. Obtaining such knowledge is of
   great value in advancing the understanding of fire ecology and promoting
   sustainable fire management. Here, we combined satellite observations of
   long-term ESA CCI land cover (300 m resolution) and burned area data
   from MODIS collection 6 (500 m resolution) to assess the global
   post-fire land cover change patterns from 2005 to 2015. The results
   showed that areas with identified post-fire land cover change accounted
   for approximately 0.36-0.74\% of the annual global burned areas during
   the study period and were most common in countries such as Brazil,
   Argentina, and the D.R. Congo. The most common land cover change types
   in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were ``forest-to-agriculture{''} (31.93\%),
   ``forest-to-shrubland{''} (26.23\%) and ``agriculture-to-forest{''}
   (18.74\%), respectively. In addition, the conversion between agriculture
   and forest, and shrubland and forest, after fire were found to be
   bidirectional. After assessing 14 fire-related, climatic, topographic,
   ecological and socioeconomic factors that could potentially influence
   post-fire land cover change occurrence, burned area size and vegetation
   cover di-versity were identified as the two strongest predictors,
   followed by aspect, fire intensity and slope. Our results provide a
   global overview of post-fire land cover change patterns and offer
   guidance for developing sustainable fire management policies.},

Title = {Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs): A Case Study from Kota

Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is
   relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and
   engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by
   taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new
   approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve
   this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The
   framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of
   database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on
   information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of
   literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters
   included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building
   structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural
   facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury,
   fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3)
   interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and
   diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is
   allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 \%
   damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25\% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26
   - 50\% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75\% damage/victims/period),
   and 1.00 (75 - 100\% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are
   compiled and analyzed with ``Landslide Distribution Map{''} (LDM) to
   generate a ``Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD){''}. The LDM was
   produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in
   order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally,
   three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were
   then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 (<
   0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability;
   Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High
   Vulnerability); and Class 5 (> 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results
   from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of
   high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as
   a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and
   managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially
   to be extended with different background environments. (C) IJOG - 2017.

Title = {Preliminary results of GOCE-based height system unification between

Abstract = {The unification of local vertical datums (LVDs) at a country-wide scale
   has gained significant attention lately due to the availability of
   GOCE-based global geopotential models (GGMs) and the unprecedented geoid
   height accuracies offered. Within a single country, several LVDs may be
   used, especially in the case of islandic nations. Therefore, the
   unification of all of them to a single nation-wide LVD is of utmost
   importance. The same holds for neighboring countries, where the
   unification of their vertical datums is necessary as a tool of
   engineering, cross-border collaboration and environmental and risk
   management projects. The aforementioned set the main scope of the
   present study, which focuses on the use of GOCE and GOCE/GRACE GGMs in
   order to investigate the offsets between the Greek and Turkish LVDs.
   First an evaluation of the latest release 5 GOCE GGMs is carried out,
   either to their maximum degree or through spectral enhancement with
   EGM208 and topographic effects. Then, the geopotential value for the
   Greek and Turkish LVDs is performed, along with different estimates for
   the marine area of the Aegean Sea where several islands and isles exist
   with each one realizing its own LVD. The relative offset between the two
   LVDs was determined and used to provide a direct link between the Greek
   and Turkish LVDs with the IAG conventional value recently proposed as a
   global WHS. From the results achieved it was concluded that the
   spectrally enhanced GOCE GGMs reduce the standard deviation of the
   differences with GPS/levelling data by 2-4 cm over Turkey and 2 cm for
   mainland Greece. In terms of the zero-level geopotential determination,
   the LVD of the Greek mainland is 64.9 cm below the IAG conventional
   value, while that of Turkey is 9.6 cm above. Finally, it is concluded
   that in practice each Greek island realizes its own LVD with offsets
   between them as large as 35 cm. Despite that fact, the spectrally
   enhanced GOCE GGMs and in particular GOCO05s provides the overall
   smallest height residuals over the islands, hence the (W) over cap
   (LVD)(o) based on that can be recommended as the best estimate. In that
   way, relative offsets with the LVD of mainland Greece can be computed
   for each island, ranging between -23.8 and 15.5 cm.},

Abstract = {For much of the last two decades, the Central and East European (CEE)
   economies have experienced a deep structural reform, moving away from a
   socialist economic system towards a market economy. The political
   situation of the second half of the 20th century had a significant
   impact on the economic development and competitiveness of these
   transition countries, when compared with their Western European
   counterparts. A vast number of studies have been conducted to analyze
   the structural changes required for resource-dependent economies to
   achieve long-term development and to understand the synergies between
   commodities and diversification. Yet, the dynamics of resource
   extraction and the resource dependence of regions that have experienced
   periods of sustained levels of growth have largely been overlooked,
   especially the Central and Eastern European region. In this context,
   this article presents an analysis of the level of resource dependence of
   six countries which joined the European Union between 2004 and 2007.
   Using data spanning from the year 2000 to 2017, we calculate the
   Extractives Dependence Index (EDI) of six former Soviet satellite
   nations and one former Soviet state. Our results indicate that the
   commodity structure of trade in the six countries which joined the
   European Union has changed considerably. These countries have reduced
   their economic dependence on extractive resources by developing their
   high value-added and technology-intensive sectors. Our findings also
   reveal that Poland experienced the highest decrease in EDI scores among
   the six CEE countries.},

Title = {Examining hickory plantation expansion and evaluating suitability for it
   using multitemporal satellite imagery and ancillary data},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {109},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hickory (Carya cathayensis) plantations in northwestern Zhejiang
   Province, China, have been extensively expanded in the past three
   decades due to their high economic value; however, improper management
   has caused serious soil erosion problems. To better manage hickory
   plantations, it is necessary to accurately map the spatial distribution
   of hickory expansion and to evaluate land suitability of current hickory
   plantations, but little research on these issues has been conducted.
   This research used bi-temporal Chinese satellite Gaofen-1 images in 2015
   (leaf-on and leaf-off) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM)
   data to develop a land-cover map with emphasis on young and mature
   hickory plantations using the random forest (RF) approach. The
   distribution data of hickory plantations in 2015 was then used to
   extract the spectral signatures of the 2010 Landsat imagery. The
   extracted spectral signatures were classified into different land covers
   using cluster analysis. The same approach was used with the Landsat
   imagery in 2005, 2000, 1995, 1990, and 1985 for mapping hickory dynamic
   change over time. The maximum entropy-based (MaxEnt) model was then used
   to evaluate the land suitability of these hickory plantations based on
   the identified factors from DEM, soil, and climate data. The results
   indicate that (1) the RF classifier based on multisource data can
   effectively produce a land-cover map with an overall accuracy of 89.5\%,
   in particular, producer's and user's accuracies of 88.7\% and 90.2\%,
   respectively, for mature hickory, and 95.2\% and 88.9\%, respectively,
   for young hickory plantations; (2) the areas of hickory plantations
   increased from 157.6 km(2) in 1985 to 528.5 km(2) in 2015 with the
   highest average annual increase rate of 25.3 km(2) in 2000-2005 and
   mainly at the cost of coniferous forests, followed by shrub and
   broadleaf forests; and (3) the MaxEnt model can be effectively used to
   evaluate suitability for hickory plantations. Three suitability
   levels-highly suitable, moderately suitable, and marginally
   suitable-were grouped. The mature hickory forests in 1985 had a higher
   proportion at the highly suitable level than the expanded hickory
   plantations between 1985 and 2015. This research provides important
   results for local governments and farmers to improve the management of
   young hickory plantations. The approach used in this research may be
   used for evaluation of land suitability for other cash forests such as
   Torreya.},

Title = {Financing urban development, three business models: Johannesburg,
   Shanghai and London},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in
   urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of
   which bring new business logics into the production of the built
   environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban
   projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban
   expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors
   and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political
   contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to
   fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance
   arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics.
   However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of
   these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as
   contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation.
   As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban
   outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore
   broaden the discussion from globalised processes of
   ``financialisation{''} to consider three large-scale urban development
   projects from the perspective of their distinctive ``business
   models{''}, including their place in achieving wider strategic
   objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often
   bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of
   financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang,
   Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of
   Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development
   seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park
   Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation,
   associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport
   investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in
   relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with
   the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of
   governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move
   beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider
   accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and
   calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic
   analytical conversation about the implications of different business
   models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban
   development projects.},

Title = {Digital assessments of soil organic carbon storage using digital maps
   provided by static and dynamic environmental covariates},
Journal = {SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Understanding the vertical and lateral distribution of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is indispensable for
   soil use and environmental management because of their vital role in
   soil quality assessments. Primarily, they are needed in calculating soil
   organic carbon storage (SOCS). The objective of this research was to
   provide digital maps of SOC and SOCD variation as well as their
   uncertainties at multiple standardized depths (H1: 0-5, H2: 5-15, H3:
   15-30, H4: 30-60 and H5: 60-100 cm) using a parsimonious model with
   optimized terrain-related attributes and satellite-derived data. SOCS
   were evaluated at soil subgroup levels. An area of about 808 km(2) with
   varying elevation, plant cover and lithology from the Miandoab region,
   West Azerbaijan Province, Iran was selected as a case study area. A
   total of 386 soil samples were collected from 104 profiles comprising
   various soil genetic horizons. A continuous spline function was then
   fitted to the target properties in advance of creating a dataset at five
   standard depth intervals (following the GlobalSoilMap project). These
   were then grouped into three classes including top (H1), middle (H2, H3
   and H4) and bottom (H5) depths to ease interpretation. Static and
   dynamic covariates (30-m resolution) were derived from a digital
   elevation model (DEM) and a suite of Landsat-8 spectral imageries,
   respectively. Four candidate models including stepwise multiple linear
   regression (SMLR), random forest (RF), cubist (CU) and extreme gradient
   boosting (XGBoost) Tree were tested in this study. Finally, the digital
   maps at 30-m resolution of SOC and SOCD and their uncertainties were
   prepared using the best-fit model and the bootstrapping method,
   respectively. Four soil subgroups (Gypsic Haploxerepts, Typic
   Calcixerepts, Typic Haploxerepts and Xeric Haplocalcids) were identified
   across the study area. The covariates had variable contributions on the
   evaluated models. The XGBoost Tree model generally outperformed other
   models for prediction of SOC and SOCD (R-2 = 0.60, on average).
   Regardless of soil subgroups, the uncertainty analysis showed that the
   SOCD map had a low prediction interval range value indicating high
   accuracy. Additionally, the highest SOCS and SOCD was observed at the
   top followed by middle and bottom depths in the study area. All
   subgroups exhibited a decreasing trend of SOCD with increasing depth. A
   similar trend was also observed for SOCS. The highest SOCD (on average)
   was observed in Gypsic Haploxerepts (4.71 kg C/m(2)) followed by Typic
   Calcixerepts (4.46 kg C/m(2)), Typic Haploxerepts (4.45 kg C/m(2)) and
   Xeric Haplocalcids (4.40 kg C/m(2)). Overall, the SOCS normalized by
   area within soil order boundaries was greater in Inceptisols than
   Aridisols across the study area. The findings of this study provide
   critical information for sustainable management of soil resources in the
   area for agricultural production and environmental health in the
   Miandoab region of Iran.},

Title = {Torrential Hazard Prevention in Alpine Small Basin through Historical,
   Empirical and Geomorphological Cross Analysis in NW Italy},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Debris flow is one of the most dangerous natural processes in mountain
   regions and it occur in a wide variety of environments throughout the
   world. In the Italian Alps, some tens of thousands of damaging debris
   flow and, in general, torrential floods associated to intense sediment
   transport in secondary catchments have been documented in the last 300
   years. These have caused socio-economic damage, damage to anthropogenic
   structures or infrastructures and in many cases casualties. Often, in
   the same basins, the occurrence of debris-flow processes recurs many
   years later. Prediction can often be spatial and based on the magnitude
   of the largest known process, while the temporal forecast is the most
   uncertain. It is also possible to increase the resilience of the
   population and of the territory. The present study aims at investigating
   different levels of debris-flow hazard in urban areas on Alpine alluvial
   fans and proposes a strategy for debris-flow prevention based on
   historical research and on a simplified analytical approach, methods
   that also involve relatively low costs. For such analysis, Ischiator
   stream catchment (ca. 20 km(2)) and its alluvial fan (NW Italy) were
   selected. This area was partly affected by historical torrential flood
   associated to intense sediment transport and debris-flow processes.
   Present-day instability conditions along the slope and the stream
   network were detected and synthesized through surveys and aerial photo
   interpretation integrated by satellite images (period 1954-2021). An
   estimation of the potential amount of moving detritus, referred to as
   debris flow, was carried out regarding the June 1957 debris-flow event,
   based on the predictive models. The individual hazard index value was
   estimated based on different methods. The results indicate that 56\% of
   the area is exposed to flood associated to intense sediment transport
   hazard, which fluctuates from high to very high levels; such results are
   supported by debris-flow historical records. Since today almost half of
   the settlement (Bagni di Vinadio) is located on potentially risk-exposed
   areas, the urban evolution policy adopted after the 1957 event failed to
   manage the risk connection to debris-flow activity.},

Title = {Probabilistic seasonal dengue forecasting in Vietnam: A modelling study
   using superensembles},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background
   With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a
   climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of
   dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These
   predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to
   ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue
   forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive
   ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round
   prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition
   from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control
   activities is rare.
   Methods and findings
   We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for
   Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged
   dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue
   models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian
   spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002-2020) of dengue data at
   the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then
   makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future
   time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines.
   We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate
   predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it
   incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings.
   Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate
   predictions (continuous rank probability score {[}CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI
   60.6-148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence
   rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5-80.5) at lead times of 1 to
   3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection
   capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that
   of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in
   southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue
   transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple
   areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the
   system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam
   for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with
   the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI
   102-575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI
   120-168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for
   the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated
   value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the
   consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly
   available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control
   efforts and serotype-specific case data.
   Conclusions
   This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data,
   seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue
   outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough
   lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits
   some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale,
   the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead.
   Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and,
   if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other
   climate-sensitive disease systems.
   Author summary
   Why was this study done?
   A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health
   decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to
   the most at-risk places.
   Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and
   wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal
   climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in
   advance.
   What did the researchers do and find?
   We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue
   incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of
   the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and
   compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and
   locations.
   We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate
   predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6
   months ahead.
   The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks
   than the baseline model across all lead times.
   The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location,
   forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak
   season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission.
   What do these findings mean?
   While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict,
   particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine
   multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of
   forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool.
   Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift
   dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and
   targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of
   scarce resources.},

Abstract = {One problem during offshore well-test operations, stimulations, and
   routine workovers are discharges into the air and sea while flaring.
   These procedures are usually performed by mobile drilling rigs with no
   storage capacity, and thus, hydrocarbons sequestered must be burned off
   from the rig flare booms. Another major problem has been the inability
   of the flare to operate at high flow rates. Because the burning process
   slows the pace of a test, restricting full flow testing, valuable well
   information is lost. Flaring of hydrocarbons also represents an economic
   loss. In the case of oil rigs, for example, flaring not only emits CO2
   into the atmosphere but also burns off usable oil.
   The Crystal Sea well-test vessel was designed to address the problems
   inherent to flaring and, at the same time, provide cost efficiency by
   salvaging usable oil during well testing. The success of her initial two
   jobs on the Statfjord North satellite field in the Norwegian sector of
   the North Sea confirms that sale of the salvaged oil normally lost
   during the flaring process could generate sufficient economic return to
   pay for the vessel. In addition, with its capability to receive products
   at twice the flow rate of conventional methods, the increased accuracy
   of the technical information obtained from the well test further
   enhances its value for improved reservoir management.},

Journal = {NEMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) have gained importance due to
   their widespread distribution, their host range and damage potential
   (Hussey \& Janssen, 2002). A recent survey on root-knot nematodes in
   Europe by Wesemael et al. (2011) showed that out of the 90 species
   described so far, 23 have been found in Europe. Furthermore, this survey
   showed that three species, namely Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and
   M. javanica, are the most prevalent in southern European countries and
   in protected cultivation systems in the northern parts of Europe. These
   species can cause significant economic losses due to yield and quality
   reduction on high value crops. Rootknot nematode species are normally
   identified using morphological features and morphometrics on
   second-stage juveniles (J2), males, on the perineal patterns of mature
   females or isozyme phenotyping of females (Hunt \& Handoo, 2009). As the
   J2 stage is readily available from soil, and identifying this stage is
   most useful for making appropriate management decisions, several
   molecular methods, such as the use of restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms (RFLP), satellite DNA probes, sequence characterised
   amplified regions (SCAR) and real-time PCR assays, have become the
   preferred method for identification (Blok \& Powers, 2009). However, few
   of these methods enable the simultaneous identification of several
   nematode species within one sample.},

Abstract = {Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide
   susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the
   same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the
   models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been
   explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest
   (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then
   explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model
   is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two
   typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological
   conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide
   inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images,
   and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in
   Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of
   topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were
   prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical
   ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were
   adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based
   model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was
   applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix
   and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value
   (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model
   delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County,
   indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where
   the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the
   Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the
   Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other
   than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study
   could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain
   and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting
   landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve

Abstract = {We conducted a satellite tracking study of the endangered short-tailed
   albatross (Phoebastria albatrus) to determine post-breeding season
   distribution, the amount of time spent within exclusive economic zones
   of Pacific Rim countries, and assess factors affecting spatial and
   temporal overlap with commercial fisheries in Alaska. We obtained 6709
   locations for 14 albatrosses (131-808 locations and 51-138 days of
   tracking per bird). Albatrosses ranged widely throughout the North
   Pacific Rim, spending the majority of time within the exclusive
   economics zones of Japan, Russia (Kuril Islands and Kamchatka
   Peninsula), and the United States (Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea,
   Alaska). We found evidence for gender and age-related differences in
   distribution and, therefore, potential interaction with regional
   fisheries. Overall, albatrosses spent the greatest proportion of time
   within the Alaska exclusive economic zone. Within Alaska, albatrosses
   occurred most frequently in fishery management zones that encompassed
   the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, and south of the Alaska Peninsula.
   Short-tailed albatrosses had the greatest potential overlap with
   fisheries that occurred along continental shelf break and slope regions,
   e.g., longlining for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), where albatrosses
   occurred most often. Some birds, however, also made frequent excursions
   onto the extensive Bering Sea shelf, suggesting significant potential
   for interactions with the large-scale walleye pollock (Theragra
   chalcogramma) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) fisheries. Alaskan
   longline fishing fleets have been proactive in using seabird deterrent
   devices, however, our data further emphasize that such efforts beyond
   the Alaska exclusive economic zone would provide a greater conservation
   benefit for this species. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Coastal wetlands of the northern Gulf of California: inventory and
   conservation status},
Journal = {AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-28},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {1. Above 28 degrees N, the coastline of the northern Gulf of California
   is indented Lit frequent intervals by negative or inverse estuaries that
   are saltier at their backs than at their Mouths due to the lack of
   freshwater inflow. These `esteros' total over 215000 ha in area and
   encompass mangrove marshes below 29 degrees N and saltgrass (Distichlis
   palmeri) marshes north of 29 degrees N. An additional 6000 ha of
   freshwater and brackish wetlands are found in the Colorado River delta
   where fresh water enters the interticial zone.
   2. The mangrove marshes in the Gulf of California have been afforded
   some degree of protected status in Mexico, but the northern saltgrass
   esteros do not have priority conservation status and are increasingly
   becoming development targets for resorts, vacation homes and aquaculture
   sites.
   3. We conducted an inventory of the marshes using aerial photography and
   satellite images, and evaluated the extent and type of development on
   each marsh. We reviewed the available literature on the marshes to
   document their vegetation types, and ecological functions in the
   adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
   4. Over 95\% of the mangrove marshes have been developed for shrimp
   fanning. However, the farms are built adjacent to, rather than in, the
   marshes, and the mangrove stands are still mostly intact.
   5. The majority of saltgrass marshes above the mangrove line are still
   relatively unspoiled. However, resort and Vacation home development is
   taking place on land Surrounding them.
   6. We recommend a system of protected reserves incorporating the
   pristine wetlands, along with water quality management and buffer zones
   For the more developed esteros. The saltgrass marshes should be
   considered for conservation protection, similar to the protection given
   to the Southern mangrove marshes whose Value has already been
   recognized. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In situ PM2.5 concentration observations have long been used as critical
   data sources in haze-related studies. Due to the frequently occurring
   haze pollution events, China started to regularly monitor PM2.5
   concentration nationwide from the newly established air quality
   monitoring network in 2013. Nevertheless, the acquisition of these
   invaluable air quality samples is challenging given the absence of a
   publicly available data download interface. In this study, we provided a
   homogenized in situ PM2.5 concentration dataset that was created on the
   basis of hourly PM2.5 data retrieved from the China National
   Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC) via a web crawler between 2015
   and 2019. Methods involving missing value imputation, change point
   detection, and bias adjustment were applied sequentially to deal with
   data gaps and inhomogeneities in raw PM2.5 observations. After excluding
   records with limited samples, a homogenized PM2.5 concentration dataset
   comprising of 1309 5-year long PM2.5 data series at a daily resolution
   was eventually compiled. This is the first attempt to homogenize in situ
   PM2.5 observations in China. The trend estimations derived from the
   homogenized dataset indicate a spatially homogeneous decreasing tendency
   of PM2.5 across China at a mean rate of about 7.6\% per year from 2015
   to 2019. In contrast to raw PM2.5 observations, the homogenized data
   record not only has complete data integrity but is more consistent over
   space and time. This homogenized daily in situ PM2.5 concentration
   dataset is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.917557
   (Bai et al., 2020a) and can be applied as a promising dataset for
   PM2.5-related studies such as satellite-based PM2.5 mapping, human
   exposure risk assessment, and air quality management.},

Abstract = {The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal (Hemiptera:
   Pentatomidae), is native to Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. Its
   dispersion from Asia to the United States of America and Europe caused
   serious damage to fruit, vegetables, and high-value crops. In Greece,
   damages are reported in kiwi orchards in the regions of Pieria and
   Imathia, which are the main production areas of kiwifruit. Greek
   kiwifruit production is expected to increase twofold within the next
   years. The aim of this research is to study the terrain and canopy
   properties that may have an impact on the development of H. halys
   populations. Thus, five kiwi orchards in total were selected in the
   regions of Pieria and Imathia. \& tau;en traps were installed from early
   June to late October within each selected kiwi orchard-two types of
   traps at every side of the orchards and the center. The installed traps
   were examined weekly and the number of the captured H. halys was
   recorded. During the same days, sentinel satellite images were analyzed
   to calculate the vegetation index, NDVI (Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index), and NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index). The
   results showed population variability within the kiwi orchards since the
   population of H. halys was higher in areas with high NDVI and NDWI
   values. Additionally, our research revealed that H. halys prefers to
   develop populations at higher altitudes at both regional and field
   scales. The results of this research can be used to reduce damages by H.
   halys in kiwi orchards using different rates of pesticides depending on
   the prediction of the population size. There are multiple benefits of
   the proposed practice, such as a reduction in the production cost of
   kiwifruits, an increase in farmers' profit, and environmental
   protection.},

Abstract = {This article describes a spatial prediction method that predicts the
   monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly field from the land only
   data. The land data are from the Global Historical Climatology Network
   (GHCN). The prediction period is 1880-1999 and the prediction ocean
   domain extends from 60degreesS to 60degreesN with a spatial resolution
   5degrees x 5degrees. The prediction method is a regression over the
   basis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), The EOFs are computed
   from the following data sets: (a) the Climate Prediction Center's
   optimally interpolated sea surface temperature (OI/SST) data
   (1982-1999); (b) the National Climatic Data Center's blended product of
   land-surface air temperature (1992-1999) produced from combining the
   Special Satellite Microwave Imager and GHCN: and (c) the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research Reanalysis data (1982-1999). The optimal prediction method
   minimizes the first-M-mode mean square error between the true and
   predicted anomalies over both land and ocean. In the optimization
   process, the data errors of the GHCN boxes are used, and their
   contribution to the prediction error is taken into account. The
   area-averaued root mean square error of prediction is calculated.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate that this EOF prediction method can
   accurately recover the global SST anomalies during some circulation
   patterns and add value to the SST bias correction in the early history
   of SST observations and the validation of general circulation models.
   Our results show that (i) the land only data can accurately predict the
   SST anomaly in the El Nino months when the temperature anomaly structure
   has very large correlation scales, and (ii) the predictions for La Nina,
   neutral. or transient months require more EOF modes because of the
   presence of the small scale structures in the anomaly field. Copyright

Title = {Low efficiency of large volcanic eruptions in transporting very fine ash
   into the atmosphere},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Volcanic ash clouds are common, often unpredictable, phenomena generated
   during explosive eruptions. Mainly composed of very fine ash particles,
   they can be transported in the atmosphere at great distances from the
   source, having detrimental socio-economic impacts. However, proximal
   settling processes controlling the proportion (epsilon) of the very fine
   ash fraction distally transported in the atmosphere are still poorly
   understood. Yet, for the past two decades, some operational
   meteorological agencies have used a default value of epsilon = 5\% as
   input for forecast models of atmospheric ash cloud concentration. Here
   we show from combined satellite and field data of sustained eruptions
   that e actually varies by two orders of magnitude with respect to the
   mass eruption rate. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the most intense
   eruptions are in fact the least efficient (with epsilon = 0.1\%) in
   transporting very fine ash through the atmosphere. This implies that the
   amount of very fine ash distally transported in the atmosphere is up to
   50 times lower than previously anticipated. We explain this finding by
   the efficiency of collective particle settling in ash-rich clouds which
   enhance early and en masse fallout of very fine ash. This suggests that
   proximal sedimentation during powerful eruptions is more controlled by
   the concentration of ash than by the grain size. This has major
   consequences for decision-makers in charge of air traffic safety
   regulation, as well as for the understanding of proximal settling
   processes. Finally, we propose a new statistical model for predicting
   the source mass eruption rate with an unprecedentedly low level of

Abstract = {The transformation of resource-based cities and coordinated regional
   development are of great value to global urbanization and sustainable
   economic development in developing countries. Based on Landsat satellite
   monitoring data and urban economic data, statistical analysis and
   geospatial model were used to analyze the characteristics of urban
   development in urban agglomeration in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020,
   and the influencing mechanism was quantitatively revealed. The results
   show that the expansion of urban agglomerations rate reached its peak
   from 2005 to 2010, and then the expansion rate continued to decline. The
   resources of central cities were concentrated, while the development of
   sub-central cities was weak. The overall urbanization rate slows down,
   the scale difference between high-order cities and low-order cities
   expands, and the regional urban system shifts from balanced development
   to polarized development. The overall development of urban
   agglomerations shows a centripetal agglomeration characteristic centered
   on the Harbin Changchun-Daqing and Central and southern Liaoning
   Economic belt. Its west expands faster than the East, and its south
   expands faster than the north. The driving factors of urban
   agglomeration development are mainly administrative power, followed by
   market power, external power and weak internal power. From the point of
   time and space, the external power is on the rise, while the internal
   power is affected by the industrial adjustment and lacks the staying
   power. In view of the coordinated development of resource-based cities,
   this paper proposes to establish the linkage and coordination mechanism
   of integrated development of urban agglomeration, speed up the
   construction of unified market system, carry out transformation
   positioning according to market demand and implement differentiation
   policy.},

Abstract = {The expansion of terrestrial applications including location-based
   services and transportation means such as road or train has fostered the
   design of complex location systems to comply with the needs of these
   applications. In the frame of the service provision ensured by the
   application towards a user or an external entity, these location systems
   are in charge of providing a consolidated information based on the
   position of one or more mobile platforms.
   The complexity of the information reported depends on the type of
   service targeted. It can range from a simple position reporting in the
   case of a low end asset management, to the provision of a reliable
   information (e.g. authenticated and with a mastered uncertainty) on the
   mobile's trajectory for liability critical services such as road
   charging or Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This wide spectrum of
   required technical features calls for a new and broader concept at
   location system level taking into account hybrid solutions in which the
   use of GNSS technologies is complemented with other technology sensors
   to improve the robustness and the performance of the solution.
   Several standards have been generated by different dedicated bodies, in
   order to support the GNSS market development across the various
   application domains mentioned above. For instance, 3GPP Location
   Services (LCS) standards provide minimum performance requirements mainly
   for Assisted-GNSS in the frame of terrestrial telecommunications and
   OMA-LOC LPPe (LTE Positioning Protocol Extensions) defines a
   communication protocol supporting hybridised positioning.
   Nevertheless, there is still a lack of performance specification for a
   large number of terrestrial applications (e.g. electronic fee
   collection, fleet management, container tracking.), including
   multi-modal applications (i.e. those involving various means of
   transport), leading to the development and use of sub-optimal GNSS-based
   systems and solutions.
   The need to unify the different initiatives by concentrating the
   positioning-related standardisation effort for terrestrial applications
   within a single dedicated entity was identified some time ago
   Accordingly, an initiative triggered by a number of industrial and
   institutional stakeholders materialized in the frame of the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This initiative is led by
   the group Satellite Communication and Navigation (SCN) of the Technical
   Committee Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (TC SES), the main
   objective being to elaborate a firm and common standard for GNSS-based
   Location systems. Up to now, the TC-SES has already approved end of 2012
   two Technical Reports related to architectures and application inventory
   which paved the way for the technical specifications to be developed.
   The present paper provides an overview of this on-going standardisation
   work, its objectives and the added-value it will bring. In addition, the
   already approved Technical Specifications will also be presented.
   Thus, the structure of the targeted standard encompasses the four
   following specifications:
   The location system minimum performance requirements, which can be
   considered as the core of the specification work. These requirements are
   determined function of the type of location systems (i.e. association of
   technical enablers), the applicable environmental conditions (depending
   on the type of application), and finally the type of features needed
   (e.g. accuracy, authentication, anti-spoofing, robustness to
   interference).
   The GNSS-based location system reference architecture including the
   interface definition, which is expected to capture a generic and modular
   definition of location systems, thus adaptable to all targeted
   applications.
   The data exchange protocol at location system level (covering in
   particular the handling of the requests from an external application
   provider and the protocol to ensure proper information delivery).
   The test specification (including procedure, scenario and data),
   enabling location system validation versus the previous requirements
   (protocol and performance).
   The methodology used to define the perimeter of the above specifications
   looks for:
   The definition of terrestrial application classes to be covered by the
   standard, including the identification of the key requirements
   (functional and performance) applicable for each application.
   The inventory of the technological enablers taken onboard in the
   standard. These enablers are understood as much as sensor technologies
   (GNSS receivers, Network sensors, inertial sensors, hybridization
   layer), as system layer features allowing Quality of Service (QoS)
   improvements (A-GNSS, D-GNSS, RTK, integrity functions, authentication
   functions).
   The definition of reference environments, derived from the applications'
   typical use cases, and which provide the necessary conditions to
   determine the minimum performance requirements.
   With the ambition to satisfy a wide range of terrestrial applications,
   the standard under preparation, once approved, will surely benefit to
   other standardization groups. Indeed, care is being taken to harmonize
   the work done under TC SES SCN, with standardisation groups in other
   domains. Furthermore, it will also be valuable to actors from markets
   whose specificities do not justify the existence of a dedicated
   standard. All these stakeholders will thus benefit from a more important
   variety of solutions, components and functions available, all of them
   simultaneously compatible to the standard.},

Abstract = {Geomagnetic storms play a critical role in space weather physics with
   the potential for far reaching economic impacts including power grid
   outages, air traffic rerouting, satellite damage and GPS disruption. The
   LFM-MIX is a state-of-the-art coupled magnetospheric-ionospheric model
   capable of simulating geomagnetic storms. Imbedded in this model are
   physical equations for turning the magnetohydrodynamic state parameters
   into energy and flux of electrons entering the ionosphere, involving a
   set of input parameters. The exact values of these input parameters in
   the model are unknown, and we seek to quantify the uncertainty about
   these parameters when model output is compared to observations. The
   model is available at different fidelities: a lower fidelity which is
   faster to run, and a higher fidelity but more computationally intense
   version. Model output and observational data are large spatiotemporal
   systems; the traditional design and analysis of computer experiments is
   unable to cope with such large data sets that involve multiple
   fidelities of model output. We develop an approach to this inverse
   problem for large spatiotemporal data sets that incorporates two
   different versions of the physical model. After an initial design, we
   propose a sequential design based on expected improvement. For the
   LFM-MIX, the additional run suggested by expected improvement diminishes
   posterior uncertainty by ruling out a posterior mode and shrinking the
   width of the posterior distribution. We also illustrate our approach
   using the Lorenz `96 system of equations for a simplified atmosphere,
   using known input parameters. For the Lorenz `96 system, after
   performing sequential runs based on expected improvement, the posterior
   mode converges to the true value and the posterior variability is
   reduced.},

Abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the
   European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land
   component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5),
   hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered
   will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support
   land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the
   water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the
   production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends
   and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical
   integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled
   meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an
   elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land
   shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use
   of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical
   weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared
   to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is
   enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km
   (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5.
   Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or
   satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in
   the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced
   soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of
   river discharge estimations with available observations. However,
   ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to
   those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The
   description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5.
   Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square
   error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly
   due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is
   important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has
   extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month
   delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in
   production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn
   2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its
   extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a
   valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and
   climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water
   resource, land, and environmental management.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single
   or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its
   environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an
   ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging
   implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity
   attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical,
   economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative
   importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest
   vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized
   software, Bio\_CAP Higher biological richness was assigned to the
   habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem
   uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and
   (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated `three-tier
   modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited
   field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid
   assessment of biological richness.
   Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach
   provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to
   ecological habitats), with 89\% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done
   using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and
   evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for
   deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of
   juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e.,
   proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape
   parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in
   turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species
   diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients
   were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species
   diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and
   biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated
   quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation.
   Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the
   elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to
   Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's
   index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of
   distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was
   presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest
   degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This
   methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest
   managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization
   of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific
   species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Title = {An optimisation model for incentivising the development of marginal oil
   and gas fields amidst increasingly complex ownership patterns: UKCS case
   study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many recent discoveries in the UKCS have been economically marginal and
   comparatively small such that they are unable to be developed on a
   standalone basis. Nevertheless, there is a proliferation of production
   facilities and transport infrastructure that can, on accepting a tariff,
   process hydrocarbons from these smaller-sized oil and gas fields,
   thereby contributing to the UK Government's strategy of maximising
   economic recovery (MER). However, the empirical dimensions of
   cost-sharing arrangements between a field owner (host field or hub) and
   tie-in (satellite) fields are not well examined in the literature
   although they influence long-term economics in matured oil provinces. In
   this paper, we develop a mixed integer programming optimisation model to
   analyse how these third-party access to infrastructure issues impact MER
   in the UKCS. A first-best situation with only one regional operator is
   empirically compared with the actual situation of multiple ownership. We
   then assess the impact of different infrastructure unbundling provisions
   via pipeline tariff choices and their interaction with the fiscal regime
   on the net present value (NPV) and other project metrics such as timings
   of hub and field shutdowns. We find that differences in field ownership,
   tariff choice and changes to the fiscal regime impact the overall NPV of
   field developments. Our results also show that having a progressive
   fiscal regime in a mature basin such as the UKCS is important to support
   continued operations under low oil prices while increasing the
   government's take at high prices. The cost-sharing effect shows that
   imposing strict cost-sharing rules does not change overall project
   valuations, even in a low oil price scenario. An additional contribution
   to the extant literature is that tariff determination could be based on
   cost-sharing rules that enjoin each field tieback to a hub to pay a
   split tariff, comprised of a fixed cost of service (access charge) and
   variable (marginal) costs.},

Abstract = {The man-made processes, boosted by the increasingly worldwide need of
   food, fiber, water and shelter, rule the changes of use and land cover
   {[}1]. The deforestation causes the loss of biodiversity and causes
   possible weather impacts {[}2]. With the valuation of natural resources,
   know its allocation in both spatial location and time and know how they
   interact in space is fundamental to create aid mechanisms to decision
   taking as well as planning future development {[}3].
   The spatial modeling simulation help understand the causing mechanisms
   and development processes of environmental systems {[}4]. The spatial
   modeling simulation based on Cellular Automata (CA) have been used for
   assessing complex environmental issues, such as estimate pathways and
   impacts related to the greenhouse gases emissions {[}5], {[}6],
   integrated modeling of population, employment and land-use change {[}7],
   land-use change {[}8], predict possible trends in deforested areas,
   pastures and forests {[}9], among others {[}10].
   This study proposes the development, calibration and outcomes analysis
   of a dynamic spatial modeling simulation Land Use, Land Use Change
   (LULUC), taking into consideration a time period, 1986, 2000 and 2008
   (t(1), t2 and t(3), respectively) where t3 is used to assess quality of
   the simulated map from t(2). Work is focused on reduction rate of the
   forest remaining of Atlantic Rainforest of the Brazilian Municipality of
   Maragogipe located at 82 miles east of the State Capital Salvador in the
   State of Bahia. For so, a modeling platform was used (freeware) based on
   (CA) DINAMICA-EGO (http://www.csr.ufmg.br/dinamica).
   Medium and high resolution satellite images were researched and
   purchased (Landsat-TM and CBERS-2B, sensor CCD; HRC) and other
   cartographical bases correlated to the study area. Information was
   cataloged according to its source, homogenized, and defining the work
   unit: degrees, cartographic and geodetic references, by performing
   conversions and geo-referencing if applicable. Satellite images were
   processed to equalization histogram and radiometric. They were
   classified by using the supervised method and the Bhattacharya
   algorithm. The following classes were identified: rainforest, mangrove,
   grassland, regrow, urban areas and others. The thematic precision was
   assessed with the aid of 300 points acquired in technical visit and by
   high resolution images analyses, in both cases defined at random. The
   descriptive statistics of global accuracy reached the 89\% ratio and the
   Kappa inter-rater agreement: 0.864 number that represents a high
   acceptance level according to scale suggested by Congalton and Green
   {[}3]. The classes were grouped in rainforest and non-rainforest.
   Basically, the model was structured in the software, based on a
   simulation model suggested by Soares-Filho et al. {[}12]. An initial map
   (t(2)) has its classes changed according to change rate ``Transition
   Matrix{''} (TM). TM is the total amount of change for each land cover
   transition type of the maps classified, taking into account the time
   period of the simulation through a cross-tab operation. Such changes
   happen in the most likely areas, defined by the likelihood map,
   resulting from the calculus of Weights of Evidence (WofE). WofE are the
   local odds of a transition land use classes taking into account a range
   of spatial variables by stochastic methods, Bayesian statistical or
   conditional probability. The spatial variables were: altitude, slope,
   soil conditions, conservation areas, distance to major rivers, distance
   to small rivers, distance to urban patches, distance to roads, distance
   to deforestation, and distance to protected areas. In this study,
   analyzed transition was transformation of forest in deforested areas
   (deforestation). Stains of change (landscape disturbance) happened in
   quantity in accordance with TM and had their rate of appearance or
   aggregation according to the values arbitrated to certain software
   function operators, as well as the isometrics of stains. Applied to
   changes, the resulting landscape map was saved at every step of the
   model and retro-fed as initial map in the next step until reaching a
   compatible time variation with t(3), by making possible the validation
   of outcomes. Validation was performed by calculating the similarity
   between the simulated map and the real map (t(3)) based on fuzzy logic,
   applied to a context of pixel vicinity, by means of an exponential decay
   function with an 11-pixel-window.
   By visual analysis (Figure 1), it was noted that the heuristic process
   was successfully designed, as the deforestation standard was respected
   and are congruent with the local probabilities according to the
   likelihood map. The similarity reached by comparison between the model
   outcome and the real map (t(3)) was 46\% of minimal similarity and 77\%
   of maximal similarity.},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well
   documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern
   depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This
   first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species
   richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups
   in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal
   variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index
   (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each
   vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations
   in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination
   method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25
   each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season
   respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during
   2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed
   that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1.
   Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2.
   Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus
   Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or
   CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the
   majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The
   majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas
   therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the
   most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were
   recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher
   mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields,
   suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical
   correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local
   climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most
   important in controlling the variations in the weed species data
   followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI
   and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are
   required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area.
   Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their
   distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing,
   quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and
   intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity,
   quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing,
   quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their
   relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are
   recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.},

Title = {Forest Fire Susceptibility Zonation in Eastern India Using Statistical
   and Weighted Modelling Approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Recurring forest fires disturb ecological balance, impact socio-economic
   harmony, and raise global concern. This study implements multiple
   statistical and weighted modelling approaches to identify forest fire
   susceptibility zones in Eastern India. Six models, namely, Frequency
   Ratio (FR), Certainty Factor (CF), Natural Risk Factor (NRF), Bivariate
   statistical (Wi and Wf), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and
   Logistic Regression (LR) were used in the study. Forest fire inventory
   (2001 to 2018) mapping was done using forest fire points captured by the
   MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. Fire
   responsible components, namely, topography (which has four variables),
   climate (5), biophysics (8) and disturbance (4) were used as inputs to
   the modelling approaches. Multicollinearity analysis was carried out to
   examine the association and remove the highly-correlated variables
   before performing the modeling. Validation of model prediction levels
   was done using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
   (ROC curve-AUC) value. The results reveal that the areas with west and
   southwest orientations, and moderate slope demarcate higher
   susceptibility to forest fire. High precipitation areas with lower
   temperature but ample solar radiation increase their susceptibility to
   forest fire. Mixed deciduous forest type with ample solar radiation,
   higher NDVI, lower NDWI and lower TWI values exhibits higher
   susceptibility. Model validation shows that LR (with AUC = 0.809)
   outperforms other models used in the study. To minimize the risk of fire
   and frame with proper management plans for the study area,
   susceptibility mapping using satellite imageries, GIS technique, and
   modelling approaches is highly recommended.},

Abstract = {Background and aims: The objective of this work is to classify mountain
   wetlands (vegas) in the Central Andes between 28 degrees y 53 degrees S,
   based on geomorphology and hydrology. In addition, it seeks to
   characterize and determine the area, height, and slope of the vegas in
   each typology. M\&M: The determination of the different typologies was
   carried out based on an integrated biophysical approach at different
   scales of spatial analysis, where the vegas present in the study area
   were identified and their link with hydrological and geomorphological
   aspects. The dominant runoff types, and the geomorphological units were
   determined. Satellite images ALOS-AVNIR-2, Landsat 5 TM and field data
   were used. Results: A total of 304 vegas were identified that are
   determined by the geomorphological unit (river plains, alluvial fan,
   hillside, undifferentiated foothills, depression without surface
   discharge with or without water and fault) and the dominant type of
   runoff (linear surface, mantiform subsurface and subsurface mantiform to
   superficial linear). Four typologies of vegas are recognized: Riverbank,
   Hillside, Depression and Fault. The Riverbank and Hillside typologies
   were dominant in number and area. Eight and slope did not result
   different between typologies. Conclusions: The vegas present in the

Title = {Vegetable mapping using fuzzy classification of Dynamic Time Warping
   distances from time series of Sentinel-1A images},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vegetable production is important because of the food security, diet
   improvement and socio-economic value. Mapping the location and extent of
   vegetable fields is therefore important in agricultural policy, food
   security and farmer support. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a common way
   to map crops from time series of satellite images. However, as all hard
   classifications, it does not show the spatial distribution of
   uncertainty in the classification. In fuzzy classification, where
   memberships to multiple classes are assigned to each pixel, differ-ences
   in membership between the first and the runners-up class can be used to
   assess classification uncertainty at the pixel level. This research
   formulates a fuzzy classifier based upon Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
   Warping (TWDTW) distances to map vegetable types from time series of
   Sentinel-1A SAR images. For each pixel, the TWDTW distances to the
   classes was normalised by dividing them by the sum of all TWDTW
   distances to all the classes for that pixel. The normalized distances
   were then used to compute fuzzy memberships for each pixel to each
   class, using the Gaussian membership function. Based on these
   memberships, fuzzy measures such as Confusion Index (CI), Ambiguity
   Index (AI), fuzziness and fuzzy membership were calculated and different
   thresholds applied on each of the measures during subsequent
   defuzzification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the
   defuzzified output results were 0.86 and 0.83, respectively, which was
   an improvement with regard to the crisp Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
   Warping with SPRING strategy for subsequence searching (TWDTWS)
   algorithm with 0.73 and 0.68 for overall accuracy and kappa,
   respectively. This study concludes that this new approach improves
   classification accuracy in image classification by excluding pixels with
   high un-certainty, which is especially relevant when only a limited
   number of classes are sampled and mapped.},

Title = {Head-cut gully erosion susceptibility mapping in semi-arid region using

Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Gully erosion has been identified in recent decades as a global threat
   to people and property. This problem also affects the socioeconomic
   stability of societies and therefore limits their sustainable
   development, as it impacts a nonrenewable resource on a human scale,
   namely, soil. The focus of this study is to evaluate the prediction
   performance of four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression
   (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), Linear Discriminate
   Analysis (LDA), and the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), which are novel
   approaches in gully erosion modeling research, particularly in semi-arid
   regions with a mountainous character. 204 samples of erosion areas and
   204 samples of non-erosion areas were collected through field surveys
   and high-resolution satellite images, and 17 significant factors were
   considered. The dataset cells of samples (70\% for training and 30\% for
   testing) were randomly prepared to assess the robustness of the
   different models. The functional relevance between soil erosion and
   effective factors was computed using the ML models. The ML models were
   evaluated using different metrics, including accuracy, the kappa
   coefficient. kNN is the ideal model for this study. The value of the AUC
   from ROC considering the testing datasets of KNN is 0.93; the remaining
   models are associated to ideal AUC and are similar to kNN in terms of
   values. The AUC values from ROC of GLM, LDA, and CART for testing
   datasets are 0.90, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively. The value of accuracy
   considering the validation datasets of LDA, CART, KNN, and GLM are 0.85,
   0.82, 0.89, 0.84 respectively. The values of Kappa of LDA, CART, and GLM
   for testing datasets are 0.70, 0.65, and 0.68, respectively. ML models,
   in particular KNN, GLM, and LDA, have achieved outstanding results in
   terms of creating soil erosion susceptibility maps. The maps created
   with the most reliable models could be a useful tool for sustainable
   management, watershed conservation and prevention of soil and water
   losses.},

Title = {Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for
   Prioritizing Dam Removal},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation
   benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow
   regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present
   study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of
   Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance
   between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological
   benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four
   sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream
   connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities
   for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the
   movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The
   proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir
   (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However,
   before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the
   connectivity results will be balanced with other important
   socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an
   inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an
   observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of
   any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on
   surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the
   riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others.
   All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also
   included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network.
   The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were
   processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for
   inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability.
   These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to
   calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used
   to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria.
   The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega
   and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed
   obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For
   the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may
   constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this
   case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this
   connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity,
   it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that
   critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of
   field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement
   along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the
   implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam
   removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define
   exclusion areas for additional obstacles.},

Abstract = {Placing reflectors in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to
   shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for
   use as a countermeasure against climate change. While the sunshade
   technology has been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoints, no study
   has evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a
   cost-effectiveness viewpoint, presuming that it is used in combination
   with CO2 abatement options as a pillar of the mitigation of climatic
   change. Nor have the contributions of geoengineering research and
   development to the economics of overall climate control measures been
   evaluated. Such evaluations are attempted in this study, which focuses
   on a space-based sunshade technology. As a result, it is recommended
   that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m(2) through the sunshades
   over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the
   21st century. In this case, an increase in global CO2 emissions by some
   15\% is allowed in the former half of the 21st century, and the total
   climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US\$ on a
   present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshades are
   unavailable. To enjoy the above advantages, the mass of the sunshade
   stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a
   doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration should be lower than 100
   Mt/2xCO(2) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing
   (space-launching) sunshades from 6000 to 1000 US\$/kg over a
   half-century. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Restitution Study for the Plans of a Group of Traditional Erzurum
   Houses in Ibrahim Pasa District},
Journal = {MEGARON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-285},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to purpose a restitution for the plan of a
   group of traditional Erzurum houses, which were built as independent but
   adjacent houses in the second half of the 18th century in the historical
   city center of Erzurum, by examining the spatial, structural and
   functional transformation with the abolition of borders while
   transforming into a cafe/restaurant. These traditional Erzurum houses
   are located at the intersection of Rasit Pasa and Salih Yuzbasi Streets
   in Ibrahim Pasa District, which is one of the historical settlements in
   the south west of Inner Castle. Houses once used independently began to
   be used as a single building with a number of changes made in the plan
   layout. However, during the change of function, facade layout and
   numerous spaces intertwined under the same roof and this made it
   difficult to understand the original plan scheme of the buildings. As
   there is a lack of documentation of the changes made and the presence of
   ambiguity in the different verbal information sources about the
   buildings, the main problem of this study is to determine the number of
   houses the cafe/restaurant consists of. Other important problems are the
   determination of the boundaries and the spatial organization of the
   houses. In addition, the scarcity of written sources in literature about
   these historic adjacent houses, which are numerous but more modest in
   the urban fabric compared with the two-story independent houses,
   increases the importance of this study. In order to reveal the changes
   and transformation of a group of traditional Erzurum houses built
   independently but adjacent to each other, first of all, traditional
   Erzurum houses were examined architecturally under the headings of
   location, plan and facade layout, material and construction technique
   properties. Then the architectural features and possible traces of
   change on this group of buildings, which were not mentioned in any
   source or document, were revealed in terms of location and plan
   features. After documentation of the current situation, property deeds,
   cadastral plans, satellite images, old photographs, historical and
   current maps, traces of the buildings themselves, information about
   traditional Erzurum houses and comparative studies were used to
   understand the different building phrases and restitution of the plan of
   these buildings. When the archive documents are evaluated, it is
   understood that the group of buildings were built in the second half of
   the 18th century according to Nene Saliha Hanim's Foundation record
   dated to 1791-92. Also, parcel numbers with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 belong to
   a foundation named ``Nene Saliha Hanim{''} and parcel numbers with 5,
   15, 16, 17, 18, 41 and 42 belong to private property according to the
   land registers. Within the building group, in addition to eight
   independent houses analyzed spatially, functionally and structurally,
   the external body walls and garden boundaries of at least two more
   houses, which do not exist currently, were identified. Possibly, a khan
   might have existed in the place of one. Unlike the traditional Erzurum
   houses mentioned in the literature, these houses, for which a
   restitution is prepared, have a simple spatial organization consisting
   of one or two rooms. The studied houses, which contain many clues about
   the social and cultural life style of the old Erzurum city, yet which
   are decreasing in number, should be registered as cultural assets by the
   relevant Conservation Board.
   Additionally, the reconstruction permit decision given in the
   Conservation Development Plan for this region that conforms to many
   protection criteria such as historical, architectural, continuity,
   rarity and memorial value with its structure, parcel and streets should
   be re-evaluated. This study is important as it reveals that these
   single-story houses, which are stacked in a building block on a
   traditional street texture, with modest architectural organization
   should be part of the relevant literature on traditional Erzurum houses,
   which mainly deals with independent separate two-story houses owned by
   wealthy families. In addition, it is stated for the first time in the
   literature with this study that the parcels inside the building block
   get access to the main street through a common closed inner street, in
   contrast to the houses lined up adjacent to each other on independent
   lots on the street.},

Abstract = {Urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta is the most developed one of
   three urban agglomerations in China, which consists of Shanghai, some
   cities located in the south of Jiangsu province and the north of
   Zhejiang province. Shanghai is an international economic, financial,
   trade and shipping center, which leads the progress of urban
   agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. It is a lively region which has
   the fastest economy growth and the largest economy amount The
   development of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta has played a
   very important role in China's sustained and steady economic growth all
   the while. However, with the economic advancement in urban agglomeration
   of Yangtze River Delta, the augment of chemical emissions gases, such as
   non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), CFCS, CO, NO, NO2, caused the decrease
   of the amount of O-3. According to the previous research, O-3 had a
   strongly relationship with ultraviolet radiation (UV), and the depletion
   of O-3 would cause the increase of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
   earth surface. The ultraviolet radiation has a strong negative
   ecological effect in many aspects, such as people, animal, plant,
   biogeochemical cycles and the structure of the ecosystem. In the
   situation, it is very meaningful for us to study the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of O-3 and ultraviolet radiation in urban
   agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta based on remote sensing data; it
   can also be very important to analyze the relationship between the
   ultraviolet radiation and O-3. Government departments can legislate or
   make planning to protect ozone layer in order to reduce the surface
   ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface to maintain residents' health
   and ecosystem according the results of the article.
   We used the total ultraviolet radiation product of SCIAMACHY (from Jan.
   2003 to Dec. 2007), the total ozone product of SCIAMACHY (from Jan. 2003
   to Sep. 2004) and OMI (from Oct. 2004 to Dec. 2007) to analyze the
   ultraviolet radiation and total ozone spatiotemporal characteristics
   reaching the earth surface, as well as the relationship between them in
   urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. Urban agglomeration of
   Yangtze River Delta was divided into sixteen cities according the
   administration management and economy activities.
   The calculation results revealed that (1) the spatial feature of the
   annual and seasonal of ultraviolet radiation and the total ozone
   presented significant regional difference, but the distribution
   characteristics of them were not the same. The spatial character of
   ultraviolet radiation in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was
   that cities located in the lower latitude had the higher ultraviolet
   radiation, but had the lower total ozone. However, the cities located in
   the higher latitude had the lower ultraviolet radiation, but had the
   higher total ozone. (2) the average value of summer ultraviolet
   radiation of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was the highest
   one followed by spring, autumn, and the average value of winter
   ultraviolet radiation was the lowest; the total ozone of spring of urban
   agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was the highest followed by summer,
   winter, and the total ozone of autumn was the lowest. (3) The seasonal
   change amplitude of ultraviolet radiation was not significant, and the
   trends were different, while the seasonal change range of total ozone
   was significant, and the trends were different. (4) The calculation
   results showed that there were negative correlation between the
   ultraviolet radiation and total ozone in urban agglomeration of Yangtze
   River Delta.},

Abstract = {Food culture is most influenced by the locality of its origin, which
   will have been one of food acquisition and processing by various means.
   It is generally agreed, and is the basis of much United Nations,
   especially Food and Agriculture Organisation strategic development
   policy, that successful agriculture, horticulture and aquacuiture along
   with fishing, underpin economically viable and healthy communities with
   their various food cultures. We also know that this must be in tandem
   with maternal literacy and operational health care systems. These
   elements are best represented on a regional basis. There is a growing
   consumer interest in knowing where one's food comes from as a measure of
   ``food integrity{''}. However, food production alone can be a precarious
   business and relate to a lesser or greater extent to local food culture
   and to trade, which may be complementary or at-odds with each other.
   Likewise, the local food culture may have its strengths and weaknesses
   as far as its ability to meet nutritional and health needs is concerned.
   Local food production may be restricted because of geographical or
   socio-economic conditions which preclude food diversity, although this
   may be compensated for by trade. Where food adequacy and diversity is
   compromised, and soils poor, various macro-nutrient, micronutrient (from
   animals and plants) and phytonutrient (nutritionally-advantageous food
   component from plants) deficiencies may be in evidence. These food
   system problems may be intertwined with food culture - for example,
   ``rice-based and water-soluble vitamin poor{''}; ``few animal-derived
   foods like meat, fish, eggs and milk with associated low calcium,
   vitamin D, Vitamin B-12 and long chain n-3 fatty acid intakes{''}; ``low
   fruit and vegetable intake with limited carotenoids and other
   phytonutrients{''}. Geo-satellite surveillance and mopping is
   identifying such ``hot spots{''}: for regional food problems, as well as
   hot spots where most of the world's biodiversity is found (1.4\% of land
   on earth). On the other hand, regional food culture can confer
   considerable advantage for health and economic development, but does not
   necessarily do so. The challenge is to respect and retain traditional
   food knowledge and sustainable food systems, with good governance for
   food security. There has been a recent awakening of interest and concern
   about the lack of documentation of traditional and indigenous food
   cultures which are important not only for their own sake, but for the
   legacy of food knowledge which they can confer on future generations,
   provided they are not lost. Hence, the value of a special focus on
   African food cultures (www.healthyeatingclub.org/Africa), including Rift
   and Nile Valleys and North West African foods, which are the cradles of
   human food systems and habits. This is the case too with indigenous
   foods and food cultures (whether hunter-gatherer or subsistence
   agriculture); with relatively long-living food cultures in North East
   Asia, with food cultural distinction and fusion (FHILL and SENECA
   studies) and with migratory Food Habits. By and large, there is a
   remarkable resilience and ingenuity of people and their food systems,
   but monoculture and lack of diversity encourage food system failure.},

Title = {Greening residential quarters in China: What are the roles of urban
   form, socioeconomic factors, and biophysical context?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Residential greenspace has great intracity variations. Its driving
   factors have been widely investigated in Western countries (e.g., in
   Europe and North America), where residential areas are mostly privately
   owned, but few studies have examined the determinants of residential
   greenspace in China, where land is owned by the gov-ernment. Taking the
   subtropical city of Changsha, China, as an example, this study mapped
   the percent green cover (PGC) in residential quarters with a
   fine-resolution satellite image. We also investigated its driving
   factors measured from multisource geospatial data. The results show that
   (1) the PGC in the residential quarters showed great spatial variation,
   with an average of 36.6\% (0-85.7\%) and a standard deviation of 18.3\%.
   (2) Urban form, biophysical context, and socioeconomic factors together
   explained 49.18\% of the variation in the PGC, and they independently
   explained 22.87\%, 11.17\%, and 2.31\% of the variation, respectively.
   (3) Residential quarter size, PGC in the surrounding buffer zone,
   residential quarter age, housing value, and population density
   significantly and positively impact the PGC, while percent building
   cover, floor area ratio, and distance to city center had significant
   negative impacts. The strongest positive and negative impacts came from
   PGC in the surrounding buffer zone and percent building cover,
   respectively. Socioeconomic factors, the dominant driving factors in
   Western countries, show little impact on residential PGC. These findings
   expand our understanding of the intracity variation in greenspace
   coverage and the driving factors, which sheds light on the effective
   planning and management of urban greenspaces in China.},

Abstract = {The people of northwestern Alaska have had a long relationship with
   local populations of Rangifer tarandus. During the last 200 years this
   relationship has changed from one of subsistence to overexploitation of
   caribou (the name for wild reindeer in North America), to commercial
   livestock production of semi domesticated reindeer and now may be
   returning to a subsistence economy based on caribou. Reindeer were
   introduced to Alaska in 1892 because of the disappearance of caribou, a
   subsistence resource. Until recently, reindeer meat and velvet antler
   production generated significant employment and revenue important to the
   economies of rural Alaskan communities. However, from 1976 to 1996 the
   Western Arctic Caribou Herd (WACH) increased from about 75,000 to
   463,000 animals. Concurrently, winter range use of the WACH shifted
   westward onto traditional reindeer ranges of the Seward Peninsula for
   the first time in over 100 years. This event has produced socio-economic
   and ecological consequences for the region. Many reindeer herders have
   lost 75-100 percent of their herds through commingling and out-migration
   with wild caribou. This loss, amounting to over 17,000 reindeer,
   represents a potential economic value of millions of dollars. Many
   herders have adopted new technologies, such as satellite telemetry and
   intensive herding to salvage what is left of their herds. Here we
   discuss the role of grazing animals and patterns of human resource use
   in an Arctic system. We then discuss our findings on the effects and
   changes in management practices brought about by caribou incursion in
   the context of the regional economy on the Seward Peninsula.},

Abstract = {Recent flood events along the international border between the USA and
   Mexico resulted in significant economic damage and loss of human life.
   The International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency responsible
   for monitoring US-Mexican flood control levees, had requested funding
   for maintenance and improvement of these levees. However, the Office of
   Management and Budget requires agencies to provide benefits or in this
   case avoided loss estimates to justify the budget request. Due to severe
   time constraints in the budgetary process there was a need for a rapid
   assessment of the potential economic impacts from a failure of this
   ageing flood-control infrastructure. The economic losses avoided by four
   major flood-control projects on the Rio Grande were estimated using an
   innovative combination of satellite imagery, geographic information
   systems, and economic methods. The control projects apply to about 547
   km (340 miles) of levees from Caballo Reservoir in New Mexico to
   Brownsville, Texas, and include several million people, extensive
   industry, and agricultural production. High resolution imagery was used
   to identify and quantify potential flood inundation areas, types of land
   use, and impacts of flood-control infrastructure failure. Value
   estimates of residential, industrial, and commercial property, and
   agricultural production at risk were developed from property assessment
   data, crop enterprise budgets, census data, and community leaders.
   Damage factors accounting for flood inundation levels and building
   contents were then used to develop gross economic losses avoided by
   flood-control infrastructure for each of the different property and land
   use types in each project area. The baseline analysis indicates that the
   four projects cumulatively prevent one time losses of US\$322.9 million
   in flood-control protection.},

Abstract = {Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of
   transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with
   wireless Internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways.
   If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be
   enormous.
   This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group
   endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G
   and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of
   the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG
   (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed
   access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals
   cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on
   this planet.
   While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the
   world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination
   to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost
   of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin
   down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important.
   But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the
   goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can
   bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create
   large global projects and influence the network service providers,
   manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU
   working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the
   relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes
   into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach
   to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those
   living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and
   industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are
   available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems
   level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable.
   In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to
   be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer
   interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who
   are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the
   devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible
   spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to
   increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable
   deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is
   intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology
   gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is
   affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the
   targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative
   business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the
   long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural
   population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE)
   Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service
   providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation
   Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting
   from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.},

Abstract = {To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR)
   model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected
   Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters;
   especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical
   records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a
   geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides
   in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into
   two datasets: 70\% of them were used as the training dataset and 30\% as
   the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors
   (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors;
   human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary
   conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library
   for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model
   training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the
   established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation
   in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis
   results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very
   low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of
   conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was
   explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and
   recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above
   two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances
   between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than
   the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF
   model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high
   and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the
   geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other
   hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable
   for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of
   its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The
   outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine
   learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and
   urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing
   demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility
   assessments.},

Abstract = {Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have
   teamed together to demonstrate the multimission capabilities of
   commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record
   testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across
   air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio
   of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are
   uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the
   ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated
   deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios.
   Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and
   civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely
   controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial
   robots providing services and access that was never before considered
   valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and
   taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling
   subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and
   disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same
   potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance,
   rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these
   systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy.
   We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the
   Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle
   systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center
   (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with
   autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature.
   Additional customized, missioncentric sensors may be added to the
   systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase
   autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication
   architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress
   monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the
   remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level
   of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications
   (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite
   communications for navigation and mission data transfer.
   Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to
   accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of
   other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science
   missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the
   sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while
   characterizing the operating conditions for each test series.
   ``Autonomy{''} is a capability that means different things to different
   people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system
   to react to new information, whether from external source or
   self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of
   an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts
   such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications
   with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through
   these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator
   workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the
   system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance.
   Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these
   objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and
   data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous
   underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation
   Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable
   process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime
   unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing
   the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test
   units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at
   least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate
   capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives.
   We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and
   the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for
   unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving
   that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as
   evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.},

Title = {Generating digital terrain model: joint use of airborne lidar data and
   optical images},
Journal = {TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The knowledge of an accurate topography is a prerequest for monitoring
   natural hazards and for environmental management (e.g. hydrologic and
   erosion models). Remote sensing lidar systems are active sensors which
   record altimeter data of the Earth's surface as 3D point clouds: from an
   emitted laser pulse, the receptor detects backscaterred photons from the
   reflecting target. The altimeter accuracy is often higher than in the
   case of using stereoscopic conventional techniques, even if the ground
   density of the data is often lower. Additionnaly, beyond the altimeter
   information, these data contain spectral information related to the
   target reflectance in the infra-red domain. Depending on the target
   geometry, lidar systems can acquire several echos for a single laser
   pulse. This property is particularly interesting in forests or in areas
   of urban vegetation since it provides not only the canopy height, but
   also, under certain conditions, the terrain height under the vegetation
   layer.
   Many algorithms have been implemented to sort out the automatic
   classification problem of 3D point clouds providing ground and
   off-ground points as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). This is
   mainly due to the various aspects of landscapes within a global survey
   which can include urban, forest or mountainous areas.
   This paper presents the generation of DTMs based on the joint use of
   optical images and lidar data. The study is focused on rural areas where
   a large scale mapping is a major issue. We propose an algorithm based on
   a predictive Kalman filter for which the temporal component is replaced
   by a spacial indexation. The algorithm consists in analyzing the
   altimeter distribution of the point cloud of a local area in the local
   slope frame. We insist on the role of local slopes for determining the
   ground height especially in case of steep slope terrain. We assume that
   points of the first altimeter mode (lowest points) belong to the
   terrain. The mean height of these points correspond to the measured DTM
   value. The final DTM value at a specific position is obtained by a
   linear combination between the measured value and the predicted value.
   The predicted value depends on the neighboring pixels through their
   respective uncertainties. The slopes are also integrated in the
   predictive filter. The local slope is estimated by robust M-estimator,
   based on the local first altimeter mode. The final slope for each site
   depends on the corresponding neighborhood uncertainties. This process
   makes the slope estmation more robust. Finally, the predictive Kalman
   framework provides not only a robust terrain surface, but also an
   uncertainty for each DTM pixel as well as a map of normal vectors.
   The local window size is a critical parameter in filtering algorithms.
   It should be small enough to keep all ground details but large enough to
   ensure the removal of off-ground objects such as trees or/and buildings.
   Consequently, we S introduce an adaptation of the local neighborhood
   based on the integration of image and lidar data within a predictor of
   high vegetation areas. In this context, we decided to investigate the
   potential of using raw uncalibrated lidar intensity in case of a joint
   indice computation, which is generally derived from image-based infrared
   data. Consequently, lidar intensity and optical images are combined to
   generate a Hybrid Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (HNDVI). The
   lidar provides the infrared band whereas the aerial image provides RGB
   spectral bands.
   A vegetation mask is then calculated with HNDVI and lidar variance
   information. In fact, higher values of HNDVI are likely to correspond to
   vegetated areas and vegetation is described as non-ordered point cloud
   with a high variance compared to human-made structures. Based on the
   vegetation mask, the local neighborhood size continuously varies from a
   predefined minimum distance to an automatically processed upper boundary
   depending on the vegetated area density. Lidar data have been collected
   in 2004 by the Institut Frangais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la
   Mer (IFREMER) over the Morbihan Gulf, France. It has been funded by
   TOTAL. The entire survey is composed of 230.106 points with intensities
   and has been acquired with an ALTM (Optech) system 1210. The point
   density is 0.7 pt/m(2). The lidar wavelength is 1064 nm. Optical images
   are extracted from the BDOrtho (R) French orthophoto data basis of the
   Institut Geographique National with a nominal resolution of 0.5 m, but
   resampled at 2.5 m for the generation of the Hybrid-NDVI image.
   Conclusive results show the potentiality of a full combination of lidar
   data and RGB optical images for improving the generation of fine DTMs on
   rural environments. The filtering process is more robust, DTM are less
   picked due to vegetation filtering. However, in case of dense
   vegetation, the window size can be large and the average terrain height
   may be underestimated. As future work, further area predictors can be
   developed to adapt the proposed methodology to various landscapes and
   relieves.},

   urban environment of Chaoyang District, Beijing. Past patterns of LULC
   and LST were identified through the maximum likelihood classification
   (MLC) method and multispectral Landsat satellite images during the
   1990-2018 data period. The cellular automata (CA) and stochastic
   transition matrix of the Markov model were applied to simulate future
   (2025) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns.
   The CA model was validated for the simulated and estimated LULC for
   1990-2018, with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.83, using validation
   modules in IDRISI software. Our results indicated that the cumulative
   changes in built-up to vegetation area were 74.61 km2 (16.08\%) and
   113.13 km2 (24.38\%) from 1990 to 2018. The correlation coefficient of
   land use and land cover change (LULCC), including vegetation, water
   bodies and built-up area, had values of r = -0.155 (p > 0.005), -0.809
   (p = 0.000), and 0.519 (p > 0.005), respectively. The results of future
   analysis revealed that there will be an estimated 164.92 km2 (-12\%)
   decrease in vegetation area, while an expansion of approximately 283.04
   km2 (6\% change) will occur in built-up areas from 1990 to 2025. This
   decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely
   cause a rise of approximately similar to 10.74 degrees C and similar to
   12.66 degrees C in future temperature, which would cause a rise in
   temperature (2025). The analyses could open an avenue regarding how to
   manage urban land cover patterns to enhance the resilience of cities to
   climate warming. This study provides scientific insights for
   environmental development and sustainability through efficient and
   effective urban planning and management in Beijing and will also help
   strengthen other research related to the UHI phenomenon in other parts
   of the world.},

Abstract = {The mapping of soil nutrients is a key issue for numerous applications
   and research fields ranging from global changes to environmental
   degradation, from sustainable soil management to the precision
   agriculture concept. The characterization, modeling and mapping of soil
   properties at diverse spatial and temporal scales are key factors
   required for different environments. This paper is focused on the use
   and comparison of soil chemical analyses, Visible near infrared and
   shortwave infrared VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy, partial least-squares
   regression (PLSR), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Landsat-8 operational land
   imager (OLI) images, to inexpensively analyze and predict the content of
   different soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium
   (K)), pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) in arid conditions. To achieve
   this aim, 100 surface samples of soil were gathered to a depth of 25 cm
   in the Wadi El-Garawla area (the northwest coast of Egypt) using
   chemical analyses and reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range
   from 350 to 2500 nm. PLSR was used firstly to model the relationship
   between the averaged values from the ASD spectroradiometer and the
   available N, P, and K, pH and SOM contents in soils in order to map the
   predicted value using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and secondly to retrieve N,
   P, K, pH, and SOM values from OLI images. Thirty soil samples were
   selected to verify the validity of the results. The randomly selected
   samples included the spatial diversity and characteristics of the study
   area. The prediction of available of N, P, K pH and SOM in soils using
   VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy showed high performance (where R-2 was 0.89,
   0.72, 0.91, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively) and quite satisfactory results
   from Landsat-8 OLI images (correlation R-2 values 0.71, 0.68, 0.55, 0.62
   and 0.7, respectively). The results showed that about 84\% of the soils
   of Wadi El-Garawla are characterized by low-to-moderate fertility, while
   about 16\% of the area is characterized by high soil fertility.},

Title = {MODIS sensors can monitor spatiotemporal trends in fog and low cloud
   cover at 1 km spatial resolution along the U.S. Pacific Coast},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems
   along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently
   unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally,
   FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air
   traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to
   inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve
   transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in
   current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog,
   its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year
   (2000-2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine
   its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the
   California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months
   (June-September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an
   existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min
   intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear
   relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average
   r(2) of 0.82 and p-value of < 0.01. This strong relationship
   demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately
   detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our
   FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia
   sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California.
   This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution
   FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring
   spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our
   case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates
   considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend
   occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible
   Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC
   data for all summer months for the years 2000-2020. The methods and
   dataset presented in this paper provide a means for efficient, daily
   FLCC monitoring at 1 km(2) resolution, as well as the capacity for
   historical FLCC analyses.},

Abstract = {The seasonal and occasional movement of wild animals including elephants
   from one terrestrial habitat to another habitat are very common natural
   as well as biological habits for the survival of their lives. Around 163
   km railway track runs from Siliguri Junction (SGUJ) to Alipurduar
   Junction (APDJ) within biodiversity hotspot region. According to the
   report of Forest Department, around 14 prominent and 59 minor elephant
   corridors have been crisscrossed over the railway track and in between
   the years 1974 and 2019, nearly 71 elephants are brutally killed due to
   collision with running trains. The kernel density estimation model is
   applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal death risk of elephants. To
   predict the spatial vulnerability or risk of accidental death of
   elephants, Kernel density estimation analytical algorithms like
   Bandwidth selection, Intensity, Grid Resolution, Kernel function have
   been considered. This model considers past accidental deaths data along
   with secondary data like train speed, fragmentation of elephant
   habitats, distance of croplands from railway track, human encroachment
   with electric fencing etc. The anthropogenic activities as well as land
   use and land cover change have been analysed using Landsat 8 Operational
   Land Imager-OLI (2019) satellite images and digitally processed by EDRAS
   IMAGINE 16.5(v16.5.0.852) software. Similarly digital thematic maps have
   also been prepared on ArcGIS 10.3 platform. Kernel Density Estimation
   (KDE) intensity (risk) is computed considering the Elephant Death Risk
   Score (EDRS) as it takes into account of the first and second order
   properties. Fixed bandwidth is selected for the whole distribution and
   it is computed by the nearest neighbour distance mean method. On the
   basis of calculated tau value, (the mean distance between centroids and
   nearest neighbour index) Kernel Density map is prepared to show the
   elephant death risk in term of first order properties and second order
   properties. The result shows very high and high KD (risk) values (
   0.9799-10.0709) are confined in the eastern and western segments of the
   SGUJ to APDJ railway line. Therefore, this model helps to take
   sustainable holistic environmental management of wild animals as well as
   wild natural habitats in different corners of the globe.},

Title = {Determining critical light and hydrologic conditions for macrophyte
   presence in a large shallow lake: The ratio of euphotic depth to water
   depth},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {317-326},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Light determines macrophyte distribution, community composition and
   biomass in shallow lakes. Therefore, it is vital to determine the
   critical underwater light climate thresholds for macrophyte degradation
   and recovery. In this study, we first proposed a novel index, defined as
   the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to water depth (WD), as a measure of
   the underwater light supply for macrophytes. The underwater light
   environment in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow, eutrophic lake) was then
   characterized based on this index (Z(eu)/WD) using field measurements
   collected from 2006 to 2013 (8 years x 4 seasons x 32 sites). The
   distribution of the macrophyte presence frequency (MPF, the number of
   investigations that identified macrophytes divided by the total number
   of investigations) was greater than 0.70 in Xukou Bay and East Lake
   Taihu over the 32 investigations, followed by the other sites
   distributed in East Lake Taihu. The proportion of macrophyte coverage
   increased with the increase in Z(eu)/WD. A significant relationship was
   observed between Zeu/WD and MPF for the 19 sites with macrophytes (r(2)
   = 0.48, p< 0.001, n = 19). In the region with high nutrient
   concentrations and serious water pollution, better underwater light
   conditions are required for the growth of macrophytes. A Z(eu)/WD value
   of 0.80 can be regarded as the critical underwater light threshold for
   the growth of macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The region with Z(eu)/WD
   ranging between 0.57 and 0.80 was usually covered by sparse macrophytes;
   this region should be vital for macrophyte recovery and environmental
   management in Lake Taihu. The distribution of Z(eu)/WD was further
   obtained using MODIS satellite-derived Zeu from June to October in 2003
   and 2013. Xukou Bay and Guangfu Bay in the southern part of Lake Taihu
   could be regarded as potentially crucial regions for the recovery of
   macrophytes from the perspective of underwater light and nutrient
   levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic created an extreme natural experiment in which
   sudden changes in human behavior and economic activity resulted in
   significant declines in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, immediately
   after strict lockdowns were imposed. Here we examined the impact of
   multiple waves and response phases of the pandemic on nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) dynamics and the role of meteorology in shaping relative
   contributions from different emission sectors to NO2 pollution in
   post-pandemic New York City. Long term (> 3.5 years), high frequency
   measurements from a network of ground-based Pandora spectrometers were
   combined with TROPOMI satellite retrievals, meteorological data,
   mobility trends, and atmospheric transport model simulations to quantify
   changes in NO2 across the New York metropolitan area. The stringent
   lockdown measures after the first pandemic wave resulted in a decline in
   top-down NOx emissions by approx. 30 \% on top of long-term trends, in
   agreement with sector-specific changes in NOx emissions. Ground-based
   measurements showed a sudden drop in total column NO2 in spring 2020, by
   up to 36 \% in Manhattan and 19 \%-29 \% in Queens, New Jersey (NJ), and
   Connecticut (CT), and a clear weakening (by 16 \%) of the typical weekly
   NO2 cycle. Extending our analysis to more than a year after the initial
   lockdown captured a gradual recovery in NO2 across the NY/NJ/CT
   tri-state area in summer and fall 2020, as social restrictions eased,
   followed by a second decline in NO2 coincident with the second wave of
   the pandemic and resurgence of lockdown measures in winter 2021.
   Meteorology was not found to have a strong NO2 biassing effect in New
   York City after the first pandemic wave. Winds, however, were favorable
   for low NO2 conditions in Manhattan during the second wave of the
   pandemic, resulting in larger column NO2 declines than expected based on
   changes in transportation emissions alone. Meteorology played a key role
   in shaping the relative contributions from different emission sectors to
   NO2 pollution in the city, with low-speed (< 5 m s(-1)) SW-SE winds
   enhancing contributions from the high-emitting power-generation sector
   in NJ and Queens and driving particularly high NO2 pollution episodes in
   Manhattan, even during - and despite - the stringent early lockdowns.
   These results have important implications for air quality management in
   New York City, and highlight the value of high resolution NO2
   measurements in assessing the effects of rapid meteorological changes on
   air quality conditions and the effectiveness of sector-specific NOx
   emission control strategies.},

Title = {An Integrated Experimental Design for the Assessment of Multiple

Abstract = {Background: For nearly five decades long-term studies in rodents have
   been the accepted benchmark for assessing chronic long-termtoxic
   effects, particularly carcinogenicity, of chemicals. The European Food
   Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have
   pointed out that the current set of internationally utilized test
   methods capture only some of the potential adverse effects associated
   with exposures to these agents over the lifetime.
   Objectives: In this paper, we propose the adaption of the
   carcinogenicity bioassay to integrate additional protocols for
   comprehensive long-term toxicity assessment that includes developmental
   exposures and long-term outcomes, capable of generating information on a
   broad spectrum of different end points.
   Discussion: An integrated study design based on a stepwise process is
   described that includes the priority end points of the Economic
   Co-operation and Development and the National Toxicology Program
   guidelines on carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity and developmental and
   reproductive toxicity. Integrating a comprehensive set of relevant
   toxicological end points in a single protocol represents an opportunity
   to optimize animal use in accordance with the 3Rs (replacement,
   reduction and refinement). This strategy has the potential to provide
   sufficient data on multiple windows of susceptibility of specific
   interest for risk assessments and public health decision-making by
   including prenatal, lactational, neonatal exposures and evaluating
   outcomes over the lifespan.
   Conclusion: This integrated study design is efficient in that the same
   generational cohort of rats used for evaluating long-term outcomes can
   be monitored in satellite parallel experiments to measure biomarkers and
   other parameters related to system-specific responses including
   metabolic alterations and endocrine disturbances.

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline changes and future forecasting:
   the case of Kucuk Menderes Delta, Turkiye},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {A delta coastal area is one of the most important regions for human use
   owing to its scenic natural beauty and economic value. However, due to
   the constant interaction between the land and water environments in this
   region, it is also one of the most rapidly changing landforms in the
   world under the impact of natural processes as well as anthropogenic
   activities. Therefore, the determination and the constant monitoring of
   these changes spatiotemporally are of great significance in terms of the
   protection, planning, proper usage, effective management, and
   sustainability of the delta coast. In this study was aimed to determine
   the short-term and long-term shoreline changes that occurred between the
   years 1957 and 2020 along the coast of the Kucuk Menderes Delta and its
   close surroundings. In addition, the underlying causes were explored,
   and the future of the shoreline position was forecasted. The shorelines
   were digitized using seven multi-temporal orthophoto maps based on the
   high water line indicator. The shoreline changes were analyzed using
   different statistical methods, namely, the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM),
   Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear
   Regression Rate (LRR), by employing the Digital Shoreline Analysis
   System (DSAS). The future position of the shoreline was estimated using
   the extended Kalman Filter in the DSAS. The analyses revealed that in a
   period of 63 years, the maximum accretion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR
   and LRR) were 248.99 m, 3.96 m/year, and 3.65 m/year, respectively, the
   maximum erosion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR and LRR) were - 142.37 m,
   - 2.27 m/year, and - 2.19 m/year, respectively, and the delta coastal
   area had increased by 37.01 ha. It is forecasted that the delta coastal
   area will expand by 10.63 ha and 16.16 ha from 2020 to 2030 and 2040. If
   the current conditions that occurred in the last 63 years continue with
   similar effects, it was forecasted that by the years 2030 and 2040,
   significant changes would occur in the shoreline such as retreat into
   the existing facilities/usage areas and decrease of Eleman Wetland area,
   which would greatly alter the ecology, hydrography, and spatial usage of
   the delta region.},

Title = {How do CMIP6 models project changes in precipitation extremes over
   seasons and locations across the mid hills of Nepal?},

Abstract = {Assessing variability of historical and projected future precipitation
   extremes is of high value in managing water resources effectively. The
   Himalayan environment of Nepal is comprised of both hills and mountains.
   The hills are the most susceptible to precipitation extremes and related
   natural hazards, which hinder the socio-economic development of the
   country. This study investigated the variability of extreme
   precipitation events over the 22 weather stations distributed across the
   mid hills of Nepal to identify its driving potential of extreme events.
   Firstly, trends and spatial distribution of different precipitation
   indices were computed on annual and seasonal scales for the baseline
   (historical) period of 1986-2015. We found that the annual maximum
   precipitation amount (1-day, consecutive 3-day, and 5-day) and heavy
   precipitation days with daily precipitation exceeding 10, 20, and 50 mm
   (i.e., R10, R20, and R50 respectively) show dominantly falling trends
   during the historical period. Noticeably, while analyzing at a seasonal
   scale, we found that the precipitation amount exhibited a statistically
   significant decreasing pattern during the monsoon season. This study
   then assessed possible changes of those indices under future climatic
   conditions using the latest set of scenarios from ten CMIP6 (Coupled
   Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6) models dataset for the near
   future period (2021-2050) under two shared socio-economic pathways
   (SSP245 and SSP585). The projection showed a wider range of deviation
   with respect to the baseline, predominantly increasing heavy
   precipitation. Overall, the increasing pattern of the intensity,
   duration, and frequency of extreme events indicates the region would
   possess more risks of natural hazards such as floods, landslides, and
   soil erosion in the future. Furthermore, most of the climate models
   showed that consecutive dry days (CDDs) are projected to increase, which
   could significantly impact agriculture facilities, food security, and
   water scarcity and ultimately could increase the vulnerability of hill
   communities. Our findings are expected to help understand the
   extremities of precipitation variability and have strong policy
   implications indicating that adaptation measures that can reduce risks
   make society less vulnerable and more resilient to extremes.},

Title = {Precision variable rate nitrogen for dryland farming on waterlogging
   Riverine Plains of Southeast Australia?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in
   popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land
   preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen,
   invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many
   major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability
   as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may
   include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical
   harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable
   Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information
   and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces
   crop yields.
   Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the
   district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings
   over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha).
   Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across
   GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR
   levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one
   year may be poorest in the next.
   We answer the question: ``Why would a farmer in this district choose to
   apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in
   possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment,
   georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map
   data for that paddock in many past seasons?{''} We show that soil
   conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN
   versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging.
   If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season,
   applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of
   attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled
   soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable.
   We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated
   decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable,
   fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced
   in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with
   high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices.
   Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of
   each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1\% increase in
   yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7\% decrease in applied N.
   We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable
   than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may
   lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.},

Title = {Changes in crop type distribution in Zhangye City of the Heihe River
   Basin, China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {With rapid economic development in China, crops have undergone
   remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and
   accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and
   agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural
   production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in
   planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such
   knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural
   competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee
   national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in
   the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated
   upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on
   multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial
   distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and
   analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition,
   some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern
   of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four
   conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural
   network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in
   Zhangye was high, at 89.38\%. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land
   area in Zhangye increased from 463.81 x 10(3) ha to 493.89 x 10(3) ha.
   The sowing area of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39.21 x 10(3) ha
   and 5.99 x 10(3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the sowing
   area decreased by 3.61 x 10(3) ha and 9.14 x 10(3) ha, respectively.
   Considering other crop types as a group, their sowing area decreased by
   only 2.37 x 10(3) ha. The increase in corn sowing area mainly came from
   the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43.09\% of
   its total sowing area in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed
   a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the
   tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high
   conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while
   wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle
   and Shandan counties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To account for complex and diverse water system involving river dry-up,
   groundwater degradation, agricultural/urban water use, and dam/canal
   effects in heavily irrigated Yellow River Basin, this study coupled NIES
   Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model series with more
   complex sub-models involving various factors (NICE-DRY). The model
   reproduced reasonably evapotranspiration, irrigation water use,
   groundwater level, and river discharge during spring/winter wheat,
   summer maize, and summer rice cultivations. Scenario analysis predicted
   the impact of irrigation on both surface water and groundwater, which
   had previously been difficult to evaluate. The simulated discharge with
   irrigation was improved in terms of mean value, standard deviation, and
   coefficient of variation. Another scenario analysis of conversion from
   dryland to irrigated fields predicted that the effect of groundwater
   irrigation was predominant in the middle and downstream and the
   resultant groundwater degradation predominantly, where surface water was
   seriously limited. Simulated dry biomasses of wheat and maize were
   linearly related to Time-Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (TINDVI) estimated from satellite images. Temporal gradient of
   TINDVI during 1982-1999 showed spatially heterogeneous distribution and
   increasing trends in the wheat and maize fields, indicating that the
   production increases were related to irrigation water and the resultant
   hydrologic changes. This integrated approach could help to estimate a
   close relationship between crop production, hydrologic cycle, and water
   availability, and predict heterogeneous vulnerability of water
   resources. Because this region experienced substantial river dry-up and
   groundwater degradation at the end of the 20th century, this approach
   would help to overcome substantial pressures of increasing food demand
   and declining water availability, and to decide on appropriate measures
   for whole water resources management to achieve sustainable development
   under sound socio-economic conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Reviews and syntheses: An empirical spatiotemporal description of the
   global surface-atmosphere carbon fluxes: opportunities and data

Abstract = {Understanding the global carbon (C) cycle is of crucial importance to
   map current and future climate dynamics relative to global environmental
   change. A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed
   information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes.
   However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their
   coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of
   integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland
   freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a
   data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based
   spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to
   identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data
   limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans,
   continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes
   related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical
   aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and
   cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through
   geostatistical and/ or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby
   minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in
   process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE)
   between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere.
   Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study
   is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that
   need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories.
   Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling.
   In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates
   from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric
   inversions. This holds for Europe (mean +/- 1 SD: 0.8 +/- 0.1 PgC
   yr(-1), positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 +/-
   0.4 PgC yr(-1)), East Asia (1.6 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), South Asia (0.3 +/-
   0.1 PgC yr(-1)), Australia (0.2 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), and most of the
   Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in
   tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and
   because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global
   bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of 5.4 +/- 2.0 PgC yr(-1). By
   contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2
   over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source
   of 4.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr(-1)
   highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in
   tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment
   provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon
   observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land
   regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second,
   extensive pCO(2) data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack
   observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and
   inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data
   uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria
   optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS)
   and atmospheric inversions, without over-or under-stating bottom-up data
   credibility.
   In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at
   national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2
   fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which
   future emission reductions are proposed.},

Abstract = {The black soil area in Northeast China serves as a ``ballast{''} to
   ensure China's food security. Unreasonable development and utilization
   lead to serious black soil degradation in some areas and affect regional
   food production and economic and social development. In the context of
   the intensification of the contradiction between food supply and demand
   worldwide, we should pay more attention to the overall situation of
   regional sustainable development and seek for systematic, scientific,
   and economic solutions. This study establishes a regional all-for-one
   customization model of black soil granary on the basis of the regional
   system of human-land relationship, customized and accurate management,
   agricultural system theory, and agricultural informatization with the
   guidance of integrated geography concept. The aim of this regional
   all-for-one customization model is to systematically diagnose the key
   problems and leading factors of black soil degradation and determine a
   solution that combines the commonness and individuality of black soil
   protection from the perspective of multiscale linkage, multifactor
   coupling, and multitechnology cooperation. The regional all-for-one
   customization model of black soil granary integrates the two
   perspectives of ``regional{''} and ``customization{''} into the
   protection and comprehensive utilization of black soil for the first
   time. It adopts zoning, grading, and classification as the main strategy
   and big data and artificial intelligence as the main technical
   approaches. This model constructs three strategies of different scales
   by combining the ``satellite-air-ground-network{''} 3D monitoring system
   and the all-for-one customization platform driven by big data and
   artificial intelligence. First, the ``implementing strategies by
   regions{''} are implemented at the regional scale to formulate the
   regional agricultural resource allocation scheme and agricultural
   zoning, which can provide strategies to protect and utilize black soil
   effectively. Second, the ``determining strategies in accordance with
   villages{''} are implemented at the village scale to formulate a black
   soil protection and utilization model for different categories of
   villages, which can promote the organic integration of black soil
   protection and rural revitalization. Third, a ``one strategy for one
   field{''} concept is applied at the field scale to provide accurate
   strategies for soil restoration and yield improvement in a fixed,
   quantitative, and regular manner. Multiscale integrated demonstration
   and scheme verification of the regional all-for-one customization model
   of black soil granary are conducted in Qiqihar City at three scales,
   namely, region, village, and field, to solve the key issues in black
   soil protection and utilization and form a replicable and popularized
   system solution, thereby providing a model for the sustainable
   development of Chinese and global black soil agriculture. The proposed
   regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary has
   important theoretical and practical value in promoting the high-quality
   development of regional agriculture and rural revitalization, and
   provides a demonstration model of land protection and utilization for
   the black soil area in China and the whole world.},

Title = {Machine Learning for Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence in Changsha: An
   Innovative Investigation into the Introduction of a Forest Fuel Factor},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Affected by global warming and increased extreme weather, Hunan Province
   saw a phased and concentrated outbreak of forest fires in 2022, causing
   significant damage and impact. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires
   can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early
   warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in
   China's forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the
   overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire
   occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation,
   topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the
   occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel
   moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of
   forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology,
   topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along
   with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and
   evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a
   database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was
   constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built
   using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the
   Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive
   Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified
   using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with
   an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in
   predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the
   GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model,
   which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest
   fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse
   Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire
   probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal
   distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied
   significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and
   December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The
   highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern
   regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of
   forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy
   evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was
   identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability
   prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that
   vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence
   on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors,
   and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in
   Changsha City.},

Title = {Impact of information technology on the earth sciences},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Abstract = {The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with
   the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal
   plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight
   quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and
   geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to
   construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front
   the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the
   controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly
   the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the
   building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data
   gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example,
   digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the
   earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the
   earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly
   available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to
   propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into
   a new era. The component information technologies are now available to
   allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world.
   Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques
   have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's
   crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved
   pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas
   reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at
   best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this,
   geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow
   through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic
   reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir
   and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made
   about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is
   analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques
   means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences
   yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in
   understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers
   which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake
   belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems
   within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their
   colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is
   such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone.
   Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies
   will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The
   key components of the information technologies that will enable this
   revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and
   computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components
   needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from
   observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making.
   Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic
   sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within
   the earth.
   Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can
   be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful
   information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this
   particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir
   through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil.
   The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through
   the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed.
   From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior
   of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists
   and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to
   various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and
   manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being
   developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data
   overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data.
   Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by
   data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is
   probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age.
   Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which
   by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to
   picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously,
   the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple
   two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing
   rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated,
   and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff
   the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many
   complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of
   complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments
   conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to
   project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special
   glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a
   three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are
   already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly
   with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and
   workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies
   and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the
   application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the
   generalist. This is a very important development because it allows
   models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights
   and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the
   specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily
   available technology. Application of this entire suite of information
   technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced
   processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete
   cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and
   improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory
   to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a
   major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the
   value of their application and integration with other technical
   disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely
   not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic
   prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from
   companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of
   the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk
   factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing
   national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this
   study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in
   context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for
   previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate
   attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends
   in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural,
   environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks
   from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met
   World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable
   evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from
   randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household
   surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used
   statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate
   covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure
   across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual
   scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of
   deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed
   trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth,
   population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific
   DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a
   Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation,
   household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and
   smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several
   occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased
   by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in
   2015 accounted for 57.8\% (95\% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and
   41.2\% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to
   global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure
   (211.8 million {[}192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking
   (148.6 million {[}134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma
   glucose (143.1 million {[}125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI
   (120.1 million {[}83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood
   undernutrition (113.3 million {[}103.9 million to 123.4 million]),
   ambient particulate matter (103.1 million {[}90.8 million to 115.1
   million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million {[}74.6 million to 105.7
   million]), household air pollution (85.6 million {[}66.7 million to
   106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million {[}77.2 million to 93.0
   million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million {[}49.3 million to
   127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for
   micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation
   and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY
   rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising
   exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from
   high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and
   drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined
   steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting
   plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks,
   such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most
   attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the
   leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries;
   childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early
   death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed
   to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be
   invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting
   plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to
   rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for
   intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain
   major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining.
   Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are
   increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The

Title = {Monitoring three-decade dynamics of citrus planting in Southeastern
   China using dense Landsat records},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Across Southeastern China, the expansion of citrus plantation has
   underpinned substantial economic development at the expense of forest
   cover and associated ecosystem services. The high-order complexity of
   citrus planting dynamics requires more detailed observations. To achieve
   this goal, we developed a novel monitoring scheme by integrating
   multi-epoch land cover classification and continuous change detection on
   the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using all available Landsat
   archives (1986-2018). First, a stable/changed area masking approach was
   adopted. Then, the GEE-based Continuous Change Detection and
   Classification (GEE-CCDC) algorithm was applied to detect the timing and
   position of citrus planting-related land cover changes. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the scheme was validated both spatially and temporally.
   We applied the proposed scheme in Xunwu, a typical County in
   Southeastern China where continuous expansion was disrupted by an
   outbreak of Huanglongbing (HLB, a destructive citrus disease). The
   validation results indicate that the multiepoch classification
   effectively identified the stable, abandoned, and newly cultivated areas
   related to citrus planting. Within these areas, our monitoring of citrus
   planting dynamics had an overall temporal accuracy of 90.59\% and a mean
   detection date deviation of 13.21 days (leading). Based on the change
   detection results, we found a two-stage change pattern, namely a
   continuous expansion period (1986-2016) followed by a disturbance period
   (2017-2018). Moreover, almost half of the orchards were cultivated in
   regions with an elevation and slope of 301-400 m and 11-20 degrees.
   During the continuous expansion period, a total of 497.85 km(2) natural
   lands were converted for citrus planting. Affected by the HLB outbreak,
   both orchard abandonment (114.66 km(2)) and new orchard cultivation
   (36.87 km(2)) were detected during the disturbance period. The proposed
   scheme offers a useful tool for cash crops management, and highlights
   the value of dense satellite data in monitoring the extent of ongoing
   human appropriation of natural ecosystems at a large scale and
   long-term.},

Title = {The economic impact of tourism in Central Finland: a regional
   input-output study},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-547},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic
   impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper
   aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional
   output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional
   input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on
   regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional
   taxes in Central Finland.
   Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that
   tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland
   (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in
   different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on
   employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central
   Finland are quite significant.
   Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem
   from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate
   to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings,
   consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may
   overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism
   jobs are often low paying.
   Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to
   frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in
   planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use
   the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or
   improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries.
   Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at
   the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism
   impact studies using the input-output technique have also been
   conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the
   regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and
   employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have
   focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers
   (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional
   input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism
   expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the
   whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author
   also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The
   results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers
   involved in regional planning and development.},

Title = {Delta dynamics: Effects of a major earthquake, tides, and river flows on
   Cienega de Santa Clara and the Colorado River Delta, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {144-156},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intertidal portion of Mexico's Colorado River Delta is a dynamic
   environment subject to complex interactions of tectonic, fluvial, and
   tidal forces at the head of the Gulf of California. We review the
   historical interactions of these forces, use sequential satellite
   images, overflights, ground observations, and interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (InSAR) data to study the effects of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El
   Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake on changing patterns of tidal inundation within
   the Delta, and assess effects of these changes to the
   fluvial/hydrological regime of the Colorado River estuary and nearby
   Cienega de Santa Clara wetland. The objectives of this study are to
   highlight for environmental scientists, land managers, and ecological
   engineers the contribution of tectonic forces in shaping the intertidal
   Delta environment and to provide information on the effects of the 2010
   earthquake which will be of practical value in planning and designing
   management measures and restoration projects for the estuary and
   Cienega.
   The Colorado River estuary is at present blocked by a tidal sand bar
   which restricts access by marine species to the upper estuary and
   obstructs the flow of fresh water into the lower estuary. Located 13 km
   east of the estuary, the Cienega is a 6000 ha wetland supported by
   agricultural drain water from Arizona and Mexico. South of the Cienega
   is the Santa Clara Slough, an unvegetated 26,000 ha basin subject to
   periodic inundation from the northern Gulf's high amplitude tides, which
   have historically reached the margins of the Cienega several times each
   year.
   The El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake ruptured the previously unknown Indiviso
   Fault which extends into the intertidal zone just west of the Cienega.
   The Cienega experienced only minor surface deformation having no direct
   effects to the wetland. Most of the significant ground movement and
   surface deformation occurred west of the Indiviso Fault adjacent to the
   estuary, where portions of the intertidal flats underwent extensive
   liquefaction, northward coseismic displacement and post-seismic
   subsidence. These surface deformations changed the pattern of tidal
   inundation, triggering development of a new system of natural tidal
   channels and creating conditions favorable for installation of projects
   to restore connectivity between the upper and lower estuary. The changed
   pattern of tidal inundation may also have contributed to an observed
   reduction in the occurrence of tidal flooding along the southwestern
   margin of the Cienega following the earthquake. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Evaluating rainfall datasets to reconstruct floods in data-sparse
   Himalayan region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Floods are widespread natural disasters having significant
   socio-economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management
   strategies. Flood modelling is an enduring challenge, especially over
   the data-sparse mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, due to the
   lack of accurate rainfall measurements. Global datasets are often
   employed for flood modelling; however, their applicability over the
   Himalayan terrain is still uncertain. In this regard, the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model is
   increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates. This work aims
   at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets,
   satellite product, and the WRF model to represent heavy rainfall over
   the Himalayan terrain. Further, these datasets are used to drive the
   Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to assess their
   ability to reconstruct floods in the Himalayan region. A Rainfall-Flood
   Skill Score (RFSS) is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall
   datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the
   region. The range of RFSS can vary from - infinity to 1, with positive
   values as the desired value. The analysis is conducted over the upstream
   part of the Upper Ganga Basin, spanning from high elevation mountains to
   the foothills of the Himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that
   caused flooding in the region. Quantitative evaluation of rainfall
   datasets in terms of bias, RMSE, and scale errors shows high spatial
   variability with different datasets performing differently over various
   regions of the study area. The topography is observed to influence the
   performance of rainfall datasets. Based on the error metrics, it is
   found that the rainfall simulated using the WRF model exhibits least
   error in high elevation and valley regions of the Himalayas, whereas,
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation
   Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR, in some
   cases) datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the
   Himalayas. On forcing the VIC model with these datasets, the WRF model
   with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest
   RFSS score of 0.97 among all the datasets and, therefore, considered
   most suitable for simulating floods in the study region.},

Title = {Mapping croplands of Europe, Middle East, Russia, and Central Asia using
   Landsat, Random Forest, and Google Earth Engine},

Abstract = {Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for
   environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit
   cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type,
   crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area -
   defined as continental to global - cropland mapping is challenging due
   to differential manifestation of croplands, wide range of cultivation
   practices and limited reference data availability. This study presents
   the results of a cropland extent mapping of 64 countries covering large
   parts of Europe, Middle East, Russia and Central Asia. To cover such a
   vast area, roughly 160,000 Landsat scenes from 3351 footprints between
   2014 and 2016 were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
   platform. We used a pixel-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning
   algorithm with a set of satellite data inputs capturing diverse
   spectral, temporal and topographical characteristics across twelve
   agroecological zones (AEZs). The reference data to train the
   classification model were collected from very high spatial resolution
   imagery (VHRI) and ancillary datasets. The result is a binary map
   showing cultivated/non-cultivated areas ca. 2015. The map produced an
   overall accuracy of 93.8\% with roughly 14\% omission and commission
   errors for the cropland class based on a large set of independent
   validation samples. The map suggests the entire study area has a total
   546 million hectares (Mha) of net croplands (nearly 30\% of global net
   cropland areas) occupying 18\% of the study land area. Comparison
   between national cropland area estimates from United Nations Food and
   Agricultural Organizations (FAO) and those derived from this work also
   showed an R-square value of 0.95. This Landsat-derived 30-m cropland
   product (GFSAD30) provided 10-30\% greater cropland areas compared to UN
   FAO in the 64 Countries. Finally, the map-to-map comparison between
   GFSAD30 with several other cropland products revealed that the best
   similarity matrix was with the 30 m global land cover (GLC30) product
   providing an overall similarity of 88.8\% (Kappa 0.7) with producer's
   cropland similarity of 89.2\% (errors of omissions = 10.8\%) and user's
   cropland similarity of 81.8\% (errors of commissions = 8.1\%). GFSAD30
   captured the missing croplands in GLC30 product around significantly
   irrigated agricultural areas in Germany and Belgium and rainfed
   agriculture in Italy. This study also established that the real
   strengths of GFSAD30 product, compared to other products, were: 1.
   identifying precise location of croplands, and 2. capturing fragmented
   croplands. The cropland extent map dataset is available through NASA's
   Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at
   tps://doi.org,10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30EUMARUMECE.001, while the

Abstract = {The developments taking place in Information Technology (IT),
   particularly, the convergence between computers and communication has
   made the world a global village.  Indeed competitive advantage would be
   primarily determined by a nation's or firm's IT infrastructure.  This is
   all the more compelling in the context of our economic reforms programme
   where India is all set to get plugged into the global economy.  The
   shift from analogue to digital technology has brought a major transition
   which has completely altered the communications landscape.  `'anytime
   anywhere'' communications based on mobile cellular, satellite and
   Personal Communication System (PCS) technologies are fast becoming a
   global reality.  This coupled with the development of `'Information
   Superhighways'' based on optical fibre is making the integration of
   voice, data and video available through the Integrated Services Digital
   Network.  While wireless and optical fibre based local loops loom on the
   horizon, `the last mile problem' has resulted in the amalgamation of
   major switching and cable networks in the USA, in order to bring
   multimedia to tomorrow's home.  It is anticipated that several of these
   possibilities would become commonplace by the year 2000 and in this
   context it is extremely important that developing countries like our
   own, chalk out strategies in order to leapfrog technologies in the most
   cost effective manner with a view to successfully managing the
   tremendous changes underway.
   The output of global electronics reached \$700 billion in 1990 and is
   expected to reach about \$1.3 trillion by the year 2000.  The value
   added by the electronics industry is growing at about 6 per cent per
   year, compared with about 3.8 per cent for all manufacturing industries
   and 3.1 per cent for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (all in real terms). 
   At this pace by the year 2000 electronics will account for about 4 per
   cent of world GDP and 14 per cent of value added in manufacturing.  In
   comparison, the Indian electronics industry reached an output level of a
   little over \$ 4 billion in 1992 representing 0.7 per cent of the global
   electronics industry.  If India were to achieve a production level of \$
   20 billion by the year 2000, this would increase to 1.5 per cent.
   In the context of the next decade China whose current electronics output
   is almost 3 times that of India provides a very useful point of
   reference.  What is alarming is the rate at which electronics
   applications are growing in China, in TV, telecom and Information
   Technology (IT).  Thus, China's production of TV sets, both colour and
   Black \& White, is 5 times that of India; it proposes to install over 3
   times the number of telephones by the year 2000; and its IT industry
   currently is also 3 times of India's.  These in turn provide rapidly
   improving economies of scale, when compared to those of the Indian
   electronics industry, thus promoting greater vertical integration,
   increasing cost competitiveness, makes exports more viable and attracts
   greater foreign direct investment and technology to feed its burgeoning
   market.  Consequently, there is an imperative need to provide a
   strategic vision at this juncture to address the Chinese challenge and
   to ensure the future health of the Indian electronics industry
   commensurate with our size and capabilities.
   The background paper provides the current status of the electronics
   industry both nationally as well as internationally and the development
   strategies pursued by different countries.  From these, the major issues
   in devising an appropriate strategy for future development of the Indian
   Electronics Industry are derived.  This is to lay the ground work for
   further deliberation.  The paper is divided into following parts:

Title = {A multiple natural hazard analysis, SECMOL College region, near Leh,
   Ladakh, North India, with applications for community-based DRR},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {287-312},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment
   (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied,
   rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study
   (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College),
   close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to
   the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard
   assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of
   hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue
   its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019)
   documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the
   principles of geohazard assessment and the development of
   student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home
   village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised
   along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards.
   Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data
   (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation
   of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes,
   assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and
   identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with
   satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood
   vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003),
   examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic
   terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation
   allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and
   the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events,
   together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan
   earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and
   river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and
   disaster scenario analyses.
   Findings
   This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is
   exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High
   magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in
   the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to
   maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods
   demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely
   damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study
   reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the
   potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to
   be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts
   of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be
   lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces
   recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural
   planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk
   zones.
   Practical implications - The frequency of hazards is low, but potential
   impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering
   options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and
   evacuation management for large floods.
   Originality/value
   Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages
   between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application
   of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to
   rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of
   catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work
   complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community
   aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value.},

Title = {Linking data of ENSO, NDVI-MODIS and crops yield as a base of an early
   warning system for agriculture in Cordoba, Argentina},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {By influencing interannual rainfall variability in the Province of
   Cordoba, Argentina, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also impact on
   corn and soybean yields at the main rain-fed agricultural production
   departments. Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental
   impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a
   region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and
   decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean
   yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using
   different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production
   departments of Cordoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Rio
   Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Cordoba as a vegetation proxy to
   depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal
   persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators
   from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing
   season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops
   productivity.
   Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence
   during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is
   compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While
   for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p <
   0.05) in all Cordoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS.
   Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships
   when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when
   using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was
   located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop
   season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as
   an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case,
   the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small.
   The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more
   extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May,
   at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the
   growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with
   the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11\% and 10\% of Rio
   Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19\% when
   SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an
   unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of
   crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression
   models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI
   and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors.
   Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making
   use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during
   the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO
   influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its
   incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis
   of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health
   care professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control
   hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women).
   Options: For people at risk for hypertension, there are a number of
   lifestyle options that may avert the condition-maintaining a healthy
   body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, exercising, reducing
   sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium, and
   reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce the
   risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the
   options for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification,
   antihypertensive medications or a combination of these options; with no
   treatment, these people remain at risk for the complications of
   hypertension.
   Outcomes: The health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure
   and in morbidity and mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence,
   no economic outcomes were considered.
   Evidence: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1966 to
   September 1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists
   were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors
   were used to identify other studies. All relevant articles were
   reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to
   level of evidence.
   Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular
   morbidity and premature death caused by untreated hypertension.
   Benefits, harms and costs: Lifestyle modification by means of weight
   loss (or maintenance of healthy body weight), regular exercise and low
   alcohol consumption will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected normotensive and hypertensive people. Sodium restriction and
   stress management will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected hypertensive patients. The side effects of these therapies are
   few, and the indirect benefits are well known. There are certainly costs
   associated with lifestyle modification, but they were not measured in
   the studies reviewed. Supplementing the diet with potassium, calcium and
   magnesium has not been associated with a clinically important reduction
   in blood pressure in people consuming a healthy diet.
   Recommendations: (1) It is recommended that health care professionals
   determine the body mass index (weight in kilograms/{[}height in
   metres](2)) and alcohol consumption of all adult patients and assess
   sodium consumption and stress levels in all hypertensive patients. (2)To
   reduce blood pressure in the population at large, it is recommended that
   Canadians attain and maintain a healthy body mass index. For those who
   choose to drink, alcohol intake should be limited to 2 or fewer standard
   drinks per day (maximum of 14/week for men and 9/week for women). Adults
   should exercise regularly (3) To reduce blood pressure in hypertensive
   patients, individualized therapy is recommended. This therapy should
   emphasize weight loss for overweight patients, abstinence from or
   moderation in alcohol intake, regular exercise, restriction of sodium
   intake and, in appropriate circumstances, individualized cognitive
   behaviour modification to reduce the negative effects of stress.
   Validation: The recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring
   organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth
   International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They are similar to
   those of the World Hypertension League and the Joint National Committee,
   with the exception of the recommendations on stress management, which
   are based on new information. They have not been clinically tested.

Title = {Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Denoising Algorithm Based on Deep
   Learning},
Journal = {ACTA OPTICA SINICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) is a kind of sensor to capture
   microwaves. Its principle is to establish images through the reflection
   of waveforms, so as to solve the problem that traditional optical remote
   sensing radars are affected by weather, air impurities, and other
   environmental factors when collecting images. The most widely used SAR
   is change detection (CD). CD refers to the dynamic acquisition of image
   information from a certain target, which includes three steps: image
   preprocessing, generation of difference maps, and analysis and
   calculation of difference maps. It is applied to the estimation of
   natural disasters, management and allocation of resources, and
   measurement of land topographic characteristics. However, in the process
   of CD, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images will reduce the
   performance of CD. Therefore, the image denoising method has become a
   basic method of preprocessing in CD. How to restore a clean image from a
   noisy SAR image is an urgent problem to be solved.
   Methods Traditional denoising algorithms of SAR images generally use the
   global denoising idea whose principle is to use the global similar
   information in images to perform processing and judgment. In the case of
   the high resolution of images, these algorithms need a series of
   preprocessing such as smoothing and then complete pixel distinction
   through the neighborhood processing of each image block. The algorithms
   usually occupy huge computing resources and have certain spatial and
   temporal limitations in practical applications. In addition, they cannot
   efficiently complete the denoising task. In terms of deep learning, some
   algorithms perform well, but there is still room for improvement in
   network convergence speed, model redundancy, and accuracy. To solve
   these problems, this paper proposes a denoising algorithm based on a
   multi-scale attention cascade convolutional neural network (MALNet). The
   network mainly uses the idea of multi- scale irregular convolution
   kernel and attention. Compared with a single convolution kernel, a
   multi-scale irregular convolution kernel has an excellent image
   receptive field. In other words, it can collect image information from
   different scales to extract more detailed image features. Subsequently,
   the convolution kernels of different scales are concat layers in the
   network, and an attention mechanism is introduced into a concat feature
   map to divide the attention of the features so that the whole model has
   a positive enhancement ability for the main features of the image. In
   the middle of the network, the dense cascade layer is used to further
   strengthen the features. Finally, the image restoration and
   reconstruction are realized by network subtraction.
   Results and Discussions In this paper, qualitative and quantitative
   experiments are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed MALNet model in denoising. The WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-
   CNN algorithms are compared with our proposed method. The clear state
   and complete signs of the denoised images are visually observed. In
   order to make a fair comparison, we use the default settings of the
   three algorithms provided by the authors in the literatures. Peak
   signal-to- noise ratio ( PSNR), structural similarity index measure
   (SSIM), and image entropy are used as objective evaluation indexes. The
   PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy are calculated as error metrics. Three
   denoising algorithms are compared, and airpoirt, mountain, and coast are
   selected as verification images. The denoising effects of airport images
   (Fig. 7), coast images (Fig. 8), and mountain images (Fig. 9) are
   analyzed. It shows the visual effect comparison of denoising results of
   different algorithms. In Figs. 7-9, 6 figures are successively noise-
   free image, noise image, denoised image obtained by WNNM, denoised image
   obtained by SAR-BM3D, denoised image obtained by SAR-CNN and denoised
   image obtained by MALNet. It is obvious that the WNNM denoised image has
   many defects that are not removed completely, and the texture loss is
   quite serious. SAR-BM3D denoised image retains some details, but the
   aircraft fuselage is very vague, and the tail part has gotten most of
   the edge information erased. Although the aircraft wing in the SAR- CNN
   denoised image is recovered, the whole aircraft at the bottom is still
   far from the reference image, and the recovered small objects are
   blurred. It can be seen from Table 3 that the average PSNR value of the
   proposed MALNet is about 9. 25 dB higher than that of SAR-BM3D, about 0.
   75 dB higher than that of SAR-CNN, and about 14. 45 dB higher than that
   of WNNM. Moreover, in terms of the noise level, MALNet is 0. 01 dB less
   than that SAR-CNN. The PSNR value of the proposed MALNet model at each
   noise level is higher than that of other algorithms. Especially, when
   the noise parameter is 20, the proposed method is 2. 56 dB higher than
   that of the SAR- CNN algorithm. In terms of structural similarity (Table
   4), it can be seen that the SSIM of MALNet is mostly the highest among
   all methods. Only when the noise parameter is 50, it is slightly lower
   than that of SAR- CNN, but the average SSIM is still the highest. The
   average information entropy of the denoised images by the four
   algorithms is 7. 113492 bit/pixel for WNNM, 6. 842258 bit/pixel for SAR-
   BM3D, 7. 499375 bit/ pixel for SAR-CNN, and 6. 6917 bit/pixel for
   MALNet. The proposed algorithm outperforms WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-CNN
   by 0. 42179 bit/ pixel, 0. 15056 bit/pixel, and 0. 80768 bit/pixel,
   respectively. Therefore, in terms of the three objective evaluation
   indexes of PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy, the proposed network in this
   paper has better denoising performance than other comparison methods.
   Conclusions In this paper, a new denoising model MALNet is proposed for
   solving the noise in SAR images. This model uses an end-to-end
   architecture and does not require separate subnets or manual
   intervention. The solution includes three modules, i. e., multi-scale
   irregular convolution module, feature extraction module based on
   attention mechanism, and feature enhancement module based on dense
   cascade network. The model also adds batch normalization and global
   average pooling to improve its adaptability. It can complete convergence
   without massive data sets. The image data can complete convergence after
   150 rounds of training. The training efficiency is outstanding, and the
   portability is positive. The experimental results show that compared
   with those of other traditional image denoising algorithms, the PSNR and
   SSIM of the proposed algorithm are improved by 0. 75 dB-14. 45 dB and 0.
   01-0. 16, respectively. The proposed algorithm is superior to other
   algorithms in image entropy and can better recover the details of
   images.},

Title = {The CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission},
Journal = {PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {110-130},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest
   priority goals of the international planetary science community. A
   possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3
   missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission
   represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars
   analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for
   CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely
   using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the
   efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned
   strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility
   of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team,
   and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample
   selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis.
   CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over
   three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near
   Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team
   located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London,
   Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on
   the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous
   analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being
   divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015
   operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic
   datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a
   predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of
   hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing
   site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented
   multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and
   clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as
   inverted paleochannels.
   Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and
   the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the
   Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and
   hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020
   rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without
   the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast
   Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the
   equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual
   day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the
   Science Team prioritized 3 for ``return to Earth{''}. Various science
   autonomy capabilities, based on flight proven or near-future techniques
   intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016
   CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and
   targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively
   during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and
   conditional sequencing were also employed.
   Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various
   methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission
   control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made.
   Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using
   traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the
   selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region,
   collected out-of simulation, have been analysed using a range of
   laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both
   future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are
   provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and
   planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use
   of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather
   than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to
   provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful
   interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies
   along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a
   large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous
   geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering
   large suites of geological and geochemical survey data.
   Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue
   missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and
   the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current
   robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and
   outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a
   strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook),
   articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction
   with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of
   CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and
   post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration
   missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016
   activities had 90\% of participants ``somewhat agreeing{''} or
   ``strongly agreeing{''} that participation in the mission has helped
   them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.},
