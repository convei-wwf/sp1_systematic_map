Title = {Reproductive tactics of sexes and fitness in the dragonfly, Diastatops
   obscura},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The sexual selection strategies of territorial Odonata that do not
   present courtship behavior is still not completely understood,
   especially the role of the females. Diastatops obscura Fabricius (
   Odonata: Libellulidae) females participate in mate selection in a
   passive manner, allowing copulation with the first male that captures
   them and afterwards choosing whether to oviposit or not. This study
   introduces the idea of female passive choice as an adaptative tactic in
   intersexual selection. Also discussed is the adaptative value of this
   tactic and its flexibility according to environmental conditions and
   reproductive strategies adopted by the males. A natural population of
   Diastatops obscura was observed in the Pitimbu River of northeast
   Brazil. Focal continuous and ad libitum techniques were used to record
   attempted copulation, copulation, and oviposition behavior, in addition
   to registering male territoriality. An estimate of individual
   reproductive success ( IRS) was obtained by recording 187 reproductive
   events. Territorial males, mainly occupying areas near the river margin,
   achieved greater copulation and oviposition success ( IRS = 0.371) than
   did satellite males ( IRS = 0.028). Females that copulated with
   territorial males experienced, for the most part, only one copulation
   and oviposition event, while those that copulated with satellite males
   fled or performed a second copulation with a territorial male. Thus, the
   best tactic adopted by the D. obscura males was to occupy a territory
   providing the greatest access to females, while the females used passive
   choice for fitness optimization.},

Abstract = {A prefeasibility study of a solar power plant project was carried out in
   order to study and search the best location to install a concentrated
   solar power plant according to a tender with the Algerian electricity
   company ``SPE{''} following a specific criteria and methodology in order
   to obtain a site with a maximum possible irradiation along with other
   economic constraints. Normally, eleven years of solar irradiation data
   from an on-ground weather station is needed for site assessment, such
   data are not available, hence the typical meteorological year
   irradiation based on satellite imagery results is needed in order to
   have the accurate value, therefore we can give the right evaluation for
   the site candidate. Additionally, an analysis of a weather measurement
   station was carried out to ensure the proper functioning of the weather
   data reception and analysis processes, and thus to optimize the
   algorithm of a data logger in order to get the right measurement with a
   minimum error. The correction algorithm was developed by weather
   scientists and was added to the data logger main program.},

Abstract = {To aid in the management and conservation of Southwestern Willow
   Flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus, hereafter ``Flycatcher{''}), we
   developed numerous models of flycatcher breeding habitat at Roosevelt
   Lake, AZ. For model development and testing, we compiled 10 years of
   flycatcher territory data that were obtained from intensive fieldwork
   between 1996 and 2005. We identified riparian vegetation annually in the
   project area from Landsat Thematic Mapper images, and extracted
   floodplain features from a digital elevation model. We created a novel
   class of temporal (i.e., multiyear) variables by characterizing the
   stability and variability in breeding habitat over a 6-year time
   interval. We used logistic regression to determine associations between
   environmental variables and flycatcher territory occurrence, and to test
   specific hypotheses. We mapped the probability of territory occurrence
   with a GIS and determined model accuracies with a classification table
   and a 10-year population database. Environmental features that were
   associated with breeding flycatchers included floodplain size, proximity
   to water, and the density, heterogeneity, age and stability of riparian
   vegetation. Our best model explained 79\% of the variability in the
   flycatcher breeding population at Roosevelt Lake. The majority of
   predicted flycatcher habitat formed between 1996 and 2004 on an exposed
   lakebed similar to 3 years after water levels receded during a prolonged
   drought. A high correlation between annual reservoir levels and
   predicted breeding habitat (r=-0.82) indicates that we can create and
   manage habitat for conservation purposes. Our predictive models quantify
   and assess the relative quality of flycatcher breeding habitat remotely,
   and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of habitat restoration
   activities. Numerous techniques we developed can be used to characterize
   riparian vegetation and patch dynamics directly off of satellite
   imagery, thereby increasing its utility for conservation purposes.

Abstract = {Green roofs have been more common in central Europe and are now being
   constructed on buildings around the world. As powerful mapping software,
   Google Earth can provide satellite photos of three-dimensional building
   roofs in big cities to GIS system. An application system integration
   with basic function of the environmental effect assessment and energy
   saving on green roof was designed by the technology of GIS and Google
   Earth. It is hoped that this designed application system can offer
   certain reference value for green roof management in urban area. This
   application system of green roofs assessment has been conducted to
   estimate the environment efficiency and energy saving compared to none
   green roof area in city. The green roof with useful environment
   efficiency including stormwater management, energy conservation, urban
   heat island effects mitigation, noise and air pollution reduce, urban
   biodiversity increase and more aesthetically pleasing environment, can
   be effectively assessed by designed application system. It is very
   evident that this application system with GIS and Google Earth
   technology can play an important role to manage and improve the green
   roof function. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to determine the amount and value of
   carbon stock in Southwestern Ethiopia's coffee forest from 1978 to 2050,
   as well as carbon sequestration from 1988 to 2050. Different time-series
   satellite data were acquired and classified into land-use categories
   using ArcGIS and ENVI 5:0, followed by IDRISI forecasts up to 2050, and
   finally modeling with INVEST. Data were collected within the plot
   constructed in a systematic random sampling manner using quadrates 20 m
   X 20 m. The social cost of carbon (US\$12/tCO(2)e) used to estimate the
   monetary worth of the services. Forest conversion anticipated to reduce
   the carbon stock by 1.86 Mt by the end of 2050, from 65.8 Mt in 1978 to
   7.01 Mt in 2018. The rate of Carbon sequestration was 2.1Mt/year at the
   end of 1998, and it will be reduced to 1.49Mt/year by the end of 2050.
   Overall, 121.1Mt of CO2 is sequestered over 63 years, but there was also
   emission from deforestation and service loss (84.4Mt), resulting a net
   sequestered CO2 of 36.6Mt by the end of 2050. The total elemental carbon
   stock value in 1978 was \$2. 896 billion, this will be reached
   \$2.5billion (\$9.175 billion CO(2)e) at the end of 2050. The value of
   sequestration will be estimated at \$1.715 billion, but with a value
   loss of \$1.153 billion, the net sink value from 1988 to 2050 will be
   \$0.6 billion. In general, these findings show that the forest region
   will have a total storage and sequestration value (CO(2)e) of \$9.775
   billion by the end of 2050. The carbon worth in this forest area is thus
   a good indicator of the importance, and thus the value estimate here may
   well persuade policymakers to revise their forest-related policy and
   provide site-specific information to preserve this remnant forest.},

Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Number = {10},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {The sustainable economic advancement of a nation stands on an adequate
   supply of electrical energy. Reduction in cost for industrial processing
   units has been pulled with the wide utilization of rice husk (RH) and
   solar energy as value-added renewable energy sources for the era of
   power generation. The principal reason is to assist the study area
   towards development and to build up an integrated hybrid renewable power
   plant in rural regions in India. In this study, a new solar town concept
   and integrated biomass can be served as a hybrid global model for a
   smart eco-village in tropical countries like India. The demand,
   properties and cost of RH generation from rice mills resemble
   substitution of coal in power generation. Solar energy and agricultural
   residues are seasonally accessible sources and loosely dispersed over
   the substantial topographical area. So, for such an assessment,
   satellite image is a handy input and the preciseness of estimation
   increases with a high-resolution image. The methodology has been
   implemented for optimal sizing of an integrated renewable energy
   system-based power generation plants in India with less investment and
   minimum power cost. The outcome of the study reveals that the efficient
   use of renewable energy sources and proposal for placing a power
   generation plant require cautious identification of various
   techno-economic parameters. By considering the power crisis in India,
   the findings of these works are expected to assist the policymakers in
   the decision-making process. Particularly, this paper generates data on
   village-level RH availability from rice mills and subsequently potential
   electric power capacity for a particular region.},

Title = {Assessing elements of surface hydrology for environmental quality
   characterisation of a site northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {192-204},
Abstract = {Purpose - Surface hydrology studies are becoming more important for
   environmentalists and design engineers in arid regions where climate
   elements, particularly rainfall, are severe, sporadic and difficult to
   forecast. The main purpose of this study is to analyse elements of
   surface hydrology in the northwest of Riyadh City as part of
   environmental quality characterization for urban development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study area lies within a typical arid
   zone in the Arabian desert, and forms an integral part of Riyadh City
   extension. Field observations, collection and analyses of meteorological
   data, identification and analyses of the drainage network were the main
   approaches used in this study. The study made use of SPOT 4 satellite
   images, published topographic maps and Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
   from Shuttle Radar (SRTM).
   Findings - Drainage analyses show four sub-dendritic systems in
   northwest Riyadh. The study area lies within the middle sub-catchment
   with a total area of 11-5 km(2). Average annual rainfall is 125 mm. It
   occurs in the months of November-February with a standard deviation of
   17-25.5 for monthly rainfall and a standard deviation of 3.2-8.8 for
   maximum daily rainfall. Annual relative humidity is 34.4 percent, annual
   solar radiation is 477 cal/cm(2) per day, prevailing wind direction is
   NE and N with an average speed of 5.1 km/hr, and average annual
   evaporation is 2910 mm. Runoff peak flow varies from 2.73-4.67 m(3)/sec.
   Practical implications - Planners, design engineers, decision makers can
   use these findings for urban environmental development. The results of
   this study can help to prepare safeguard settlements from any unforeseen
   events.
   Originality/value - The study indicates the importance of environmental
   quality chacterization for urban development.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry has drawn the attention of researchers due to its capacity
   to reduce the poverty and land degradation, improve food security and
   mitigate the climate change. However, the progress in promoting
   agroforestry is held back due to the lack of reliable data sets and
   appropriate tools to accurately map and to have an adequate decision
   making system for agroforestry modules. Agroforestry suitability being
   one special form of land suitability is very pertinent to study in the
   current times when there is tremendous pressure on the land as it is a
   limited commodity. The study aims for applying the geo-spatial tools
   towards visualizing various soil and environmental data to reveal the
   trends and interrelationships and to achieve a nutrient availability and
   agroforestry suitability map. Using weight matrix and ranks, individual
   maps were developed in ArcGIS 10.1 platform to generate nutrient
   availability map, which was later used to develop agroforestry
   suitability map. Watersheds were delineated using DEM in some part of
   the study area and were evaluated for prioritizing it and agroforestry
   suitability of the watersheds were also done as per the schematic
   flowchart. Agroforestry suitability regions were delineated based upon
   the weight and ranks by integrated mapping. The total open area was
   identified 42.4\% out of which 21.6\% area was found to have high
   suitability towards agroforestry. Within the watersheds, 22 village
   points were generated for creating buffers, which were further evaluated
   showing its proximity to high suitable agroforestry sites thus
   generating tremendous opportunity to the villagers to carry out
   agroforestry projects locally. This research shows the capability of
   remote sensing in studying agroforestry practices and in estimating the
   prominent factors for its optimal productivity. The ongoing agroforestry
   projects can be potentially diverted in the areas of high suitability as
   an extension. The use of ancillary data in GIS domain can have enormous
   ability to map the land for the benefit of rural people even up to the
   village level.},

Abstract = {Modelling the impact of river regulation on large floodplain wetland
   ecosystems is essential for long-term management of these systems.
   Understanding the response to hydrological events is critical to
   developing conceptual models, while appropriate data is required to
   calibrate, test and validate models. In the Gwydir wetlands, NSW,
   Australia, satellite-derived normalised difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) has been used to assess flood response. This paper firstly
   compares the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   with NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI for use
   in long-term temporal profile analysis and then explores the use of
   these data to identify the flood response from wetland ecosystems.
   Terra MODIS 16-day maximum value composite (MVC) NDVI data at a pixel
   resolution of 250 m(2) is stacked temporally for the period 29 September
   2000 to 26 June 2005 for the study area. The NOAA AVHRR High Resolution
   Picture Transmission (HRPT) dataset (1 km(2)) was extracted for the
   period 21 March 1992 to 26 June 2005 and an MVC algorithm applied to
   correspond to the MODIS 16-day periods. Both MODIS and AVHRR data are
   used to determine the flood response using two sites, an internationally
   recognised wetland site and an adjacent native grassland site. Rainfall
   and inflow data were extracted from Bureau of Meteorology and NSW
   Department of Natural Resources databases respectively at daily
   resolution and the cumulative total for each 16-day antecedent period
   calculated.
   For both the wetland and grassland site, the AVHRR NDVI value was lower
   overall than for MODIS NDVI for the 109 composite periods analysed. A
   simple linear regression model explained over 80\% of the variation
   between the AVHRR and MODIS data for both sites, although the intercept
   was higher for the wetland site. Mean NDVI was significantly higher in
   the wetland site compared to the grassland site but both sites can reach
   similar peak values following large rainfall or flood events. The NDVI
   time-series has significant auto-correlation at lags of 1 to 4 (64
   days). Cross-correlation between NDVI, rainfall and inflow was generally
   significant at lags up to 80 days.
   Events were extracted from the AVHRR 16-day time-series where peak
   wetland NDVI exceeded 0.45. The mean NDVI for the event, initial NDVI,
   antecedent rainfall and inflows (80 days) were calculated for each
   event. Multiple regression analysis indicated that pre-event NDVI and
   antecedent inflows accounted for over 79\% of the event NDVI for the
   wetland site. Neither rainfall nor inflows were significant for
   grasslands.
   This exploratory analysis of events indicates that the modelling of NDVI
   response is possible for small wetland sites using the AVHRR satellite
   data and can be compared to higher resolution MODIS data to provide a
   level of confidence when scaling from field sites to MODIS to AVHRR.
   Further investigation of modelling approaches using time-series may
   strengthen the analysis. More research is required to provide confidence
   in the sensitivity of models and data to small differences in event NDVI
   that separated highly productive wetlands from normal seasonal greening
   responses. This work must also be coupled with field monitoring to
   validate the NDVI results and determine the target event NDVI response
   required to maintain wetland vegetation communities in a healthy state.
   Despite some limitations and the need for further analysis, the results
   of this paper show promise for application to water management. These
   types of models can be used to estimate the water requirements to
   achieve a pre-determined NDVI response under a variety of antecedent
   conditions (as indicated by pre-event NDVI).},

Abstract = {Rice is considered the main food source for over 40\% of the world
   population and plays a crucial role in countries' food security, food
   management, and economic aspects. The value of SAR remote sensing in
   agricultural studies has its source of illumination and not limited to
   cloud cover. This makes it highly preferable over optical sensors in
   cloud-shrouded countries. The objective of the study is to assess the
   capability of Sentinel-1 data for determining paddy planting methods,
   identifying unhealthy paddy and an attempt made to differentiate rice
   varieties through correlation of in situ measurements and temporal
   variation of SAR backscattered signals. Six Sentinel-1 images are
   stacked to cover the entire paddy lifecycle. The correlated field data
   and plant backscatter showed that transplanted paddy has backscatter
   higher than broadcasted paddy. Two drops of paddy backscatter
   coefficient occurred, the first one, at the reproductive stage when
   paddy was attacked by bacteria and the second drop was at the ripening
   stage due to the attack of pests. The five rice varieties planted in
   Seberang Perak, Malaysia had the backscatter with insignificant
   differences that cannot confirm the Sentinel-1 capability to
   differentiate planted rice varieties. According to the obtained results,
   the time series of Sentinel-1 data has the capability for paddy rice
   growth monitoring.},

Abstract = {In Asia, cassava (Manihot esculenta) is cultivated by more than 8
   million farmers, driving the rural economy of many countries. The
   International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in partnership
   with national agricultural research institutes (NARIS), instigated
   breeding and agronomic research in Asia, 1983. The breeding program has
   successfully released high-yielding cultivars resulting in an average
   yield increase from 13.0 t ha(-1) in 1996 to 21.3 t ha(-1) in 2016, with
   significant economic benefits. Following the success in increasing
   yields, cassava breeding has turned its focus to higher-value traits,
   such as waxy cassava, to reach new market niches. More recently,
   building resistance to invasive pests and diseases has become a top
   priority due to the emergent threat of cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The
   agronomic research involves driving profitability with advanced
   technologies focusing on better agronomic management practices thereby
   maintaining sustainable production systems. Remote sensing technologies
   are being tested for trait discovery and large-scale field evaluation of
   cassava. In summary, cassava breeding in Asia is driven by a combination
   of food and market demand with technological innovations to increase the
   productivity. Further, exploration in the potential of data-driven
   agriculture is needed to empower researchers and producers for
   sustainable advancement.},

Booktitle = {ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SOIL SCIENCE, VOLS I-III, 3RD EDITION},

Pages = {633-641},
Abstract = {Mapping desertification has proven to be a challenging task.
   Difficulties derive from its ambiguous definition and the comprehensive
   integration of various biophysical and socioeconomic indicators that
   need to be considered in the evaluation process. In the early 1990s,
   assessments and mapping were based primarily on expert opinions that
   introduced uncertainties and obvious shortcomings. Later on, with the
   development of the remote sensing technology and the advancement of the
   geographic information systems, global mapping became commonplace.
   Results showed that temporal and spatial scales are crucial components
   of the mapping and assessment process, but great difficulties arose
   comparing maps that were developed using different methodologies. Global
   maps could depict only general trends in desertification caused by
   human-induced land use changes or climatic variations but proved to be
   of limited value at local level. On the other side, local studies have
   problems of extrapolation. This necessitates the performance of mapping
   at various scales, but only after a methodological approach has been
   developed that accounts for all the components of the desertification
   process, allowing upscaling from global to local level and vice versa.
   Desertification mapping is under way by the World Atlas of
   Desertification (WAD) 3rd edition. The WAD places particular importance
   on case studies that document local realities affected by
   desertification as well as mitigation actions. Finally, concerned
   efforts must be made to develop and implement sustainable land use
   planning and land management techniques that arrest and reverse the
   negative consequences of desertification.},

   winter when temperatures are low and food resources are unpredictable.
   We conducted fixed-radius point counts of wintering birds in forest
   stands logged or unlogged after windthrows and in mature forest stands
   to test our predictions that bird species densities and abundances (i)
   are lower in postdisturbance logged stands and (ii) depend on the amount
   of natural regeneration, (iii) which differs between logged and unlogged
   stands. Our generalized linear mixed model did not support the expected
   differences in bird abundance or species densities between
   postdisturbance logged and unlogged stands but indicated that mature
   forest stands harbor the highest bird abundances and species densities.
   The number of regenerated coniferous trees significantly positively
   affected wintering bird abundances in both postdisturbance logged and
   unlogged stands. Hence, the number of coniferous trees appears to be a
   main predictor of wintering bird presence.},

Abstract = {Engineers have shaped the environment across the centuries in order to
   improve the quality and safety of human life. The unrestrained invasion
   of nature led to significant environmental problems, for this reason
   nowadays engineering projects should be based on ecological concepts to
   protect our environment. This paper presents an integrated methodology
   that involves GIS tools, hydraulic numerical models, and landscape
   metrics to investigate ecological consequences caused by river
   restoration activities. The combined use of these different tools
   represents a bridge to connect the field of engineering with ecological
   techniques. The proposed method was tested to predict and assess the
   influence of a river restoration plan on a reach of the Orco river
   located in the northwest of Italy. Morphological alterations were
   simulated to reconnect remnant meanders and provide water to the
   floodplain, enhancing the ecological value of riparian ecosystems. The
   application of the hydraulic model permitted to evaluate the
   distribution of water inside the study area before and after the
   restoration plan. Thereafter, spatial configuration and temporal
   dynamics of the landscape structures were quantified using landscape
   metrics. The increase of patch density (PD) by 9\% and edge density (ED)
   up to 10\% highlights that restoration activities lead to a new
   configuration characterized by a higher level of fragmentation and
   heterogeneity. The characteristics of versatility, repeatability, and
   the possibility to predict the outcomes of a specific plan make the
   proposed method a useful tool that could help decision-makers to manage
   the territory while safeguarding natural ecosystems.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapidly changing remote sensing technologies (lidar, aerial photography,
   satellites) provide opportunities to improve regional-scale landslide
   risk mapping. However, data limitations regarding landslide hazard and
   exposure data influence how landslide risk is calculated. To develop
   risk assessments for a landslide-prone region of eastern Kentucky, USA,
   we assessed risk modeling and applicability using variable quality data.
   First, we used a risk equation that incorporated the hazard as a
   logistic regression landslide susceptibility model using geomorphic
   variables derived from lidar data. Susceptibility is calculated as a
   probability of occurrence. The exposure data included population, roads,
   railroads, and land class. Our vulnerability value was assumed to equal
   one (worst-case scenario for a degree of loss) and consequence data was
   economic cost. Results indicate 64.1 percent of the study area is
   classified as moderate to high socioeconomic risk. To develop a more
   data-limited approach, we used a 30 m slope-angle map as the hazard
   input and simplified exposure data. Results for the slope-based approach
   show the distribution of risk that is less uniform, with large areas of
   over-and under-prediction. Changes in the hazard and exposure inputs
   result in significant changes in the quality and applicability of the
   maps and demonstrate the broad range of risk modelling approaches.},

Abstract = {Macroalgae plays an important role in coastal ecosystems. The accurate
   delineation of macroalgae areas is important for environmental
   management. This study compared the pixel- and object-based methods
   using Gaofen satellite no. 2 image to explore an efficient
   classification approach. Expert system rules and nearest neighbour
   classifier were adopted for object-based classification, whereas maximum
   likelihood classifier was implemented in the pixel-based approach.
   Normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water
   index, mean value of the blue band and geometric characteristics were
   selected as features to distinguish macroalgae farms by considering the
   spectral and spatial characteristics. Results show that the object-based
   method achieved a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient than the
   pixel-based method. Moreover, the object-based approach displayed
   superiority in identifying Porphyra class. These findings suggest that
   the object-based method can delineate macroalgae farming areas
   efficiently and be applied in the future to monitor the macroalgae farms

Title = {Estimating evapotranspiration based on the satellite-retrieved
   near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) over croplands},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {6},

Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Accurate information on cropland evapotranspiration (ET) can facilitate
   effective agricultural management. However, the application of existing
   physical models over broad regions may be impeded due to the need for
   difficult to acquire information about environmental factors that
   constrain ET. The recently developed near-infrared reflectance of
   vegetation (NIRv), which can reasonably characterize ecosystem
   photosynthesis without the need for additional environmental
   information, is potentially useful for estimating cropland ET and
   reducing the difficulty in ET modeling. As such, we proposed two simply
   formulated semi-empirical models that utilize NIRv as a major factor
   constraining cropland ET. The first model, termed Penman-Monteith+
   (PM+), computed canopy transpiration using the PM equation along with
   canopy conductance values estimated from NIRv-derived gross primary
   productivity (NIRv-GPP) and calculated soil evaporation using an
   empirical approach. Another model, termed underlying water-use
   efficiency+ (uWUE+), used the uWUE approach along with the NIRv-GPP to
   predict ET. We calibrated and validated PM+ and uWUE+ over 32 cropland
   flux sites and then compared them with six complex models. The better
   model between PM+ and uWUE+ was applied to estimate regional ET over
   North China Plain (NCP), where typical C-3 and C-4 crops were planted
   during 2010-2018, along with remote sensing and meteorological data.
   Results indicated that the two new models can reasonably estimate
   cropland ET. The PM+ model reproduced an eight-day value of ET (denoted
   as eight-day ET) with R-2 = 0.741 and RMSE = 5.638 mm/8d, slightly
   better than the uWUE+ model (R-2 = 0. 674 and RMSE = 6.275 mm/8d) for a
   cross-site validation over 17 flux sites of the validation dataset.
   Site-level validation revealed consistently better performance of PM+
   compared to uWUE+ over most flux sites. For the comparisons with six
   existing models, PM+ can perform better than all these models and uWUE+
   is better than five of them. Subsequently, the PM+ (uWUE+) model
   reasonably reproduced eight-day ET over four sites under a dry climate
   (Arid Index <= 0.5) with site-level R-2 = 0.691 (0.617) and RMSE = 6.663
   (7.906) mm/8d on average, which is better than the six existing models.
   In addition, the regional mean annual ET varied from 590 mm per year
   (mm/yr) to 680 mm/yr over NCP with a significant increasing trend of
   9.05 mm/yr (p < 0.01), and the ET values in maize growing season were
   higher than that in wheat growing season. Our results demonstrated that
   the simply formulated PM+ and uWUE+ models can provide simple and robust
   approaches to estimate regional and global cropland ET.},

Title = {Model for estimation of total nitrogen content in sandalwood leaves
   based on nonlinear mixed effects and dummy variables using multispectral

Journal = {CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Fertilizer overuse is a common phenomenon in global agroforestry
   production, and this overuse causes ecological destruction. The ability
   to accurately estimate the nutrient content of plant leaves in real-time
   would be a wonderful solution to reduce the degree of environmental
   damage. in recent years, remote sensing technology has been widely used
   in the diagnosis of crop nutrition in many countries. Most studies focus
   on optimal band selection or create new vegetation indices, but these
   studies have ignored the random impact of natural environmental factors
   on the estimated results. This paper proposed an estimation model of
   total nitrogen content (TNC) in sandalwood leaves that takes sampling
   season and site conditions as the dummy variable and random effect,
   respectively. Three forestry farms with different locations and site
   conditions were selected as study areas to enhance the universality of
   this model. Multispectral images of leaves were obtained using a
   low-cost five-band camera (RedEdge3, MicaSense, USA), and the
   experimental results indicate the following: (1) the growth of the tree
   height, crown width and stem effectively increased under the medium
   gradient level (N2), whereas a high gradient level (N3) significantly
   promoted all aspects except tree height; (2) the mean and variance of
   some image texture features of the G, RE and NIR band were significantly
   correlated with TNC at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, and the texture mean
   value index (TMVI) proposed in this paper can improve the correlation
   with TNC; and (3) the results obtained using the nonlinear mixed-effects
   model with dummy variables improved the fitting degree and estimation
   accuracy compared with results of SVR and BPNN. This study demonstrates
   the advantages of using the nonlinear mixed-effects model with dummy
   variables to obtain a more reliable estimation model for the nutritional
   diagnosis of rare tree species.},

Title = {Delivering wildlife habitat on productive agricultural lands
   cost-effectively: The case of migratory shorebirds on California rice
   lands},
Journal = {CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},

Abstract = {Promoting wildlife habitat on working agricultural land is a growing
   conservation priority, and agri-environment schemes are using payments
   for environmental services (PES) to reach these privately owned lands.
   PES can be ecologically effective, but also expensive, putting pressure
   on these schemes to be cost-effective, maximizing the conservation value
   of their limited resources. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness
   of four PES schemes in California that paid rice growers to provide
   temporary flood habitat on their working lands in support of shorebirds.
   It examines whether the schemes (1) paid for flood habitat only when
   needed (targeting); (2) paid for habitat that was actually delivered and
   would not otherwise be provided (additionality); (3) sacrificed as
   little habitat as possible when the habitat competed with production
   (ag/wildlife balance); and (4) fostered a commitment among growers to
   maintain the habitat after payments ended (permanence). Results show
   that the schemes fell short in each of the four goals, and they expose
   several factors that undermined their cost-effectiveness. First,
   variable weather patterns altered the date in which the
   shorebird-habitat gap emerged year-to-year, creating a dynamic and
   unpredictable target for the schemes to address. Second, growers' views
   on the compatibility of the flood habitat with their rice production
   varied widely and changed rapidly as the agricultural calendar
   progressed, making it a challenge to mitigate potential ag/wildlife
   conflicts. Third, water for flood habitat is expensive, and growers
   proved unwilling to shoulder that expense once payments ended. These
   results highlight the need for schemes to adopt design elements that can
   add flexibility, such as cancelation clauses, so that they can adjust to
   dynamic targets and adapt to changing ag/wildlife relationships. Results
   also suggest that PES schemes operating on working lands may require
   long-term external support. That finding amplifies the imperative that
   schemes use their conservation resources cost-effectively.},

Abstract = {Throughout history, mankind has sought to minimize the impact of the
   unpredictability and severity of violent storms such as tornadoes. To
   date, solutions have focused on early warning and on development of
   fortified buildings made to withstand the strong forces that are the
   hallmark of these atmospheric events. Sophisticated prediction methods
   have been developed to warn populations of potential storm danger. These
   ``warn and seek shelter{''} mechanisms have clearly reduced the loss of
   life and, to a lesser extent, property damage associated with these
   natural events. However, despite our best efforts, loss of life and
   costly property damage are still strongly associated with severe weather
   phenomenon. This paper describes concepts that use either ground or
   space based platforms for generating beams of microwave radiation to
   provide localized thermal heating or ionization of the atmosphere. It is
   further suggested that these heating techniques could initially be used
   as research tools for improving computer simulations of atmospheric
   phenomena. The ultimate goal is to utilize such tools for prevention of
   severe storm phenomena and eventually for the manipulation of the jet
   stream for alleviation of draught and floods.
   The experimental techniques include a) heating of rain droplets with
   microwaves between 26 and 35 Ghz, b) Heating of atmospheric oxygen with
   microwave frequencies of about 54 Ghz and c) creation of artificial
   ionization plasma patterns in the atmosphere which can be heated with
   microwaves to produce acoustic or gravitational waves and can interact
   with electrical phenomena by adjustments in atmospheric electrical
   conductivity. New experimental techniques similar to ``ink drop{''}
   experiments to determine the diffusion of chemicals in a liquid can be
   applied to the atmosphere to study heat transport and electrical
   properties.
   Weather research concepts are discussed. The microwave heating
   technologies suggested in this paper provide methods for rapidly heating
   well-defined regions of a weather system. Ground or satellite based
   microwave phased arrays, focused on specific locations in the
   atmosphere, will be used to heat the atmosphere and to create useful
   artificial ionized plasma patterns. Initial experiments would correlate
   heating in a specific region of a weather system with computer
   simulations.
   Weather modification of tornadoes and of the jet stream is also
   discussed. One such application is to prevent concentration of
   rotational energy in a mesocyclone by heating the cold rainy downdrafts.
   The anticipated result is to prevent the precise rotation geometry that
   can produce a tornado and thus interrupt tornado formation. Methods of
   influencing the jet stream are also discussed. A new approach to
   influencing hurricanes and typhoons by influencing the position of the
   jet stream and the behavior of atmospheric gravitational waves is also
   discussed.
   Development of Space-Based Solar Power as a clean, renewable energy
   source for the world's needs is dependent on an evolutionary approach.
   Dual use of such systems for weather research and control will increase
   the economic value of solar power satellites. Understanding the weather
   and computer simulation of storm systems is necessary before attempting
   interaction to mitigate storms. When that has been achieved, the initial
   investment can save lives and reduce property damage. In the process,
   the fundamentals of Space-Based Solar Power are demonstrated, leading to
   development of commercial energy systems as well as systems for
   modifying the weather and the effects of global warming on weather.},

Title = {Analysis of Ecological and Economic Benefits of Rural Land Integration
   in the Manas River Basin Oasis},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Land consolidation is an effective means of promoting the regularization
   of fragmented arable land, optimizing the allocation of land resources
   and improving the environment in farming areas, as well as an important
   means of increasing the economic returns of farming households, and it
   is important to scientifically assess the ecological and economic
   benefits of agricultural land consolidation. In this study,
   participatory rural assessment (PRA) was used to investigate, in detail,
   the meaning, satisfaction and changes in farmland rehabilitation before
   and after implementation. The accuracy of the remote sensing data was
   verified through an experiment on the net cultivation coefficient. We
   used a sample of 447 farmers from nine villages in Manas County to study
   the differences in plot area, crop unit value, income and irrigation
   before and after the farmers' integration. We found that, after the
   integration of farmland, the cultivated area increased significantly,
   the crop unit yield increased by at least 42.66\%, the average income of
   farmers increased by a value of RMB 4324/ha and the water savings were
   all higher than 7.18 m(3)/ha. At the same time, after the integration of
   farmland, the number of plots was significantly reduced, the arable land
   became more regular and the microclimate of the farmland improved
   significantly. The government and individuals should follow the concept
   and construction requirements of the ``community of life in mountain,
   water, forest, lake, grass and sand{''}, consider the economic and
   ecological benefits of land consolidation, ensure the quality of
   farmland ecosystems, actively explore new models of land consolidation
   and stimulate the economic vitality of rural areas.},

Title = {The Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium - a protocol
   for building a national environmental exposure data platform for
   integrated analyses of urban form and health},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Multiple external environmental exposures related to
   residential location and urban form including, air pollutants, noise,
   greenness, and walkability have been linked to health impacts or
   benefits. The Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium
   (CANUE) was established to facilitate the linkage of extensive
   geospatial exposure data to existing Canadian cohorts and administrative
   health data holdings. We hypothesize that this linkage will enable
   investigators to test a variety of their own hypotheses related to the
   interdependent associations of built environment features with diverse
   health outcomes encompassed by the cohorts and administrative data.
   Methods: We developed a protocol for compiling measures of built
   environment features that quantify exposure; vary spatially on the urban
   and suburban scale; and can be modified through changes in policy or
   individual behaviour to benefit health. These measures fall into six
   domains: air quality, noise, greenness, weather/climate, and
   transportation and neighbourhood factors; and will be indexed to
   six-digit postal codes to facilitate merging with health databases.
   Initial efforts focus on existing data and include estimates of air
   pollutants, greenness, temperature extremes, and neighbourhood
   walkability and socioeconomic characteristics. Key gaps will be
   addressed for noise exposure, with a new national model being developed,
   and for transportation-related exposures, with detailed estimates of
   truck volumes and diesel emissions now underway in selected cities.
   Improvements to existing exposure estimates are planned, primarily by
   increasing temporal and/or spatial resolution given new satellite-based
   sensors and more detailed national air quality modelling. Novel metrics
   are also planned for walkability and food environments, green space
   access and function and life-long climate-related exposures based on
   local climate zones. Critical challenges exist, for example, the
   quantity and quality of input data to many of the models and metrics has
   changed over time, making it difficult to develop and validate
   historical exposures.
   Discussion: CANUE represents a unique effort to coordinate and leverage
   substantial research investments and will enable a more focused effort
   on filling gaps in exposure information, improving the range of
   exposures quantified, their precision and mechanistic relevance to
   health. Epidemiological studies may be better able to explore the common
   theme of urban form and health in an integrated manner, ultimately
   contributing new knowledge informing policies that enhance healthy urban
   living.},

Abstract = {Urbanization due to population growth and regional development can cause
   various environmental problems, such as the urban heat island
   phenomenon. A planned city is considered an appropriate study site to
   analyze changes in urban climate caused by rapid urbanization in a
   short-term period. In this study, changes in land cover and surface heat
   island phenomenon were analyzed according to the development plan in
   Sejong City from 2013 to 2020 using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager/
   Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) satellite imagery. The surface
   temperature was calculated in consideration of the thermal infrared band
   value provided by the satellite image and the emissivity, and based on
   this the surface heat island effect intensity and Urban Thermal Field
   Variance Index (UTFVI) change analysis were performed. The level-2 land
   cover map provided by the Ministry of Environment was used to confirm
   the change in land cover as the development progressed and the
   difference in the surface heat island intensity by each land cover. As a
   result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the urbanized area
   increased by 15\% and the vegetation decreased by more than 28\%.
   Expansion and intensification of the heat island phenomenon due to urban
   development were observed, and it was confirmed that the ecological
   level of the area where the heat island phenomenon occurred was very
   low. Therefore, It can suggest the need for a policy to improve the
   residential environment according to the quantitative change of the
   thermal environment due to rapid urbanization.},

Title = {Quantifying the Impact of Hydrological Connectivity on Salt Marsh
   Vegetation in the Liao River Delta Wetland},
Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Salt marshes play a critical role in ecological functioning and have
   significant economic value. Hydrological elements are considered to be
   one of the major contributors to salt marsh degradation. However, how
   hydrological connectivity affects salt marshes remains poorly
   investigated at fine scales. This paper used spatial analysis and
   statistical methods to investigate the impact of hydrological
   connectivity on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of
   salt marsh vegetation in two natural succession areas of the Liao River
   Delta wetland in 2020 and 2021 by selecting vegetation area, NDVI, tidal
   creeks area, distance to tidal creeks, and the Index of Connectivity,
   using 1 m Gaofen-2 data and 0.2 m aerial topographic data. The study
   found that the area and growth status of vegetation and the overall
   connectivity in 2021 were better than that in 2020, while the west bank
   of the Liao River was better than that on the east bank. Phragmites
   australis showed a round island distribution pattern primarily at the
   end of tidal creeks. The differences between different hydrological
   connectivity and vegetation area were significant in 2021. The
   vegetation area was the largest under poor and moderate connectivity. We
   also found that within a distance range of 0-6 m from tidal creeks, the
   vegetation area increased with increasing distance, but beyond 6 m, the
   vegetation area decreased with increasing distance. Our results showed
   that poor and moderate connectivity conditions were more suitable for
   vegetation growth. The threshold value of 6 m can provide an important
   reference for wetland vegetation restoration in the Liao River Delta
   wetland.},

   most northerly province (in short SECBH) and includes 16 provinces, 4
   central government-controlled municipalities and one autonomous region,
   all referred to here as provinces. The extended time series and
   provincial-scale averaging of the AOD provide more detailed and new
   information on the spatiotemporal variation across the SECBH.
   Differences in temporal behaviour are observed between the north,
   central-south and south of the SEBCH. The AOD increased in southern
   China before it increased in the northern provinces. The AOD was high
   between 2006 and 2014, with strong interannual fluctuations in response
   to the emission reduction policy opposed by economic developments, and
   decreased significantly from 2013/2014, in response to the Clean Air
   Action Plan (2013-2017). However, during the period 2017-2020 the AOD
   stabilized and fluctuated within 10\% of the average value for these
   years which was similar to, and in part of the study area lower than,
   the AOD in 2000. Exceptions are Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and part of
   Shandong, where the AOD in 2020 was slightly higher than in 2000. The
   extension of the AOD time series until July 2021 shows that earlier
   derived trends do not continue and the emission reduction policy needs
   to be extended to achieve the earlier air quality goals.},

Title = {Assessing the resilience of ecosystem functioning to wildfires using
   satellite-derived metrics of post-fire trajectories},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {286},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Wildfire disturbances can profoundly impact many aspects of both
   ecosystem functioning and resilience. This study proposes a
   satellite-based approach to assess ecosystem resilience to wildfires
   based on post-fire trajec-tories of four key functional dimensions of
   ecosystems related to carbon, water, and energy exchanges: (i)
   vegetation primary production; (ii) vegetation and soil water content;
   (iii) land surface albedo; and (iv) land surface sensible heat. For each
   dimension, several metrics extracted from satellite image time-series,
   at the short, medium and long-term, describe both resistance (the
   ability to withstand environmental disturbances) and re-covery (the
   ability to pull back towards equilibrium). We used MODIS data for
   2000-2018 to analyze trajectories after the 2005 wildfires in NW Iberian
   Peninsula. Primary production exhibited low resistance, with abrupt
   breaks immediately after the fire, but rapid recoveries, starting within
   six months after the fire and reaching stable pre-fire levels two years
   after. Loss of water content after the fire showed slightly higher
   resistance but slower and more gradual recoveries than primary
   production. On the other hand, albedo exhibited varying levels of
   resistance and recovery, with post-fire breaks often followed by
   increases to levels above pre-fire within the first two years, but
   sometimes with effects that persisted for many years. Finally, wildfire
   effects on sensible heat were generally more transient, with effects
   starting to dissipate after one year and overall rapid recoveries. Our
   approach was able to successfully depict key features of post-fire
   processes of ecosystem functioning at different timeframes. The added
   value of our multi-indicator approach for analyzing ecosystem resilience
   to wildfires was highlighted by the independence and complementarity
   among the proposed indicators targeting four dimensions of ecosystem
   functioning. We argue that such approaches can provide an enhanced
   characterization of ecosystem resilience to disturbances, ultimately
   upholding promising implications for post-fire ecosystem management and
   targeting different dimensions of ecosystem functioning.},

Abstract = {Risk factors related to herd and farmer status, farm and pasture
   management, and environmental factors derived by satellite data were
   examined for their association with the prevalence of F. hepatica in
   sheep and goat farms in Thessaly, Greece. Twelve farms (16.2\%) and 58
   farms (78.4\%) of 74 had evidence of infection using coproantigen and
   serology respectively. The average normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI) of farm location for 12 months before sampling was the most
   significant environmental risk factor for F. hepatica infection based on
   high seropositivity. The risk of infection increased by 1\% when the
   value of NDVI increased by 0.01 degree. A geospatial map was constructed
   to show the relative risk (RR) of Fasciola infection in sheep and goat
   farms in Thessaly. In addition, geospatial maps of the model-based
   predicted RR for the presence of Fasciola infection in farms in Thessaly
   and the entire area of Greece were constructed from the developed model
   based on NDVI. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Thessaly
   should be regarded as an endemic region for Fasciola infection and it
   represents the first prediction model of Fasciola infection in small
   ruminants in the Mediterranean basin.},

Abstract = {With shrinking budgets and expanding program costs, government program
   offices are seeking innovative ways to accomplish their goals with
   better efficiency and less cost. In 2008, the U. S. Air Force's Space
   and Missile Systems Center's Development Planning Directorate (SMC/XRF)
   took a bold step in this direction and funded a new program that started
   as an unsolicited proposal from SES Government Solutions, and its
   industry teammates, Orbital Sciences Corporation (Orbital) and Science
   Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The program called for
   hosting of an Air Force furnished infrared sensor, developed by SAIC, on
   an SES commercial communications satellite, built by Orbital, and was
   appropriately referred to as CHIRP (Commercially Hosted Infra-Red
   Payload). This bold new effort has been a resounding success and has
   stimulated a whole new market area for hosted payloads that is now
   germinating throughout the aerospace industry.
   The concept of a staring sensor using large format focal plane arrays
   began as a risk reduction program by the Air Force Research Laboratory
   (AFRL). Under that program (the Alternate InfraRed Satellite System
   (AIRSS) or Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) program), SAIC
   developed a laboratory model of a full-earth, four-telescope staring
   Overhead Persistent InfraRed (OPIR) sensor for ground validation. For
   the CHIRP contract, but under the 3GIRS umbrella, SAIC designed and
   developed a space-qualified, one-quarter earth, single OPIR staring
   telescope for a technical demonstration in space. The satellite was
   built by Orbital Sciences as part of an existing commercial contract
   with SES. The sensor and satellite efforts were leveraged by the CHIRP
   program, integrating the government furnished equipment (GFE) sensor
   with the commercial SES-2 telecommunications satellite. The CHIRP
   program uses contractor ground system facilities and mission operations
   teams to operate and evaluate the CHIRP system, including sensor
   commanding, state-of-health monitoring, sensor calibration and
   characterization, and tracking algorithm assessment on the ground using
   on-orbit data. The satellite is operated by SES through its commercial
   satellite operations center (SOC). By design, CHIRP operations are
   completely independent of spacecraft operations except for initial
   deployments and CHIRP power on/off activities. Sensor commands are
   generated at SAIC's CHIRP Mission Analysis Center (CMAC) in Seal Beach,
   California, transmitted through Orbital's CHIRP Mission Operations
   Center (CMOC) in Dulles, Virginia, and uplinked to the spacecraft by the
   SES-operated teleport in Woodbine, Maryland. The CHIRP mission data is
   transmitted from the CHIRP payload through an Orbital-developed
   Secondary Payload Interface (SPI) on the spacecraft, where it is
   encrypted and transmitted to the ground through one of the commercial
   transponders. The ground entry point for the CHIRP data is a SES
   teleport, which transmits the data to the CMOC for dissemination in
   real-time to the CMAC and the U. S. Air Force's Advanced Fusion Center
   (AFC). The CMOC and CMAC are accredited to handle collateral classified
   data, while the SES facilities are commercial entities with no access to
   classified data.
   The CHIRP program is a truly ground breaking, but like many early
   endeavors had to overcome challenges along the way. However, at the end
   of the day, the CHIRP team:
   a) Space-qualified a ground-breaking wide-field-of-wiew (WFOV), OPIR
   sensor designed and developed by SAIC in two years on the 3GIRS program;
   b) Integrated the payload onto a commercial communications satellite
   platform, including all payload accommodations for heat, power, and
   commanding, and tested the payload within the commercial integration and
   testing (I\&T) flow;
   c) Launched and flew the sensor in space a little over three years from
   the start of the contract;
   d) Demonstrated the agility and flexibility of the commercially hosted
   payload concept, which included accommodating a payload development
   within commercial schedules;
   e) Delivered a sensor to orbit that was operational and performing its
   mission two days before the satellite arrived at its operational orbital
   location and within 24 hours of removal of the baffle cover;
   f) Proved that classified systems can be operated as a commercially
   hosted payload; and
   g) Showed that high quality commercial buses can support demanding
   optical missions.
   The CHIRP program uncovered and resolved several hosted payload-related
   challenges and pioneered solutions for future hosted payloads in areas
   ranging from contracts to space policy, weight/power/thermal
   accommodations, security and cultural differences between the commercial
   and government environments.
   The main take-away from this unique program is that by working closely
   together, with a common goal, both government and industry can benefit
   greatly from the hosted payload model.},

Abstract = {Atriplex nummularia has been extensively planted in Northern Africa to
   combat desertification. However, few studies evaluated the effectiveness
   of these interventions. This study aimed at assessing the dynamic
   performance of a number of Atriplex plantations located in the Marrakech
   province in terms of multitemporal dry biomass production. Three SPOT 5
   images (2004, 2008 and 2012) and field biomass measurements were
   integrated to quantify the dry biomass production dynamics of
   plantations established from 1996 to 2007. Different plant ages covered
   the whole plant life cycle curve. Vegetation indices were derived from
   the images and those of 2012 were coupled to the measured biomass of
   2012 to formulate biomass models. An analysis of shrub biomass
   production was conducted in plantations and in adjacent rangelands,
   covering varying degree of plant development, and an estimate of the
   economic benefits generated by the plantations in terms of available
   fodder biomass was performed. The results show that, on average, the
   plantation sites produced 221 to 361Mgha(-1) of dry biomass more than
   the surrounding rangelands. The best performing plantations yielded even
   greater differences, up to more than 7Mgha(-1). It was observed that the
   most performing plantations, while contributing to mitigating land
   degradation, have generated economic value and could compensate the
   economic cost of the intervention even under drought conditions.
   However, in several cases the plantation performance was far from
   sustainability, particularly due to poor management (early and/or over
   grazing), revealing that management is a critical factor for the success
   of this restoration practice. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Measuring the economic impact of tourism: the case of Lower and Upper
   Austria},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {289-297},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to demonstrate that the information content of
   a regional tourism satellite account (RTSA) is a very complex phenomenon
   and the complete impact of tourism is difficult to capture.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on the recommended
   framework for tourism satellite account-building and is concentrated on
   Lower and Upper Austria, two of the nine Austrian federal states. The
   RTSA provides an analytical framework of issues related to tourism
   economics and tourism policy as well as for model building, tourism
   growth analysis and productivity measurement.
   Findings - Considering only direct effects, calculations showed that
   tourism made around 3 1/2 per cent of the Upper Austrian gross regional
   product. In case of Lower Austria, the relevant figure was around 1
   percentage lower. Considering the direct and indirect effects, tourism
   contributed almost 6 per cent to the overall gross regional product of
   Upper Austria, and in Lower Austria, tourism contributed around 5 per
   cent to the overall gross regional product.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the first papers about
   considering (beside the direct effects) also the indirect effects of
   tourism and pointing out the true economic impact of tourism on the
   whole economy on a regional level.},

Title = {Assessment of biomass and yield loss of maize caused by aerosols in
   heavily polluted agricultural areas of China based on APSIM model},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid economic growth, the government and the
   public pay more and more attention to the environmental effects caused
   by aerosols. In this study, the effects of aerosols on the biomass and
   yield of maize from 2001 to 2014 in heavily polluted agricultural areas
   of China were explored using global AErosol Robotic Network (AERONET)
   monitoring data, the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the
   Solar Spectrum radiative transfer (6S) model, and the Agricultural
   Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop growth model. Beijing,
   Xianghe, and Taihu stations were selected as research areas. The results
   showed that the APSIM-maize model was able to accurately simulate the
   interactions between maize and the climatic constraints in the maize
   planting areas at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations. Our results
   revealed that the aerosols reduced direct solar radiation, and that the
   decreasing trend was mainly due to the net radiation flux caused by
   aerosols. The average total radiation from 2001 to 2014 at Beijing,
   Xianghe, and Taihu stations decreased by 31.95\%, 14.74\%, and 28.30\%,
   respectively, and the average maize biomass decreased by 34.12\%,
   20.78\%, and 28.41\%, respectively. As a result, the average maize yield
   at Beijing, Xianghe, and Taihu stations declined by 28.44\%, 13.43\%,
   and 14.89\%, respectively. Our findings, particularly the understanding
   of the effect of aerosols on crop production, will have important
   implications for improving climate change impact studies and helping
   local agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change. They
   could also benefit strategic decision-making related to future
   agricultural adaptation methods in China.},

Title = {Proximal sensing estimation of glyphosate injury on weeds in central
   Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Herbicide injury on weeds is quantified through responses such as
   mortality, biomass, and visual scores, which are time consuming and/or
   subjective, making it hard to evaluate injury in experiments and making
   the site-specific management impracticable in major crops. The objective
   of our work was to build prediction models of glyphosate injury on weed
   species of economic importance in the Brazilian Cerrado (savana) through
   multispectral digital images. Two weed species with different levels of
   susceptibility to glyphosate, Eleusine indica (L.) Pers. and Brachiaria
   decumbens L., were cultivated in pots and subjected to increasing doses
   of glyphosate, simulating a gradient of injury. Visual scores were given
   by three trained evaluators during three weeks after the application.
   Images of the pots were acquired with a digital multispectral camera in
   the following bands of the electromagnetic spectrum: blue (450 nm),
   green (560 nm), red (660 nm), and near-infrared (850 nm), with a digital
   camera at 0.9-m height from the ground. Images were first segmented to
   separate plant from soil using the hue-saturation- value color space.
   Vegetation indices were calculated and used as explanatory variables for
   phytotoxicity in regression models. A field experiment was conducted in
   order to validate predictions. The injury pattern of glyphosate on E.
   inidica and B. decumbens was best modeled by an exponential function of
   the median of hue for plant pixels, which could be reproduced at field
   scale with prediction errors below 8\%. Differences in sensitivity to
   glyphosate between the two species were detected with the kernel density
   of hue for plant pixels, with absolute correlation with phytotoxicity
   above 0.8. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Title = {Comparison of RS/GIS analysis with classic mapping approaches for siting
   low-yield boreholes for hand pumps in crystalline terrains. An
   application to rural communities of the Caimbambo province, Angola},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {22-31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In poverty-stricken regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, groundwater for
   supply is often obtained by means of hand pumps, which means that
   low-yield boreholes are acceptable. However, boreholes are often sited
   without sufficient hydrogeological information due to budget
   constraints, which leads to high failure rates. Cost-effective
   techniques for borehole siting need to be developed in order to maximize
   the success rate. In regions underlain by granite, weathered formations
   are usually targeted for drilling, as these are generally presented as a
   better cost-benefit ratio than the fractured basement. Within this
   context, this research focuses on a granite region of Angola. A
   comparison of two mapping techniques for borehole siting-groundwater
   prospect is presented. A classic hydrogeomorphological map was developed
   first based on aerial photographs, field mapping and a geophysical
   survey. This map represents a considerable time investment and was
   developed by qualified technicians. The second map (RS/GIS) is
   considerably simpler and more cost-effective. It was developed by the
   integration in a GIS platform of six maps of equal importance-slope,
   drainage density, vegetation vigor, presence of clay in the soil,
   lineaments and rock outcrops-prepared from Landsat 8 imagery and a
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Similar results were obtained in both
   cases. By means of a supervised classification of Landsat images, RS/GIS
   analysis allows for the identification of granitic outcrops, house
   clusters and sandy alluvial valleys. This in turn allows for the
   delineation of low-interest or contamination-prone areas, thus
   contributing additional qualitative information. The position of a well
   that is going to be powered by a handpump is chosen also upon social and
   local matters as the distance to the stakeholders, information that are
   not difficult to integrate in the GIS. Although the second map needs
   some field inputs (i.e. surveys to determine the thickness of the
   weathered pack), results show that RS/GIS analyses such as this one
   provide a valuable and cost-effective alternative for siting low-yield
   boreholes in remote regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the onset of a global pandemic, all the sectors have started to
   become heavily dependent on Information Technology to improve the
   standards and performance of their respective fields. Being of utmost
   importance to the day-to-day life of humans, shipping plays a major role
   in our everyday life. As it is the case with the other sectors shipping
   had become increasingly dependent on Information Technology. The use of
   satellite communication along with other sophisticated tools have
   improved the shipping sector with the latest technology improving the
   performance of ships and shipping as well.
   This study explores the possibilities of globally consistent
   connectivity and specialized analytics channels enabling shipping
   equipment vendors to sell add-on aftercare services such as remote
   real-time analytics of fuel use to aid compliance with emissions
   regulations. Web Companies assume that fibre-like connectivity should be
   as accessible at sea as it is in the home, so that shipping fleets,
   floating communities, and offshore operations can become more efficient,
   sustainable, and profitable. The main objective of this study is to
   investigate high throughput, low latency solutions enabling a digital
   transformation of operations at sea. Focusing on improving access to
   real time performance data, supporting environmental impact monitoring,
   improving the timeliness of tracking and crew scheduling in addition to
   enhancing customer experiences for cruise and yacht passengers, the
   capabilities enable user access to fast, flexible, secure connectivity
   as a standardized service. Beyond regulation, digital transformation
   enabled by reliable and flexible connectivity also promises to deliver
   major cost efficiencies to the maritime sector. Unlocking the capability
   for real-time data exchange between all equipment and ships in all
   locations, will empower crews to make management and optimisation
   decisions not only on their own vessel, but fleet-wide.
   These new and pending regulatory and non-regulatory drivers create a
   need for real-time collection and analysis of data in a secure and
   trustworthy format. Operators will need to find new ways to co-operate
   between ship and shore to transform fuel efficiency, which will require
   new technologies to ensure greater standardization, integration and
   communication of maritime data. Reliable, flexible connectivity will
   enable maritime shipping organizations to meet new challenges, but also
   get ahead by implementing their own transformative changes to benefit
   efficiency and profitability for years to come. Based at CINEC Sri
   Lanka, venturing into this Jetstream with expert solutions to cover a
   wide range of products and services throughout the life cycle of any
   vessel and technology - from 3D design and engineering to risk
   assessment and ship management this overall solution, based on
   Information Technology, will optimize the digitalization of the outlook
   of the global maritime industry.},

Abstract = {The International Water Management Institute's Data and Knowledge
   Storehouse Pathway (IWMIDSP) was launched in June 2004 meeting the need
   identified in the IWMI 2002-2004 MTP Project 1: ``Improved tools for
   assessment, accounting, planning and use of water resources for
   agriculture and food production.{''} Since then to now, IWMIDSP
   (http://www.iwmidsg.org) has evolved as a pathfinder in providing over 3
   terabyte of state-of-art value added remote sensing and GIS (RS/GIS)
   data and products of high scientific quality that are made available
   through online access for the global benchmark river basins, Nations,
   regions, and the entire World.
   The IWMIDSP has about 5 new registrations every day and currently (as on
   February 16, 2006) reaching a total permanent registrations of 1964 from
   over 50 Countries. Over last 1-year there has been, on an average, a
   constant stream of at least 2000 visitors from 70 Countries every month.
   To date, about 1.4 million hits have been recorded, 270,000 pages
   visited, and on an average 130 gigabytes of data downloaded every month.
   All data in IWMIDSP have accompanied by Meta data at international
   standard (FGDC). Our data users include students from leading
   Universities of the World, researchers from UN organizations, USGS,
   NASA, and National Institutions. Further the IWMIDSP link has been
   provided by over 50 web portals. The site has also been profiled by the
   World Health Organization, UN Human Settlement Program (UN HABITAT), and
   UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).
   The IWMIDSP generated maps were widely used to understand and inform
   Tsunami damage and rehabilitation immediately after Tsunami by the
   coordinating National Office (CNO)-a Sri Lankan Presidential initiative
   (http://www.iwmidsp.org/iwmi/info/tsunami asp). IWMIDSP hosted and
   disseminated real time Tsunami Response maps of Sri Lanka (an effort of
   IWMI and MapAction UK) to the world. These maps were not only popular
   with the non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) working in Sri Lanka,
   but were printed in a book (FAO, 2005) by FAO
   (www.fao.org/tsunami/environment/maps.html). The maps were also used in
   the ``Geographic Information Systems{''} chapter in an Australian school
   book (Easton et al., 2006) of which 40,000 copies were printed.
   The IWMIDSP data is instrumental in production of the first satellite
   sensor based Global Map of Irrigated Areas (GMIA;
   http://www.iwmigiam.org) and the South West Asia drought monitoring
   project (dms.iwmi.org).
   The IWMIDSP has been hailed as the ``best UN or similar GIS sites I have
   seen{''} by Keith Forbes of UN Economic Affairs Officer. Dr. John G.
   Lyon, Director of USEPA Las Vegas writes: ``I just cant say enough
   positive things about the site.... what is very striking to me, is...
   this is probably the very first time that all these great sources of
   data and information and decision support systems have made all their
   great work available free of charge and in formats that all can
   understand.... it is truly impressive...{''}. The outcome is that
   IWMIDSP has established itself as a unique one of its kind Global Public
   Good (GPG) data and knowledge spatial data gateway.},

Title = {Assessing the role of climate and resource management on groundwater
   dependent ecosystem changes in arid environments with the Landsat
   archive},

Abstract = {Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) rely on near-surface
   groundwater. These systems are receiving more attention with rising air
   temperature, prolonged drought, and where groundwater pumping captures
   natural groundwater discharge for anthropogenic use. Phreatophyte
   shrublands, meadows, and riparian areas are GDEs that provide critical
   habitat for many sensitive species, especially in arid and semi-arid
   environments. While GDEs are vital for ecosystem services and function,
   their long-term (i.e. similar to 30 years) spatial and temporal
   variability is poorly understood with respect to local and regional
   scale climate, groundwater, and rangeland management. In this work, we
   compute time series of NDVI derived from sensors of the Landsat TM, ETM
   +, and OLI lineage for assessing GDEs in a variety of land and water
   management contexts. Changes in vegetation vigor based on climate,
   groundwater availability, and land management in arid landscapes are
   detectable with Landsat. However, the effective quantification of these
   ecosystem changes can be undermined if changes in spectral bandwidths
   between different Landsat sensors introduce biases in derived vegetation
   indices, and if climate, and land and water management histories are not
   well understood. The objective of this work is to 1) use the Landsat 8
   under-fly dataset to quantify differences in spectral reflectance and
   NDVI between Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI for a range of vegetation
   communities in arid and semiarid regions of the southwestern United
   States, and 2) demonstrate the value of 30-year historical vegetation
   index and climate datasets for assessing GDEs. Specific study areas were
   chosen to represent a range of GDEs and environmental conditions
   important for three scenarios: baseline monitoring of vegetation and
   climate, riparian restoration, and groundwater level changes. Google's
   Earth Engine cloud computing and environmental monitoring platform is
   used to rapidly access and analyze the Landsat archive along with
   downscaled North American Land Data Assimilation System gridded
   meteorological data, which are used for both atmospheric correction and
   correlation analysis. Results from the cross-sensor comparison indicate
   a benefit from the application of a consistent atmospheric correction
   method, and that NDVI derived from Landsat 7 and 8 are very similar
   within the study area. Results from continuous Landsat time series
   analysis clearly illustrate that there are strong correlations between
   changes in vegetation vigor, precipitation, evaporative demand, depth to
   groundwater, and riparian restoration. Trends in summer NDVI associated
   with riparian restoration and groundwater level changes were found to be
   statistically significant, and interannual summer NDVI was found to be
   moderately correlated to interannual water-year precipitation for
   baseline study sites. Results clearly highlight the complementary
   relationship between water-year PPT, NDVI, and evaporative demand, and
   are consistent with regional vegetation index and complementary
   relationship studies. This work is supporting land and water managers
   for evaluation of GDEs with respect to climate, groundwater, and
   resource management. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Capturing variations in inundation with satellite remote sensing in a
   morphologically complex, large lake},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, with high
   morphological complexity from south to north. In recent years, the lake
   has experienced expansion and shrinkage processes over both short- and
   long-term scales, resulting in significant hydrological, ecological and
   economic problems. Exactly how and how rapidly the processes of spatial
   change have occurred in the lake during the expansion and shrinkage
   periods is unknown. Such knowledge is of great importance for
   policymakers as it may help with flood/drought prevention, land use
   planning and lake ecological conservation. In this study, we
   investigated the spatial-temporal distribution and changing processes of
   inundation in Poyang Lake based on Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-1B data from 2000 to 2011. A defined
   water variation rate (WVR) and inundation frequency (IF) indicator
   revealed the water surface submersion and exposure processes of lake
   expansion and shrinkage in different zones which were divided according
   to the lake's hydrological and topographic features. Regional
   differences and significant seasonality variability were found in the
   annual and monthly mean IF. The monthly mean IF increased slowly from
   north to south during January-August but decreased quickly from south to
   north during September-December. During the lake expansion period, the
   lake-type water body zone (Zone II) had the fastest expansion rate, with
   a mean monthly WVR value of 34.47\% in February-March, and was followed
   by the channel-type water body zone (Zone I) in March-May (22.47\%).
   However, during the lake shrinkage period, rapid shrinkage first
   appeared around the alluvial delta zones in August-October. The sequence
   of lake surface shrinkage from August to December is exactly opposite to
   that of lake expansion from February to July. These complex inundation
   characteristics and changing process were driven by the high temporal
   variability of the river flows, the morphological diversity of the
   benthic landforms and the patterns of water movement. These results
   provide a foundation for basic hydrological and ecological studies and
   are valuable for the conservation and management of water resources in
   Poyang Lake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Accurate and timely maps of tree cover attributes are important tools
   for environmental research and natural resource management. We evaluate
   the utility of Landsat 8 for mapping tree canopy cover (TCC) and
   aboveground biomass (AGB) in a woodland landscape in Burkina Faso. Field
   data and WorldView-2 imagery were used to assemble the reference
   dataset. Spectral, texture, and phenology predictor variables were
   extracted from Landsat 8 imagery and used as input to Random Forest (RF)
   models. RF models based on multi-temporal and single date imagery were
   compared to determine the influence of phenology predictor variables.
   The effect of reducing the number of predictor variables on the RF
   predictions was also investigated. The model error was assessed using
   10-fold cross validation. The most accurate models were created using
   multi-temporal imagery and variable selection, for both TCC (five
   predictor variables) and AGB (four predictor variables). The coefficient
   of determination of predicted versus observed values was 0.77 for TCC
   (RMSE = 8.9\%) and 0.57 for AGB (RMSE = 17.6 tons center dot ha(-1)).
   This mapping approach is based on freely available Landsat 8 data and
   relatively simple analytical methods, and is therefore applicable in
   woodland areas where sufficient reference data areavailable.},

Title = {Past and Future Changes of Land Use/Land Cover and the Potential Impact
   on Ecosystem Services Value of Damietta Governorate, Egypt},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This investigation aims to assess the changes of Land Use/Land Cover
   (LULC) and its impact on ecosystem services value in Damietta
   Governorate, Egypt. To fulfill this aim, Landsat data of TM5 in 2001,
   ETM in 2011 and OLI in 2021 were used. The Maximum Likelihood Classifier
   was employed to track the changes in LULC of the study area. Cellular
   automata (CA) and Markov model adopted from IDRISI software were used
   for accurate prediction of the LULC in 2031. The VALIDATE model in
   TerrSet was used to compare the predicted 2031 LULC with actual 2021
   LULC to assess the accuracy of the model. The Millennium Ecosystem
   Assessment was utilized to assess the value per unit area of land types.
   The results indicated that there was a noticeable change in different
   land cover classes during the duration 2001-2021. Results showed that
   there are decreases in the cultivated area and the bare area, meanwhile
   the urban area was increased. The cultivated area was remarkably
   decreased recording 548.2 km(2) (62.15\%) at 2001, 548.2 km(2) (55.79\%)
   at 2011 and 468.96 km(2) (53.16\%) at 2021 of the total study area.
   However, the percentage of urban area increased; reporting 65.69 km(2)
   (7.45\%), 124.57 km(2) (14.12\%), and 176.67 km(2) (20.03\%) at 2001,
   2011, and 2021, respectively. LULC analyses in 2031 showed an increase
   in the urban area by 2.8\% and a decrease in the cultivated area by
   7.2\%. The kappa index values are greater than 0.80, which shows a
   strong agreement between simulated and predicted LULC maps. The
   comprehensive index of Damietta Governorate ranges from 100 to 400. The
   ES that experienced positive ESV changes during the study period gives
   strength indicator for achieving the sustainable development of Damietta
   Governorate. To prevent further ecosystem degradation and to ensure the
   best possible delivery of ES, it is necessary to reduce the current
   drivers of LULC changes within the buildup in agricultural land. The
   study helps the local authorities to better understand the land use
   system and to develop an improved land use management strategies that
   manage the urban expansion and guarantee the ecological conservation.},

Title = {Revealing Annual Crop Type Distribution and Spatiotemporal Changes in
   Northeast China Based on Google Earth Engine},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) produces 1/4 of the grain and 1/3 of the
   commercial grain in China, and is essential for food security and a
   sustainable socio-ecological system development. However, long-term
   annual crop type distribution in this vital area remains largely
   unknown, compromising the scientific basis for planting structure
   adjustment and sustainable agriculture management. To this end, we
   integrated 111-dimensional MOD09A1 features, feature optimization and
   random forest algorithms on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to
   classify annual crop types in the NEC during 2000-2020, and adopted
   multi-source spatial data and geostatistical methods to reveal
   anthropogenic and natural characteristics of crop type changes. The
   results demonstrated that sample-based classification accuracies were
   84.73-86.93\% and statistics-based R-2 were 0.81-0.95. From 2000-2020,
   the sowing area of maize and rice increased by 11.92 x 10(6) ha
   (111.05\%) and 4.03 x 10(6) ha (149.28\%), whereas that of soybean and
   other crops decreased by 13.73 x 10(6) ha (-64.10\%) and 1.03 x 10(6) ha
   (-50.94\%), respectively. Spatially, maize expanded northwestward, rice
   expanded northeastward, and soybean demonstrated a south-north
   shrinkage. The soybean-to-maize shift was the main conversion type, and
   its area largely reduced from 8.68 x 10(6) ha in 2000-2010 to 4.15 x
   10(6) ha in 2010-2020. Economic comparative benefit and climate change
   jointly affected crop types in NEC. Higher-benefits maize and rice were
   mainly planted in more convenient areas with more population and closer
   to settlements, roads and waterways. The planting of maize and rice
   required higher temperature and precipitation, and climate change in the
   NEC provided favorable conditions for their expansion toward
   high-latitude areas. The crop type changes in the NEC have boosted
   economic benefits, but increased water-carbon-energy costs. Thus,
   effective measures such as subsidy policies, ecological compensation,
   and knowledge-exchange should be implemented to aid crop type and
   rotation adjustment and ensure food-ecological security.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variation of Evapotranspiration on Different Land
   Use/Cover in the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River Basin},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {The accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is essential
   to understanding the water cycle and land-atmosphere feedbacks in the
   Earth system. This study focused on the Inner Mongolia Reach of the
   Yellow River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid region. Although there
   are many remote sensing ET datasets, many of the ET algorithms have not
   considered the impact of soil moisture, especially in water-limited
   areas. In this paper, the new PT-JPL model, which incorporates soil
   moisture into ET simulation, is used to improve the accuracy of ET
   simulation in water-limited areas. The simulation value is evaluated
   using two Hobq Desert eddy-covariance towers and the
   Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PML-V2) dataset. The new PT-JPL model
   shows the most significant improvements in water-limited regions; the
   coefficient of determination can reach 0.826, and the RMSE can reduce to
   9.645 W/m(2). Soil evaporation is central to the actual ET increase in
   the study area. Implementing ecological restoration projects reduced the
   exposed area of land in the study area and reduced the rate of total ET
   effectively. Furthermore, the most advanced machine learning local
   interpretation algorithm-the TreeExplainer-based Shapley additive
   explanation (SHAP) method-was used to identify the driving factors of ET
   capacity under different land use types. Temperature, NDVI, and root
   zone soil moisture were the main environmental factors causing ET
   changes in different plants. Meanwhile, temperature and root zone soil
   moisture had a noticeable coupling effect, except for grassland.
   Furthermore, a threshold effect of temperature to ET was found, and the
   value is 25, 30, and 30 degrees C in the forest, grassland, and
   cropland, respectively. This study provides an essential reference for
   accurately describing the ET characteristics of arid and semi-arid
   regions to achieve the efficient management of water resources.},

Title = {Diagnosis of Nitrogen Nutrition in Sugar Beet Based on the

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Sugar beet is an important economic crop in Northwest China. In this
   area, efficient use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has become crucial due to
   decreased profits associated with both under- and oversupply relative to
   sugar beet requirements. Thus, fast and non-destruction diagnostic tools
   for estimating plant N status have an important role in reducing N
   inputs while maintaining sugar beet yield and qualify. The objective of
   our study was to quantify leaf color characterization of sugar beet with
   an inexpensive scanner and establish the relationship with yield, leaf
   nitrogen content (LNC), plant total nitrogen content (PTNC), chlorophyll
   content (CC), soil nitrate nitrogen content (SNNC) and soil plant
   analysis development (SPAD) readings in sugar beet. In 2017 and 2018,
   field experiments were conducted with five N treatments ranging from 0
   to 180 kg N ha(-1). The main results showed the following: The SPAD
   readings (SPR) and CC exhibited a significant or highly significant
   correlation (maximum = 0.70, P < 0.01), both of which reflected well the
   N nutrient status of the entire plant. Furtherly, a detailed association
   analysis revealed that there was a close relationship (maximum = - 0.63,
   P < 0.01) of LNC, SPR, PTNC, CC and yield with leaf color parameter
   Red/Blue (R/B), which was recommended as leaf color parameters for N
   diagnosis in sugar beet. In addition, based on the distribution of R/B
   value under different N rate, the yield was low with greater R/B value
   than 1.36 indicating an insufficient N supply, and with the R/B value
   was lower than 1.36, the theoretical yield reached its peak indicating
   an adequate supply of N fertilizer. To summarize, compared to the
   complicated and expensive of hyperspectral and other remote sensing
   technologies, scanned leaf image (SLI) processing technique was a
   simple, inexpensive and reliable method of determining sugar beet N
   status that has potential as a diagnostic tool for determining crop N
   requirement.},

Abstract = {High concentrations of PM2.5 are universally considered as a main cause
   for haze formation. Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial
   heterogeneity and influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations for
   regional air quality control and management. In this study, PM2.5 data
   from 2000 to 2015 was determined from an inversion of NASA atmospheric
   remote sensing images. Using geo-statistics, geographic detectors, and
   geo-spatial analysis methods, the spatio-temporal evolution patterns and
   driving factors of PM2.5 concentration in China were evaluated. The main
   results are as follows. (1) In general, the average concentration of
   PM2.5 in China increased quickly and reached its peak value in 2006;
   subsequently, concentrations remained between 21.84 and 35.08 g/m(3).
   (2) PM2.5 is strikingly heterogeneous in China, with higher
   concentrations in the north and east than in the south and west. In
   particular, areas with relatively high PM2.5 concentrations are
   primarily in four regions, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, Lower Yangtze River
   Delta Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Taklimakan Desert. Among them,
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region has the highest concentration of PM2.5. (3)
   The center of gravity of PM2.5 has generally moved northeastward, which
   indicates an increasingly serious haze in eastern China. High-value
   PM2.5 concentrations have moved eastward, while low-value PM2.5 has
   moved westward. (4) Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a
   significantly positive spatial correlation. The High-High PM2.5
   agglomeration areas are distributed in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain,
   Fenhe-Weihe River Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Jianghan Plain regions. The
   Low-Low PM2.5 agglomeration areas include Inner Mongolia and
   Heilongjiang, north of the Great Wall, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and
   Taiwan, Hainan, and Fujian and other southeast coastal cities and
   islands. (5) Geographic detection analysis indicates that both natural
   and anthropogenic factors account for spatial variations in PM2.5
   concentration. Geographical location, population density, automobile
   quantity, industrial discharge, and straw burning are the main driving
   forces of PM2.5 concentration in China.},

Abstract = {The scientific-technological development is essential for the sustained
   growth of our regions; the production of quality goods with high added
   value is an important step forward when compared with the production of
   raw materials. Computational Mechanics is an essential tool for the
   development of new technologies and for the optimization of the existing
   ones {[}1].
   The industry faces technological problems increasingly more complex, and
   the numerical simulation of those technological problems induces
   scientists to computational developments of eater complexity. Since
   technological decisions are reached based on the results provided by
   numerical models, is evident that these models have to be highly
   reliable. Therefore, it is essential that sophisticated modeling
   techniques are used; that highly qualified engineers develop models and
   that the results are validated experimentally using industrial or
   laboratory determinations {[}2].
   The examples used to illustrate this article are taken from real
   applications developed for industry: the structural verification of the
   communications satellite ARSAT-1 and the modeling of rock fracturing

Abstract = {Detailed knowledge of forest cover dynamics is crucial for many
   applications from resource management to ecosystem service assessments.
   Landsat data provides the necessary spatial, temporal and spectral
   detail to map and analyze forest cover and forest change processes. With
   the opening of the Landsat archive, new opportunities arise to monitor
   forest dynamics on regional to continental scales. In this study we
   analyzed changes in forest types, forest disturbances, and forest
   recovery for the Carpathian ecoregion in Eastern Europe. We generated a
   series of image composites at five year intervals between 1985 and 2010
   and utilized a hybrid analysis strategy consisting of radiometric change
   classification, post-classification comparison and continuous index- and
   segment-based post-disturbance recovery assessment. For validation of
   the disturbance map we used a point-based accuracy assessment, and
   assessed the accuracy of our forest type maps using forest inventory
   data and statistically sampled ground truth data for 2010. Our
   Carpathian-wide disturbance map achieved an overall accuracy of 86\% and
   the forest type maps up to 73\% accuracy. While our results suggested a
   small net forest increase in the Carpathians, almost 20\% of the forests
   experienced stand-replacing disturbances over the past 25 years. Forest
   recovery seemed to only partly counterbalance the widespread natural
   disturbances and clear-cutting activities. Disturbances were most
   widespread during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but some areas also
   exhibited extensive forest disturbances after 2000, especially in the
   Polish, Czech and Romanian Carpathians. Considerable shifts in forest
   composition occurred in the Carpathians, with disturbances increasingly
   affecting coniferous forests, and a relative decrease in coniferous and
   mixed forests. Both aspects are likely connected to an increased
   vulnerability of spruce plantations to pests and pathogens in the
   Carpathians. Overall, our results exemplify the highly dynamic nature of
   forest cover during times of socio-economic and institutional change,
   and highlight the value of the Landsat archive for monitoring these
   dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations in many areas of the Palearctic
   including the Iberian Peninsula have grown continuously over the last
   century. This increase has led to numerous different types of conflicts
   due to the damage these mammals can cause to agriculture, the problems
   they create in the conservation of natural areas, and the threat they
   pose to animal health. In the context of both wildlife management and
   the design of health programs for disease control, it is essential to
   know how wild boar are distributed on a large spatial scale. Given that
   the quantifying of the distribution of wild species using census
   techniques is virtually impossible in the case of large-scale studies,
   modeling techniques have thus to be used instead to estimate animals'
   distributions, densities, and abundances. In this study, the potential
   distribution of wild boar in Spain was predicted by integrating data of
   presence and environmental variables into a MaxEnt approach. We built
   and tested models using 100 bootstrapped replicates. For each replicate
   or simulation, presence data was divided into two subsets that were used
   for model fitting (60\% of the data) and cross-validation (40\% of the
   data). The final model was found to be accurate with an area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.79. Six
   explanatory variables for predicting wild boar distribution were
   identified on the basis of the percentage of their contribution to the
   model. The model exhibited a high degree of predictive accuracy, which
   has been confirmed by its agreement with satellite images and field
   surveys.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {This study investigated the spatial pattern evolution of the rural
   settlement system in the town of Menggang, China, based on settlement
   patches extracted from remote sensing data for four time points between
   1990 and 2018. Five typical villages were selected to study their
   spatial textures from point to surface. The reasons for the evolution of
   the rural settlements were examined as well. The results indicated that
   the number of settlement patches in Menggang decreased, the area of a
   single patch expanded, and the scale of the rural settlements continued
   to expand. Settlements were distributed randomly, but an agglomeration
   trend began to appear. The plain terrain had little restriction on
   settlement site selection. Cofferdams and embankments were the limiting
   factors for settlement expansion, which led to the compact development
   of the settlements. Economic development, population growth, and family
   miniaturization were positive factors for the expansion of the rural
   settlements. In the typical villages, cluster settlements and cluster
   settlements with a banded tendency had higher spatial utilization
   efficiency. Several high-density building centers were formed in the
   settlements, and the trend of residential buildings was mainly
   northeast-southwest. The plain terrain had little effect on the
   orientation of buildings, single-building areas, or the public spaces of
   the settlements. Traditional culture and traffic routes affected the
   orientation of the main buildings of folk houses. This study has
   theoretical and reference value for the structure optimization and
   sustainable development of rural settlements in the lower Yellow River
   plain.},

Title = {Reading Greenness in Urban Areas: Possible Roles of Phenological Metrics
   from the Copernicus HR-VPP Dataset},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Vegetation phenology is that branch of science that describes periodic
   plant life cycle events across the growing seasons. Remote sensing
   typically monitors these significant events by means of time series of
   vegetation indices, permitting to characterize vegetation dynamics. It
   is well known that vegetation in urban areas, i.e., green spaces in
   general, may benefit human health mainly by mitigating noise and air
   pollution, promoting physical or social activities, and improving mental
   health. Based on the influence that green space exposure seems to exert
   on Public Health and using a multidisciplinary approach, we mapped
   phenological behavior of urban green areas to explore yearly persistence
   of their potential favorable effect, such as heat reduction, air
   purification, noise mitigation, and promotion of physical/social
   activities and improvement of mental health. The study area corresponds
   to the municipality of Torino (about 800,000 inhabitants, NW, Italy).
   Renouncing to a rigorous at-species level phenological description, this
   work investigated macro-phenology of vegetated areas for the 2018, 2019
   and 2020 years with reference to the new free and open Copernicus HR-VPP
   dataset. Vegetation type, deduced with reference to the 2019 BDTRE
   official technical map of the Piemonte Region, was considered and
   related to the correspondent macro-phenology using a limited number of
   metrics from the HR-VPP dataset. Investigation was aimed at exploring
   their capability of providing synthetic and easy-to-use information for
   urban planners. No validation was achieved about phenological metrics
   values (assuming their accuracy correspondent to the nominal one
   reported in the associated manuals). Nevertheless, a spatial validation
   was operated to investigate the capability of the dataset to properly
   recognize vegetated areas, thus providing correspondent metrics.
   Preliminary results showed a spatial inconsistency related to the HR-VPP
   dataset, that greatly overestimates (about 50\%) vegetated areas in the
   city, assigning metric values to pixels that, if compared with technical
   maps, do not fall within vegetated areas. The work found out that, among
   HR-VPP metrics, LOS (Length Of Season) and SPROD (Seasonal Productivity)
   well characterized vegetation patches, making it possible to clearly
   read vegetation behavior, which can be effectively exploited to zone the
   city and make management of green areas and real estate considerations
   more effective.},

Title = {Reexamining supply chain integration and the supplier's performance
   relationships under uncertainty},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-78},
Abstract = {Purpose - Effective and efficient supply chain coordination requires the
   integration of all product flow processes. However, inconsistent
   empirical results have been obtained with respect to the relationships
   between supply chain integration (SCI) and performance. Drawing on
   efficiency-flexibility arguments, this paper seeks to develop a SCI
   model that includes buyer-supplier-supplier relationships, and proposes
   a contingency framework for reexamining the SCI-supplier performance
   relationship under demand and technological uncertainties.
   Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage data collection process was
   conducted, and a total of 878 suppliers that listed in the Taiwanese
   ``Center-Satellite Production System{''} with supply contract were
   contacted for this study. Finally 164 suppliers were gathered and
   screened as valid responses. Hierarchical regression analysis was used
   to test the hypotheses in this study.
   Findings - Evidence indicates that SCI has a significant positive effect
   on the suppliers' performance. The positive SCI-performance relationship
   can be moderately weakened by demand uncertainty; however, this positive
   SCI-performance relationship will be strengthened by technological
   uncertainty.
   Originality/value - While supply chain management is needed to manage
   the vertical and horizontal relationships simultaneously, this study
   offers a framework to solve efficiency-flexibility dilemma arguments
   when dealing with ``exploitation{''} and ``exploration{''} alternatives
   to help to reexamine the inconsistent SCI-performance relationship.
   Furthermore, based on transaction cost theory, this paper takes the
   nature of uncertainty into account for improving the theoretical
   background of the SCI-performance relationship arguments. Empirical
   results indicate the existence of an ambidextrous supply chain
   integration strategy which justifies the choice of which one is
   preferable in efficiency-flexibility dilemma arguments.},

Abstract = {Landslides are natural disasters that have resulted in the loss of
   economies and lives over the years. The landslides caused by the 2005
   Muzaffarabad earthquake heavily impacted the area, and slopes in the
   region have become unstable. This research was carried out to find out
   which areas, as in Muzaffarabad district, are sensitive to landslides
   and to define the relationship between landslides and geo-environmental
   factors using three tree-based classifiers, namely, Extreme Gradient
   Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
   These machine learning models are innovative and can assess
   environmental problems and hazards for any given area on a regional
   scale. The research consists of three steps: Firstly, for training and
   validation, 94 historical landslides were randomly split into a
   proportion of 7/3. Secondly, topographical and geological data as well
   as satellite imagery were gathered, analyzed, and built into a spatial
   database using GIS Environment. Nine layers of landslide-conditioning
   factors were developed, including Aspect, Elevation, Slope, NDVI,
   Curvature, SPI, TWI, Lithology, and Landcover. Finally, the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve
   (AUC) value were used to estimate the model's efficiency. The area under
   the curve values for the RF, XGBoost, and KNN models are 0.895 (89.5\%),
   0.893 (89.3\%), and 0.790 (79.0\%), respectively. Based on the three
   machine learning techniques, the innovative outputs show that the
   performance of the Random Forest model has a maximum AUC value of 0.895,
   and it is more efficient than the other tree-based classifiers.
   Elevation and Slope were determined as the most important factors
   affecting landslides in this research area. The landslide susceptibility
   maps were classified into four classes: low, moderate, high, and very
   high susceptibility. The result maps are useful for future generalized
   construction operations, such as selecting and conserving new urban and
   infrastructural areas.},

Abstract = {This research is aimed at designing, implementing, and testing a
   geospatial database for wind and solar energy applications in the
   Kingdom of Bahrain. All decision making needed to determine economic
   feasibility and establish site location for wind turbines or solar
   panels depends primarily on geospatial feature theme information and
   non-spatial (attribute) data for wind, solar, rainfall, temperature and
   weather characteristics of a particular region. Spatial data includes,
   but is not limited to, digital elevation, slopes, land use, zonings,
   parks, population density, road utility maps, and other related
   information. Digital elevations for over 450,000 spot at 50 m spatial
   horizontal resolution plus field surveying and GPS (at selected
   locations) was obtained from the Surveying and Land Registration Bureau
   (SLRB). Road, utilities, and population density are obtained from the
   Central Information Organization (CIO). Land use zoning, recreational
   parks, and other data are obtained from the Ministry of Municipalities
   and Agricultural Affairs. Wind, solar, humidity, rainfall, and
   temperature data are obtained from the Ministry of Transportation, Civil
   Aviation Section. LandSat Satellite and others images are obtained from
   NASA and online sources respectively. The collected geospatial data was
   georeferenced to Ain el-Abd UTM Zone 39 North, 3D Digital Elevation
   Model (DEM)-50 m spatial resolutions was created using SLRB spot
   elevations. Slope and aspect maps were generate based on the DEM.
   Supervised image classification to identify open spaces was performed
   utilizing satellite images. Other geospatial data was converted to
   raster format with the same cell resolution. Non-spatial data are
   entered as an attribute to spatial features. To eliminate ambiguous
   solution, multi-criteria GIS model is developed based on, vector
   (discrete point, line, and polygon representations) as well as raster
   model (continuous representation). The model was tested at the Al-Areen
   proposed project, a relatively small area (15 km(2)). Optimum site
   spatial location for the location of wind turbines and solar panels was
   determined and initial results indicates that the combination of wind
   and solar energy would be sufficient for the project to meet the energy
   demand at the present per capita consummation rate..},

   930.6 km(3) from 1980 to 2020. Therefore, there is a total lakes and
   reservoirs area of 120359.5 km(2), but only accounting for 1.25\% of
   China's land area. Although the area of lakes and their proportion of
   land area are very limited, lakes play a vital role in ensuring the
   ecological civilization construction and promoting the economic and
   social development of the basin. Unfortunately, the importance and
   ecological service values of lakes are seriously underestimated and lack
   the real quantification. Therefore, this study systematically explores
   and quantifies the importance and ecological services of lakes in China
   from seven different perspectives.
   First, lakes are the most and the best centralized drinking water
   sources (CDWSs) contributing 40.6\% of the CDWSs vs. river (30.8\%) and
   groundwater (28.6\%), and act as the backbone of the safety of drinking
   water in China based on 1093 CDWSs from 340 prefecture-level cities and
   55 county-level cities (population >= 1 million). Second, lakes have
   important regulation and storage functions and play a key role in flood
   control and drought resistance. Based on the national lake survey data,
   the total amount of water regulation of natural lakes (>= 1 km(2)) is
   close to 150 km(3). Meanwhile, the joint operation of the Yangtze River
   Basin in 2021 indicated a total regulation capacity of 106.6 km(3) and a
   total flood control capacity of about 69.5 km(3) of 47 control
   reservoirs. Third, lake basins play an important role in the national
   economic development and food security. Of China's nine major commercial
   grain production areas, seven are located in Jianghuai lakes zone and
   northeast plain lake zone. Fourth, lakes are one of the richest
   biodiversity ecosystems on earth. Among the 62 international important
   wetlands in China, there are 26 lake wetlands including Lake Poyang,
   Lake Dongting, Lake Qinghai etc accounting for 41.9\%. Fifth, lake
   fishery plays an important role in China's fishery production evidenced
   by China Fishery Statistical Yearbook 2021, which showed that the
   aquaculture area of lakes was 2186662 hectares, accounting for 42.7\% of
   the national freshwater aquaculture area and 30.8\% of the national
   aquaculture area in 2019. Sixth, lakes have important tourism value and
   contribute to beautiful business cards of many cities. Among the 45
   national tourist resorts in China, there are 15 lakes tourist resorts,
   accounting for one third, highlighting the rich tourism value resources
   of lakes. Seventh, lakes are an important part of the northern
   ecological security barrier. Lake Hulunhu, Lake Wuliangsuhai, Lake
   Daihai, Lake Qinghaihu, Lake Bositenghu, and Lake Aibihu act as the key
   nodes of northern ecological security barrier. In addition, lakes play a
   big role in energy storage and power generation, agricultural
   irrigation, inland navigation, carbon sequestration and pollution
   reduction and regional climate regulation.
   Large numbers of lakes with different types are widely distributed
   throughout China exhibiting obvious regional differentiation. Moreover,
   lakes are facing many ecological and environmental problems which reduce
   their value of providing ecological services. Specifically,
   eutrophication and cyanobacteria bloom have not been fundamentally
   alleviated, which threats the water quality safety of lake drinking
   water sources. The aquatic vegetation of the lakes is seriously
   degraded, which weaken their purification capacity and reduce their
   biodiversity. The synergistic effects of rapid climate change and
   intense human activities cause either lake flooding, shrinkage or
   salinization. Warm and humid climate results in a rapid expansion of the
   lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, which significantly increase the risk of
   glacial lake outburst. Aiming the above-mentioned ecological and
   environmental problems, this study puts forward the strategies and
   countermeasures for lake protection and management including lake-basin
   system studies, scientific regulation of water resources, cyanobacteria
   bloom early warning and control, national lake ecological restoration
   project, basin industrial structure upgrading, and lake protection
   legislation, which will promote the improvement of lake environmental
   and the construction of beautiful lakes.},

Title = {UAV to Inform Restoration: A Case Study From a California Tidal Marsh},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Monitoring of environmental restoration is essential to communicate
   progress and improve outcomes of current and future projects, but is
   typically done in a very limited capacity due to budget and personnel
   constraints. Unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in a
   variety of natural and human-influenced environments and have been found
   to be time- and cost-efficient, but have not yet been widely applied to
   restoration contexts. In this study, we evaluated the utility of UAVs as
   an innovative tool for monitoring tidal marsh restoration. We first
   optimized methods for creating high-resolution orthomosaics and
   Structure from Motion digital elevation models from UAV imagery by
   conducting experiments to determine an optimal density of ground control
   points (GCPs) and flight altitude for UAV monitoring of topography and
   new vegetation. We used elevation models and raw and classified
   orthomosaics before, during, and after construction of the restoration
   site to communicate with various audiences and inform adaptive
   management. We found that we could achieve 1.1 cm vertical accuracy in
   our elevation models using 2.1 GCPs per hectare at a flight altitude of
   50 m. A lower flight altitude of 30 m was more ideal for capturing
   patchy early plant cover while still being efficient enough to cover the
   entire 25-hectare site. UAV products were valuable for several
   monitoring applications, including calculating the volume of soil moved
   during construction, tracking whether elevation targets were achieved,
   quantifying and examining the patterns of vegetation development, and
   monitoring topographic change including subsidence, erosion, and creek
   development. We found UAV monitoring advantageous for the ability to
   survey areas difficult to access on foot, capture spatial variation,
   tailor timing of data collection to research needs, and collect a large
   amount of accurate data rapidly at relatively low cost, though with some
   compromise in detail compared with field monitoring. In summary, we
   found that UAV data informed the planning, implementation and monitoring
   phases of a major landscape restoration project and could be valuable
   for restoration in many habitats.},

Title = {Are Patagonia grasslands being overgrazed? A response to Marino et al.
   (2020)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2399-2405},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based upon primary productivity estimates, Oliva et al. (2019) concluded
   that, at the end of last century and after long periods of overgrazing,
   Patagonia's domestic stocks adjusted to regional-scale herbivore
   carrying capacity. Populations of guanaco, a native camelid, increased
   thereafter, driving combined grazing pressures once again over carrying
   capacity in some areas. Marino et al. (2020) argued that grazing is not
   really at equilibrium because domestic stocks are concentrated in areas
   that remain overgrazed. They support the ideas that guanaco density is
   auto-regulated by resource-defence territoriality, and that guanacos are
   weak competitors with domestic stock, occupying only marginal areas. In
   their view, Oliva et al. (2019) put guanacos in the role of scapegoats,
   leaving domestic stocks unchecked. Equilibrium at regional scale does
   not preclude overgrazing and under-grazing at local scales. By
   separating areas with and without domestic stocks, Marino et al. (2020)
   estimated overgrazing at 28\% in Chubut Province and 73\% in Santa Cruz
   Province. Our recalculations show 28\% and 47\% domestic overgrazing,
   respectively. However, when combined with guanaco densities, these
   increase to 48\% for Chubut and 108\% for Santa Cruz. We question the
   hypothesised lack of competitive value and efficient self-regulating
   mechanisms that would prevent guanaco populations from overshooting
   carrying capacity. A dataset of 13 sheep farms showed mean density of 26
   +/- 3.8 guanacos/km(2)and high combined grazing pressures. This was also
   observed in a protected area of Chubut that reached 42 guanacos/km(2)and
   crashed during drought, with 60\% mortality. Thereafter, guanacos
   increased to 70 guanacos/km(2), with recruitment rates that showed a
   complex response of density dependence but remained relatively elevated
   at densities above the estimated carrying capacity. Synthesis and
   applications. Marino et al. (2020) are right to question the apparent
   equilibrium of domestic stocks that are concentrated in areas that may
   be still overgrazed. But ground data show that guanaco populations have
   inefficient density population regulation and can reach densities well
   over carrying capacity, even in the presence of sheep. This does not
   mean that the main control should be on growing guanaco populations but
   it stresses our conclusion that joint management of the native-domestic
   herbivore system is urgently needed. Joint management can be effected
   through local plans, as current guanaco management permits can only be
   issued in areas that are not overgrazed by sheep. Farm management plans
   may in this way transform an apparent competitor into a valuable
   resource, complementary to sheep raising.},

Title = {Predictive distribution models applied to satellite tracks: modelling
   the western African winter range of European migrant Black Storks
   Ciconia nigra},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {152},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-118},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Predictive distribution models generally use data from multiple
   individuals each associated with a unique observation location, coupled
   with environmental parameters, to define the overall suitable area where
   the species could occur. Whether the use of multiple locations from few
   individuals is similarly efficient to model species distribution is not
   yet known. If so, the method could bring valuable inputs to identify
   priority conservation areas for rare or elusive species, especially
   those large vertebrates tracked with telemetry. Satellite tracking of
   long-distance migrants often produces numerous locations of surveyed
   individuals across their wintering ranges. We examined such wintering
   tracks to test if the wintering locations obtained from few tracked
   individuals could be useful to model the full species wintering range,
   using habitat suitability models. We aimed at predicting the wintering
   distribution of West European Black Storks Ciconia nigra. We used tracks
   of 9 storks, retaining one location per winter day per individual for a
   total of 972 different locations. Combined with bioclimatic and land
   cover data in habitat suitability modelling within an ensemble forecast
   framework, we obtained a probabilistic distribution which largely
   matched the previously reported wintering range of the species in
   western and central Africa. Using tracks of the six individuals with
   more than 100 locations each, we obtained a distribution range closely
   matching the nine-bird range. A range similar to the nine-bird range
   could be predicted by models using data from less numerous individuals
   and by considering a lower threshold value. Habitat suitability models
   using wintering record locations of satellite-tracked migrant birds can
   therefore help to get a better picture of the wintering distribution
   range, and hence provide more accurate information for conservation
   planning on African wintering grounds.},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover are essential in all
   environmental aspects. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of LST
   and vegetation abundance is beneficial to investigate the microclimate
   studies of an urban area. In urban areas, vegetation is an essential
   element in flourishing microclimate and outdoor thermal consolation. Due
   to unplanned rapid urbanization and lack of proper management, the
   vegetation cover in Rangpur City Corporation (RpCC) are decline day by
   day. The vegetation covers are declined in fast-growing city like RpCC
   and it is leading to more sensible heat than the normal heat flux. This
   study focused on the relationship between LST and vegetation cover of
   the RpCC area of different periods and how they affect the regional
   microclimate. Through this research has also been evaluate the impacts
   of reducing the vegetation cover on the microclimate conditions in the
   study area. To fulfil the aim of the study, satellite imageries of the
   year 2021 (Operational Landsat), 2017 (Operational Landsat), 2009 and
   (Thematic mapper), 2000 (Thematic mapper) were processed using ArcGIS
   10.5 software. From the satellite imageries, normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) and LST have been estimated to show the relation
   between LST and vegetation in RpCC and ANN (Artificial neural network)
   model was developed to predict the value of LST and NDVI after 7 years,
   particularly to the year 2028 based on datasets from 2000 to 2021. The
   linear regression analysis provides the inverse relationship between LST
   and vegetation in the study area that explains that due to urban growth
   materials, the amount of vegetation has been decreased, leading to
   increased surface temperature during 2000-2021. The developed ANN model
   using obtained data sets of LST and NDVI of RpCC predicts that the value
   of LST and NDVI till the year 2028 will not be changed so much compared
   to the previous 21 years (2000-2021). The highest LST may occur 32.71
   degrees c in the year 2028 whereas the predicted highest NDVI value has
   been observed 0.57 which is not so sufficient in controlling LST in the
   city. However, more amount forestation is needed to minimize the effects
   of LST to make the city comfortable for the inhabitants including flora
   and fauna and others process as well like as cultivation, fishing,
   farming, etc.},

Abstract = {The landslide susceptibility of a region is important for socioeconomic
   considerations and engineering applications. Thus, an automated system
   for mapping of landslide susceptibility could be of significant benefit
   for society. In this paper, a knowledge-based landslide susceptibility
   zonation (LSZ) system has been proposed. The system consists of input,
   understanding, expert, and output modules. The input module accepts
   thematic images of contributing factors for landslides. The
   understanding module interprets input images to extract relevant
   information as required by the expert module. The expert module consists
   of knowledge base and inference strategy to categorize a region into
   different landslide intensities. Finally the output module provides a
   LSZ map. It is a pixel-based system and provides output having the scale
   same as that of the input maps. The system has been tested to prepare a
   landslide susceptibility map for the Tehri-Garhwal region in India's
   lower Himalayas, and further validated with studies for two other
   different regions. The proposed system provides output commensurate with
   that provided by experts. The categories of hazard zones have a
   discrepancy as little as 6.2\% in high hazard zones and near to 1.5\%
   and 4\% in moderate and low hazard zones, respectively. The high hazard
   zones in the LSZ maps from the proposed system are supersets of that
   obtained by experts (i.e., the proposed system provides safer LSZ map).
   Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed system can be used for
   preparation of LSZ maps. In the future, the methodology may be extended
   for real time assessment and prediction of landslide hazards.},

Abstract = {The Global Positioning System (CPS) and Personal Communication Services
   (PCS) satellites are both information system technologies applicable to
   the mobile user. GPS, which was developed by the United States military,
   is one of the most successful dual-use systems. The size of the military
   GPS user equipment market currently is only a small fraction of the
   civilian market. GPS enables accurate timing, positioning, and
   navigation capabilities on a worldwide basis, whereas PCS satellites
   also enable worldwide communications. In the past, commercial GPS user
   sets have been integrated with digital maps and computer databases
   (yellow pages) to enable user situational awareness. For example, this
   type of implementation has been integrated into auto navigation systems.
   However, in many applications, the user requires time-evolving
   environmental data for enhanced situational awareness. For example, the
   automobile navigator would like information on traffic patterns,
   accidents, and road construction Since the user is mobile, he needs a
   driver information service supplied through a wireless data link.
   In the past, we have proposed Personal Navigation Service (PNS) as
   wireless PCS tailored to the mobile consumer/navigator.
   Military battlefield planners and participants have similar types of
   requirements for situational awareness involving both navigation and
   wireless data communication. Current world political situations require
   an effective military network centric global grid, which maximizes
   information superiority for the US and our allies. Shared communication
   links and the PVT (position, velocity and time) strengths of GPS create
   many opportunities (many yet to be conceived) for improved mission
   effectiveness.
   There is a compelling opportunity for a complementary space-based Navcom
   satellite architecture to meet the needs of both the military and
   civilian users. Global civil Navcom systems for air, rail, road traffic
   and infrastructure management (among many others) parallel many aspects
   of military Navcom systems for battlefield awareness inside the zones of
   armed conflict. Agreed upon overlapping elements of constituent civil
   and military navigation and communication systems can be integrated into
   a common infrastructure. Open system PNS standards illustrate some of
   these shared architecture concepts {[}1].
   With a dual-use system, there are several issues, which need to be
   resolved.
   (1) Can a cost-effective Navcom Sat system be developed that meets all
   of the requirements of both military and civilian users?
   (2) Why should the military consider dual-use?
   (3) Why should the civilian sector consider dual-use?
   (4) Can dual-use be developed without compromising military performance,
   availability, and security?
   (5) How does dual-use benefit the military as well as the civilian
   sector?
   (6) Why should navigation service and communication services be
   integrated on the same satellite system?
   This paper will address these questions as well as identify many issues
   associated with dual-use, integrated Navcom, and propose solutions to
   those issues.},

Abstract = {The rating of biodiversity in and and semiarid regions on the basis of
   ecological function and genetic traits of adaptation to severe
   environmental stresses produces significantly higher values, than that
   based solely on the commonly applied structural criteria of forms of
   life and levels of organization. The indirect driving forces of
   biodiversity impoverishment listed in the Global Biodiversity Strategy
   that are particularly effective in and and semi-arid regions are (a)
   population growth, (b) economic systems and policies that fail to value
   the environment and its natural resources; (c) inequity in the
   ownership, management and flow of benefits from both the use and
   conservation of biological resources;, and (d) weakness in legal and
   institutional systems. The most effective direct human impacts are (a)
   habitat destruction and fragmentation, (b) overexploitation of
   biological resources, (c) biological invasion, and (d) agriculture. The
   problem in and and semiarid regions, particularly in developing
   countries, is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge and awareness, the
   paucity of research, and the diminishing number of competent
   systematists.
   This paper discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of each of
   the indirect driving forces, and the direct human impacts on
   biodiversity, and reviews case studies related to these impacts, with
   special reference to those carried out in and and semiarid regions.
   These studies include monitoring of the human impact on land cover by
   remote sensing, effects of landuse on species diversity, impact of
   habitat fragmentation by summer resorts on coastal dunes, consequences
   of protection from grazing on biodiversity, comparison of biodiversity
   in nature reserves and the traditional hema system with that of nearby
   territories, and the impact of desertification on animal life and
   endangered species. Case studies also include the tools applied for
   biodiversity conservation in and and semiarid lands with special
   emphasis on endangered species, restoration of degraded habitats and
   their biodiversity, the significance of nature reserves and captive
   breeding, the importance of conserving the populations below the species
   level throughout their geographical range of distribution, and ecotonal
   biodiversity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Title = {Combining Tourism Economic Account and Tourism Employment Module for a
   best measurement of tourism at a sub-national level},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {99-113},
Abstract = {For more than 15 years, the World tourism organization and other major
   multilateral organizations have worked on the development of reliable
   tools for assessing tourism related to others economic activities in a
   country: the tourism satellite account. Its implementation at a
   sub-national level is a challenging endeavour and requires going beyond
   this framework. A regional tourism economic account is a good answer to
   the demand for regional tourism economic data and to highlight the
   problematic of employment with a tourism employment module. This
   combination sheds a new light on the role of tourism in creating,
   preserving and diversifying jobs in the economy. We developed a regional
   tourism economic account (RTEA), based on the supply-side, in order to
   take advantage of the existence a system of regional accounts and to
   respond to the lack of domestic tourism data. All these developments
   have been applied in a French overseas region, Reunion Island. The
   results show their feasibility. The others ultra-peripheral regions of
   European Union, others European islands and more generally small island
   tourism economies can benefit from this experience, (i.e. all regions in
   which a system of regional account has been implented). (C) 2016 Varna

Abstract = {The Census of Marine Life was a 10-year, international research effort
   to explore poorly known ocean habitats and conduct large-scale

   live in the oceans, and what will live in the ocean. Many of the
   findings and techniques from census research may prove valuable in
   making a transition, which many governments have publicly endorsed, from
   single-species fisheries management to more holistic ecosystem
   management. Census researchers sampled continental margins, mid-Atlantic
   ridges, ocean floor vents and seeps, and abyssal plains and polar seas
   and organized massive amounts of past and new information in a public
   online database called the Ocean Biogeographic Information System
   (www.iobis.org). The census described and categorized seamount biology
   worldwide for its vulnerability to fishing, advanced large-scale animal
   tracking with acoustic arrays and satellite archival tags, and
   accelerated species identification, including nearshore, coral reef, and
   zooplankton sampling using genetic barcoding and pyrotag sequencing for
   microbes and helped to launch the exciting new field of marine
   environmental history. Above all, the census showed the value of
   investing in large-scale, collaborative projects and sharing results

Title = {Application of novel hybrid model for land subsidence susceptibility

Abstract = {Land subsidence (LS) is one of the challenging geo-hazards in several
   regions of the world that is mainly caused by the overexploitation of
   groundwater and subsequent collapse of underground cavities. The
   prediction of LS is difficult due to limitations in monitoring, proper
   surveys, and knowledge related to the functioning and behaviour of the
   phenomenon. The application of remote sensing (RS) and global
   positioning system (GPS) for the proper location identification of LS in
   the ground and its implementation in susceptibility mapping can help to
   better constrain this geohazard. However, proper LS susceptibility maps
   to identify LS prone areas and to mitigate this problem in a way are
   generally lacking. Several methodologies have been developed for
   preparing LS susceptibility maps through RS techniques coupled with
   statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Furthermore, different
   regions have unique natural and anthropogenic causes for the occurrence
   of LS, such as subsidence due to groundwater over-exploitation, road
   construction, consolidation of alluvial soil, mining activities, and so
   forth, resulting in severe economic losses. The LS susceptibility
   mapping (LSSM) can help to prevent natural and human catastrophes and
   reduce the economic damages. ML techniques are becoming increasingly
   proficient at modelling such occurrences and have wide application in
   LSSM. This study compares the performances of single and hybrid ML
   models to predict and map the susceptible areas prone to LS. A
   combination of several algorithms helps to improve the overall results.
   In order to achieve this, the gradient-boosting machine-evolutionary
   genetic algorithm (GBM-EG) was adopted in this study for LS assessment
   and compared to three algorithms, namely random forest, artificial
   neural networks, and alternating decision tree, that stand as commonly
   used benchmarks. This case study on LSSM was carried out in the
   Abozidabad watershed, Isfahan Province, Iran, and a total of 155 LS
   locations were identified by using GPS. Measures of 12 conditioning
   factors were compiled for each of the sites. These data were input into
   the models in five different training-to-validation configurations of
   sample ratios: D1 (90\%:10\%), D2 (80\%:20\%), D3 (70\%:30\%), D4
   (60\%:40\%), and D5 (50\%:50\%). The performance of the algorithms were
   evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic curve and seed cell
   area index (SCAI). The results show that the best area under curve value
   (0.989) and SCAI value were achieved by the GBM-EG hybrid model in an
   80:20 ratio. The results demonstrate that LSSMs can be effectively
   produced to support planning and land use for management decisions.},

Abstract = {The vegetation cover of northern Australia ranges from open forest or
   woodland savanna (dominated by eucalypts over a range of highly
   flammable annual and perennial grasses) to hummock and tussock
   grasslands occupying sandy and fertile fine-textured soils. Like
   monsoonal eastern Indonesia, the major fire period occurs over the long
   dry season, typically between April/May-October/November. People light
   fires for a range of land management purposes; lightning strikes cause
   relatively few fires at the start of the annual wet season. Based on
   regional mapping of fires from satellite imagery (mostly NOAA-AVHRR and
   LANDSAT) from the 1980s, we can identify two broad patterns concerning
   the application of fire in northern Australia. In northwestern and
   northern Australia, and possibly also on parts of Cape York in the
   northeast, intense wild fires typically late in the dry season burn vast
   tracts annually. Ecological studies indicate that such fire regimes are
   having catastrophic impacts on native fire-sensitive species,
   communities, and habitats. Conversely, elsewhere across northern
   Australia but especially on more productive pastoral lands, the
   restricted application/absence of burning is in some cases leading to
   native and exotic woody species thickening/invading, likewise with
   profound ecologic and economic consequences. Growing recognition of
   these issues has led to the development of collaborative fire management
   programs in various parts of northern Australia. Similar cooperative
   approaches involving practitioners from northern Australia working with
   relevant parties in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea would bring
   significant benefit to the study of regional landscape management
   issues.},

Title = {Soil erosion and sediment yield assessment using RUSLE and GIS-based
   approach in Anjeb watershed, Northwest Ethiopia},

Abstract = {Soil erosion is a serious and continuous environmental problem in
   Ethiopia. Lack of land use planning, environmental protection,
   over-cultivation, and overgrazing are prominent causes of erosion and
   sedimentation. This study is conducted in Anjeb watershed located in the
   Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. In this study, the quantity and
   distribution of soil erosion, sediment delivery ratio (SDR), and
   sediment yield of the watershed were assessed by employing remote
   sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and revised universal soil
   loss equation analysis capabilities. Important data sets of topography,
   soil, conservations practices, cover management, and rainfall factors
   were processed and superimposed in GIS analysis, and soil loss rate,
   SDR, and sediment yield of the watershed were derived. Based on the
   result found, the watershed was categorized into six classes of erosion:
   slight (0-5), moderate (5-10), high (10-15), very high (15-30), severe
   (30-50), and very severe (>50) t ha(-1) yr(-1). The estimated average
   annual soil loss was 17.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The soil loss rate is higher
   in the steeper and topographically dissected part of the watershed. The
   average sediment delivery capacity was about 0.122. The result showed
   that the average sediment yield in the watershed was grouped into
   classes of low (<2.5), moderate (2.5-7.5), high (7.5-12.5), very high
   (12.5-22.5), severe (22.5-40), and very severe (>40) t ha(-1) yr(-1). It
   is found that from a total of 20,125.5 t yr(-1) eroded soil over the
   whole watershed 2254.5 t yr(-1) of sediment has been brought and
   deposited to the channels. Sediment accumulation from the watershed
   threatens the storage capacity and life span of Anjeb reservoir which is
   the source of irrigation water downstream. The study provides an insight
   to planners and resource managers to design and implement practices of
   watershed management to reduce erosion and enhance land productivity and
   to minimize the reservoir sediment accumulation.
   Article Highlights
   center dot The soil loss in the watershed ranges between 0 and 195 t
   ha(-1) yr(-1)

Abstract = {Coral reefs are a vital component of coastal and marine ecosystems. They
   are now under strong environmental challenges and are being harmed by
   human activities and rising sea surface temperatures, which are reducing
   the living coral cover. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the
   mapping accuracy of coral covers using PlanetScope satellite pictures
   with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method surrounding Cu Lao Xanh
   Island in Binh Dinh province. To adjust for the sunglint effect, the
   bands were corrected using the Hedley technique. After that, the
   Depth-Invariant Index technique was utilized to reduce the influence of
   the water column, and the ANN algorithm was employed for mapping. Hard
   coral, soft coral, seagrass, deep water, and bare bottom were identified
   as the five kinds of benthic habitat. The accuracy of the classification
   results was assessed using field data collected on May 10 and 11, 2022.
   The results indicated that the artificial neural network (ANN) technique
   had a higher accuracy, with a total classification accuracy of 89.55\%
   and a kappa value of 0.87. Cu Lao Xanh's coral area is around 68
   hectares, with soft corals mostly found west and southwest of the island
   and hard corals in the east. This finding demonstrates that Planetscope
   satellite imagery is effective at monitoring shallow coral reefs on
   small islands, providing a scientific foundation and reliable data for
   the development of a more comprehensive coral reef ecological monitoring
   and management.},

Title = {Estimation of Soil Erosion and Sediment Yield in the Lancang-Mekong
   River Using the Modified Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and GIS

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The Lancang-Mekong River basin, as an important transboundary river in
   Southeast Asia, is challenged by rapid socio-economic development,
   especially the construction of hydropower dams. Furthermore, substantial
   factors, such as terrain, rainfall, soil properties and agricultural
   activity, affect and are highly susceptible to soil erosion and sediment
   yield. This study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in terms
   of spatial distribution and sediment deposition by using the revised
   universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and GIS techniques. This study also
   applied remote sensing and available data sources for soil erosion
   analysis. Annual soil erosion in most parts of the study area range from
   700 to 10,000 t/km(2)/y with a mean value of 5350 t/km(2)/y.
   Approximately 45\% of the total area undergoes moderate erosion.
   Moreover, the assessments of sediment deposition and erosion using the
   modified RUSLE and the GIS techniques indicate high sediment erosion
   along the flow direction of the mainstream, from the upper Mekong River
   to the Mekong Delta. The northern part of the upper Mekong River and the
   central and southern parts of the lower Mekong River are the most
   vulnerable to the increase in soil erosion rates, indicating sediment
   deposition.},

Abstract = {Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations are one of the most important
   economic forest in tropical area. Retrieving leaf area index (LA!) and
   its dynamics by remote sensing is of great significance in ecological
   study and production management, such as yield prediction and
   post-hurricane damage evaluation. Thirteen HJ-1A/1B CCD images, which
   possess the spatial advantage of Landsat TM/ETM+ and 2-days temporal
   resolution of MODIS, were introduced to predict the spatial-temporal LAI
   of rubber plantation on Hainan Island by Nonlinear AutoRegressive
   networks with exogenous inputs (NARX) model. Monthly measured LAIs at 30
   stands by LAI-2000 between 2012 and 2013 were used to explore the LAI
   dynamics and their relationship with spectral bands and seven vegetation
   indices, and to develop and validate model. The NARX model, which was
   built base on input variables of day of year (DOY), four spectral bands
   and weight difference vegetation index (WDVI), possessed good accuracies
   during the model building for the data set of training (N = 202, R-2 =
   0.98, RMSE = 0.13), validation (N = 43, R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.24) and
   testing (N = 43, R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 031), respectively. The model
   performed well during field validation (N = 24, R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.24)
   and most of its mapping results showed better agreement (R-2 =
   0.54-0.58, RMSE = 0.47-0.71) with the field data than the results of
   corresponding stepwise regression models (R-2 = 0.43-0.51, RMSE =
   0.52-0.82). Besides, the LAI statistical values from the spatio-temporal
   LAI maps and their dynamics, which increased dramatically from late
   March (2.36 +/- 0.59) to early May (3.22 +/-. 0.64) and then gradually
   slow down until reached the maximum value in early October (4.21 +/-
   0.87), were quite consistent with the statistical results of the field
   data. The study demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of
   retrieving spatio-temporal LAI of rubber plantations by an artificial
   neural network (ANN) approach, and provides some insight on the
   application of HJ-IA/1B CCD images, and data and methods for
   productivity study of rubber plantation in future. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the development of an
   optimal design framework for high altitude long endurance solar unmanned
   aerial vehicle. The proposed solar aircraft design framework provides a
   simple method to design solar aircraft for users of all levels of
   experience. Design/methodology/approach This design framework consists
   of algorithms and user interfaces for the design of experiments,
   optimization and mission analysis that includes aerodynamics,
   performance, solar energy, weight and flight distances. Findings The
   proposed sizing method produces the optimal solar aircraft that yields
   the minimum weight and satisfies the constraints such as the power
   balance, the night time energy balance and the lift coefficient limit.
   Research limitations/implications - The design conditions for the sizing
   process are given in terms of mission altitudes, flight dates, flight
   latitudes/longitudes and design factors for the aircraft configuration.
   Practical implications - The framework environment is light and easily
   accessible as it is implemented using open programs without the use of
   any expensive commercial tools or in-house programs. In addition, this
   study presents a sizing method for solar aircraft as traditional sizing
   methods fail to reflect their unique features.
   Social implications - Solar aircraft can be used in place of a satellite
   and introduce many advantages. The solar aircraft is much cheaper than
   the conventional satellite, which costs approximately \$200-300m. It
   operates at a closer altitude to the ground and allows for a better
   visual inspection. It also provides greater flexibility of missions and
   covers a wider range of applications.
   Originality/value This study presents the implementation of a function
   that yields optimized flight performance under the given mission
   conditions, such as climb, cruise and descent for a solar aircraft.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem fragmentation is being recognized as an important
   characteristic of landscapes, with numerous implications on its
   ecological and socio-economic valuation, and for the sustainable
   management of forest and natural resources in general. Particularly in
   regions where the population pressure on natural resources is heavy, and
   where the natural and man-influenced ecosystems are highly vulnerable,
   monitoring of landscape pattern provides valuable insight in and
   indicators of ecological landscape development. Pattern is a relatively
   complicated and multi-dimensional characteristic of landscape. Among the
   constituting agents are number of vegetation classes considered, number,
   size, shape, and relative and absolute spatial arrangement of the single
   patches, as is the scale (spatial resolution, level of detail) with
   which the landscape pattern is analysed. If an analysis shall go beyond
   a merely narrative and descriptive approach, indexes are frequently
   employed to quantitatively characterize the landscape pattern. These
   indexes are calculated from one or more measurable attributes. Usually,
   those indexes are derived on the basis of complete maps produced from
   remote sensing imagery and GIS analysis, and assuming that segmentation
   and classification of the imagery has been made with a high level of
   accuracy. Relatively little has been published on how to possibly
   estimate landscape pattern from sample surveys. This paper discusses the
   potential of sample surveys to produce estimates of some aspects of the
   fragmentation status of a landscape, where forest and non-forest are
   used as example classes. Sample based indexes can be derived from
   different sampling and plot designs, where area and perimeter length are
   attributes that can most easily be estimated. However, not all
   attributes interesting for landscape pattern description can be
   estimated from samples. We present a method that gives a metric, which
   is related to mean patch size. Sample-based approaches have some
   interesting properties: some analysis of pattern can be done in the
   absence of complete maps, and also for historic inventory data, when
   neither maps nor imagery are available. The proposed analysis of
   estimating a mean patch size related metric could easily be done with
   common forest inventory plot designs, where no additional measurements
   are required. This may make it interesting for ``time series{''} using
   old forest inventory data.},

Title = {A review of drought monitoring with big data: Issues, methods,
   challenges and research directions},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over recent years, the frequency and intensity of droughts have
   increased and there has been a large drying trend over many parts of the
   world. Consequently, drought monitoring using big data analytic has
   gained an explosive interest. Droughts stand among the most damaging
   natural disasters. It threatens agricultural production, ecological
   environment, and socio-economic development. For this reason, early
   warning, accurate evaluation, and efficient prediction are an emergency
   especially for the nations that are the most menaced by this danger.
   There are numerous emerging studies addressing big data and its
   applications in drought monitoring. In fact, big data handle data
   heterogeneity which is an additive value for the prediction of drought,
   it offers a view of the different dimensions such as the spatial
   distribution, the temporal distribution and the severity detection of
   this phenomenon. Big data analytic and drought are introduced and
   reviewed in this paper. Besides, this review includes different studies,
   researches and applications of big data to drought monitoring.
   Challenges related to data life cycle such as data challenges, data
   processing challenges and data infrastructure management challenges are
   also discussed. Finally, we conclude that big data analytic can be
   beneficial in drought monitoring but there is a need for statistical and
   artificial intelligence-based approaches.},

Title = {An adaptive method for identifying marine areas of high conservation
   priority},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1436-1447},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation is particularly
   challenging in the marine environment due to the open and dynamic nature
   of the ocean, the paucity of information on species distribution, and
   the necessary balance between marine biodiversity conservation and
   essential supporting services such as seafood provision. We used the
   Patagonian seabird breeding community as a case study to propose an
   integrated and adaptive method for delimiting key marine areas for
   conservation. Priority areas were defined through a free
   decision-support tool (Marxan) that included projected at-sea
   distributions of seabirds (approximately 2,225,000 individuals of 14
   species); BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for
   pelagic bird species; and the economic costs of potential regulations in
   fishing practices. The proposed reserve network encompassed
   approximately 300,000 km(2) that was largely concentrated in northern
   and southern inshore and northern and central offshore regions. This
   reserve network exceeded the minimum threshold of 20\% conservation of
   the abundance of each species proposed by the World Parks Congress.
   Based on marine currents in the study area, we further identified the 3
   primary water masses that may influence areas of conservation priority
   through water inflow. Our reserve network may benefit from enhanced
   marine productivity in these highly connected areas, but they may be
   threatened by human impacts such as marine pollution. Our method of
   reserve network design is an important advance with respect to the more
   classical approaches based on criteria defined for one or a few species
   and may be particularly useful when information on spatial patterns is
   data deficient. Our approach also accommodates addition of new
   information on seabird distribution and population dynamics, human
   activities, and alterations in the marine environment.},

Title = {Tree-Related Microhabitats Are Promising Yet Underused Tools for
   Biodiversity and Nature Conservation: A Systematic Review for
   International Perspectives},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Sustainable management of forest ecosystems requires the use of reliable
   and easy to implement biodiversity and naturalness indicators.
   Tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) can fulfill these roles as they
   harbor specialized species that directly or indirectly depend on them,
   and are generally more abundant and diverse in natural forests or
   forests unmanaged for several decades. The TreM concept is however still
   recent, implying the existence of many knowledge gaps that can challenge
   its robustness and applicability. To evaluate the current state of
   knowledge on TreMs, we conducted a systematic review followed by a
   bibliometric analysis of the literature identified. A total of 101
   articles constituted the final corpus. Most of the articles (60.3\%)
   were published in 2017 or after. TreM research presented a marked lack
   of geographical representativity, as the vast majority (68.3\%) of the
   articles studied French, German or Italian forests. The main themes
   addressed by the literature were the value of TreMs as biodiversity
   indicators, the impact of forest management on TreMs and the factors at
   the tree- and stand-scales favoring TreMs occurrence. Old-growth and
   unmanaged forests played a key role as a ``natural `` forest reference
   for these previous themes, as TreMs were often much more abundant and
   diverse compared to managed forests. Arthropods were the main phylum
   studied for the theme of TreMs as biodiversity indicators. Other more
   diverse themes were identified, such as restoration, remote sensing,
   climate change and economy and there was a lack of research related to
   the social sciences. Overall, current research on TreMs has focused on
   assessing its robustness as an indicator of biodiversity and naturalness
   at the stand scale. The important geographical gap identified
   underscores the importance of expanding the use of the TreMs in other
   forest ecosystems of the world. The notable efforts made in recent years
   to standardize TreM studies are an important step in this direction. The
   novelty of the TreM concept can partially explain the thematic knowledge
   gaps. Our results nevertheless stress the high potential of TreMs for
   multidisciplinary research, and we discuss the benefits of expanding the
   use of TreMs on a larger spatial scale.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the problem of student engagement in the modern
   educational space. Based on the analysis of the works of Russian and
   foreign authors, it is shown that engagement is considered as a process,
   as condition, as a mechanism, as a situation, as an investment of time
   and energy in the performed activity. There are also various approaches
   to understanding the structure of engagement, its types, forms, levels,
   indicators and diagnostic criteria. The most studied is the behavioral
   side of engagement, the least studied are the mechanisms of the
   formation of involvement and its management.
   The authors proposed a systemic anthropological psychology as a
   methodological basis for the study of student engagement, the
   foundations of which were laid in the works of Tomsk scientists (V.E.
   Klochko, E.V. Galazhinsky, O.M. Krasnoryadtseva, O.V. Lukyanov). In this
   vein, the concordance between the person and the environment is
   considered as the main mechanism for the formation of engagement. The
   measure of compliance is the ``resource of engagement{''} of a person,
   which includes instrumental and value and meaning characteristics. The
   instrumental component includes various aspects of self- regulation of
   activity in a changing environment, the value and meaning component is
   the value and meaning dimension of the objective conditions of activity.
   The resource of engagement determines the fundamental possibility of
   including a person in an environment with specific characteristics.
   The authors conducted an empirical study of the ``resource of
   engagement{''} of students of two large universities in the Russian Far
   East; the sample consisted of 498 people. As a result of the factor
   analysis of the data, the dimensions of the concordance between the
   student and the educational environment were identified. These are
   subjective disorganization of activity (impossibility of performing
   activities in an environment with the specific parameters); flexibility
   and readiness for change (orientation towards activities in a changing
   environment); willingness to take responsibility (focus on own forces
   and resources); result orientation (experience of pleasure in achieving
   specific results); willingness to work in conditions of uncertainty;
   selfishness (self-dependence and focus on gaining benefits); focus on
   the labor process (without taking into account its goals and working
   conditions). For each option, the directions of psychological assistance
   aimed at increasing the academic and social involvement of students in
   the educational space are determined.},

Abstract = {Climate change is directly related to our livelihoods and needs to be
   studied in order to form mitigation and adaptation policies. Climate
   change is a global phenomenon and poses diverse implications in form and
   type for different ecologies. Human activities are greatly disturbing
   the nature through using the land for different types of anthropogenic
   activities like cultural, financial matters, environmental aspects. land
   policy and land development plans. The present study aims to analyze the
   climatic variation and assess the land use change of district Bahawalpur
   having total area of 24,830 km(2). Climatic data (minimum temperature,
   maximum temperature and rainfall) were collected for a period of 30
   years (1989-2018). Monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature, annual
   rainfall, Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) and their anomalies were
   calculated using secondary data for the study area. Land use data were
   collected in the form of Landsat satellite images of last 30 years
   (1990-2019) with 10 yeas interval from different online sources. Landsat
   ETM and ETM + satellite imagery were processed in ArcGIS software.
   Results showed that there is a great variation in maximum temperature
   anomaly during the entire study period. Minimum temperature anomaly
   shows positive and negative trend during the entire study period from
   1989 to 2019. There is a great variation in DTR anomaly during the study
   period. 10-years moving average of DTR anomaly remained positive during
   most of the time. There is variation in annual rainfall anomaly, with
   both positive and negative values. As in the whole time span of 30
   years, built-up land increased from 2.54\% (631 Km(2)) in 1990 to 4.66\%
   (1,157 Km(2)) at the end of 2019. Agricultural land use also increased
   from 3,439 Km(2) (13.85\%) to 5,168 Km(2) (20.81\%). Forest land use
   decreased from the 1,321 Km2 (5.32\%) to 775 Km(2) (3.12\%) at end of
   2019. Water occupied land with the high fluctuation was 109 Km(2)
   (0.44\%) in 1990 and in 2019 it recorded 148 Km(2) (0.60\%). The main
   land use class desert land also decreased from an area of 19,330 Km(2)
   (77.85\%) to 17,582 Km(2) (70.81\%). Correlation of land use change
   classes in last 30 years showed relationship intensity between different
   land use changes. Agricultural land and built up land have strong
   relationship with the value of 0.98. Desert land and agricultural land
   have strongly negative relationship with the value of -0.94. This study
   found how rapidly changes occurred in the land use with rate of land use
   change is a mile stone for the planners, researchers and scholars for
   the better understanding towards land use change in district Bahawalpur.},

Abstract = {Biological limit reference points (LRPs) for fisheries catch represent
   upper bounds that avoid undesirable population states. LRPs can support
   consistent management evaluation among species and regions, and can
   advance ecosystem-based fisheries management. For transboundary species,
   LRPs prorated by local abundance can inform local management decisions
   when international coordination is lacking. We estimated LRPs for
   western Pacific leatherbacks in the U.S. West Coast Exclusive Economic
   Zone (WCEEZ) using three approaches with different types of information
   on local abundance. For the current application, the best-informed LRP
   used a local abundance estimate derived from nest counts, vital rate
   information, satellite tag data, and fishery observer data, and was
   calculated with a Potential Biological Removal estimator. Management
   strategy evaluation was used to set tuning parameters of the LRP
   estimators to satisfy risk tolerances for falling below population
   thresholds, and to evaluate sensitivity of population outcomes to bias
   in key inputs. We estimated local LRPs consistent with three
   hypothetical management objectives: allowing the population to rebuild
   to its maximum net productivity level (4.7 turtles per five years),
   limiting delay of population rebuilding (0.8 turtles per five years), or
   only preventing further decline (7.7 turtles per five years). These LRPs
   pertain to all human-caused removals and represent the WCEEZ
   contribution to meeting population management objectives within a
   broader international cooperative framework. We present multi-year
   estimates, because at low LRP values, annual assessments are prone to
   substantial error that can lead to volatile and costly management
   without providing further conservation benefit. The novel approach and
   the performance criteria used here are not a direct expression of the
   ``jeopardy{''} standard of the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but they
   provide useful assessment information and could help guide international
   management frameworks. Given the range of abundance data scenarios
   addressed, LRPs should be estimable for many other areas, populations,
   and taxa.},

Title = {Large Scale Flood Risk Mapping in Data Scarce Environments: An
   Application for Romania},
Journal = {WATER},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Large-scale flood risk assessment is essential in supporting national
   and global policies, emergency operations and land-use management. The
   present study proposes a cost-efficient method for the large-scale
   mapping of direct economic flood damage in data-scarce environments. The
   proposed framework consists of three main stages: (i) deriving a water
   depth map through a geomorphic method based on a supervised linear
   binary classification; (ii) generating an exposure land-use map
   developed from multi-spectral Landsat 8 satellite images using a
   machine-learning classification algorithm; and (iii) performing a flood
   damage assessment using a GIS tool, based on the vulnerability
   (depth-damage) curves method. The proposed integrated method was applied
   over the entire country of Romania (including minor order basins) for a
   100-year return time at 30-m resolution. The results showed how the
   description of flood risk may especially benefit from the ability of the
   proposed cost-efficient model to carry out large-scale analyses in
   data-scarce environments. This approach may help in performing and
   updating risk assessments and management, taking into account the
   temporal and spatial changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.},

Abstract = {Around the world, vast improvements in public transportation methods in
   urban environments have been made. However, in densely populated areas,
   the bicycle remains a very useful means of transportation. Its small
   size and minimal environmental impact are the critical factors that
   maintain its relevance. Moreover, the advancement of connected devices
   and sharing-based services have allowed private vendors to develop
   bike-sharing programs, giving millions access to bike transportation
   around the globe. These bike-sharing programs rely on the user to check
   out and return the bike to a designated bike-holding station. With the
   growth of Internet of Things (IoT) services and wirelessly connected
   devices, there is a major benefit in enabling vendors to track their
   bicycle assets. Satellite navigation has come a long way, however, it
   requires a large power overhead. This paper proposes an energy-efficient
   bicycle tracking system that utilizes bicycle powered Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BLE) beacons and Long Range (LoRa) type base-stations in order
   to track and maintain a real-time location-based inventory of all
   assets. The BLE beacons are used to track individual bicycle assets
   based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) proximity and the
   LoRa base stations exploit longer range communication capabilities to
   transmit asset location information between each other, for added
   management capabilities. Preliminary proximity estimations using BLE
   beacons in an urban outdoor environment show promising results with
   proximity accuracy consistently under 2 meters.},

Abstract = {Adaptation and resilience practitioners lack guidance on how to
   understand and manage extreme climate risk using the data available. We
   present a methodological framework to integrate the satellite as well as
   location based data sets to estimate extreme climate risk. The
   framework, in detail, has been demonstration using a study carried out
   to quantify extreme rainfall risks in India incorporating the influence
   of global (large scale oscillations) as well as local factors
   (population, infrastructure, economic activity) in a probabilistic
   model. We use nonstationary extreme value theory along with Bayesian
   uncertainty analysis to model the time varying influence of oscillations
   such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, and North
   Atlantic Oscillation in augmenting high rainfall risks in 637 districts
   across 29 states of India. It is found that at least 50\% of the
   districts in 8 out of 29 states are at high risk. Extreme risk is
   observed in 198 (similar to 31\%) and 249 (similar to 39\%) districts
   caused by heavy downpour and extremely long wet spells, respectively.
   This study provides a framework to identify local implications of global
   factors and is aimed at supporting policy makers in framing extreme
   rainfall-induced disaster risk reduction strategies.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Health Status of Indonesian Watersheds Using
   Impervious Surface Area as an Indicator},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Impervious surfaces affect the ecosystem function of watersheds.
   Therefore, the impervious surface area percentage (ISA\%) in watersheds
   has been regarded as an important indicator for assessing the health
   status of watersheds. However, accurate and frequent estimation of ISA\%
   from satellite data remains a challenge, especially at large scales
   (national, regional, or global). In this study, we first developed a
   method to estimate ISA\% by combining daytime and nighttime satellite
   data. We then used the developed method to generate an annual ISA\%
   distribution map from 2003 to 2021 for Indonesia. Third, we used these
   ISA\% distribution maps to assess the health status of Indonesian
   watersheds according to Schueler's criteria. Accuracy assessment results
   show that the developed method performed well from low ISA\% (rural) to
   high ISA\% (urban) values, with a root mean square difference value of
   0.52 km(2), a mean absolute percentage difference value of 16.2\%, and a
   bias of -0.08 km(2). In addition, since the developed method uses only
   satellite data as input, it can be easily implemented in other regions
   with some modifications according to differences in light use efficiency
   and economic development in each region. We also found that 88\% of
   Indonesian watersheds remain without impact in 2021, indicating that the
   health status of Indonesian watersheds is not a serious problem.
   Nevertheless, Indonesia's total ISA increased significantly from 3687.4
   km(2) in 2003 to 10,505.5 km(2) in 2021, and most of the increased ISA
   was in rural areas. These results indicate that negative trends in
   health status in Indonesian watersheds may emerge in the future without
   proper watershed management.},

Title = {Oceanographic habitat of an endangered Mediterranean procellariiform:
   Implications for marine protected areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) require ecologically meaningful designs
   capable of taking into account the particularities of the species under
   consideration, the dynamic nature of the marine environment, and the
   multiplicity of anthropogenic impacts. MPAs have been most often
   designated to protect benthic habitats and their biota. Increasingly,
   there is a need to account for highly mobile pelagic taxa, such as
   marine birds, mammals and turtles, and their oceanic habitats. For
   breeding seabirds foraging from a central place, particular attention
   should be paid to distant foraging grounds and movement corridors, which
   can often extend to hundreds of kilometers from breeding colonies. We
   assessed the habitat use by the most threatened Mediterranean seabird,
   the Balearic Shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus, using vessel-based
   surveys during the chick-rearing period (May June). We used a
   hierarchical modeling approach to identify those environmental variables
   that most accurately reflected the oceanographic habitat of this species
   by (1) delineating its foraging range using presence/absence data and
   (2) identifying important foraging grounds where it concentrates in
   dense aggregations. The foraging range comprised the frontal systems
   along the eastern Iberian continental shelf waters (depth < 200 m) and
   areas close to the breeding colonies in the Balearic Islands.
   Shearwater's aggregated in productive shelf areas with elevated
   chlorophyll a concentrations. Following the model of a core-buffer MPA,
   we envisioned those areas of dense aggregation (i.e., the area of
   influence of the Ebro River discharge and Cape La Nao regions) as the
   core regions deserving elevated protection and more stringent
   management. More diffuse protective measures would be applied within the
   larger buffer region, delineated by the foraging range of the species.
   Marine zoning measures can greatly benefit the conservation of the
   Balearic Shearwater and other far-ranging seabirds by extending
   protective measures beyond their breeding colonies during both the
   breeding and nonbreeding seasons.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Erosion is the main cause of soil and water degradation, which
   demands investments for the recovery of such natural resources. The
   purpose of this paper is to quantify and spatialize soil losses in a
   municipality with large areas of monoculture of sugarcane.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Universal Soil Loss Equation was
   applied for the identification of areas susceptible to erosion in the
   municipality of Jahu, SP, Brazil. Soil maps, statistical census data
   from Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, radar images from
   SRTM, rainfall data from Fatec-Jahu hydrometeorological station and
   digital satellite images from Landsat 5 TM were used for the analyses.
   Four basic parameters were evaluated: topography of the terrain,
   rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and soil use and management
   factors. The analyses were conducted in the Geographic Information
   System (ArcView software).
   Findings - The results show most of the municipality (91 percent)
   consists of areas of erosion potential. However, the remaining 9 percent
   can potentially produce 40 percent of the sediment load, which indicates
   the need for conservation practices and environmental recovery for a
   reduction in the erosion process acceleration.
   Originality/value - In view of the expansion of sugarcane culture in the
   cities of Sao Paulo, the results show the importance of a master plan
   for new areas of sugarcane planting and the need for restoration of
   riparian vegetation in the surrounding streams and springs for the
   reduction of erosion.},

Title = {Geological methane emissions and wildfire risk in the degraded
   permafrost area of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains, China},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {With global warming, the carbon pool in the degradation zone of
   permafrost around the Arctic will gradually be disturbed and may enter
   the atmosphere in the form of released methane gas, becoming an
   important factor of environmental change in permafrost areas. We
   selected the northwestern section of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains in China
   as the study area, located in the degradation zone on the southern
   margin of the permafrost region in Eurasia, and set up multiple study
   monitoring areas equipped with methane concentration sensors, air
   temperature sensors, pore water pressure sensors and soil temperature
   sensors for long-term monitoring of data changes using the high-density
   electrical method, ground penetrating radar and on-site drilling to
   survey the distribution of frozen soil and geological conditions in the
   study area, combined with remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 L1C and
   unmanned aerial vehicle photographs and three-dimensional image
   reconstruction, analysis of fire activities and related geological
   environmental factors. The results show that since 2004, the permafrost
   thickness of the marsh wetland in the study area has gradually reduced
   and the degradation rate obviously accelerated; the organic matter and
   methane hydrate (metastable methane hydrate and stable methane hydrate)
   stored in the permafrost under the marsh wetland are gradually entering
   the atmosphere in the form of methane gas. Methane emissions show
   seasonal changes, and the annual methane emissions can be divided into
   three main stages, including a high-concentration short-term emission
   stage (March to May), a higher-concentration long-term stable emission
   stage (June to August) and a higher-concentration short-term emission
   stage (September to November); there is a certain correlation between
   the change in atmospheric methane concentration and the change in
   atmospheric pressure and pore water pressure. From March to May every
   year (high-concentration short-term emission stage), with snow melting,
   the air humidity reaches an annual low value, and the surface methane
   concentration reaches an annual high value. The high concentration of
   methane gas entering the surface in this stage is expected to increase
   the risk of wildfire in the permafrost degradation area in two ways
   (increasing the regional air temperature and self-combustion), which may
   be an important factor that leads to a seasonal wildfire frequency
   difference in the permafrost zone of Northeast China and Southeast
   Siberia, with the peak in spring and autumn and the monthly maximum in
   spring. The increase in the frequency of wildfires is projected to
   further generate positive feedback on climate change by affecting soil
   microorganisms and soil structure. Southeastern Siberia and northeastern
   China, which are on the southern boundary of the permafrost region of
   Eurasia, need to be targeted to establish fire warning and management
   mechanisms to effectively reduce the risk of wildfires.},

Title = {Both real-time and long-term environmental data perform well in
   predicting shorebird distributions in managed habitat},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Highly mobile species, such as migratory birds, respond to seasonal and
   interannual variability in resource availability by moving to better
   habitats. Despite the recognized importance of resource thresholds,
   species-distribution models typically rely on long-term average habitat
   conditions, mostly because large-extent, temporally resolved,
   environmental data are difficult to obtain. Recent advances in remote
   sensing make it possible to incorporate more frequent measurements of
   changing landscapes; however, there is often a cost in terms of model
   building and processing and the added value of such efforts is unknown.
   Our study tests whether incorporating real-time environmental data
   increases the predictive ability of distribution models, relative to
   using long-term average data. We developed and compared distribution
   models for shorebirds in California's Central Valley based on high
   temporal resolution (every 16 days), and 17-year long-term average
   surface water data. Using abundance-weighted boosted regression trees,
   we modeled monthly shorebird occurrence as a function of surface water
   availability, crop type, wetland type, road density, temperature, and
   bird data source. Although modeling with both real-time and long-term
   average data provided good fit to withheld validation data (the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or AUC, averaged
   between 0.79 and 0.89 for all taxa), there were small differences in
   model performance. The best models incorporated long-term average
   conditions and spatial pattern information for real-time flooding (e.g.,
   perimeter-area ratio of real-time water bodies). There was not a
   substantial difference in the performance of real-time and long-term
   average data models within time periods when real-time surface water
   differed substantially from the long-term average (specifically during
   drought years 2013-2016) and in intermittently flooded months or
   locations. Spatial predictions resulting from the models differed most
   in the southern region of the study area where there is lower water
   availability, fewer birds, and lower sampling density. Prediction
   uncertainty in the southern region of the study area highlights the need
   for increased sampling in this area. Because both sets of data performed
   similarly, the choice of which data to use may depend on the management
   context. Real-time data may ultimately be best for guiding dynamic,
   adaptive conservation actions, whereas models based on long-term
   averages may be more helpful for guiding permanent wetland protection
   and restoration.},

Title = {Phenotyping a diversity panel of quinoa using UAV-retrieved leaf area
   index, SPAD-based chlorophyll and a random forest approach},
Journal = {PRECISION AGRICULTURE},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Given its high nutritional value and capacity to grow in harsh
   environments, quinoa has significant potential to address a range of
   food security concerns. Monitoring the development of phenotypic traits
   during field trials can provide insights into the varieties best suited
   to specific environmental conditions and management strategies. Unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a promising means for phenotyping and
   offer the potential for new insights into relative plant performance.
   During a field trial exploring 141 quinoa accessions, a UAV-based
   multispectral camera was deployed to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) and
   SPAD-based chlorophyll across 378 control and 378 saline-irrigated plots
   using a random forest regression approach based on both individual
   spectral bands and 25 different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from
   the multispectral imagery. Results show that most VIs had stronger
   correlation with the LAI and SPAD-based chlorophyll measurements than
   individual bands. VIs including the red-edge band had high importance in
   SPAD-based chlorophyll predictions, while VIs including the near
   infrared band (but not the red-edge band) improved LAI prediction
   models. When applied to individual treatments (i.e. control or saline),
   the models trained using all data (i.e. both control and saline data)
   achieved high mapping accuracies for LAI (R-2 = 0.977-0.980, RMSE =
   0.119-0.167) and SPAD-based chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.983-0.986, RMSE =
   2.535-2.861). Overall, the study demonstrated that UAV-based remote
   sensing is not only useful for retrieving important phenotypic traits of
   quinoa, but that machine learning models trained on all available
   measurements can provide robust predictions for abiotic stress
   experiments.},

Title = {Protecting marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction: A penguins'
   perspective},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The expansion of human activities in offshore maritime regions has
   outpaced the development of scientific knowledge and cooperative
   governance across these areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). In
   this context, current negotiations by the United Nations aim for an
   international legally-binding instrument to improve governance and
   sustainable use of biodiversity in ABNJ. Penguins are among the most
   threatened seabird groups today, notably at sea from fisheries and
   oiling. Here, we examine the available information on penguins'
   movements and evaluate their use of ABNJ across species and life-cycle
   stages. We highlight that in most of the 18 extant penguin species, the
   birds may undertake spectacular migrations, seasonally or throughout
   life-cycle stages. Long-range movements were reported in 16 species,
   with trans-jurisdictional distribution in 14 species, including 13 in
   ABNJ. Species richness in ABNJ varied extensively according to oceanic
   region, and also varied according to season. Transboundary movements,
   notably to ABNJ, are thus remarkably prevalent among penguin species.
   Consequently, provisions of the treaty under negotiation may crucially
   benefit penguin conservation, notably by creating a uniform legal
   framework to designate protected areas in ABNJ, and by promoting the
   precautionary approach to extraction activities. However, the
   seasonally-dynamic utilisation of ABNJ by penguins supports the
   pertinence of adding innovative protection tools, such as mobile Marine
   Protected Areas, to the negotiations for a more adequate protection of
   marine biodiversity. Underlining penguins' remarkable connectivity to
   the high seas can thus further strengthen this instrument aiming to
   protect a global ocean commons heritage of mankind.},

   global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed
   using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1
   emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on
   net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization
   based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly
   better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is
   achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with
   respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol
   measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions
   are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the
   MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse
   modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate
   an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source
   totals 187 Tg yr(-1) with a contribution of 100 Tg yr(-1) from plants,
   only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr(-1).
   Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are
   inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 \%) and Indonesia (up to 58 \%),
   whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20-25
   \%) and Central Africa (25-35 \%). On the other hand, the biogenic
   source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions
   of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2),
   probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which
   is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant
   error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived
   biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union. The
   robustness of the derived fluxes to changes in convective updraft
   fluxes, in methanol removal processes, and in the choice of the biogenic
   a priori inventory is assessed through sensitivity inversions. Detailed
   comparisons of the model with a number of aircraft and surface
   observations of methanol, as well as new methanol measurements in Europe
   and in the Reunion Island show that the satellite-derived methanol
   emissions improve significantly the agreement with the independent data,
   giving thus credence to the IASI dataset.},

Abstract = {The joint development by Belarus and China of the Great Stone Industrial
   Park (GSIP) is designed to establish a high-tech industrial zone and an
   eco-friendly satellite city of Minsk as a key node on the Eurasian Land
   Bridge linking China with the Eurasian Economic Union and the European
   Union. The development and organization of the GSIP are explained in the
   light of a coupling of the strategic goals of the two countries in the
   context of a new Chinese model of external engagement called an emergent
   geo-political economic culture. These goals include Belarus' desire to
   reduce its dependence on Russian gas and oil, upgrade and diversify its
   economy, strengthen its integration with Eurasia and find new partners,
   by attracting Chinese and other foreign direct investment in the context
   of China's Going Out and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). An analysis of
   the roles of national leaders Aliaksandr Lukashenka and Xi Jinping and
   of different stakeholders in the predominantly top-down design,
   development and governance of the park reveals the way in which a BRI
   cooperation platform permits the coupling of Chinese and Belarusian
   interests and strategies in ways through which each side expects to

Abstract = {AimIn order to understand fire's impacts on vegetation dynamics, it is
   crucial that the distribution of fire sizes be known. We approached this
   distribution using a power-law distribution, which derives from
   self-organized criticality theory (SOC). We compute the global spatial
   variation in the power-law exponent and determine the main factors that
   explain its spatial distribution.
   LocationGlobal, at 2 degrees grid resolution.
   MethodsWe use satellite-derived MODIS burned-area data (MCD45) to obtain
   global individual fire size data for 2002-2010, grouped together for
   each 2 degrees grid. A global map of fire size distribution was produced
   by plotting the exponent of the power law. The drivers of the spatial
   trends in fire size distribution, including vegetation productivity,
   precipitation, population density and net income, were analysed using a
   generalized additive model (GAM).
   ResultsThe power law gave a good fit for 93\% of the global 2 degrees
   grid cells with important fire activity. A global map of the fire size
   distribution, as approached by the power law shows strong spatial
   patterns. These are associated both with climatic variables
   (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and with anthropogenic variables
   (cropland cover and population density).
   Main conclusionsOur results indicate that the global fire size
   distribution changes over gradients of precipitation and aridity, and
   that it is strongly influenced by human activity. This information is
   essential for understanding potential changes in fire sizes as a result
   of climate change and socioeconomic dynamics. The ability to improve SOC
   fire models by including these human and climatic factors would benefit
   fire projections as well as fire management and policy.},

Title = {Geospatial analysis of agricultural drought vulnerability using a

Abstract = {Vulnerability of agriculture to drought conditions is closely related to
   the challenges of sustainable agriculture and food security. Information
   on agricultural drought vulnerability status at different scales is
   crucial for prescription, development and implementation of long-term
   drought management measures. This study is on developing a composite
   index for measuring crop-generic agricultural drought vulnerability at
   disaggregated level, in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state of India. By
   analyzing the data on soils, irrigation, farm holdings, rainfall, rainy
   days, cropping pattern and satellite-based crop condition, 22 input
   indicators for 1038 spatial units called ``Mandals{''}
   (within-the-district administrative units) were generated and segregated
   into exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of
   vulnerability. The composite index was computed for each component by
   generating the weights for inputs through variance approach.
   Agricultural drought vulnerability index was generated for each Mandal
   by combining the three component indices and beta distribution was
   fitted to it to generate vulnerability classes. Results indicate that
   the vulnerable group of Mandals represents 57\% of agricultural area and
   67\% of rain-fed crop area of the state. The geographical pattern of
   vulnerability is well captured by the composite index. Districts
   dominant with vulnerable Manclals showed frequent drought occurrence and
   higher crop yield variability. The vulnerability map can be instrumental
   in prioritizing the areas for drought management interventions. Since
   the methodology was applied over a large geographic area with diverse
   conditions of weather, soil and crop, its utility over other geographies
   is also established. Indicators selection and weights generation are the
   critical aspects for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper proposes a fundamental model for continuous-time scheduling
   and marginal pricing of energy generation and storage in day-ahead power
   systems operation. The paper begins with formulating the economic
   operation problem of power systems with generating units and energy
   storage (ES) devices as a continuous-time optimal control problem, where
   the Lagrange multiplier trajectory associated with the continuous-time
   power balance constraint is proven to be the marginal price of energy
   generation and storage. The marginal price is calculated in closed-form,
   which reveals that in addition to the incremental cost rates of
   generating units, the marginal price embeds the financial ES charging
   offers and discharging bids that are defined as incremental charging
   utility and incremental discharging cost rates. This paper shows that
   the adjoint function associated with the ES state equation establishes a
   temporal dependence between the marginal prices during the ES charge and
   discharge states. A function space-based method is developed to solve
   the proposed model, which converts the continuous-time problem into a
   mixed-integer linear programming problem with finite dimensional
   decision space. The features of the proposed scheduling and pricing
   models are demonstrated using numerical studies conducted on the IEEE
   Reliability Test System.},

Title = {Seasonal Change and Spatial Distribution of Traffic Noise in
   Seferihisar, Turkey},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {631-642},
Abstract = {In this study, traffic noise in Seferihisar, which is a holiday resort
   by the Aegean Sea in the West of Turkey, was investigated. The noise
   occurring in summer and winter, on weekdays, and at weekends was mapped
   separately. Besides, land uses exposed to traffic noise were specified.
   In the carried out method, the land uses were primarily mapped by using
   the satellite images of the study area. Then, the noise was measured at
   46 points during ten days in summer and winter, on weekdays and at
   weekends, and it was mapped by using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)
   method and by means of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques.
   The measurements were taken in the daytime (07: 00-19: 00), in the
   evening (19: 00-23: 00), and at night (23: 00-07: 00) as stated in the
   Turkish Regulation of Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise.
   Since the time interval of the daytime measurements was large, the noise
   was measured in three different periods for the daytime measurements. In
   the formation of noise maps, logarithmic averages of all measurements
   taken at each point were used. The noise maps were overlapped with the
   land use maps by the help of the GIS techniques; the land use affected
   by the noise was analyzed.
   The results showed that the road traffic noise varied from summer to
   winter seasons in the study area depending on heavy or light traffic.
   The noise occurring in summer showed an increase both on weekdays and at
   weekends. While the limit value was exceeded in 49 of the measurement
   averages taken in winter, the limit value was exceeded in 96
   measurements taken in summer. The noise maps formed according to the IDW
   method displayed that the areas in which the limit value was exceeded in
   the daytime in summer took up 14.27\% of the study area while this rate
   went down to 4.06\% in winter. The study area is one of the most
   important destinations for summer holiday. 20.12\% of the area that
   exceeded the limit value in summer was builtup and 10.69\% of them was
   tourism area. The noise together with population and traffic that
   increase in summer season is an important environmental problem against
   which some precautions should be taken. The findings of the study
   present significant results which might guide local governments in
   preventing and managing the noise.},

Abstract = {ACCURATE estimation for groundwater recharge is required for more
   sustainable management to water resources. On-farm level, deep
   percolation is one of the water loss sources that researchers and
   agronomists work hard to minimize. However, on a large scale or district
   level, it is considered as a valuable source for recharging the aquifer.
   Indirect estimation to deep percolation would be an economic effective
   mean, especially for large scale studies. The presented research study
   aims at checking the capability of Land Information System (LIS) model
   in estimating deep percolation by soil-water balance equation. The model
   was validated using precipitation data extracted from meteorological
   stations randomly selected and distributed along the Nile basin.
   Multi-thematic map layers including all soil water balance model
   parameters, i.e. deep percolation and change in soil moisture content
   were developed to the year 2013 at a scale of 10 km(2). The relationship
   between measured rainfall values and estimated ones by LIS has a
   coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.88. The obtained results
   revealed a good capacity of LIS model in estimating deep percolation on
   large scale from its direct simulation to the soil-water balance
   parameters. It was found that deep percolation rates were generally
   higher in the Nile River's downstream than in upstream especially in
   Egypt, Sudan, and parts of Uganda. This is in contrary to the behavior
   of precipitation rates and both surface and sub-surface runoff. They
   were higher in upstream countries than in downstream ones. The highest
   deep percolation rate (19.63 mm day(-1)) was observed in Ethiopia and
   parts of Sudan during May 2013. It was found that low elevated lands
   with loose texture tend to have higher rates of deep percolation than
   elevated rocky lands. The current research results could be of great
   benefit for sustainable water management in Egypt. However, further
   study should be conducted in different agro-ecological zones in Egypt
   for more precise model calibration and validation. This may require
   access to large amount of field data and long-term meteorological data
   to run the model.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion is the common land degradation problem in the worldwide
   because of its economic use and environmental impacts. To estimate soil
   erosion and to establish soil erosion management plans, many computer
   models have been developed and used. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic
   Information System (GIS) being a well-known tool available for dealing
   with the major water resources problems, it is used in the present
   study. The objective of the present study is to estimate the annual soil
   loss using USLE model for Kulhan watershed of Shivnath basin, sub-basin
   of Mahanadi basin, Chhattisgarh using RS and GIS techniques. Land
   useland cover and topographical data for the study area was derived
   using GIS and carried out geographical data analysis. Data collection
   includes for the study were annual rainfall data, digital elevation
   model (DEM) from shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM), land-use
   classification map and soil series maps were obtained from Chhattisgarh
   Council of Science and Technology (CCOST), Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
   The five major input parameters used in the study are rainfall erosivity
   factor (R), Length slope factor (LS), soil erodability factor (K),
   vegetation cover factor (C) and erosion control factor (P). The rainfall
   erosivity factor had been determined from annual rainfall data of study
   area. The soil survey data was used to develop the soil erodability
   factor and DEM of study area was used to generate topographic factor
   (LS). The value of cover management factor and support practice factor
   were obtained from land use land cover map. After generation of input
   parameters, analysis was performed for estimation of soil erosion using
   USLE model by spatial information analysis approach. The quantitative
   soil loss (t/ha/year) ranges were estimated and classified the watershed
   into different levels of soil erosion severity and also soil erosion
   index map was developed. The watershed is classified according to Indian
   condition as suggested by Singh et, al.(2002) into different erosion
   classes such as (>5) slight, (5-10) moderate, (10-20) high, (20-40) very
   high, (40-80) sever, (>80) very severe. It was found that average annual
   soil erosion for study area is 0.1783t/ha/yr and 83.97\% of total area
   is under slight erosion risk class and only 0.45\% of total area is
   under very severe class which is near the bank of main stream line. (C)

Title = {Climate and Socioeconomic Factors Drive Irrigated Agriculture Dynamics
   in the Lower Colorado River Basin},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Colorado River Basin (CRB) includes seven states and provides
   municipal and industrial water to millions of people across all major
   southwestern cities both inside and outside the basin. Agriculture is
   the largest part of the CRB economy and crop production depends on
   irrigation, which accounts for about 74\% of the total water demand
   cross the region. A better understanding of irrigation water demands is
   critically needed as temperatures continue to rise and drought
   intensifies, potentially leading to water shortages across the region.
   Yet, past research on irrigation dynamics has generally utilized
   relatively low spatiotemporal resolution datasets and has often
   overlooked the relationship between climate and management decisions
   such as land fallowing, i.e., the practice of leaving cultivated land
   idle for a growing season. Here, we produced annual estimates of fallow
   and active cropland extent at high spatial resolution (30 m) from 2001
   to 2017 by applying the fallow-land algorithm based on neighborhood and
   temporal anomalies (FANTA). We specifically focused on diverse CRB
   agricultural regions: the lower Colorado River planning (LCRP) area and
   the Pinal and Phoenix active management areas (PPAMA). Utilizing ground
   observations collected in 2014 and 2017, we found an overall
   classification accuracy of 88.9\% and 87.2\% for LCRP and PPAMA,
   respectively. We then quantified how factors such as climate, district
   water rights, and market value influenced: (1) annual fallow and active
   cropland extent and (2) annual cropland productivity, approximated by
   integrated growing season NDVI (iNDVI). We found that for the LCRP, a
   region of winter cropping and senior (i.e., preferential) water rights,
   active cropland productivity was positively correlated with cool-season
   average vapor pressure deficit (R = 0.72; p < 0.01). By contrast, for
   the PPAMA, a region of summer cropping and junior water rights, annual
   fallow and active cropland extent was positively correlated with
   cool-season aridity (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) (R =
   0.46; p < 0.05), and active cropland productivity was positively
   correlated with warm-season aridity (precipitation/potential
   evapotranspiration) (R = 0.42; p < 0.01). We also found that PPAMA
   cropland productivity was more sensitive to aridity when crop prices
   were low, potentially due to the influence of market value on management
   decisions. Our analysis highlights how biophysical (e.g., temperature
   and precipitation) and socioeconomic (e.g., water rights and crop market
   value) factors interact to explain seasonal patterns of cropland extent,
   water use and productivity. These findings indicate that increasing
   aridity across the region may result in reduced cropland productivity
   and increased land fallowing for some regions, particularly those with
   junior water rights.},

Abstract = {Wetland is an important part of the natural ecosystem. The study of
   land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) and its prediction is of great
   significance to land-use optimization and ecological environment
   protection of wetlands. Based on the LULC data of Chongming Dongtan
   Wetland from 1986 to 2020, the paper analyzed the driving factors of
   LULCC and predicted the LULCC in the next 10 years by using CA-Markov
   model. The main land-use type of wetland is water, followed by
   cultivated land, and other types of land-use areas are small. The area
   of paddy fields, woodland and construction land continue to increase,
   while the grassland and mudflat continue to decrease. Waters are
   gradually transformed into natural wetlands due to sediment accumulation
   in nature reserves. Agricultural reclamation leads to large-scale
   conversion of natural wetlands into paddy fields in agricultural
   reclamation areas. The expansion of construction land and woodland has
   occupied a large scale of cultivated land. Economic development and
   agricultural population were the main driving factors of LULCC, with
   contribution rates of 69.02\% and 15.06\%, respectively. The impact on
   wetlands increased rapidly after 2002. Fiscal expenditure, agricultural
   and industrial output value explained wetland LULCC the most. In
   2020-2030 years, the area of mudflat and waters increase, the area of
   reed beach and grassland will continue to decrease. The area of
   cultivated land will decrease by 964.72hm(2). Woodland and construction
   land showed a downward trend different from the past. There was no
   obvious change in spatial distribution.},

Title = {An integrated approach to streamflow estimation and flood inundation
   mapping using VIC, RAPID and LISFLOOD-FP},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {610},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Controlling the damaging effects of fluvial flood events has been a
   major challenge for mankind. Integrated hydrologic-hydrodynamic models
   are often employed to estimate the flow and vital flood inundation
   information for mitigating such damages. The most important criterion
   for their implementation is that they should offer large-scale
   applicability with a finer resolution to have local relevance and
   practicability. This study presented an integrated modeling framework,
   VIC-RAPID-LISFP that couples a hydrological model (VIC), a river routing
   model (RAPID) and a hydrodynamic model (LISFLOOD-FP) for fast generation
   of high-resolution flow and flood inundation extent. The utility of the
   model is tested and demonstrated for a case study in the Upper Krishna
   River basin in India. The results showed that the simulated hourly
   streamflows from the calibrated model match reasonably well with the
   observations in terms of various efficiency measures. Also, the
   generated flood inundation maps from the model can reliably capture more
   than 80\% of the satellite-derived flood inundation extent during both
   the low and high flow events. The proposed modeling framework is based
   on readily available open source hydrographic data, and minimum
   meteorological information, so it has global applicability for
   supporting a flood management system with local relevance, especially
   for the data-scarce regions.},

Abstract = {Piping erosion is one of the water erosions that cause significant
   changes in the landscape, leading to environmental degradation. To
   prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable
   development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping
   erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been
   successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this
   work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model
   (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model
   (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility
   mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran.
   A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was
   prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing
   factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance
   from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use,
   soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical
   position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from
   multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion
   prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected
   using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations
   between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for
   Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative
   predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC)
   curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV
   (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The
   results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land
   use showed that 41\% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping
   erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local
   planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to
   agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable
   areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model's ability for
   piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular
   methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.},

Abstract = {Analysis described in the paper were made in the frame of the PROZA
   (Operational decision-making based on atmospheric conditions,
   http://projekt-proza.pl/) project co-financed by the European Union
   through the European Regional Development Fund. One of its tasks was to
   develop an operational forecast system, which is going to support
   different economies branches like forestry or fruit farming by reducing
   the risk of economic decisions with taking into consideration weather
   conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to describe the method of
   the MCSs (Mesoscale Convective Systems) tracking on the basis of the MSG
   (Meteosat Second Generation) data. Until now several tests were
   performed. The Meteosat satellite images in selected spectral channels
   collected for Central Europe Region for May 2010 were used to detect and
   track cloud systems recognized as MCSs in Poland. The ISIS tracking
   method was applied here. First the cloud objects are defined using the
   temperature threshold and next the selected cells are tracked using
   principle of overlapping position on consecutive images. The main
   benefit of using a temperature threshold to define cells is its
   efficiency. During the tracking process the algorithm links the cells of
   the image at time t to the one of the following image at time t+dt that
   correspond to the same cloud system. Selected cases present phenomena,
   which appeared at the territory of Poland. They were compared to the
   weather radar data and UKMO UM (United Kingdom MetOffice Unified Model)
   forecasts. The paper presents analysis of exemplary MCSs in the context
   of near real-time prediction system development and proves that
   developed tool can be helpful in MCSs monitoring.},

Title = {Variations of Ecosystem Services Supply and Demand on the Southeast
   Hilly Area of China: Implications for Ecosystem Protection and
   Restoration Management},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The balance between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) is
   an important prerequisite for maintaining the sustainability of
   ecological protection and restoration project implementation. However,
   research related to ecological protection and restoration is
   insufficient for the study of the demand for ecosystem services. Many
   ecological protection and restoration projects have been implemented in
   the Fujian Province, but the ESs and the relationship changes between
   supply and demand are not clear. In this study, multisource remote
   sensing and public data and the InVEST model were used to quantitatively
   assess and map four typical ESs, including food production, water yield,
   soil retention and carbon sequestration. Hotspot analysis was used to
   analyze the spatial cluster of the ESs supply-demand ratio. The results
   showed that: (1) there were trade-offs between supporting and regulating
   services, particularly between carbon sequestration and water yield
   services, and the strength of trade-offs or synergies between food
   production and other services was stronger in protection and restoration
   areas than in other areas; (2) the supply of ESs in the Fujian Province
   exceeded the demand, and the supply-demand ratio for ESs decreased from
   the mountainous regions in the northwest interior to the economically
   developed regions in the southeast coast; and (3) ecological restoration
   projects improved the relationship between supply and demand for some
   ESs, while other areas (except protection and restoration areas) had
   many low-value clusters of supply-demand ratios, especially regarding
   water yield and carbon sequestration services. Based on the results, our
   findings also provide suggestions for ensuring the sustainability of
   ecological protection and restoration in southeast hilly areas and other
   similar regions.},

Title = {Parameters adaptive adjustment strategy of quantum communication channel
   in free-space based on software-defined quantum communication},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Quantum communication in free space will be disturbed by natural
   environment, such as fog, dust, and rain, which is a difficult problem
   in the construction of quantum communication system. In order to solve
   this problem and improve the survivability of quantum communication
   system, we propose an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy for
   free-space quantum communication based on software-defined quantum
   communication (SDQC). Firstly, we propose a software-defined quantum
   communication model based on the idea of software defined networks. The
   architecture of SDQC is divided into four layers: transport layer,
   access layer, control layer, and management layer. The SDQC system sends
   the link information to the preset program at a management level through
   the real-time monitoring of channel state by the access layer. According
   to the link information, the management level issues instructions to the
   control layer to adjust the parameters such as the initial quantum state
   and the existence time of single quantum state, in order to improve the
   quantum entanglement and fidelity. Secondly, we analyze the relationship
   between quantum fidelity and parameters in SDQC system under three noise
   channels, i.e. depolarization channel, spontaneous amplitude decay
   channel, and phase damping channel. In the depolarized channel, the
   quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase of the error probability
   P-d of the qubit. When the error probability of qubit is certain, the
   system has the maximum quantum fidelity with the value of parameter x is
   0.5. In the spontaneous amplitude decay channel, the quantum fidelity F
   decreases with the increase of the quantum state transition probability
   p(t). When the transition probability of quantum state is certain, the
   higher the value of parameter x, the higher the fidelity will be. In the
   phase-damped channel, the quantum fidelity F decreases with the increase
   of the probability p(c) with which the qubit and the background
   interference equivalent quantum state have complete elastic scattering.
   When the probability is certain, the larger the value of |1/2 - x|, the
   higher the quantum fidelity of the system will be. Finally, we study the
   optimal values of SDQC system parameters under different environmental
   disturbances. The simulation results show that the optimal parameters of
   SDQC system are different when the parameters of three noise channels,
   namely depolarization, spontaneous amplitude decay and phase damping,
   are different. The system adaptively selects the initial quantum state
   and the existence time of single quantum state according to the
   environmental change and business demand, so that the quantum fidelity
   is always at the peak in the communication process. This strategy
   effectively improves the adaptability and comprehensive immunity of the
   quantum communication system.},

Abstract = {Watershed-based development is the strategy for sustainable growth in
   the vast rain-fed regions of India since 1980s to enhance agricultural
   production, conservation of natural resources and raising rural
   livelihood of farming communities. Although soil and water conservation
   was initially the primary objective of watershed program that saw large
   public investment since inception, later its focus shifted to principles
   of equity and enhancing rural livelihood opportunities and more recently
   to sustainable development since mid-1990s. At present a major emphasis
   under watershed program is the regeneration of degraded fragile lands in
   rain-fed regions. Several noteworthy watershed programs have been
   carried out since inception that have yielded sterling results while
   many others have yielded little by way of unbalanced development because
   of improper characterization of watersheds and poor project planning and
   implementation. Tools of Geomatics like satellite data, GIS and GPS
   besides conventional ones like field survey, topographical and cadastral
   maps along with traditional multi-disciplinary methods like PRA, soil
   and water analysis, socio-economic survey etc. provide insight into
   characterization of watersheds, project formulation and proper
   implementation of such development programs. The present paper
   illustrates the methodology for characterization of watersheds using the
   tools of Geomatics on one hand, besides exhibiting its utility for
   scaling-out the program benefits like sustaining higher agricultural
   productivity, enhancing irrigation efficiency, equity, enhanced rural
   livelihood opportunities, women empowerment, drought-proofing etc.
   during Watershed-Plus phase in the coming decades, on the other.},

Title = {Prediction of Future Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using a Coupled CA-ANN
   Model in the Upper Omo-Gibe River Basin, Ethiopia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Land use/land cover change evaluation and prediction using
   spatiotemporal data are crucial for environmental monitoring and better
   planning and management of land use. The main objective of this study is
   to evaluate land use/land cover changes for the time period of 1991-2022
   and predict future changes using the CA-ANN model in the Upper Omo-Gibe
   River basin. Landsat-5 TM for 1991, 1997, and 2004, Landsat-7 ETM+ for
   2010, and Landsat-8 (OLI) for 2016 and 2022 were downloaded from the
   USGS Earth Explorer Data Center. A random forest machine learning
   algorithm was employed for LULC classification. The LULC classification
   result was evaluated using an accuracy assessment technique to assure
   the correctness of the classification method employing the kappa
   coefficient. Kappa coefficient values of the classification indicate
   that there was strong agreement between the classified and reference
   data. Using the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS and the CA-ANN model, future LULC
   changes were predicted. Artificial neural network (ANN) and cellular
   automata (CA) machine learning methods were made available for LULC
   change modeling and prediction via the QGIS MOLUSCE plugin. Transition
   potential modeling was computed, and future LULC changes were predicted
   using the CA-ANN model. An overall accuracy of 86.53\% and an overall
   kappa value of 0.82 were obtained by comparing the actual data of 2022
   with the simulated LULC data from the same year. The study findings
   revealed that between 2022 and 2037, agricultural land (63.09\%) and
   shrubland (5.74\%) showed significant increases, and forest (-48.10\%)
   and grassland (-0.31\%) decreased. From 2037 to 2052, the built-up area
   (2.99\%) showed a significant increase, and forest and agricultural land
   (-2.55\%) showed a significant decrease. From 2052 to 2067, the
   projected LULC simulation result showed that agricultural land (3.15\%)
   and built-up area (0.32\%) increased, and forest (-1.59\%) and shrubland
   (-0.56\%) showed significant decreases. According to the study's
   findings, the main drivers of LULC changes are the expansion of built-up
   areas and agricultural land, which calls for a thorough investigation
   using additional data and models to give planners and policymakers clear
   information on LULC changes and their environmental effects.},

Title = {Climate limits on European forest structure across space and time},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {168-178},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The structure of a forest dictates its function, vulnerability to
   mortality, and ecosystem services it provides. Many aspects of the
   environment and management determine forest structures, such as canopy
   height, stand density, carbon content, etc. Environmental factors, such
   as climate, limit the extent to which management can maximize structures
   of a forest. By understanding how climate limits forest structures over
   large landscapes we can better quantify the potential upper limit that a
   forest structure can achieve independent of management. Further, by
   quantifying how climate limits forest structures we can deepen our
   understanding of the impact climate change has had and will have on our
   forest resources and services. This type of information goes beyond
   quantifying how climate will impact the pools and fluxes of a forest,
   which is typically done for climate change studies over large
   landscapes. Estimating how climate change will impact structures will
   allow us to quantify how climate change will impact resources and
   services unquantifiable by pools and fluxes alone - such as
   biodiversity, habitat suitability, and market values. We quantified how
   maximum and minimum temperatures, and precipitation limit 3 forest
   structures, diameter at breast height, height, and basal area across the
   European continent. We found that climate zones exist that maximize each
   forest structure. Further, we estimated how climate change since the
   1950's has influenced the potential structures of European forests by
   assessing eight individual forests throughout Europe and then Europe as
   a whole. All three forest structures are limited in different ways
   depending on their location in Europe. Though some individual forests
   have seen a benefit from climate change, European forests on average
   have lost 5.0\%, 1.7\% and 6.5\% of potential forest diameter, height
   and basal area respectively. Further, the extremes of the climate values
   in our study, which may support endemic life, have already begun to
   vanish from the entire continent.},

   Time Series},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {Accurate regional and global information on land cover and its changes
   over time is crucial for environmental monitoring, land management, and
   planning. In this study, we selected Fengning County, in China's Hebei
   Province, as a case study area. Using satellite data, we generated fused
   normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with high spatial and
   temporal resolution by utilizing the STARFM algorithm to produce a fused
   GF-1 and MODIS NDVI dataset. We extracted seven phenological parameters
   (including the start, end, and length of the growing season, base value,
   mid-season date, maximum NDVI, seasonal NDVI amplitude) from a fused
   NDVI time-series after reconstruction using the TIMESAT software. We
   developed four classification scenarios based on different combinations
   of GF-1 spectral features, the fused NDVI time-series, and the
   phenological parameters. We then classified the land cover using a
   support vector machine and analyzed the classification accuracies. We
   found that the proposed method achieved satisfactory classification
   results, and that the combination of the fused NDVI data with the
   extracted phenological parameters significantly improved classification
   accuracy. The classification accuracy based on the composited GF-1
   multi-spectral bands combined with the phenological parameters was the
   highest among the four scenarios, with an overall classification
   accuracy of 88.8\% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8714, which represent
   increases of 9.3 percentage points and 0.1073, respectively, compared
   with GF-1 spectral data alone. The producer's and user's accuracy for
   different land cover types improved, with a few exceptions, and cropland
   and broadleaf forest had the largest increase.},

Title = {Post-logging changes in a neotropical dry forest composition and
   structure modify the ecosystem functioning},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {537},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Native forests are considered to be the main centers of terrestrial
   diversity in the world and they provide important ecosystem services for
   humanity. Unsustainable logging is currently-one of the greatest threats
   to the biodiversity of these forests. In northwestern Argentina, about
   90 \% of the piedmont forest in the Southern Yungas has been transformed
   and the remaining 10\% is being intensively logged. The aim of this
   study was to identify post-logging changes in the structural and
   compositional attributes affecting the functionality of a dry forest in
   Argentina. In the control forest, we recorded 1559 individuals from 45
   tree species and 22 families, and at post-logging forest, 1376 trees
   from 47 species and 25 families. Logging affected the forest structure
   by decreasing timber tree density and basal area. In addition, at the
   post-logging forest, we observed an increase in the density of
   non-timber trees and in the horizontal understory cover, which were
   associated with the normalized difference vegetation index, thus,
   affecting the forest functioning. The threatened timber species Amburana
   cearensis and Jacaranda mimosifolia were not recorded in the logged
   forest. In the control, four timber species had the highest importance
   value indexes (IVI): Phyllostilon rhamnoides, Anadenanthera colubrina,
   Cal-icophylum multiflorum, and Myracrodruon urundeuva. Additionally, in
   the logged forest there was a change in the species order regarding the
   IVI, with A. colubrina, P. rhamnoides, Cordia americana, and a
   non-valuable timber species (Ocotea puberula) being the most important
   tree species. In order to preserve the economic and ecological value of
   the piedmont forest, the density of non-timber tree species and the
   horizontal understory cover must be maintained at values close to the
   control forest. These guidelines can be implemented by applying
   low-impact logging techniques.},

Title = {Identifying priorities for the joint conservation of maritime built
   heritage and marine biodiversity: An assessment of shoreline engineering
   on the Isles of Scilly, UK, using historical datasets},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {227},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Growing concern over the ecological impact of maritime structures has
   led to increasing attempts to quantify the extent of marine human
   development. However, maritime heritage assets (i.e., historic
   structures of cultural significance, such as decommissioned quays) are
   often missing in these assessments as many of these structures are not
   recorded in conventional datasets of maritime infrastructure, instead
   featuring exclusively in heritage registers. At the same time, heritage
   assets may provide unintentional ecological benefits to marine wildlife
   due to their age, traditional construction, and protected status, and as
   such, comprehensive assessments of marine human development cannot be
   achieved without the inclusion of historical data. Using the Isles of
   Scilly as a geographically confined case study, we present a novel
   methodology for quantifying the full extent of marine engineering
   structures (including heritage assets) at a regional scale, and for
   identifying priority structures for joint biodiversity and heritage
   conservation. Historical datasets were considered alongside remote
   sensing data and records of modern coastal defences in a rapid
   desk-based assessment to create a full inventory of marine structures
   along the entire coastline of the Isles of Scilly. In total, 68
   structures were recorded, totalling 6180 m in length. By evaluating the
   ecological potential and heritage value of each structure using a novel
   scoring system that was verified in the field, priorities for
   conservation and other managed interventions are identified. This
   includes (1) listed buildings and scheduled monuments that due to their
   construction features and shore position are most likely to support
   diverse marine assemblages, and (2) modern structures where
   eco-enhancement adaptations may be favourable.As demonstrated here,
   combined ecological-heritage evaluations allow for the identification of
   structures with the greatest potential for the joint conservation of
   built heritage and marine wildlife. Research is now needed to develop
   this method further and test its application in other geographical
   locations and at varying spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Climate variability along with increase in the demand for water

   were observed during these periods. Extreme rainfall analysis from
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and strong connection between wet
   season rainfall, lake height, and TWSA, respectively, indicate
   interannual terrestrial water storage dynamics in the UBN Basin is
   strongly influenced by climate. Further, the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) influences rainfall in the UBN Basin, specifically
   the peak rainfall season (June-September), which shows negative
   correlation (r = -0.62) with MEI anomaly values, which indicates that
   the El Nino case (positive MEI values) is linked to the dry conditions
   in the basin. The findings of this study, combined with studies such as
   socioeconomic impact of drought, will facilitate better planning and
   management of water resources in water stressed regions. Furthermore,
   this study demonstrates the application of a combination of satellite
   and other hydrologic data in understanding the hydro-climatic condition
   of a remote basin.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the first decadal reanalysis simulation of the
   biogeochemistry of the North West European shelf, along with a full
   evaluation of its skill, confidence, and value. An error-characterized
   satellite product for chlorophyll was assimilated into a
   physical-biogeochemical model of the North East Atlantic, applying a
   localized Ensemble Kalman filter. The results showed that the reanalysis
   improved the model simulation of assimilated chlorophyll in 60\% of the
   study region. Model validation metrics showed that the reanalysis had
   skill in matching a large data set of in situ observations for 10
   ecosystem variables. Spearman rank correlations were significant and
   higher than 0.7 for physical-chemical variables (temperature, salinity,
   and oxygen), similar to 0.6 for chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphate,
   nitrate, and silicate), and significant, though lower in value, for
   partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide (similar to 0.4). The
   reanalysis captured the magnitude of pH and ammonia observations, but
   not their variability. The value of the reanalysis for assessing
   environmental status and variability has been exemplified in two case
   studies. The first shows that between 325,000 and 365,000 km(2) of shelf
   bottom waters were vulnerable to oxygen deficiency potentially
   threatening bottom fishes and benthos. The second application confirmed
   that the shelf is a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but the
   total amount of uptake varies between 36 and 46 Tg C yr(-1) at a 90\%
   confidence level. These results indicate that the reanalysis output data
   set can inform the management of the North West European shelf
   ecosystem, in relation to eutrophication, fishery, and variability of
   the carbon cycle.},

   Cone Production Using Terrestrial Laser Scanner},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Kernels found in stone pinecones are of great economic value, often
   surpassing timber income for most forest owners. Visually evaluating
   cone production on standing trees is challenging since the cones are
   located in the sun-exposed part of the crown, and covered by two
   vegetative shoots. Very few studies were carried out in evaluating how
   new remote sensing technologies such as terrestrial laser scanners (TLS)
   can be used in assessing cone production, or in trying to explain the
   tree-to-tree variability within a given stand. Using data from 129 trees
   in 26 plots located in the Spanish Northern Plateau, the gain observed
   by using TLS data when compared to traditional inventory data in
   predicting the presence, the number, and the average weight of the cones
   in an individual tree was evaluated. The models using TLS-derived
   metrics consistently showed better fit statistics, when compared to
   models using traditional inventory data pertaining to site and tree
   levels. Crown dimensions such as projected crown area and crown volume,
   crown density, and crown asymmetry were the key TLS-derived drivers in
   understanding the variability in inter-tree cone production. These
   results underline the importance of crown characteristics in assessing
   cone production in stone pine. Moreover, as cone production (number of
   cones and average weight) is higher in crowns with lower density, the
   use of crown pruning, abandoned over 30 years ago, might be the key to
   increasing production in combination with stand density management.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an automated approach for efficient detection of
   building regions in complex environments. We investigate the shadow
   evidence to focus on building regions, and the shadow areas are detected
   by recently developed false colour shadow detector. The directional
   spatial relationship between buildings and their shadows in image space
   is modelled with the prior knowledge of illumination direction. To do
   that, an approach based on fuzzy landscapes is presented. Once all
   landscapes are collected, a pruning process is applied to eliminate the
   landscapes that may occur due to non-building objects. Thereafter, we
   benefit from a graph-theoretic approach to accurately detect building
   regions. We consider the building detection task as a binary
   partitioning problem where a building region has to be accurately
   separated from its background. To solve the two-class partitioning, an
   iterative binary graph-cut optimization is performed. In this paper, we
   redesign the input requirements of the iterative partitioning from the
   previously detected landscape regions, so that the approach gains an
   efficient fully automated behaviour for the detection of buildings.
   Experiments performed on 10 test images selected from QuickBird (0.6 m)
   and Geoeye-1 (0.5 m) high resolution datasets showed that the presented
   approach accurately localizes and detects buildings with arbitrary
   shapes and sizes in complex environments. The tests also reveal that
   even under challenging environmental and illumination conditions (e.g.
   low solar elevation angles, snow cover) reasonable building detection
   performances could be achieved by the proposed approach.},

Title = {The small pelagic fishery of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania: What we know
   and what we need to know for management under climate change},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Small pelagic fish, including anchovies, sardines and sardinellas,
   mackerels, capelin, hilsa, sprats and herrings, are distributed widely,
   from the tropics to the far north Atlantic Ocean and to the southern
   oceans off Chile and South Africa. They are most abundant in the highly
   productive major eastern boundary upwelling systems and are
   characterised by significant natural variations in biomass. Overall,
   small pelagic fisheries represent about one third of global fish
   landings although a large proportion of the catch is processed into
   animal feeds. Nonetheless, in some developing countries in addition to
   their economic value, small pelagic fisheries also make an important
   contribution to human diets and the food security of many low-income
   households. Such is the case for many communities in the Zanzibar
   Archipelago and on mainland Tanzania in the Western Indian Ocean. Of
   great concern in this region, as elsewhere, is the potential impact of
   climate change on marine and coastal ecosystems in general, and on small
   pelagic fisheries in particular. This paper describes data and
   information available on Tanzania's small pelagic fisheries, including
   catch and effort, management protocols and socio-economic significance.
   Then, incorporating the rapidly improving understanding of the region's
   oceanography resulting from the application of remote sensing and
   oceanographic modelling, the paper undertakes the most complete
   assessment to date of the potential impacts of climate change on the
   small pelagic fishery of the Pemba Channel. Pathways of climate change
   impact are explored and crucial knowledge gaps, both in terms of the
   fishery itself and the wider ecosystem, are identified in order to guide
   future research activities. Although we analyse small pelagics in the
   specific context of the Pemba Channel, the key challenges identified in
   the analysis are likely to be relevant to many small pelagic fisheries
   in coastal nations heavily dependent on living marine resources.},

Abstract = {Wadi Naghamish is located at a distance of 20 km east of Matrouh City.
   It occupies an area of about 9000 ha. Wadi Naghamish suffers from
   seasonal floods that can remove the surface layers, cut off the natural
   cover, destroy the infrastructures, and cause many natural disasters as
   well as cause a great economic loss. The study aimed at evaluating soil
   erosion in Wadi Naghamish, Northwest Coast of Egypt using Revised
   Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) based integration soil chemical,
   physical properties, and topographic factors. Geomorphological units of
   Wadi Naghamish were identified based on the integration of sentinel 2
   image and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The Geomorphological units were
   classified into: Tableland 77\%, Escarpment 1.3\%, Basin 2.1\%, Alluvial
   terraces 5.6\%, Wadi 8.98\%. Sandy beach 0.03\% of the total area. The
   results indicated that soil erosion values were associated with the
   geomorphic feature of the study area where, the highest values were
   observed in Tableland unit, where it has average soil erosion ranging
   between 0.42 +/- 0.21 to 55 +/- 39 t h(-1) y(-1). Meanwhile the lowest
   values were observed in Wadi, alluvial terraces and Basin where, the
   overall average of soil erosion were 0.41 +/- 0.23, 0.26 +/- 0.09 and
   0.19 +/- 0.13 t h(-1) y(-1) sequentially. The highest values were found
   in the sloping areas where slope length value reaches 2.8 and the
   erodibility values ringing between 0.3 and 0.5 Mg h MJ(-1) mm(-1).
   Therefore, the study emphasized the importance of relying on scientific
   study in preparing an appropriate management plan including a suitable
   potential crop system, increasing the organic matter, and implementing a
   no-till or direct sowing system to preserve the soil from erosion.(c)

Abstract = {This paper describes the activity based on the use of the microblogging
   Twitter for a better comprehension of the treated topics in the subject
   Management of Technology Projects. The development of the course is
   focused in ITIL (a methodology of ICT Services Management), which
   contents it is on the Web and is reviewed at the Master Classes. Later,
   the concepts viewed in the classes and reviewed on the Web, are analyzed
   by the students researching for examples of common life and socializing
   on Twitter through a HashTag.
   Students, through a virtual, common space for them, unfold theirselves
   with a better agility than through a virtual space based on a class.
   This allows a bigger density of participations in forums, which
   contributes with the goals of the class. Besides, interacting in an open
   space, there is a chance that outsider people enrich the developed
   forums, letting a better comprehension of the treated topics.
   The students' participations on Twitter must have a specific Hashtag, so
   they can be reviewed and a feedback can be done. Besides, the teacher
   reviews each one of the tweets, deciding if they provide worth value or
   not, to the class. Periodically a summary of the quantity of
   participations is done, and a weekly continuity also.
   As the results of this experience, it is highlighted the excellent
   response of the students about the activity, the development of the
   writing quality in the virtual forums and a better comprehension of the
   topics reviewed at the classes.},

Abstract = {A main field and satellite fields consist of several separate reservoirs
   with gas cap and/or oil rim. A processing facility on the main field
   receives and processes the oil, gas, and water from all the reservoirs.
   This facility is typically capable of processing only a limited amount
   of oil, gas, and water per unit of time. In order to satisfy these
   processing limitations, the production needs to be choked. The available
   capacity is shared among several field owners with different commercial
   interests. In this paper, we focus on how total oil and gas production
   from all the fields could be optimized. The satellite-field owners
   negotiate processing capacities on the main-field facility. This
   introduces additional processing-capacity constraints (booking
   constraints) for the owners of the main field. If the total wealth
   created by all owners represents the economic interests of the
   community, it is of interest to investigate whether the total wealth may
   be increased by lifting the booking constraints. If all reservoirs may
   be produced more optimally by removing the booking constraints, all
   owners may benefit from this when appropriate commercial arrangements
   are in place. We will compare two production strategies. The first
   production strategy optimizes locally, at distinct time intervals. At
   given intervals, the production is prioritized so that the maximum
   amount of oil is produced. In the second production strategy, a fixed
   weight is assigned to each reservoir. The purpose of the weights is to
   be able to prioritize some reservoirs before others. The weights are
   optimized from a life-cycle perspective. As an illustration, a case
   study based on real data is presented. For the examples considered, it
   is beneficial to lift the booking constraints because all of the
   reservoirs combined can be produced more efficiently when this is done.},

Title = {Comparison of Accuracy of Surface Temperature Images from Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle and Satellite for Precise Thermal Environment Monitoring
   of Urban Parks Using In Situ Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Rapid urbanization has led to several severe environmental problems,
   including so-called heat island effects, which can be mitigated by
   creating more urban green spaces. However, the temperature of various
   surfaces differs and precise measurement and analyses are required to
   determine the ``coolest{''} of these. Therefore, we evaluated the
   accuracy of surface temperature data based on thermal infrared (TIR)
   cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have recently
   been utilized for the spatial analysis of surface temperatures.
   Accordingly, we investigated land surface temperatures (LSTs) in green
   spaces, specifically those of different land cover types in an urban
   park in Korea. We compared and analyzed LST data generated by a thermal
   infrared (TIR) camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and
   LST data from the Landsat 8 satellite for seven specific periods. For
   comparison and evaluation, we measured in situ LSTs using contact
   thermometers. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R-2 0.912, root
   mean square error (RMSE) 3.502 degrees C) than Landsat TIR LST accuracy
   (R-2 value lower than 0.3 and RMSE of 7.246 degrees C) in all periods.
   The Landsat TIR LST did not show distinct LST characteristics by period
   and land cover type; however, grassland, the largest land cover type in
   the study area, showed the highest accuracy. With regard to the accuracy
   of the UAV TIR LST by season, the accuracy was higher in summer and
   spring (R2 0.868-0.915, RMSE 2.523-3.499 degrees C) than in autumn and
   winter (R-2 0.766-0.79, RMSE 3.834-5.398 degrees C). Some land cover
   types (concrete bike path, wooden deck) were overestimated, showing
   relatively high total RMSEs of 4.439 degrees C and 3.897 degrees C,
   respectively, whereas grassland, which has lower LST, was
   underestimated-showing a total RMSE of 3.316 degrees C. Our results
   showed that the UAV TIR LST could be measured with sufficient
   reliability for each season and land cover type in an urban park with
   complex land cover types. Accordingly, our results could contribute to
   decision-making for urban spaces and environmental planning in
   consideration of the thermal environment.},

Title = {A Simple Method to Estimate Weed Control Threshold by Using RGB Images
   from Drones},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The estimation of the infestation level in a field and the consequent
   determination of the economic threshold is a basic requisite to
   rationalize post-emergence weeding. In this study, a simple and
   inexpensive procedure to determine the economic threshold based on weed
   cover is proposed. By using high-resolution RGB images captured by a
   low-cost drone, a free downloadable app for image processing and common
   spreadsheet software to perform the model parametrization, two different
   methods have been tested. The first method was based on the joint
   estimation of the two parameters involved in weed cover calculation,
   whereas the second method required the availability of further images
   for the separate estimation of the first parameter. The reliability of
   the two methods has been evaluated through the comparison with observed
   data and the goodness of fit in parameter calibration has been verified
   by calculating appropriate quality indices. The results showed an
   acceptable estimation of the weed cover value for the second method with
   respect to observed data (0.24 vs. 0.17 m(2) and 0.17 vs. 0.14 m(2), by
   processing images captured at 10 and 20 m, respectively), whereas the
   estimations obtained with the first method were disappointing (0.35 vs.
   0.17 m(2) and 0.33 vs. 0.14 m(2), by processing images captured at 10
   and 20 m, respectively).},

Title = {Technology Roadmapping Architecture Based on Knowledge Management: Case
   Study for Improved Indigenous Coffee Production from Guerrero, Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Having demonstrated its importance for economic and human developments,
   technological change is considered one of the biggest supports
   worldwide. Today, with the population increase, the inclusion of
   technology is considered the most appropriate way to reduce the impact
   of this challenge. Considering 171 indigenous coffee producers from
   Paraje Montero and Tierra Colorada from Guerrero, Mexico, the present
   study proposes technological routes for the indigenous coffee production
   chain and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as sensors,
   actuators, and processing devices basing on the requirements of the
   chain. During face-to-face sessions, questionaries, field visits, and
   literature review for knowledge management, the results expose the need
   of effective actions against diseases and the reduction of climate
   change, lack of infrastructure, old plantations, and lack of
   commercialization channels; for these and considering the requirement of
   greenhouse technology by indigenous coffee producers and following the
   labor value driver of the digital compass, the necessity of several
   kinds of sensors, technologies, and methodologies has been identified
   with high possibilities to be implemented by similar producers analyzed
   in this manuscript to help in solving the problems identified in this
   work. The combination of remote sensing, signal processing, and
   spectroscopy could be employed to explore mineralogical features of soil
   and help problems with fertilization; sensor modules to collect
   temperature, humidity, and light intensity data are a priority for
   greenhouse monitoring; electrochemical sensors and optical technologies
   could be of great help to detect the presence of diseases in coffee
   plants; and the installation of a greenhouse solar dryer is necessary to
   reduce the time of the sun drying process and protect the coffee cherry.
   These emerging technologies will help to improve the production of
   coffee. The study contributes to identify a technology roadmap proposing
   technological implements according to indigenous coffee production chain
   requirements and serves as support for future studies in indigenous
   regions.},

Title = {Monitoring Quarry Area with Landsat Long Time-Series for Socioeconomic
   Study},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Quarry sites result from human activity, which includes the removal of
   original vegetation and the overlying soil to dig out stones for
   building use. Therefore, the dynamics of the quarry area provide a
   unique view of human mining activities. Actually, the topographic
   changes caused by mining activities are also a result of the development
   of the local economy. Thus, monitoring the quarry area can provide
   information about the policies of the economy and environmental
   protection. In this paper, we developed a combined method of machine
   learning classification and quarry region analysis to estimate the
   quarry area in a quarry region near Beijing. A temporal smoothing based
   on the classification results of all years was applied in
   post-processing to remove outliers and obtain gently changing sequences
   along the monitoring term. The method was applied to Landsat images to
   derive a quarry distribution map and quarry area time series from 1984
   to 2017, revealing significant inter-annual variability. The time series
   revealed a five-stage development of the quarry area with different
   growth patterns. As the study region lies on two jurisdictions-Tianjin
   and Hebei-a comparison of the quarry area changes in the two
   jurisdictions was applied, which revealed that the different policies in
   the two regions could impose different impacts on the development of a
   quarry area. An analysis concerning the relationship between quarry area
   and gross regional product (GRP) was performed to explore the potential
   application on socioeconomic studies, and we found a strong positive
   correlation between quarry area and GRP in Langfang City, Hebei
   Province. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of annual
   monitoring over the long-term for socioeconomic studies, which can be
   used for mining decision making.},

Abstract = {NASA and the French space agency, CNES, with contributions from the
   Canadian Space Agency ( CSA) and United Kingdom Space Agency ( UKSA) are
   developing new wide swath altimetry technology that will cover most of
   the world's ocean and surface freshwater bodies. The proposed Surface
   Water and Ocean Topography ( SWOT) mission will have the capability to
   make observations of surface water ( lakes, rivers, wetland) heights and
   measurements of ocean surface topography with unprecedented spatial
   coverage, temporal sampling, and spatial resolution compared to existing
   technologies. These data will be useful for monitoring the hydrologic
   cycle, flooding, and characterizing human impacts on a changing
   environment.
   The applied science community is a key element in the success of the
   SWOT mission, demonstrating the high value of the science and data
   products in addressing societal issues and needs. The SWOT applications
   framework includes a working group made up of applications specialists,
   SWOT science team members, academics and SWOT Project members to promote
   applications research and engage a broad community of potential SWOT
   data users. A defined plan and a guide describing a program to engage
   early adopters in using proxies for SWOT data, including sophisticated
   ocean and hydrology simulators, an airborne analogue for SWOT (
   AirSWOT), and existing satellite datasets, are cornerstones for the
   program. A user survey is in development and the first user workshop was
   held in 2015, with annual workshops planned.
   The anticipated science and engineering advances that SWOT will provide
   can be transformed into valuable services to decision makers and civic
   organizations focused on addressing global disaster risk reduction
   initiatives and potential science-based mitigation activities for water
   resources challenges of the future. With the surface water measurements
   anticipated from SWOT, a broad range of applications can inform inland
   and coastal managers and marine operators of terrestrial and oceanic
   phenomena relevant to their work.},

Title = {General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM): a new way to map whole of
   landscape biodiversity functional connectivity for operational planning
   and reporting},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {465},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Graph-theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape
   connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities. We
   developed the new General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM), as a
   operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks
   to inform conservation priorities and plans. GLCM is built on two
   complementary metapopulation ecology-based measures: Neighbourhood
   habitat area (Ni) and habitat link value (Li). Ni is a measure of the
   amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross-scale
   connectivity to neighbouring habitat. The remaining Ni across a region
   can be reported as an indicator of Ecological Carrying Capacity for
   wildlife (plants and animals). Li at any location is its contribution to
   the landscape connectivity of the study region (i.e. which is reported
   as summed Ni across a region) by virtue of providing the `least-cost'
   linkages between concentrations of habitat. Mapped Li provides valuable
   insights into the pattern of a region's habitat network, highlighting
   functioning habitat corridors and stepping-stones, and candidate areas
   for conservation and restoration. Due to its foundations in ecological
   theory and its parsimonious design, GLCM addresses a number of criteria
   we list as important, while addressing criticisms often levelled at
   graph-theoretical approaches. We present results for three south-east
   Australian case studies using continuous-value ecological condition
   surfaces as input. However, a simple habitat/non-habitat binary surface
   approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used. GLCM
   has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape
   connectivity assessment at regional scales, and broader. It incorporates
   connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities
   relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes (foraging,
   dispersal and migration). Successively finer spatial scales are more
   intensively sampled based on a simple scaling-law. This approach allows
   analysis resolutions to be determined by data-driven ecological
   relevance rather than by processing limitations. The operational
   advantages of GLCM means that landscape connectivity assessments can be
   readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time-series
   remote sensing of land cover, or applied to alternative scenarios of
   land use, ecological restoration, climate projections or combinations of
   these.},

Title = {Predicting changes in land use/land cover and seasonal land surface
   temperature using multi-temporal landsat images in the northwest region
   of Bangladesh},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Land use/land cover (LULC) variations are accelerated by rapid
   urbanization and significantly impacted global Land Surface Temperature
   (LST). The dynamic increase in LST results in the Urban Heat Island
   (UHI) effect. In this study, future LULC change scenarios, seasonal
   (summer \& winter) LST variations, and LST distribution over different
   LULC classes were predicted using Landsat satellite images for 1999,
   2009, and 2019 in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Cellular Automata (CA)
   and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) procedures were used to predict the
   LULC changes and seasonal LST variations for 2029 and 2039. In addition,
   Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) were
   conducted to identify the possible impacts of LULC change, LST shifts,
   and climate change on agricultural productivity and developed a
   sustainable land use management plan for the study area. Validation of
   the CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a kappa value of
   0.82. Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error
   (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and
   0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The
   LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded
   by 58.03 km(2) and 79.90 km(2), respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and
   2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more
   than 23.30 \% and 50.46 \% of the summer and 3.02 \% and 13.02 \% of the
   winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 degrees
   C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC
   classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the
   regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce
   agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood,
   heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature). This study provides the
   useful guidelines for agricultural officers, urban planners, and
   environmental engineers to understand the spatial configurations of
   built-up area enlargement and provide effective policy measures to
   conserve farming lands to ensure environmental sustainability.},

Title = {Satellite time series data reveal interannual and seasonal
   spatiotemporal evapotranspiration patterns in China in response to
   effect factors},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {255},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) are the basic
   problem of the circulation of water resources. Several studies have
   reported the spatiotemporal patterns of ET. However, there is a lack of
   systematic analysis of seasonal ET patterns over large areas, and the
   factors affecting ET under variable environmental conditions are still
   uncertain. In this study, flux observation data was used to evaluate the
   performance of MOD16 (the MODIS global ET product) data under different
   conditions, and then the MOD16 data were used to analyze the interannual
   and seasonal variability of ET and its spatial distribution
   characteristics in China. Furthermore, path analysis was used to analyze
   the factors affecting the change of ET. The results can be summarized as
   follows: (1) MOD16 data are sufficiently reliable and meet the precision
   requirements for research; (2) the vegetation ET in China showed
   significant temporal and spatial differences at the interannual and
   seasonal timescales, respectively, with an average annual value of
   359.61 mm between 2001 and 2018; (3) the ET in China showed an upward
   trend in 2001-2018, with an average change rate of 2.95 mm/year, and
   exhibited differences in various seasons and for different vegetation
   types; (4) surface vegetation are the main factors affecting ET in
   southeast of China, while in northwest, the ET variation is affected by
   multiple factors. Under the conditions of climate change and vegetation
   cover change, several strategies should be implemented to deal with the
   sustained increase of vegetation water consumption, for example, the
   adjustment of agricultural production structure and the optimization of
   planting structure. The ET change law obtained in this study can be used
   as a reference for water resource regulation and management.},

Title = {Investigating the Impacts of Urbanization on Vegetation Net Primary
   Productivity: A Case Study of Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration from
   the Perspective of Townships},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As an emerging national strategic urban agglomeration in China, the
   changing trend of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and the
   impact of the urbanization level (UL) on carbon cycle functions in the
   Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (CUA) have received increasing
   attention. Previous studies have largely overlooked externalities and
   the heterogeneity of urbanization effects, and urbanization has also
   been analyzed in isolation (with focus being on land and population
   urbanization). In this study, the spatial evolution of NPP was evaluated
   from 2000 to 2020 at the township level (3859) using multivariate remote
   sensing data and a comprehensive index (UL) that included population
   urbanization, land urbanization, and economic urbanization. Bivariate
   spatial autocorrelation, spatial Durbin models, and geographically
   weighted regression models were used to analyze the spatial
   externalities of urbanization impacts and assess the global and local
   effects. The results show that the region's mean NPP increased by 177.25
   g{*}c/m(2) (annual growth of 1.59\%), exhibiting a distribution of ``low
   in the middle and high in the periphery{''} and low-value clustering
   along major traffic arteries and rivers. Low-value-NPP areas were mainly
   located in urban centers, while the high-level areas were in the
   mountainous region (in the southwest and southeast) and significantly
   expanded over time. Negative correlation clusters were the main
   clustering types between the UL and NPP; the ``High-Low{''} negative
   correlation clusters accelerated outward from the urban centers of
   Chengdu and Chongqing. Overall, urbanization had negative direct and
   spillover effects on NPP, exhibiting spatial non-stationarity of the
   negative driving effect within the urban agglomeration. The results
   indicate the need to strengthen regional ecological joint governance and
   adopt more place-based urbanization optimization strategies. This study
   offers new insights to help to reduce the constraining effects of
   urbanization on vegetation productivity and ecological functions from
   the perspectives of population agglomeration, land expansion, and
   industrial construction.},

Abstract = {The ability to monitor plant nutrient status of high value horticultural
   crops and to adjust seasonal nutrient supply via fertilizer application
   has economic and environmental benefits. Recent technological advances
   may enable growers and field consultants to conduct this type of
   monitoring nondestructively in the future. Using the perennial crop
   apple (Malus domestica) and the annual crop potato (Solanum tuberosum),
   a hand-held leaf reflectance meter was used to evaluate leaf nitrogen
   (N) status throughout the growing season. In potato, this meter showed
   good correlation with leaf blade N content. Both time of day and time of
   season influenced leaf meter measurement, but leaf position did not. In
   apple, three different leaf meters were compared: the leaf spectral
   reflectance meter and two leaf greenness meters. Correlation with both N
   rate and leaf N content were strongest for the leaf reflectance meter
   early in the season but nonsignificant late in the season, whereas the
   leaf greenness meters gave weak but significant correlations throughout
   the growing season. The tapering off of leaf reflectance values found
   with the hand-held meter is consistent with normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) values calculated from satellite images from the
   same plots. Overall, the use of leaf spectral reflectance shows promise
   as a tool for nondestructive monitoring of plant leaf status and would
   enable multiple georeferenced measurements throughout a field for
   differential N management.},

Title = {Sinkhole risk mapping and early warning: the case of Camaiore (Italy)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Introduction: Sinkholes are ground collapses that can cause significant
   damage to infrastructure and buildings. Part of the risk represented by
   sinkholes is related to their abruptness and the difficulty in spotting
   in advance their exact location within a sinkhole-prone area. For this
   reason, urban planning informed by an accurate risk mapping and
   monitoring is one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk.Methods:
   In this study, we propose a two-folded procedure based on the
   examination of ground displacement data measured by a ground-based
   interferometric radar and on the generation of a sinkhole risk zonation
   map. We examined 11 years' worth of ground displacement data measured by
   a ground-based interferometric radar to search for sinkhole precursors.
   The analysis was based on averaged displacement time series retrieved
   from high-coherence pixels scattered around Camaiore, Italy, a test site
   where a catastrophic sinkhole occurred in 1995. To generate a sinkhole
   risk map, we evaluated the susceptibility map as derived from a set of
   predisposing environmental parameters, the vulnerability derived from
   the thickness of the sedimentary cover that can be linked to the
   abruptness of the collapse, and the value of the elements at risk from
   the Italian Real Estate Market Observatory integrated with land cover
   information for the non-built up areas.Results: The analysis of ground
   displacement data revealed that Camaiore had not experienced subsidence
   relatable to incoming sinkholes in the monitored period. However, few cm
   of vertical movements, which are well correlated with water table
   oscillations, have been measured and are expected to be of the same
   order of magnitude of sinkhole precursor deformations. This implies that
   a phenomenon of the size and velocity of the 1995 event could have
   likely been detected before its final collapse. The sinkhole risk map
   identified specific areas that should be closely monitored using in situ
   and remote sensing instrumentation.Discussion: The sinkhole risk
   zonation map generated in this study can be used to inform urban
   planning and risk management strategies. The study also shows the
   potential of ground-based interferometric radar to detect sinkhole
   precursors and the importance of integrating different mitigation
   approaches. Overall, this study can provide insights for sinkhole risk
   assessment and management in sinkhole-prone areas.},

Abstract = {The accelerated sea level rise and its resulting impacts on the highly
   populated coastal regions bearing significant economic value is one of
   the negative outcomes of climate change. In this study, the most
   vulnerable areas regarding sea level rise in Turkey are defined through
   CVI analysis, and the level of inundation is estimated from
   multi-mission satellite altimetry sea level anomaly, together with
   significant wave heights and the effects of tidal and meteorological
   forcing. Consequently, the maximum level of flooding that is expected to
   occur by 2100 reaches up to 6.7 m in Cukurova Delta which is one of the
   most vulnerable areas of the country, and GIS-based inundation mapping
   on the high resolution elevation model indicates that 69\% of the area
   would be under the risk of flooding. Considering the probable sea level
   rise in Cukurova by the end of this century, immediate adaptive measures
   must be undertaken for the protection of the coastal zone. In addition,
   it will be of utmost importance to make an inventory of the vulnerable
   zones comprising coastal aquifers and ecosystems, and to introduce
   adaptive long-term strategies related to local coastal zone management

Title = {UAV-based partially sampling system for rapid NDVI mapping in the
   evaluation of rice nitrogen use efficiency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Rapid acquisition and mapping of normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) values is essential for a timely evaluation of nitrogen use
   efficiency (NUE) in sustainable agriculture. The zonal nutrient
   management techniques for sustainable agriculture require timely and
   efficient NDVI data collection and analysis capabilities, - a need that
   is still rarely addressed. However, as with the use of manned aircraft,
   the primary limitation of established unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   imaging technologies is the limited time window for large-area data
   collection. Furthermore, as the spatial resolution increases, the
   post-processing time generally becomes longer. To overcome problems
   associated with the need for rapid data acquisition and post-processing,
   we have developed a UAV-based sensor system called the Accurate and
   Speed Scanner (AS-Scanner). The data acquisition accuracy and NDVI
   mapping speed of the system were assessed. According to the results of a
   ground-level experiment, the mean absolute error (MAE) between the
   reflectance data of the AS-Scanner and the corresponding data of the ASD
   FieldSpec 3 spectrometer is less than 1.11\%. Furthermore, results of a
   plot-level experiment suggest that the NDVI values of a raw point cloud
   from AS-Scanner-based UAV platform (AS-NDVI) and UAV-mounted Mica-Sense
   RedEdge camera (REG-NDVI) are highly correlated (0.54 < R-2 < 0.57, p <
   0.01). In a map-level experiment, the interpolated, 15 m x 15 m pixel
   size AS-NDVI values were in good agreement with the REG-NDVIs over a
   4.01 ha (40100 m(2)) rice field (0.55 < R-2 < 0.65, p < 0.01). The
   average processing times of the inverse distance weighted (IDW, 0.45 s),
   kriging linear (KL, 0.73 s), and nearest neighbor (NN, 1.05 s)
   interpolations of the AS-Scanner data prove that it is possible to
   efficiently create NDVI maps using data from the sensor. Besides, the
   effect of the varying solar irradiance values on the AS-NDVIs was
   analyzed under varied illumination conditions. Moreover, the AS-NDVIs
   were also used to assess the NUE in a paddy rice field at the panicle
   stage. The results show that nutrients can be effectively assessed using
   AS-Scanner data. Despite some disadvantages such as the potential of
   NDVI value saturation over dense canopies, the AS-Scanner provides a
   method for quickly obtaining reasonable spatial resolution crop
   information for agricultural nutrient monitoring and management. This
   also offers the potential to reduce environmental pressure which may be
   caused by untimely estimation of NUE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Research opportunities from emerging atmospheric observing and modeling
   capabilities},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-323},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Second Prospectus Development Team (PDT-2) of the U.S. Weather
   Research Program was charged with identifying research opportunities
   that are best matched to emerging operational and experimental
   measurement and modeling methods. The overarching recommendation of
   PDT-2 is that inputs for weather forecast models can best be obtained
   through the use of composite observing systems together with adaptive
   (or targeted) observing strategies employing both in situ and remote
   sensing. Optimal observing systems and strategies are best determined
   through a three-part process: observing system simulation experiments,
   pilot field measurement programs, and model-assisted data sensitivity
   experiments. Furthermore, the mesoscale research community needs easy
   and timely access to the new operational and research datasets in a form
   that can readily be reformatted into existing software packages for
   analysis and display. The value of these data is diminished to the
   extent that they remain inaccessible.
   The composite observing system of the future must combine synoptic
   observations, routine mobile observations, and targeted observations, as
   the current or forecast situation dictates. High costs demand fuller
   exploitation of commercial aircraft, meteorological and navigation
   {[}Global Positioning System (GPS)] satellites, and Doppler radar.
   Single observing systems must be assessed in the context of a composite
   system that provides complementary information. Maintenance of the
   current North American rawinsonde network is critical for progress in
   both research-oriented and operational weather forecasting. Adaptive
   sampling strategies are designed to improve large-scale and regional
   weather prediction but they will also improve diagnosis and prediction
   of flash flooding, air pollution, forest fire management, and other
   environmental emergencies.
   Adaptive measurements can be made by piloted or unpiloted aircraft.
   Rawinsondes can be launched and satellites can be programmed to make
   adaptive observations at special times or in specific regions. PDT-2
   specifically recommends the following forms of data gathering: a pilot
   field and modeling study should be designed and executed to assess the
   benefit of adaptive observations over the eastern Pacific for mesoscale
   forecasts over the contiguous United States; studies should be done over
   the western Atlantic and Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico regions, particularly
   during hurricane season; and enhanced observations should be implemented
   for the mountainous western states and for the Mississippi and Missouri
   River Valleys.
   Data sensitivity tests and observing system simulation experiments
   (OSSEs) are important tools for gauging the benefit of existing or
   proposed observing systems. OSSEs involve only model predictions and are
   essentially self-contained. Data sensitivity tests require the full
   consideration of modeling infrastructure, namely, observation ingest
   quality control, objective analysis, and numerical prediction.
   Sensitivity tests involving both wind and moisture profiles are
   particularly needed to determine their impact on improved precipitation
   forecasts. New variational analysis techniques are capable of
   assimilating so-called proxy observations. These techniques should be
   fully exploited. Diabatic initialization should be addressed through the
   assimilation of satellite cloud data and very high resolution WSR-88D
   radar measurements into very high resolution models with sophisticated
   cloud microphysics. Success in this area should improve quantitative
   precipitation forecasts in the first few (model) hours.
   There is a pressing need to better understand the interaction of moist
   convection with large-scale flow. One key is better characterization of
   the impact of precipitation formation and evaporation on the fluxes of
   mass, momentum, and heat in moist convection. Humidity measurement in
   precipitating downdrafts is a crucial measurement, which currently
   cannot be made reliably. The capabilities of polarization-diversity
   radar should be explored in a quasi-operational context to determine
   whether WSR-88D radars should be upgraded. Progress in quantitative
   precipitation forecasting is impeded by poorly resolved and inaccurate
   water vapor measurements.
   Further improvements in numerical weather prediction demand improved
   monitoring of Earth surface characteristics so that spatial and temporal
   variations in air-surface fluxes are realistically simulated. Over land,
   priority should be given to the coupling of mesoscale meteorological
   models with hydrological models and to routine assimilation of surface
   (soil, moisture, and plant) characteristics. Improved air-sea fluxes are
   essential to proper modeling of marine cyclogenesis. The most important,
   practical ocean measurements include sea surface temperature,
   thermocline depth, wave spectra, and ice coverage and thickness.},

Abstract = {The increasing loss of N and P is one of the greatest negative global
   consequences of agricultural advance. The aim of this study was to
   calculate an apparent N and P balance in the county of Benito Juarez
   during the 1989/90, 2002/03 and 2011/12 agroproductive periods, and
   relating the results achieved with the agriculture surface in each
   campaign. Initially, the N and P balance indicator was applied in all
   three campaigns. Then, the loss of nutrients per unit surface was
   established, based on data from satellite images of the county and the
   value of the N and P balances. As a result, remarkable temporal
   variations were observed with respect to the fertilized surfaces and the
   applied doses. Likewise, the growth of the agricultural area and
   alterations in the production values and yield of the crops stand out.
   The balances of both nutrients were negative in the three campaigns,
   showing a continuous generation of deficit balances, whit greater loss
   of tn of N than P per surface unit (km(2)). Obviously, agricultural
   sustainability is affected, so this study shows the nutrient situation
   in the county, establishing the need for a sustainable management of
   fertilization.},

Title = {Seasonality and Ecological Suitability Modelling for Anthrax (Bacillus
   anthracis) in Western Africa},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Anthrax is a globally distributed, neglected,
   underreported, soil-borne zoonotic disease. In West Africa, the disease
   is hyper-endemic, severely affecting the livestock sector. Many
   challenges exist to control the disease in this region, particularly
   constraints on financial and human resources. Therefore, methods that
   can be utilized to improve reporting, guide and prioritize surveillance
   and control activities and rationalize the allocation of limited
   resources are crucial. In this study, we showed how to optimize the use
   of fragmented, heterogeneous and limited precise reporting data of
   anthrax in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger to understand risk
   periods as well as identify and predict risk areas. To achieve this, we
   used anthrax data from different databases in combination with
   environmental and climate variables and geospatial remote sensing
   techniques. Our study demonstrated that the number of anthrax outbreaks
   by month increase with the increasing monthly rates of change in
   precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during
   the transition period from the dry to the wet season. Livestock density,
   precipitation, NDVI and alkaline soils were the main predictors of
   anthrax suitability in the region. Our findings on anthrax seasonality
   and ecological suitability can inform surveillance, prevention and
   control programs undertaken by animal and public health authorities and
   enhance collaborative One Health strategies. Anthrax is hyper-endemic in
   West Africa affecting wildlife, livestock and humans. Prediction is
   difficult due to the lack of accurate outbreak data. However, predicting
   the risk of infection is important for public health, wildlife
   conservation and livestock economies. In this study, the seasonality of
   anthrax outbreaks in West Africa was investigated using climate time
   series and ecological niche modeling to identify environmental factors
   related to anthrax occurrence, develop geospatial risk maps and identify
   seasonal patterns. Outbreak data in livestock, wildlife and humans
   between 2010 and 2018 were compiled from different sources and analyzed
   against monthly rates of change in precipitation, normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature. Maximum Entropy
   was used to predict and map the environmental suitability of anthrax
   occurrence. The findings showed that: (i) Anthrax outbreaks
   significantly (99\%) increased with incremental changes in monthly
   precipitation and vegetation growth and decremental changes in monthly
   temperature during January-June. This explains the occurrence of the
   anthrax peak during the early wet season in West Africa. (ii) Livestock
   density, precipitation seasonality, NDVI and alkaline soils were the
   main predictors of anthrax suitability. (iii) Our approach optimized the
   use of limited and heterogeneous datasets and ecological niche modeling,
   demonstrating the value of integrated disease notification data and
   outbreak reports to generate risk maps. Our findings can inform public,
   animal and environmental health and enhance national and regional One
   Health disease control strategies.},

Title = {Characterizing the spatio-temporal variations of C3 and C4 dominated
   grasslands aboveground biomass in the Drakensberg, South Africa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {51-60},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {C3 and C4 grass species composition, with different physiological,
   morphological and most importantly phenological characteristics,
   influence Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and their ability to provide
   ecosystem goods and services, over space and time. For decades, the lack
   of appropriate remote sensing data sources compromised C3 and C4 grasses
   AGB estimation, over space and time. This resulted in uncertainties in
   understanding their potential and contribution to the provision of
   services. This study therefore examined the utility of the new
   multi-temporal Sentinel 2 to estimate and map C3 and C4 grasses AGB over
   time, using the advanced Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression (SPLSR)
   model. Overall results have shown the variability in AGB between C3 and
   C4 grasses, estimation accuracies and the performance of the SPLSR
   model, over time. Themeda (C4) produced higher AGB from February to
   April, whereas from May to September, Festuca produced higher AGB. Both
   species also showed a decrease in AGB in August and September, although
   this was most apparent for Themeda than its counterpart. Spectral bands
   information predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies and an
   improvement was observed when both spectral bands and vegetation indices
   were applied. For instance, in the month of May, spectral bands
   predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies for Festuca (R-2 = 0.57;
   31.70\% of the mean), Themeda (R-2 = 0.59; 24.02\% of the mean) and
   combined species (R-2 = 0.61; 15.64\% of the mean); the use of spectral
   bands and vegetation indices yielded 0.77; (18.64\%), 0.75 (14.27\%) and
   0.73 (16.47\%), for Festuca, Themeda and combined species, respectively.
   The red edge (at 0.705 and 0.74 pm) and derived indices, NIR and SWIR 2
   (2.19 mu m) were found to contribute more to grass species AGB
   estimation, over time. Findings have also revealed the potential of the
   SPLSR model in estimating C3 and C4 grasses AGB using Sentinel 2 images,
   over time. The AGB spatial variability maps produced in this study can
   be used to quantify C3 and C4 forage availability or accumulating fuel,
   as well as for developing operational management strategies.},

Title = {Evolutionary trends of urban expansion and its sustainable development:
   Evidence from 80 representative cities in the belt and road initiative
   region},
Journal = {CITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) region has
   undoubtedly led to changes in the scale, form, and pattern of cities to
   accommodate the expansion of industry, housing, and commerce and to
   produce sus-tained impacts on environmental sustainability. However,
   limited studies have yet to systematically investigate the urban
   expansion in this area. Based on a systematic research path of
   ``pattern-mode-coordination-sustain -ability{''}, this study quantified
   the urban expansion dynamics of BRI countries and 80 representative
   cities from 2000 to 2018 using multi-source remote sensing data and the
   Global Atlas of Urban Expansion. The results show that in terms of
   dynamic rules, the share of urban lands grew from 0.32 \% in 2000 to
   0.66 \% in 2018 (an increase of 250,600 km2) and is estimated to
   increase to 1.68 \% in 2018-2030. Countries in developing regions (i.e.,
   West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Asia) are predicted to become the
   new high-value centers of urban expansion intensity (UEI). The UEI of
   BRI cities showed a significant developing region orientation and ``high
   in the east and low in the west{''} distribution pattern but would
   gradually shift towards a spatially homogeneous and discrete
   distribution. BRI cities can be divided into four expansion modes
   (center-periphery, double-winged strip, dual -core cluster, and
   single-winged mutation expansion), each with a different evolutionary
   dynamic mechanism. Regarding coordination, there is a great demand for
   land expansion by population and economic growth in BRI cities. This
   dependence increased as the city's UEI index rose; when the UEI exceeded
   3 \%, the dependence became more pronounced. The investigations also
   showed that the adverse ecological effects of urban land expansion are
   gradually increasing at the urban scale. Furthermore, the ecological
   impacts of population growth are usually the strongest for BRI's
   countries and cities, and the intensity showed a synergistic growth
   trend with the UEI index. This study provides new insights into the
   dynamic features of BRI's urban expansion from national to urban scales
   and historical to future periods, while also contributing new
   perspectives from the BRI to optimal global land management and
   sustainable urban development.},

Abstract = {Population has significant application value and scientific significance
   in resource use, public health, public transportation, disaster
   assessment, and environmental management. However, traditional census
   data can not show the population density difference within census units.
   Furthermore, census data are not uniform across countries, and
   reconciling these differences when using data from multiple countries
   require considerable effort. Finally, there are scale differences
   between census and geospatial data (e.g., land use/cover), making data
   analysis and needed research difficult. These challenges significantly
   limit the applications of census data. The advent of gridded population
   mapping (GPM) technology has overcome these challenges. GPM technology
   has developed rapidly in recent years. The research data and models are
   rich and diverse, and many achievements have been made. A systematic
   review of the current state of GPM research will help relevant
   researchers and data users. This article begins by summarizing the core
   elements of GPM research in four aspects: auxiliary data, models,
   accuracy, and products. It will then go on to four problems prevalent in
   GPM research that have direct or indirect effects on the accuracy of
   GPM. Finally, the article prospects GPM research from four different
   aspects based on the current state of research.},

Abstract = {This study was performed in two regions of central Chile: Libertador
   Bernardo O'Higgins y del Maule, to locate and characterize the remnants
   of schlerophyllous forests. This ecosystem has been subject of an
   intense and prolonged anthropic pressure resulting in notorious cover
   reduction and fragmentation. Despite its important biodiversity and
   endemism, these forests are ill represented in the Chilean system of
   environmental protection. We located the forest patches using satellite
   imagery and GIS followed by field verification. The patches were
   classified on the basis of forest structure and physiognomy into three
   situations: open, semi-dense and dense, and referred them to the
   municipality within each of the two regions. These municipalities were
   ordered by the size their forest cover, and a fragmentation analysis was
   performed in the top 14 units, using landscape indices. Results showed a
   very fragmented ecosystem, with great variation in patch size and
   spatial distribution. We present the forest cover for each situation in
   each municipality. In the selected municipalities we detail number of
   patches, mean size, density and patch characteristics. The results are
   then discussed in the context of landscape and lend use and, its
   possible value to design management programs at the scale of municipal

Abstract = {Swidden agriculture is an important food production system for rural
   communities in Kachet village, northern Laos. In swidden system, land is
   cleared and abandoned for several years to allow regeneration. These
   fallow areas provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as benzoin,
   and cardamom, and can be used for other purposes. In Laos, ``Forest
   Law{''} and factors associated with population growth shortened the
   fallow period to less than 4 years. This study aimed to clarify the
   plant utilization and its temporal-spatial distribution in fallow forest
   and to rethink present land use management based on these information.
   We used interviews with villagers, geographic information system data,
   vegetation surveys, and satellite imaging data from 2000 to 2010.
   Swidden area information was used to estimate the swidden cycle. The
   farmers in Kachet village used 120 plant species. The results show that
   the numbers of plant species in edible and medicine use subcategories
   dramatically increased as the fallow period became longer, and most
   NTFPs with economic value were observed in forests with a relatively
   long fallow period (6 or 7 years). The fallow period was maintained by
   exchanging fields among villagers for swidden agriculture, which is
   conducted by the whole village. The average area used for swidden
   agriculture from 2000 to 2010 was 160 +/- 11 ha year(-1), and the
   average swidden cycle was about 7 years, which is longer than that found
   in other regions in northern Laos. Recently, market economy has
   infiltrated to mountain villages and some villagers start to select
   commercial crops in swidden fields. However, villagers also have
   conducted sustainable land use to match the situation. Keeping the land
   use management and plant utilization in the fallows is important for
   sustainable development of this area.},

Title = {Depthwise Separable Convolution Neural Network for High-Speed SAR Ship
   Detection},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As an active microwave imaging sensor for the high-resolution earth
   observation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been extensively applied
   in military, agriculture, geology, ecology, oceanography, etc., due to
   its prominent advantages of all-weather and all-time working capacity.
   Especially, in the marine field, SAR can provide numerous high-quality
   services for fishery management, traffic control, sea-ice monitoring,
   marine environmental protection, etc. Among them, ship detection in SAR
   images has attracted more and more attention on account of the urgent
   requirements of maritime rescue and military strategy formulation.
   Nowadays, most researches are focusing on improving the ship detection
   accuracy, while the detection speed is frequently neglected, regardless
   of traditional feature extraction methods or modern deep learning (DL)
   methods. However, the high-speed SAR ship detection is of great
   practical value, because it can provide real-time maritime disaster
   rescue and emergency military planning. Therefore, in order to address
   this problem, we proposed a novel high-speed SAR ship detection approach
   by mainly using depthwise separable convolution neural network (DS-CNN).
   In this approach, we integrated multi-scale detection mechanism,
   concatenation mechanism and anchor box mechanism to establish a
   brand-new light-weight network architecture for the high-speed SAR ship
   detection. We used DS-CNN, which consists of a depthwise convolution
   (D-Conv2D) and a pointwise convolution (P-Conv2D), to substitute for the
   conventional convolution neural network (C-CNN). In this way, the number
   of network parameters gets obviously decreased, and the ship detection
   speed gets dramatically improved. We experimented on an open SAR ship
   detection dataset (SSDD) to validate the correctness and feasibility of
   the proposed method. To verify the strong migration capacity of our
   method, we also carried out actual ship detection on a wide-region
   large-size Sentinel-1 SAR image. Ultimately, under the same hardware
   platform with NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU, the experimental results indicated
   that the ship detection speed of our proposed method is faster than
   other methods, meanwhile the detection accuracy is only lightly
   sacrificed compared with the state-of-art object detectors. Our method
   has great application value in real-time maritime disaster rescue and
   emergency military planning.},

Title = {Comparison of Global and Continental Land Cover Products for Selected
   Study Areas in South Central and Eastern European Region},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Land cover is one of the key terrestrial variables used for monitoring
   and as input for modelling in support of achieving the United Nations
   Strategical Development Goals. Global and Continental Land Cover
   Products (GCLCs) aim to provide the required harmonized information
   background across areas; thus, they are not being limited by national or
   other administrative nomenclature boundaries and their production
   approaches. Moreover, their increased spatial resolution, and
   consequently their local relevance, is of high importance for users at a
   local scale. During the last decade, several GCLCs were developed,
   including the Global Historical Land-Cover Change Land-Use Conversions
   (GLC), the Globeland-30 (GLOB), Corine-2012 (CLC) and GMES/ Copernicus
   Initial Operation High Resolution Layers (GIOS). Accuracy assessment is
   of high importance for product credibility towards incorporation into
   decision chains and implementation procedures, especially at local
   scales. The present study builds on the collaboration of scientists
   participating in the Global Observations of Forest CoverGlobal
   Observations of Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC-GOLD), South Central and
   Eastern European Regional Information Network (SCERIN). The main
   objective is to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of commonly used
   GCLCs at selected representative study areas in the SCERIN geographic
   area, which is characterized by extreme diversity of landscapes and
   environmental conditions, heavily affected by anthropogenic impacts with
   similar major socio-economic drivers. The employed validation strategy
   for evaluating and comparing the different products is detailed,
   representative results for the selected areas from nine SCERIN countries
   are presented, the specific regional differences are identified and
   their underlying causes are discussed. In general, the four GCLCs
   products achieved relatively high overall accuracy rates: 74-98\% for
   GLC (mean: 93.8\%), 79-92\% for GLOB (mean: 90.6\%), 74-91\% for CLC
   (mean: 89\%) and 72-98\% for GIOS (mean: 91.6\%), for all selected
   areas. In most cases, the CLC product has the lower scores, while the
   GLC has the highest, closely followed by GIOS and GLOB. The study
   revealed overall high credibility and validity of the GCLCs products at
   local scale, a result, which shows expected benefit even for
   local/regional applications. Identified class dependent specificities in
   different landscape types can guide the local users for their reasonable
   usage in local studies. Valuable information is generated for advancing
   the goals of the international GOFC-GOLD program and aligns well with
   the agenda of the NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program to improve the
   quality and consistency of space-derived higher-level products.},

Title = {First satellite tracks of the Endangered black-capped petrel},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {23-33},
Abstract = {The black-capped petrel Pterodroma hasitata is an endangered seabird
   with fewer than 2000 breeding pairs restricted to a few breeding sites
   in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. To date, use areas at sea have been
   determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic
   sightings and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding
   of the species' marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of
   marine use areas, we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels
   breeding on Hispaniola, representing the first tracking study for this
   species and one of the first published tracking studies for any breeding
   seabird in the Caribbean. During chick rearing, petrels primarily used
   marine habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea (ca. 18.0 degrees to 11.5
   degrees N, 70.0 degrees to 75.5 degrees W) between the breeding site and
   the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the breeding
   sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period.
   During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used
   waters west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid-and southern Atlantic
   coasts of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic
   waters east of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites
   ranged from ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding
   period. Petrels used waters located within 14 different exclusive
   economic zones, suggesting that international collaboration will benefit
   the development of management strategies for this species.},

Abstract = {Management of crops is an essential part in the food production
   procedure. Having a thorough knowledge of growth stages of each crop is
   of paramount importance in this respect. Phenology (transplanting,
   panicle formation, flowering etc) is the study of cyclic and seasonal
   natural phenomena that are controlled by environmental and climatic
   factors. Monitoring the crop condition manually in the field is
   difficult and time consuming. Therefore recently, several methods have
   been introduced by using satellite derived vegetation indices.
   Extraction of phenological parameters is helpful for the purposes like
   irrigation management, nutrient management, health management, yield
   prediction and crop type mapping. Easily extracted parameters will be
   the important data base for agricultural researchers. This research is
   an attempt to extract paddy phenological parameters of Sri Lanka by
   using 16 years' (2000 to 2015) Time series MODIS Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is highly sensitive for the green
   vegetation and the data were analysed using SPIRITS and TIMESAT
   software's. Periodicity converter in SPIRITS and Savitzky Golay
   filtering in TIMESAT and SPIRITS are helpful in smoothing the time
   series which are perturbed by noise due to missing values and Clouds.
   Phenology is considered as a sensitive climate change indicator but, it
   is very essential to have a comprehensive familiarity about the method
   of water supply that the study area is irrigated or rain fed so as to
   eliminate the wrong interpretation. As results, average of long time
   series of NDVI profile for a few agro ecological zones of Sri Lanka with
   extracted seven parameters (Start of the season, End of the season,
   Length of the season, Booting date, Base value, Maximum NDVI during the
   Season, Amplitude) and generated phenological parameter maps are
   presented here. The crop phenology is a very important element of
   agricultural monitoring, to ensure the security of the food crop
   production. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Multi-resolution dune morphology using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission

Abstract = {The complex morphology of large sand dunes of the world's great deserts
   have significant importance on conservation and climate change and hence
   are of interest to a wide variety of scientific and environmental
   applications including studies on aeolian processes, paleoclimate,
   civilian infrastructure management, and design of blown-sand control
   systems. Scientific studies on dune formation and dynamics have been
   limited to desert margins due to inaccessibility of the desert interior
   by conventional surveying and mapping techniques. Thus, dune morphology
   in the deep desert interiors is not well studied and much about the
   driving forces controlling dune activity and dynamics are still poorly
   understood.
   We demonstrate the utility of space-based observations to characterize
   dune morphology. Specifically, we used the Shuttle Radar Topography
   Mission (SRTM) C-band data to investigate and compare morphologic
   attributes of dune fields of the Taklimakan and the Namib Deserts.
   Cross-sectional amplitude roughness estimates have similar magnitude but
   stoss slopes are shallower in the Taklimakan Desert than in the Namib
   Desert. The high Height-Width (H:W) ratio of 0.09 for the linear dunes
   in the Taklimakan Desert is indicative of its equilibrium with aeolian
   shear stress whereas the Namib Desert dunes are unstable.
   Multi-resolution planimetric properties from SRTM Digital Elevation
   Model (DEM) using B-spline wavelet decomposition reveal linear dunes in
   the Taklimakan Desert are superimposed on a dome-like substrate whereas
   the linear dune in the Namib Desert are constructed on a knoll-like
   submorphology. These long-wavelength features, taken as paleotopography,
   may be a major controlling factor on wind patterns and dune sinuosity.
   We demonstrate the utility of ANFIS to assess seasonal dune changes in
   the Namib Desert using ICESat observations and SRTM. ANFIS is a
   data-driven prediction scheme. Predicted topography along ICESat tracks
   have low rms of 3.5m, a 30\% increase over SRTM accuracy. Seasonal track
   comparison from August 2003 to January 2005 shows that most changes to
   dune topography occur at crestal deformation of isolated dunes. The
   results show seasonal waning and waxing of dune crests.},

Title = {Accounting for capacity and flow of ecosystem services: A conceptual
   model and a case study for Telemark, Norway},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Understanding the flow of ecosystem services and the capacity of
   ecosystems to generate these services is an essential element for
   understanding the sustainability of ecosystem use as well as developing
   ecosystem accounts. We conduct spatially explicit analyses of nine
   ecosystem services in Telemark County, Southern Norway. The ecosystem
   services included are moose hunting, sheep grazing, timber harvest,
   forest carbon sequestration and storage, snow slide prevention,
   recreational residential amenity, recreational hiking and existence of
   areas without technical interference. We conceptually distinguish
   capacity to provide ecosystem services from the actual flow of services,
   and empirically assess both. This is done by means of different spatial
   models, developed with various available datasets and methods, including
   (multiple layer) look-up tables, causal relations between datasets
   (including satellite images), environmental regression and indicators
   derived from direct measurements. Capacity and flow differ both in
   spatial extent and in quantities. We discuss five conditions for a
   meaningful spatial capacity-flow-balance. These are (1) a conceptual
   difference between capacity and flow, (2) spatial explicitness of
   capacity and flow, (3) the same spatial extent of both, (4) rivalry or
   congestion, and (5) measurement with aligned indicators. We exemplify
   spatially explicit balances between capacity and flow for two services,
   which meet these five conditions. Research in the emerging field of
   mapping ES should focus on the development of compatible indicators for
   capacity and flow. The distinction of capacity and flow of ecosystem
   services provides a parsimonious estimation of over- or underuse of the
   respective service. Assessment of capacity and flow in a spatially
   explicit way can thus support monitoring sustainability of ecosystem
   use, which is an essential element of ecosystem accounting. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The acquisition of reliable and accurate data to assess environmental
   changes over large spatial scales is one of the main limitations to
   determine the impact of eutrophication, and the effectiveness of
   management strategies in coastal systems. Here, we used a continuous in
   situ Chl-a fluorometry sensor and L8/OLI satellite data to develop an
   algorithm and map Chl-a spatial distribution to assess the impact of
   freshwater diversions and associated high nutrient loading rates in the
   Barataria Basin (BB) complex, a coastal system in the northern Gulf of
   Mexico. We collected water quality samples at 24 sampling stations and
   high-frequency continuous fluorometry in situ {[}Chl-a] data along a
   similar to 87 km transect from 2019-2020. Field {[}Chl-a] values were
   highly correlated (r = 0.86; p < 0.0001) with continuous in situ
   {[}Chl-a] fluorometry values. These continuous in situ {[}Chl-a] values
   were significantly related to a surface reflectance ratio ({[}B1 +
   B4]/B3) estimated using L8/OLI data (exponential model; R-2 = 0.46; RMSE
   = 4.8, p < 0.0001). The statistical model replicated {[}Chl-a] spatial
   patterns across the BB complex. This work shows the utility of
   high-frequency continuous Chl-a fluorometry sampling coupled with L8/OLI
   image analysis to increase the frequency and number of field data sets
   to assess water quality conditions at large spatial scales in highly

Title = {Quantifying the impacts of land use/land cover change on groundwater
   depletion in Northwestern China - A case study of the Dunhuang oasis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {270-279},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent decades, the Dunhuang oasis in the arid Northwest China has
   been undergoing significant changes due to social-economic development
   and expanded irrigation for agricultural production. Groundwater table
   was found to have significantly declined during the period of 1987-2007
   owing to greater pumping. We analyzed the impacts of land use/land cover
   (LU/LC) changes on the groundwater fluctuations in the study area. The
   LU/LC types were derived from the satellite images for the years of
   1987, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007. The water consumptions associated with
   the LU/LC types were estimated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith method.
   Results show that during the period of 1987-2007, the area of
   agricultural land sharply increased by 98.7 km(2), and the cash crops
   were the main contributor. Under the current market system, farmers had
   much more autonomy and greater incentives to shift the cropping pattern
   from the traditional food crops to the high value cash crops with
   greater water consumption. The total water consumption of the cash crops
   accounted for 14.1\% of the total water consumption in 1987, but
   increased to 71.6\% in 2007, becoming the largest water consumer. The
   agricultural land use was the main cause of the declining groundwater
   table during the period from 1987 to 2007. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   potential commercial value. Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and
   other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels,
   pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active
   compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in
   determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are
   fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict
   yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation
   systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower
   latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to
   cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets
   that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature
   measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To
   address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive
   analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on
   ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient
   temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production
   yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of
   central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model
   predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T
   biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat,
   AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake,
   NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL
   model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area
   information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs),
   techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR
   performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and
   can assist with algae production platform optimization.},

Title = {Multi-Objective Optimal Operations Based on Improved NSGA-II for
   Hanjiang to Wei River Water Diversion Project, China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is important to investigate the laws of reservoir multi-objective
   optimization operations, because it can obtain the best benefits from
   inter-basin water transfer projects to mitigate water shortage in intake
   areas. Given the multifaceted demands of the Hanjiang to Wei River Water
   Diversion Project, China (referred hereafter as the Project), an
   easy-to-operate multi-objective optimal model based on simulation is
   built and applied to search the multi-objective optimization operation
   rules between power generation and energy consumption. The Project
   includes two reservoirs connected by a water transfer tunnel. One is
   Huangjinxia, located in the mainstream of Hanjiang with abundant inflow
   but no regulation ability, and the other is Sanhekou, located in the
   tributary of Hanjiang with multi-year regulation ability but less water.
   The layout of the Project increases the difficulty of reservoir joint
   optimization operations. Therefore, an improved Non-dominated Sorting
   Genetic Algorithm-II (I-NSGA-II) with a feasible search space is
   proposed to solve the model based on long-term series data. The results
   show that: (1) The validated simulation model is helpful to obtain
   Pareto front curves to reveal the rules between power generation and
   energy consumption. (2) Choosing a reasonable search step size to build
   a feasible search space based on simulation results for the I-NSGA-II
   can help find more optimized solutions. Considering the influence of the
   initial populations of the algorithm and limited computing ability of
   computers, the qualified rate of Pareto points solved by I-NSGA-II are
   superior to NSGA-II. (3) According to the characteristics of the
   Project, water transfer ratio threshold value of two reservoirs are
   quantified for maximize economic benefits. Moreover, the flood season is
   a critical operation period for the Project, in which both reservoirs
   should supply more water to intake areas to ensure the energy balanced
   of the entire system. The findings provide an easy-to-operate
   multi-objective operation model with the I-NSGA-II that can easily be
   applied in optimal management of inter-basin water transfer projects by
   relevant authorities.},

Abstract = {Coral islands like Saint Martin's have long been recognized as being
   particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. Based on
   this hypothesis, the broad aim of this research work was to explore the
   environmental condition of Saint Martin's Island through a geographical
   illustration of the present status of the landform, and land use and
   land cover (LULC) characteristics. Both primary and secondary data were
   used to conduct the research work. Different types of landforms of the
   island with concerned land use characteristics have been explored
   through direct field observation. The collected data were analyzed in
   ArcGIS. Field-level elevation data were collected with global
   positioning system (GPS) during the field visit, which was used for
   ground truthing. Secondary data sources include the tidal fluctuation
   data from the BNHOC and satellite images from Google Earth Pro. The
   research found rapid changes in the LULC with a sharp increase in built
   - up areas, and the average tidal fluctuation station value increased by
   0.30 metre from 1977 to 2018. This research also found that the total
   terrestrial area is decreasing due to sea - level rise (SLR). The
   landform over 3.50 metres is relatively safer from exposure to tidal
   fluctuation. This study concludes with recommendations to assess and
   identify the inundation level due to SLR and tidal fluctuation for
   formulating an effective coastal environment conservation policy.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry is a multidisciplinary effort to increase the overall
   production through a combination of trees and crops. This study attempts
   to find out the multifunctional role of agroforestry, such as productive
   role, services role and farmer's attitude towards agroforestry in
   District Dir Lower, Pakistan. For data collection, comprehensive
   questionnaire was used and 200 respondents were interviewed from 40
   villages through random sampling. Results showed that people highly
   preferred productive value and moderately preferred services value of
   agroforestry. According to the respondents feedback 83.5\% were owner of
   the land and cultivated the land themselves. The common irrigation
   system was rain fed (54.5\%) and 50.5\% of respondents were followed
   Agrosilvo system in the study area. The fast growing timber tree species
   (N=20-120) were Ailanthus altissima, Morus alba, and Populous nigra on
   their farmlands generating 20,000-40,000 PKR. (Pakistani rupees) income
   annually. From the fruit trees such as Juglans regia, Citrus species,
   and Prunus domestica income was 10,000-15,000 PKR annually. The majority
   36.5\% of respondents depended for fuel wood having PKR 5000-35,000.
   Different types of agricultural crops i.e. wheat, rice, maize, brassica
   and fodder crops along with farm trees were cultivated. Ecosystem
   services were reported by 89.6\% respondents with positive affect. It
   was concluded that agroforestry found best than traditional agriculture
   system in income generation. The percentages of land use classes were
   correlated with satellite classified data and found significant
   correlation with agroforestry services. This study will help in future
   in implementing agroforestry system in uplifting the socio economic
   condition of the community in study area.},

Title = {Assessing the Influence of Tourism-Driven Activities on Environmental
   Variables on Hainan Island, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tourism is a primary socio-economic factor on many coastal islands.
   Tourism contributes to the livelihoods of the residents, but also
   influences natural resources and energy consumption and can become a
   significant driver of land conversion and environmental change.
   Understanding the influence of tourist-related activities is vital for
   sustainable tourism development. We chose Hainan Island in South China
   as a research area to study the influence of tourist-driven activities
   on environmental variables (as Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and
   related ecosystem variables) during the period of 2000 to 2019. In
   Hainan, the local economy relies heavily on tourism, with an
   ever-growing influx of tourists each year. We categorised location-based
   points of interest (POIs) into two classes, non-tourism sites and
   tourism-related sites, and utilised satellite data from the cloud-based
   platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract LST and Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We analysed the LST variations,
   NDVI changes and the land use/land cover (LULC) changes and compared the
   relative difference in LST and NDVI between the tourism-related sites
   and non-tourism-related sites. The main findings of this study were: (1)
   The median LST in the tourism-related sites was relatively higher (1.3)
   than the LST in the non-tourism-related sites for the 20 years.
   Moreover, every annual mean LST of tourism-related sites was higher than
   the LST values in non-tourism-related sites, with an average difference
   of 1.2 degrees C for the 20 years and a maximum difference of 1.7
   degrees C. We found higher annual LST anomalies for tourist-related
   sites compared to non-tourism sites after 2010, which indicated the
   likely positive differences in LST above the average LST during 20 years
   for tourism-related sites when compared against the non-tourism related
   sites, thus highlighting the potential influence of tourism activities
   on LST. (2) The annual mean NDVI value for tourism-related sites was
   significantly lower than for non-tourism places every year, with an
   average NDVI difference of 0.26 between the two sites. (3) The land
   cover changed significantly: croplands and forests reduced by 3.5\% and
   2.8\% respectively, while the areas covered by orchards and urban areas
   increased by 2\% and 72.3\% respectively. These results indicate the
   influence of the tourism-driven activities includes the relatively high
   LST, vegetation degradation and land-use conversion particular to urban
   cover type. The outcome of this work provides a method that combines
   cloud-based satellite-derived data with location-based POIs data for
   quantifying the long-term influence of tourism-related activities on
   sensitive coastal ecosystems. It contributes to designing
   evidence-driven management plans and policies for the sustainable
   tourism development in coastal areas.},

Abstract = {To determine the proximate consequences of the limited breeding
   distribution of the critically endangered Waved Albatross (Phoebastria
   irrorata), we present continuous breeding season GPS tracks highlighting
   differences in behaviour, destinations, and distances travelled between
   three distinct colonies: two in Galapagos and one closer to the South
   American continent on Isla de la Plata, where a small number of pairs
   nest. Accelerometer data paired with GPS locations allowed operational
   classifications of Waved Albatross behaviour. All birds from Galapagos
   travelled eastward to the continental shelf and foraged southward along
   the Peruvian coast. Birds from Isla de la Plata made more and shorter
   foraging trips and used habitat north of the destinations of Galapagos
   birds. La Plata birds foraged in areas through which Galapagos birds
   commuted, and had slower average flight speeds and shorter commutes.
   Overall, albatrosses from La Plata might operate under a consistently
   lower return but they also incur lower costs compared to birds from
   Galapagos, which take fewer trips involving longer time investment.
   Galapagos birds may be able to forage more effectively based on more
   abundant or more profitable food patches in those highly productive
   areas. Foraging destinations of birds from the two Galapagos colonies
   were similar and overlapped areas that presented localized mortality
   risk from artisanal fisheries in previous years. This study, performed
   across the species' breeding range, reveals the different foraging
   distribution of La Plata albatrosses and the potential conservation
   value of this small colony in terms of maintenance of spatial diversity
   and behavioural plasticity.},

Abstract = {The development and growth of geospatial techniques offer many
   advantages and challenges to the study of biodiversity, especially in
   the present era of climate change. We are now at the beginning of the
   international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through
   the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring
   approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on
   biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising
   remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such
   as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based
   biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at
   landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has
   been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a
   three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial,
   phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were
   linked together based on their relative importance to stratify
   biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It
   has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling
   plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and
   organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have
   (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with
   the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional
   information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa
   and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES
   A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test
   site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24\% increase in the overall
   biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii)
   distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of
   shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of
   geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to
   incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the
   geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species
   distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast
   changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions.},

Abstract = {The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is regarded as one of the
   most critical water issues in downstream countries. While the GERD
   offers hopeful development chances for Ethiopia, the reduced flow of the
   Nile would exacerbate Egypt's current water shortage. Many stress
   factors are of particular interest for Egypt include population growth,
   global warming, economic expansion, and groundwater depletion. These
   factors represent significant challenges in the use and management of
   the primary water resource of the Nile Basin. The purpose of this study
   was to monitor the two phases of filling the GERD reservoir using VV
   polarized SAR data and ALOS global DEM. To achieve this aim, 14 scenes
   of Sentinel-1A imagery were processed using SNAP Toolbox. To
   automatically extract water bodies, a histogram of backscatter values
   (dB) in the VV band was developed to determine the optimal threshold
   value that separates water from non-water features. From our analysis,
   we observed that the pixels of backscatter values (dB) in the VV band
   lower than-18 dB were classified as water pixels. Also, the results
   showed that the volume of water at the GERD reservoir increased by
   approximately 4.12 billion m(3) during the period from August 2, 2020,
   to July 28, 2021. Our findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy
   for Sentinel-1 SAR data was 97\% and the kappa coefficient was 0.94.
   This study confirmed the efficiency of using SAR data to monitor the
   changes in the water volume during the filling process of the GERD
   reservoir and its impacts on downstream countries.(c) 2021 National

Title = {The impacts of the ecological water diversion project on the

Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyse the comprehensive effects of an ecological
   water diversion project (EWDP) and its driving mechanism since 2000 in
   Heihe River Basin (HRB) in Northwest China. We compared the
   hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic changes in the period of
   1985-2015, revealed the relationships between them using linear
   regression method, and discussed their internal mechanisms referring to
   the long-term monitoring data, statistics data, field surveys and remote
   sensing data. We found that the hydrological regime in the region
   downstream of Langxinshan Hydrological Station (LXS region) in the lower
   HRB has changed, with an increase of annual discharge as well as obvious
   differences in the infra-annual distribution of monthly runoff. As a
   result, the groundwater level in most of the LXS region has risen, but
   the changes of the chemical characteristics of the groundwater were not
   significant. Meanwhile, the vegetation has been remarkably restored, and
   the water and wetland continually expanded suggesting that the degraded
   environment in the LXS region has gradually been rehabilitated.
   Additionally, the regional economy has developed rapidly, with a rapid
   increase of value-added tertiary industry due to the explosive growth of
   the tourist population. Along with the EWDP, other policies and projects
   have played an important role in restoring the ecology. The
   hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic systems have formed
   feedback loops in the LXS region, but there is still need to coordinate
   the relationships between water resource, ecosystem and socio-economy by
   considering water carrying capacity and water production efficiency and
   thinking of them as a nexus.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},

Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems have emerged as an established
   tool within the construction industry. Concurrent with this trend has
   been the rise in research on RPA, establishing this as a new field of
   study within the construction management domain. What is needed now is
   an assessment of the current state of research in this emerging
   discipline - its strengths and weaknesses - by which future research on
   RPA in construction may be guided. The purpose of this paper is to
   address this need.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A total of 59 peer-reviewed journal articles covering RPAs within the
   construction domain were systematically reviewed using a mixed-methods
   approach, utilizing qualitative-scientometric analyses techniques.
   Findings
   The results reveal a field of study in its fledgling stage, with a
   limited number of experts operating somewhat in isolation, from a
   limited number of institutions. Key publication outlets are identified,
   with the main focus of research being in the technical areas of remote
   sensing, photogrammetry and image processing.
   Practical implications - The study benefits researchers and industry
   practitioners alike. For researchers, the identified gaps reveal areas
   of high priority in future research. For construction companies,
   particularly small to medium-sized businesses, the study raises
   awareness of the latest developments and potential applicability of RPAs
   in the industry.
   Originality/value
   The study exposes what is missing from current research: a broader
   consideration of organizational adjustments needed to accommodate RPA
   usage, economic analyses and impediments to wider acceptance.},

   cultured meat},
Journal = {SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cultured meat is meat produced from stem cell biopsies of cattle. Stem
   cells were cultured in a bioreactor in the presence of serum to grow the
   flesh to maturity. Cultured meat technology originated from regenerative
   medical technology; however, it has been given a new lease of life to
   produce cultured meat as an innovative food source in the future without
   involving cattle breeding. This technology can reduce the negative
   environmental impacts of global warming, water use, soil, and unethical
   handling of animals. In the excitement of accepting this new technology,
   the halal status of cultured meat is in question, as it can be produced
   from embryonic stem cells and myosatellite cells, each of which can be
   disputed for their halal status. Additionally, the process of culturing
   and maturation of stem cells involves the use of an impure medium
   derived from animal blood. Thus, cultured meat is acceptable to Muslims
   only if the stem cells, medium and scaffold biomaterials used to
   manufacture it are from Halal sources and shall be in line with the six
   principles discussed in this study. The discussion is based on Halal and
   haram animals; Animal slaughtering; Not derived from a source of najs
   (impurity); Istihalah tammah (perfect substance change); Maslahah
   (public interest or benefit) and mafsadah (damage); and Darurat
   (exigency) of cultured meat)). (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

   Botswana},

Abstract = {Recent trends in abrupt weather changes continue to pose a challenge to
   agricultural production most especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper
   specifically addresses the questions on how local farmers read and
   predict the weather; and how they can collaborate with weather
   scientists in devising adaptation strategies for climate variability
   (CV) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Recent trends in
   agriculture-related weather variables available from country's climate
   services, as well as in freely available satellite rainfall products
   were analysed. The utility of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system
   for the study area in the context of supporting farmer's information
   needs were assessed. Through a multi-stage sampling procedure, a total
   of 592 households heads in 8 rural communities in the Okavango Delta
   were selected and interviewed using open and close-ended interview
   schedules. Also, 19 scientists were purposively selected and interviewed
   using questionnaires. Key informant interviews, focus group and
   knowledge validation workshops were used to generate qualitative
   information from both farmers and scientists. Descriptive and
   inferential statistics were used in summarising the data. Analysis of
   satellite rainfall products indicated that there was a consistent
   increase in total annual rainfall throughout the region in the last 10
   years, accompanied by an increase in number of rain days, and reduction
   of duration of dry spells. However, there is a progressive increase in
   the region's temperatures leading to increase in potential evaporation.
   Findings from social surveys show that farmers' age, education level,
   number of years engaged in farming, sources of weather information,
   knowledge of weather forecasting and decision on farming practices
   either had a significant relationship or correlation with their
   perceptions about the nature of both local {[}ethno-meteorological] and
   scientific weather knowledge. Nonetheless, there was a significant
   difference in the mean scores of farmers in relation to their
   perceptions and those of the climate scientists about the nature of both
   local and Western knowledge. As farmers are adept at judging seasonal
   patterns through long-standing ethno-meteorology, one major CV
   adaptation measure is their ability to anticipate changes in future
   weather conditions, which enables them to adjust their farming calendars
   and make decisions on crop type selection in any given season. (C) 2014

Title = {Effective management of slums- Case study of Kalaburagi city, Karnataka,

Abstract = {As urbanization grows, we may expect that slums will tend to grow even
   faster. Kalaburagi is a second tier city and an important commercial hub
   for the Hyderabad-Karnataka region located in the north eastern part of
   Karnataka state. It attracts the rural folk from neighbouring districts
   and the city is undergoing rapid changes in terms of population growth
   as well as in the degree of urbanization due to which the slum
   population is increasing. There are 60 slums that account for 11\% of
   city's population. This study aims to contribute some sustainable
   methodologies for better execution of slum development programs to
   advance the living conditions of slum dwellers.
   Slum ontology has been built to identify slums from very high-resolution
   satellite data that will benefit all stakeholders. The developed
   ontology was validated with field survey and the help of field
   photographs, the physical and socio-economic conditions were documented.
   As per the slum ontology, basic inputs for the Cellular Automata (CA)
   model were identified and criteria maps with scores were generated. The
   suitability map was created by giving appropriate weight to the factors.
   When the slum map prepared based on slum ontology was overlaid on the
   final results, the CA model output has given reliable results regarding
   current slum distribution and also a hint of the possible occurrence of
   slums in the future. Since the proposed land use plan for 2021 has been
   finalized by the Urban Local Body (ULB), the suitable area for
   developing affordable housing stock was suggested for preventing slums
   from arising. The Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) was built for
   selecting slum development options. The design and running of the SDSS
   model were demonstrated with one case study - Borabai nagar slum to
   enable the ULB to apply the approach to other slum areas for effective
   implementation of slum development programs.},

Abstract = {The boundary of land and water in a remote sensing image is defined as
   water front. Picking up the water front plays an important role in
   comprehensive management of waterline, strengthening of the ability in
   resisting nature disaster, and the research of waterline's environmental
   change. Using RS methods to pick up water front has advantages of
   wide-range, high-precision, and ability of dynamic monitoring. Based on
   TM/ETM+ RS multi-spectrum images, combined with the characteristic of
   water front, the dissertation carries through water front pick-up
   approach study, and forms the water front picked-up approach based on
   the improved embedded confidence. This approach makes full use of
   spectrum eigenvalue of the image, and proposes the elementary water
   front pick-up approach; then uses the approach of embedded confidence,
   finally, realizes the automatic pick-up of water front. The main study
   content and conclusion are listed as follows: coastline characters and
   the basic mentality of water front pick-up are briefly narrated, and
   also the main methods of the water front pick-up at home and abroad in
   recent years are introduced. After analyzing kinds of methods, the
   dissertation uses the combination of spectrum-photometric method and
   embedded confidence to pick up the water front. On the basis of
   analyzing the gray value in each band of TM image, spectrum-photometric
   method will be used first to pick up water body, removing part of noise
   in the precondition of picking up full of the water, and then, using the
   approach of embedded confidence to pick up waterline, during the
   process, the grad magnitude information is the main basis. The result
   indicates that: (1) the approach based on improved embedded confidence
   is feasible in practice; (2) this approach can detect the water front by
   rule and line, also can restrain the noise effectively; (3) because the
   study does not have the subjective infection by the researchers, so the
   water front pick-up result is more exact and impersonality.},

Title = {The long-term development of temperate woodland creation sites: from
   tree saplings to mature woodlands},
Journal = {FORESTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tree planting is at the forefront of the current environmental agenda to
   mitigate climate change and tackle the biodiversity crisis. In the
   United Kingdom (UK), tree planting has been a priority for more than a
   century and has helped increase woodland cover from a historic low of 5
   per cent at the beginning of the 20th century to a current figure of 13
   per cent. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term
   development of woodland creation sites (particularly of native
   woodlands) over ecologically realistic timescales. We surveyed a
   chronosequence of 133 temperatewoodland patches encompassing 106woodland
   creation sites (10-160 years old) and 27 mature `ancient' woodlands
   (>250 years old), using a combination of field surveys and remote
   sensing techniques to quantify vegetation structural changes associated
   with woodland development. Woodland creation sites displayed similar
   vegetation development patterns to those described for other woodland
   systems, i.e. a gradual transition as woodlands undergo `stand
   initiation', `stem exclusion' and `understorey reinitiation' stages, and
   became more similar to `ancient' woodlands over time. Structural
   heterogeneity, average tree size and tree density were the attributes
   that varied the most among woodland developmental stages. In general,
   structural heterogeneity and average tree size increased with woodland
   age, whilst tree density decreased as would be expected. Younger sites
   in stand initiation were strongly dominated by short vegetation, stem
   exclusion sites by taller trees and older sites had a more even
   vegetation height distribution. There was a large degree of overlap
   between the vegetation characteristics of woodlands in understorey
   re-initiation stages and older ancient woodlands (partly driven by a
   lack of regeneration in the understorey); these results suggest that it
   takes between 80 and 160 years for woodland creation sites to develop
   certain vegetation attributes similar to those of mature ancient
   woodlands included in this study. Woodland management practices to
   create canopy gaps and reducing grazing/browsing pressure to promote
   natural regeneration are likely to accelerate this transition, increase
   the structural heterogeneity and biodiversity value ofwoodland creation
   sites and enable adaptation and resilience to climate change.},

Title = {Public libraries and difficulties with targeting the homeless},
Journal = {LIBRARY REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {7-18},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to consider the potential for public library
   policies that specifically target ``the homeless{''} to undermine their
   own objectives, and seeks to suggest alternative approaches to extend
   inclusion and ensure that all demographics are served equally.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper was written for a satellite
   meeting of the 78th IFLA Congress entitled ``The Homeless and the
   Libraries - the Right to Information and Knowledge For All{''}. Drawing
   on previous research detailed in Muggleton, and Muggleton and Ruthven,
   the author presents a discursive perspective on the impact that
   assumptions about homelessness might have for policymaking.
   Findings - Extant prejudices and the tendency to create a homeless
   ``other{''} mean that policies specifically addressing the homeless have
   the potential to accentuate difference and patronise and alienate the
   intended beneficiaries of these policies. Moreover, political opposition
   to more inclusive, accommodating policymaking makes it important to
   reject assumptions and prejudices that weaken one's own position.
   Grounding policymaking in the empirical experience of homeless library
   users is argued to be the most effective way to extend inclusion, and
   also avoid false dichotomies and the perpetuation of prejudice.
   Originality/value - Insights into unconscious assumptions gathered from
   previous research have been applied to the conceptualisation and
   implementation of public library policy. The arguments presented in the
   paper will hopefully be of use both for developing effective policies
   and for defending policies relating to homeless library users.},

Title = {Distribution modelling of vegetation types based on area frame survey

Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall
   vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and
   nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological
   models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the
   required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping
   is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we
   therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM)
   methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation
   types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca.
   324,000 km(2). Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different
   VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular
   plots of 0.9 km(2). Distribution models for each VT were obtained by
   logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection
   with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in
   100 m x 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by
   applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results
   Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest
   AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest,
   whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather
   spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than
   common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones.
   Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial
   prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a
   regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided
   relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential
   uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international
   vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may
   improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system
   models.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {The mangroves from Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to Kranji Dam represent
   the largest intact mangrove forest left on mainland Singapore. Mangroves
   colonized the area around 6820 BP, as sea level rose following the last
   glacial maximum and a variable thickness of Holocene sands, muds and
   peats (generally similar to1 to >3.8 m thick) were deposited over the
   pre-transgression land surface.
   An analysis of a time series of photographs covering the period from
   1946 to 2001 has revealed major changes in the distribution of mangroves
   in the area resulting from development-induced changes in the local
   hydrodynamic regime and clearance for aquaculture. Mangroves covered
   117.3 ha in the study area in 1946 and were actively advancing over the
   coastal mudflats until 1980. Despite the addition of 6.24 ha from
   mangrove colonization, the total area covered by mangroves was reduced
   by similar to50\% by 1980 due to clearance for aquaculture. Following
   1980, a reduction in sediment supply possibly due to the construction of
   the Kranji Dam, immediately cast of the study area, led to the
   initiation of erosion along much of the coastline, with the mangrove
   fringe having retreated by up to 50 m in 2001. Establishment of the
   wetland reserve in 1992 enabled the partial regeneration of mangroves in
   the area to 86.8 ha, 25\% less than in 1946.
   Three areas of undisturbed old growth mangroves >55 years in age have
   been identified and are considered to be of high conservation value. Two
   of these areas are within the current boundaries of the Sungei Buloh
   Wetland Reserve, but are located along coastal areas that are undergoing
   severe erosion. The third area is located in the south of the study
   area, protected from coastal erosion, but outside the current nature
   reserve boundary and hence is susceptible to loss as a result of future
   development. This third area is possibly the oldest undisturbed fragment
   of mangrove forest on mainland Singapore. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Desertification of Iran in the early twenty-first century: assessment
   using climate and vegetation indices},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Remote sensing of specific climatic and biogeographical parameters is an
   effective means of evaluating the large-scale desertification status of
   drylands affected by negative human impacts. Here, we identify and
   analyze desertification trends in Iran for the period 2001-2015 via a
   combination of three indices for vegetation (NPP-net primary production,
   NDVI-normalized difference vegetation index, LAI-leaf area index) and
   two climate indices (LST-land surface temperature, P-precipitation). We
   combine these indices to identify and map areas of Iran that are
   susceptible to land degradation. We then apply a simple linear
   regression method, the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test, and the
   Theil-Sen estimator to identify long-term temporal and spatial trends
   within the data. Based on desertification map, we find that 68\% of Iran
   shows a high to very high susceptibility to desertification,
   representing an area of 1.1 million km(2) (excluding 0.42 million km(2)
   classified as unvegetated). Our results highlight the importance of
   scale in assessments of desertification, and the value of
   high-resolution data, in particular. Annually, no significant change is
   evident within any of the five indices, but significant changes (some
   positive, some negative) become apparent on a seasonal basis. Some
   observations follow expectations; for instance, NDVI is strongly
   associated with cooler, wet spring and summer seasons, and milder
   winters. Others require more explanation; for instance, vegetation
   appears decoupled from climatic forcing during autumn. Spatially, too,
   there is much local and regional variation, which is lost when the data
   are considered only at the largest nationwide scale. We identify a
   northwest-southeast belt spanning central Iran, which has experienced
   significant vegetation decline (2001-2015). We tentatively link this
   belt of land degradation with intensified agriculture in the hinterlands
   of Iran's major cities. The spatial and temporal trends identified with
   the three vegetation and two climate indices afford a cost-effective
   framework for the prediction and management of future environmental
   trends in developing regions at risk of desertification.},

Title = {New capabilities of Sentinel-2A/B satellites combined with in situ data
   for monitoring small harmful algal blooms in complex coastal waters},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {The increased frequency of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is a major
   environmental concern worldwide, resulting not only in increased
   treatment costs for drinking water but also in impacts on tourism,
   commercial fishing and aquaculture and risks to human and animal health.
   Traditional strategies with ship-based approaches based on field
   sampling and laboratory analysis have been adopted to assess HABs.
   However, these methods are labour intensive and costly and do not
   provide synoptic views of the bloom conditions. Here, we show that the
   Sentinel-2 twin satellite mission of the Copernicus programme, in
   combination with in situ data, is a powerful tool that can offer
   valuable spatiotemporal information about a bloom of the dinoflagellate
   Lingulodinium polyedra that occurred on the SW Iberian Peninsula. Using
   the robust ACOLITE atmospheric correction processor combined with the
   normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), the enhanced mapping of
   small blooms can be performed at a 10 m spatial resolution, revealing
   surface patches and a heterogeneous distribution. This research also
   demonstrates the improved capabilities of Sentinel-2 compared to those
   of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-3 for continuous monitoring. The Sentinel-3
   and Sentinel-2 missions provide ecosystem observations that allow the
   environmental community and water managers to evaluate changes in water
   quality and bloom distribution and that facilitate field-based
   measurements. Therefore, the value added by the Copernicus products in
   terms of frequency and synoptic observations is of paramount importance
   for ecological and management purposes at regional and national scales.},

Title = {A high-resolution physical modelling approach to assess runoff and soil
   erosion in vineyards under different soil managements},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Steep-slope viticulture is a common practice in the Mediterranean basin,
   and provides landscapes of considerable socio-economic value. However,
   these complex agricultural systems are intrinsically fragile. One of the
   main problems is soil erosion due to extreme rainfall events. This may
   cause a progressive reduction in soil fertility and the occurrence of
   instabilities and land degradation phenomena. To worsen this condition
   there is the increasing mechanisation of agricultural management causing
   soil compaction, and the pressure of climate change, with an
   intensification of extreme weather events. In this context, vineyard
   soil management plays a key role, as it can accelerate or mitigate
   overland flow and soil erosion phenomena. There are various techniques
   for quantifying these processes, often based on field measurements
   through prolonged data collection using experimental plots. However, the
   advent of new technologies in remote sensing opens new frontiers in the
   acquisition of highresolution spatial data. Indeed, they could be used
   in runoff/erosion simulation models and integrated with site-specific
   data. The aim of this paper is to assess runoff and soil erosion
   processes in vineyard under four different soil managements.
   Specifically, four practices were tested: (1) Reference (inter-row
   managed with standard farm grass cover; RF); (2) Continuous Tillage
   (bare soil obtained by continuous mechanical weeding using roto-tiller;
   CT); Nectariferous (a mix of herbaceous species capable of attracting
   insects favouring inter-row biodiversity; NF); (4) Single Tillage
   (inter-row weeding once a year using roto-tiller; ST). The research
   proposes a modelling approach using a physically-based model (SIMWE)
   using samples of runoff and sediment as an assessment, collected with a
   low-cost methodology. In particular, a cost-effective approach easily
   replicable in different contexts (such as developing countries) is
   sought. In addition to cultivation specifics, areas of soil compacted by
   the passage of agricultural vehicles were also analysed using the
   connectivity index. In general, results show an interesting capacity of
   ST in mitigating soil erosion, as well as for NF. Furthermore, the
   negative role of wheel tracks as preferential pathways for surface
   runoff and sediment is highlighted. Finally, the work shows that CT
   aggravated soil erosion as compared to RF.},

Title = {Development and application of the soil moisture routing (SMR) model to
   identify subfield-scale hydrologic classes in dryland cropping systems
   using the Budyko framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {573},
Pages = {153-167},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems
   often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and
   subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of
   saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath
   the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit
   representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from
   site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the
   grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an
   established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework,
   for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with
   spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements
   in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse
   region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified
   to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was
   combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a
   dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer
   management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact.
   Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss
   potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape
   through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively.
   Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed
   within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability
   was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of
   each had water supply 172\% and 137\% that of the dry zone. Depth to a
   hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary
   landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral
   flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep
   climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in
   water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation
   ranging from 91\% in the western-most field to approximately 70\% in
   each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to
   apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high
   crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is
   minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water
   storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage
   capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and
   minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting
   fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses.
   Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the
   frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all
   dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for
   inspiration in the design of cropping systems.},

Abstract = {Photographic identification was used to track the movements of the
   whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari around South Caicos, Turks and
   Caicos Islands. A total of 165 individuals were identified, aided by the
   computer program (IS)-S-3 Spot. The sex ratio across all study sites in
   2015 was not significantly different from 1:1 (x(2)=28, P>005). 339\% of
   all individual rays were resighted at least once and the maximum number
   of days between the first and last sighting was 1640 (median 165,
   interquartile range, IQR=698). Sightings of individuals occurred at
   locations differing from the original sighting location 246\% of the
   time (07-20km away). The entire population around South Caicos has yet
   to be sampled and these rays exhibited site affinity during the study

Title = {The application of land use regression model to investigate
   spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 in Guangzhou, China: Implications for
   the public health benefits of PM2.5 reduction},

Abstract = {Understanding the intra-city variation of PM2.5 is important for air
   quality management and exposure assessment. In this study, to
   investigate the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 in Guangzhou, we
   developed land use regression (LUR) models using data from 49 routine
   air quality monitoring stations. The R-2, adjust R-2 and 10-fold cross
   validation R-2 for the annual PM2.5 LUR model were 0.78, 0.72 and 0.66,
   respectively, indicating the robustness of the model. In all the LUR
   models, traffic variables (e.g., length of main road and the distance to
   nearest ancillary) were the most common variables in the LUR models,
   suggesting vehicle emission was the most important contributor to PM2.5
   and controlling vehicle emissions would be an effective way to reduce
   PM2.5. The predicted PM2.5 exhibited significant variations with
   different land uses, with the highest value for impervious surfaces,
   followed by green land, cropland, forest and water areas. Guangzhou as
   the third largest city that PM2.5 concentration has achieved CAAQS Grade
   II guideline in China, it represents a useful case study city to
   ex-amine the health and economic benefits of further reduction of PM2.5
   to the lower concentration ranges. So, the health and economic benefits
   of reducing PM2.5 in Guangzhou was further estimated using the BenMAP
   model, based on the annual PM2.5 concentration predicted by the LUR
   model. The results showed that the avoided all cause mortalities were
   992 cases (95\% CI: 221-2140) and the corresponding economic benefits
   were 1478 million CNY (95\% CI: 257-2524) (willingness to pay approach)
   if the annual PM2.5 concentration can be reduced to the annual CAAQS
   Grade I guideline value of 15 mu g/m(3). Our results are expected to
   provide valuable information for further air pollution control
   strategies in China. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System (GH-LPS) is a
   ground-based positioning system, it can provide high-precision, high
   reliability, and high environmental adaptability independently within a
   limited area. The location services to make up for space-based
   navigation systems on the ground are limited by many factors. It mainly
   uses the carrier phase measurement value for positioning. To ensure its
   stable performance, it is necessary to detect and repair the cycle slip
   caused by high dynamics, signal impairments, and loss of lock on the
   signal. Therefore, in this paper, we establish the integration
   positioning model of Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning
   System /INS, we propose a method for using the inertial information to
   assist the Ground-based High-precision Local Positioning System for
   cycle slip detection. We use the position information predicted by the
   INS to calculate the cycle slip detection decision, and use the
   hypothesis test to determine whether the cycle slip occurs and correctly
   identify the size and position of the occurrence of the cycle slip. The
   experimental analysis of the simulated and measured scenes validates the
   performance of the proposed algorithm for cycle slip detection,
   effectively detects the occurrence of small cycle slip. For the effect
   of different noise variance, the cycle slip detection method proposed in
   this paper can also keep the probability of accurate detection of cycle
   slips above 86\%. From the positioning result, detection and repair of
   cycle slip can improve positioning accuracy by 64\%.},

Title = {Routine implementation costs of larviciding with Bacillus thuringiensis
   israelensis against malaria vectors in a district in rural Burkina Faso},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background: The key tools in malaria control are early diagnosis and
   treatment of cases as well as vector control. Current strategies for
   malaria vector control in sub-Saharan Africa are largely based on
   long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and to a much smaller
   extent on indoor residual spraying (IRS). An additional tool in the
   fight against malaria vectors, larval source management (LSM), has not
   been used in sub-Saharan Africa on a wider scale since the abandonment
   of environmental spraying of DDT. Increasing concerns about limitations
   of LLINs and IRS and encouraging results from large larvicide-based LSM
   trials make a strong case for using biological larviciding as a
   complementary tool to existing control measures. Arguments that are
   often quoted against such a combined approach are the alleged high
   implementation costs of LSM. This study makes the first step to test
   this argument. The implementation costs of larval source management
   based on Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) (strain AM65-52)
   spraying under different implementation scenarios were analysed in a
   rural health district in Burkina Faso.
   Methods: The analysis draws on detailed cost data gathered during a
   large-scale LSM intervention between 2013 and 2015. All 127 villages in
   the study setup were assigned to two treatment arms and one control
   group. Treatment either implied exhaustive spraying of all available
   water collections or targeted spraying of the 50 \% most productive
   larval sources via remote-sensing derived and entomologically validated
   risk maps. Based on the cost reports from both intervention arms, the
   per capita programme costs were calculated under the assumption of
   covering the whole district with either intervention scenario. Cost
   calculations have been generalized by providing an adaptable cost
   formula. In addition, this study assesses the sensitivity of per capita
   programme costs with respect to changes in the underlying cost
   components.
   Results: The average annual per capita costs of exhaustive larviciding
   with Bti during the main malaria transmission period (June-October) in
   the Nouna health district were calculated to be US\$ 1.05. When targeted
   spraying of the 50 \% most productive larval sources is used instead,
   average annual per capita costs decrease by 27 \% to US\$ 0.77.
   Additionally, a high sensitivity of per capita programme costs against
   changes in total surface of potential larval sources and the number of
   spraying repetitions was found.
   Discussion: The per capita costs for larval source management
   interventions with Bti are roughly a third of the annual per capita
   expenditures for anti-malarial drugs and those for LLINs in Burkina Faso
   which are US\$ 3.80 and 3.00, respectively. The average LSM costs
   compare to those of IRS and LLINs for sub-Saharan Africa. The authors
   argue that in such a setting LSM based on Bti spraying is within the
   range of affordable anti-malarial strategies and, consequently, should
   deserve more attention in practice. Future research includes a
   cost-benefit calculation, based on entomological and epidemiological
   data collected during the research project.},

Abstract = {Nowadays remote sensing is a well-established method and technique of
   providing data. The current development shows the availability of
   systems with very high geometric resolution for the monitoring of
   vegetation. At the same time, however, the value of temporally
   high-resolution data is underestimated, particularly in applications
   focusing on the detection of short-term changes. These can be natural
   processes like natural disasters as well as changes caused by
   anthropogenic interventions. These include economic activities such as
   forestry, agriculture or mining but also processes which are intended to
   convert previously used areas into natural or near-natural surfaces. The
   Konigsbrucker Heide is a former military training site located about 30
   km north of the Saxon state capitol Dresden. After the withdrawal of the
   Soviet forces in 1992 and after nearly 100 years of military use this
   site was declared as nature reserve in 1996. The management of the whole
   protection area is implemented in three different management zone. Based
   on MODIS-NDVI time series between 2000 and 2016 different developments
   are apparent in the nature development zone and the zone of controlled
   succession. Nevertheless, the analyses also show that short-term
   changes, so called breaks in the vegetation development cannot be
   described using linear trend models. The complete understanding of
   vegetation trends is only given if discontinuities in vegetation
   development are considered. Structural breaks in the NDVI time series
   can be found simultaneously in the whole study area. Hence it can be
   assumed that these breaks have a more natural character, caused for
   example by climatic conditions like temperature or precipitation.
   Otherwise, especially in the zone of controlled succession structural
   breaks can be detected which cannot be traced back to natural
   conditions. Final analyses of the spatial distribution of breakpoints as
   well as their frequency depending on the respective protection zone
   allow a detailed view to vegetation development in the Konigsbrucker
   Heide.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of large fire (> 100 ha) incidence in
   Portugal over the period 1984-2004 were modeled using extreme value
   statistics, namely the Peaks Over Threshold approach, which uses the
   Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) as a model. The original dataset
   includes all fires larger than 5 ha (30 616 fires) that were observed in
   Portugal during the study period, mapped from Landsat satellite imagery.
   The country was divided into eight regions, considered internally
   homogeneous from the perspective of their fire regimes and respective
   environmental correlates. The temporal analysis showed that there does
   not appear to be any trend in the incidence of very large fires, but
   revealed a cyclical behavior in the values of the GPD shape parameter,
   with a period in the range of 3 to 5 years. Spatial analysis highlighted
   strong regional differences in the incidence of large fires, and allowed
   the calculation of return levels for a range of fire sizes. This
   analysis was affected by the presence of a few outlying observations,
   which may correspond to clusters of contiguous fire scars, resulting in
   artificially large burned areas. We discuss some of the implications of
   our findings in terms of consequences for fire management aimed at
   preventing the occurrence of extremely large fires, and present ideas
   for extending the present study.},

Title = {Assessing land degradation induced by recreational activities in the
   Algodones Dunes, California using MODIS satellite imagery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},

Abstract = {This research investigated spatial and temporal environmental changes
   associated with climatic variability and off-highway vehicle (OHV)
   activity in the Algodones Dunes, California, using time-series analysis
   of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery from 2001 to
   2016. We compared changes in land cover, surface albedo, and surface
   temperatures between the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area (ISDRA) and
   areas with no OHV activity in the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness area
   (NADW). Both areas showed a decreasing normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI) and an increasing albedo from 2001 to 2016; however, ISDRA
   had a lower NDVI value and higher albedo compared to the adjacent NADW.
   Transects across these adjoining areas revealed substantial differences
   in daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures. ISDRA had an
   appreciably higher mean daytime temperature and a lower mean nighttime
   temperature compared to those within NADW. Results suggest direct
   association between increasing OHV activity and reduced vegetation
   cover, increased soil exposure, and higher daytime temperatures in the
   Algodones Dunes. We recommend enhanced monitoring of ecosystem and land
   use changes coupled with enhanced land use management to reduce the
   contributions of recreational OHV activity on land degradation and to
   maintain habitat for key species and ecosystems of interest in the dune
   field.},

Title = {Application of Database Approaches to the Study of Earth's Aeolian
   Environments: Community Needs and Goals},
Journal = {AEOLIAN RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {79-109},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aeolian science is faced with significant challenges that impact its
   ability to benefit from recent advances in information technology. The
   discipline deals with high-end systems in the form of ground and
   satellite based sensors, computer modeling and simulation, and wind
   tunnel experiments. Aeolian scientists also collect field data manually
   with observational methods that may differ significantly between studies
   with little agreement on even basic morphometric parameters and
   terminology. Data produced from these studies, while forming the core of
   research papers and reports, is rarely available to the community at
   large. Recent advances are also superimposed on an underlying semantic
   structure that dates to the 1800's or earlier that is confusing, with
   ambiguously defined, and at times even contradictory, meanings.
   The aeolian ``world-view{''} does not always fit within neat increments
   nor is defined by crisp objects. Instead change is continuous and
   features are fuzzy. Development of an ontological framework to guide
   spatiotemporal research is the fundamental starting point for organizing
   data in aeolian science. This requires a ``rethinking{''} of how we
   define, collect, process, store and share data along with the
   development of a community-wide collaborative approach designed to bring
   the discipline into a data rich future. There is also a pressing need to
   develop efficient methods to integrate, analyze and manage spatial and
   temporal data and to promote data produced by aeolian scientists so it
   is available for preparing diagnostic studies, as input into a range of
   environmental models, and for advising national and international bodies
   that drive research agendas. This requires the establishment of working
   groups within the discipline to deal with content, format, processing
   pipelines, knowledge discovery tools and database access issues unique
   to aeolian science.
   Achieving this goal requires the development of comprehensive and
   highly-organized databases, tools that allow aeolian scientists as well
   as those in related disciplines to access and analyze the wealth of data
   available, and a supporting infrastructure and community-wide effort
   that allows aeolian scientists to communicate their results in
   replicable ways to scientists and decision and policy makers.
   Fortunately, much of the groundwork required to move aeolian science
   into a data rich future has been developed in other data rich physical
   science fields, and within the computer science and information
   technology disciplines. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the transition from deforestation to forest regrowth with an
   agent-based model of land cover change for south-central Indiana (USA)},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {819-832},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Midwest and Northeast United States has experienced a net increase
   in forest cover since the beginning of the 20th century. However, we
   lack a detailed understanding of the transition to net forest cover
   increase because this forest regrowth occurred prior to the use of tools
   like household-level surveys focused on land use decision-making and
   availability of remote sensing data. Agent-based modeling presents an
   appealing means to explore what social and biophysical dynamics may have
   contributed to this forest regrowth process. In this paper we employ an
   agent-based model to analyze the process of forest regrowth in
   south-central Indiana from 1939 to 1993. Simulation results are
   presented for assumptions regarding pre-existing forest age and the
   stand age at which landowners harvest timber with a goal of
   understanding the influence of these factors on future trajectories of
   land cover change. The results demonstrate both the value and the burden
   of having many time points to evaluate the success of the model. Is the
   best simulation the one with the smallest net residuals across all time
   points? Or is the best simulation the one that best reproduces the
   correct trajectory of land cover change for each time interval? Model
   simulations that assume a harvesting frequency of 30 years all produced
   landscapes within 2\% of the actual forest cover in 1993, the end point
   of the study period. However, the trajectories of these simulations did
   not all mimic the gradual forest regrowth found in our observed data.
   The model simulation with the smallest residual values across all time
   points assumed a initial forest age of 5 years in 1939 and a harvesting
   frequency of 30 years. Ultimately, we cannot definitively conclude that
   one model simulation is a better representation of reality than another
   because we have no way of comprehensively validating the model
   assumptions. However, we can more plausibly conclude that the age of
   forest regrowth in 1939 and the frequency of timber harvesting by
   landowners both had an influence on the successive trajectory of land
   cover change in the study area. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Evaluation of future climate using SDSM and secondary data (TRMM and
   NCEP) for poorly gauged catchments of Uganda: the case of Aswa catchment},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {137},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {2029-2048},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Forecast rise in global temperature is expected to have variable spatial
   and temporal impacts on rainfall patterns and crop productivity. In Aswa
   catchment, with a population of over two million, of which 70\% are
   peasant farmers, there are concerns about increasing frequency of
   droughts, food shortage, and famine. However, hydro-climate data over
   the catchment are insufficient and often inconsistent to be used for
   spatial hydrological modeling and water resource management. This study
   explores the use of secondary data, such as the Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data, to generate future climatic
   information over Aswa catchment. This is achieved by interrogating the
   relationships between these secondary datasets and the available station
   data and using the secondary data to downscale two General Circulation
   Models (GCMs): Hadley Centre Coupled Model 3 and Canadian Earth System
   Model with Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM). Correlation
   coefficients between secondary and station data lie between 0.75 and
   0.85. Calibration and validation of the SDSM are satisfactory. For
   instance, Agago location gave correlation coefficient value of
   0.64-0.96, standard error for temperature of 0.37-1.30 degrees C, and
   monthly rainfall of 23-45mm. By 2099, minimum temperature is expected to
   rise by 3.25 degrees C and maximum temperature by 1.95 degrees C above
   the 2015 value. The annual rainfall coefficient of variability lies
   between 14 and 56\%. These results suggest that the future temperature
   and rainfall patterns over Aswa catchment are likely to depart from the
   present and produce extreme events and challenges.},

Abstract = {GolMexSur, a metadatabase for the oceanographic and meteorological
   information of the southern Gulf of Mexico (SGM) (17N 85W - 26N 99W) was
   designed and implemented in order to organize and manage in a fine and
   regular mesh, oceanic and meteorological data coming from several
   heterogeneous gross-grid-sized or sparse data sources. The metadatabase
   has three organizational components: (1) knowledge base, (2) metadata,
   and (3) data values. Knowledge base component contains three classes of
   knowledge: operating knowledge (triggers, processes, and integrity
   constraints), control knowledge for sequential systems interactions, and
   decision knowledge for parallel systems interactions. Metadata component
   contains organizational information related to the environmental and
   hydrological data: data's spatial and temporal location, measurement
   units, obtaining method, quality, etc. Finally, data values component
   represents the numerical value of each variable or parameter (sea
   surface temperature, wind speed, wind direction, sea level pressure,
   etc). Additionally, metadata and data values components have two
   temporal scopes: recent information, and historical information.
   GolMexSur has information from sources such as coastal airports, coastal
   meteorological stations, oceanographic cruises, buoys, wave gauges, and
   information derived or estimated from satellite imageries or numerical
   models. In a first stage, GolMexSur was designed and implemented using
   MS Visual FoxPro(@), but recently the design was modified to work with
   Oracle(@). The implementation of this metadatabase represents the first
   step of a major project, whose main objective is to build a regional
   operational oceanographic system for the SGM, and at present it is being
   used in studying the oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the SGM oil
   region.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is taking place faster, and urban air temperatures are
   gradually rising in all cities across the world. Uncontrolled and
   unplanned urbanization leads to constant environmental threats and can
   alter local and regional climates. According to the survey published by
   Economist Intelligence Unit, in India, Keralas Malappuram district ranks
   first among the fastest-growing urban areas globally, with a 44.05\%
   growth rate. Hence, the present study aims to identify the hotspot
   regions of extreme heat within the Malappuram urban agglomeration region
   and suggest strategies for its improvement. The split-window algorithm
   retrieved land surface temperature (LST) for 1991, 1998, 2014, and 2020
   using Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 satellite imageries. A rising trend in
   LST has been detected in the last 30 years, and the mean value has
   increased by 1.70 \& DEG;C within the region. Among the selected
   hotspots, an LST increase of 1.84 \& DEG;C was observed for those areas
   with the highest increase in urban density with decreased vegetation.
   The increasing impact of urbanization and the subsequent change in land
   use patterns at the cost of greenery have caused a substantial effect on
   the local climate. Accordingly, planning and policy directions are
   proposed for the local government that can help provide awareness to the
   people through the effective implementation of mitigation measures.},

Title = {Comparing fine-scale structural and hydrologic connectivity within
   unimproved and improved grassland},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Grasslands vary with diverse forms and functions ranging from
   monocultures of perennial rye grass to more biodiverse unimproved
   grasslands which cover around 5\% of Europe. Despite the broad diversity
   of grassland types, within environmental and flood risk models
   grasslands are frequently represented by a singular set of hydrological
   and structural parameters which belies their diversity and complexity.
   This study aimed to determine empirically the extent to which improved
   versus unimproved grasslands exhibit different hydrological
   connectivity. Working in SW England at neighbouring field sites with
   comparable slopes and rainfall regimes, we used unpiloted aerial
   vehicles to survey a tussocky Molinia caerulea dominated unimproved
   grassland field (MCUG) field and a Lolium perenne dominated improved
   grassland (LPIG) field. Using digital photogrammetry workflows applied
   to the overlapping aerial images, we produced a digital surface model
   (DSM) at 0.03-m resolution from which flow pathways were modelled using
   GIS and compared with 1-m LiDAR and DSM produced by a global navigation
   satellite system (GNSS). MCUG had longer, tortuous pathways through the
   dense tussock network with a drainage density of 2.54 m m(-2). This was
   significantly greater than drainage density in the LPIG (1.82 m m(-2)).
   As a result of this study, we rescaled the Manning's n value for MCUG
   according to photogrammetrically-derived roughness values. We suggest it
   should lie between 0.075 and 0.09. Our data shows that MCUG can play an
   important role in reducing overland flow impacts when compared to LPIG
   through lower connectivity which can delay run-off to rivers.},

Title = {Assessment of Energy-Population-Urbanization Nexus with Changing Energy
   Industry Scenario in India},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The demand for energy has been growing worldwide, especially in India
   partly due to the rapid population growth and urbanization of the
   country. To meet the ever-increasing energy requirement while
   maintaining an ecological balance is a challenging task. However, the
   energy industry-induced effect on population and urbanization has not
   been addressed before. Therefore, this study investigates the linkages
   between energy, population, and urbanization. The study also aims to
   find the quantifiable indicators for the population growth and rate of
   urbanization due to the expanding energy industry. The integrated
   framework uses a multi-temporal Landsat data to analyze the urbanization
   pattern, a census data for changes in population growth, night time
   light (NTL) data as an indicator for economic development and energy
   production and consumption data for energy index. Multi-attribute model
   is used to calculate a unified metric, termed as the
   energy-population-urbanization (EPU) nexus index. The proposed approach
   is demonstrated in the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Dadri
   power plant located in Uttar Pradesh, India. Landsat and NTL data
   clearly shows the urbanization pattern, economic development, and
   electrification in the study area. A comparative analysis based on
   various multi-attribute decision model assessment techniques suggests
   that the average value of EPU nexus index is 0.529, which significantly
   large compared to other studies and require special attention by
   policymakers because large EPU index indicates stronger correlation
   among energy, population, and urbanization. The authors believe that it
   would help the policymakers in planning and development of future energy
   projects, policies, and long-term strategies as India is expanding its
   energy industry.},

Title = {The effect of post-wildfire management practices on vegetation recovery:
   Insights from the Sapadere fire, Antalya, Turkiye},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Post-wildfire management actions mainly targeting the removal of salvage
   logs and burned trees is a common but controversial practice. Although
   it aims to regain some of the natural and economic value of a forest, it
   also requires disturbing burned areas, which may have some negative
   consequences affecting, for instance, the carbon cycle, soil erosion,
   and vegetation cover. Observations from different geographic settings
   contribute to this scientific debate, and yet, the spatiotemporal
   evolution of the post-fire road network developed as part of fire
   management practices and its influence on vegetation recovery has been
   rarely examined. Specifically, we still lack observations from Turkiye,
   though wildfires are a common event. This research examined the
   evolution of the vegetation cover in relation to post-fire road
   constructions and the resultant debris materials in areas affected by
   the 2017 Sapadere fire in Antalya, Turkiye. We used multi-sensor,
   multi-temporal optical satellite data and monitored the variation in
   both vegetation cover and road network from the pre-to post-fire periods
   between 2014 and 2021. Our results showed that fire management practices
   almost doubled the road network in the post-fire period, from 487 km to
   900 km. Overall, 7\% of the burned area was affected by these practices.
   As a result, vegetation cover in those areas shows only similar to 50\%
   recovery, whereas undisturbed areas exhibit similar to 100\% recovery 5
   years after the event. Notably, such spatiotemporal analysis carried out
   for different burned areas would provide a better insight into the most
   suitable post-fire management practices. Our findings, in particular,
   show that the current practices need to be revisited as they cause a
   delay in vegetation recovery.},

Abstract = {Transformation is a total transition process from a form into a new
   figure which can be interpreted as the final stage of a process where
   space and time become greatly affect the changes to the ultimate stage.
   Changes are done by giving the response of the influence of external and
   internal elements that will lead to a change of shape that has been
   known previously. The title of ``education city{''} to the city of
   Bandung past of history of its establishment. Education in Bandung began
   to show its development since the establishment of Hollandsch Inlandsche
   Kweekschool, shortened into HIK48, on May 13, 1868. It was established
   by some important figures, among others, were R. H. Muhammad Musa.
   Meanwhile, higher education began to grow since the establishment of
   Technische Hoogeschool (abbreviated as THS) in 1920 as part of the
   Ethical Policy of the Dutch Government to its colony. So since then, the
   life of higher education in the city of Bandung continues to grow and
   increase. THS is a forerunner to the birth of Bandung Institute of
   Technology (ITB now). The purpose of this study is to establish the
   theory that can explain how the transformation of urban space in Balubur
   Tamansari in Bandung City, so it can be seen adjusting the physical
   setting of the region as the city's identity. The research method used
   was a qualitative grounded theory research method, the approach is
   focused on the discrete phenomenon in the field in order to disclose the
   meaning of the background of the city region space. This phenomenon was
   appointed through a process of snowball sampling. The process of data
   collection, analysis and theory building will be done at the same time
   in a period of time and iterative of process. This research generates
   knowledge building based on the knitting of the value system, the

Abstract = {Demarcation of conservation priority zones (CPZs) using spatially
   explicit models is the new challenge in ecosystem services (ESs)
   research. This study identifies the CPZs of the Indian Sundarbans by
   integrating 2 different approaches, that is, ESs and ecosystem health
   (EH). Five successive steps were followed to conduct the analysis:
   First, the ESs were estimated using biophysical and economic methods and
   a hybrid method (that combines biophysical and economic methods);
   second, the vigor-organization-resilience (VOR) model was used for
   estimating EH; third, the risk characterization value (RCV) of ESs was
   measured using the function of EH and ESs; fourth, Pearson correlation
   test was performed to analyze the interaction between ESs and EH
   components; and fifth, the CPZs were defined by considering 7 relevant
   components: ecosystem vigor, ecosystem organization, ecosystem
   resilience, RCV, EH, ESs, and the correlation between EH and ESs. Among
   the major ecoregions of the Sundarbans, the highest ESs value in
   economic terms is provided by the mangrove ecosystem (US\$19 144.9
   million per year). The highest conservation priority score was projected
   for the Gosaba block, which is dominated by dense mangrove forests. The
   estimated CPZs were found to be highly consistent with the existing
   biodiversity zonations. The outcome of this study could be a reference
   for environmentalists, land administrators, researchers, and decision
   makers to design relevant policies to protect the high values of the

Title = {Fine-scale mapping of urban malaria exposure under data scarcity: an
   approach centred on vector ecology},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {BackgroundAlthough malaria transmission has experienced an overall
   decline in sub-Saharan Africa, urban malaria is now considered an
   emerging health issue due to rapid and uncontrolled urbanization and the
   adaptation of vectors to urban environments. Fine-scale hazard and
   exposure maps are required to support evidence-based policies and
   targeted interventions, but data-driven predictive spatial modelling is
   hindered by gaps in epidemiological and entomological data. A
   knowledge-based geospatial framework is proposed for mapping the
   heterogeneity of urban malaria hazard and exposure under data scarcity.
   It builds on proven geospatial methods, implements open-source
   algorithms, and relies heavily on vector ecology knowledge and the
   involvement of local experts.MethodsA workflow for producing fine-scale
   maps was systematized, and most processing steps were automated. The
   method was evaluated through its application to the metropolitan area of
   Dakar, Senegal, where urban transmission has long been confirmed. Urban
   malaria exposure was defined as the contact risk between adult Anopheles
   vectors (the hazard) and urban population and accounted for
   socioeconomic vulnerability by including the dimension of urban
   deprivation that is reflected in the morphology of the built-up fabric.
   Larval habitat suitability was mapped through a deductive geospatial
   approach involving the participation of experts with a strong background
   in vector ecology and validated with existing geolocated entomological
   data. Adult vector habitat suitability was derived through a similar
   process, based on dispersal from suitable breeding site locations. The
   resulting hazard map was combined with a population density map to
   generate a gridded urban malaria exposure map at a spatial resolution of
   100 m.ResultsThe identification of key criteria influencing vector
   habitat suitability, their translation into geospatial layers, and the
   assessment of their relative importance are major outcomes of the study
   that can serve as a basis for replication in other sub-Saharan African
   cities. Quantitative validation of the larval habitat suitability map
   demonstrates the reliable performance of the deductive approach, and the
   added value of including local vector ecology experts in the process.
   The patterns displayed in the hazard and exposure maps reflect the high
   degree of heterogeneity that exists throughout the city of Dakar and its
   suburbs, due not only to the influence of environmental factors, but
   also to urban deprivation.ConclusionsThis study is an effort to bring
   geospatial research output closer to effective support tools for local
   stakeholders and decision makers. Its major contributions are the
   identification of a broad set of criteria related to vector ecology and
   the systematization of the workflow for producing fine-scale maps. In a
   context of epidemiological and entomological data scarcity, vector
   ecology knowledge is key for mapping urban malaria exposure. An
   application of the framework to Dakar showed its potential in this
   regard. Fine-grained heterogeneity was revealed by the output maps, and
   besides the influence of environmental factors, the strong links between
   urban malaria and deprivation were also highlighted.},

Title = {Mapping of Ecological Environment Based on Google Earth Engine Cloud
   Computing Platform and Landsat Long-Term Data: A Case Study of the
   Zhoushan Archipelago},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid advancement of China's urbanization, the
   contradiction between urban development and the ecological environment
   has become increasingly prominent, and the urban ecological system now
   faces severe challenges. In this study, we proposed an ecological
   index-based approach to monitor and evaluate the ecological environment
   using a Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform and Landsat time
   series. Firstly, a long-term series of Landsat images was obtained to
   construct and calculate the remote sensing-based ecological index
   (RSEI). Then, the Theil-Sen median estimation and the Mann-Kendall test
   were used to evaluate the trend and significance of the RSEI time series
   and combined with the Hurst index to predict the future development
   trend of the ecological environment in the study area. Finally, the
   coefficient of variation method was used to determine the temporal
   stability of the ecological environment. Taking Zhoushan Archipelago,
   China, as the study area, we mapped the distribution of the ecological
   environment using a spatial resolution of 30 m and evaluated the
   ecological environment from 1985 to 2020. The results show that (1) from
   1985 to 2020, the average RSEI in the Zhoushan Archipelago decreased
   from 0.7719 to 0.5817, increasing at a rate of -24.64\%. (2) The changes
   in the areas of each level of ecological environmental quality show that
   the ecological environment in the Zhoushan Archipelago generally
   exhibited a decreasing trend. During the study period, the proportion of
   the areas with excellent ecological environmental quality decreased by
   38.83\%, while the proportion of areas with poor and relatively poor
   ecological environmental quality increased by 20.03\%. (3) Based on the
   overall change trend, the degradation in the ecological environment in
   the Zhoushan Archipelago was greater than the improvement, with the
   degradation area accounting for 84.35\% of the total area, the
   improvement area accounting for 12.61\% of the total area, and the
   stable area accounting for 3.05\% of the total area. (4) From the
   perspective of the sustainability of the changes, in 86.61\% of the
   study area, the RSEI exhibited positive sustainability, indicating that
   the sustainability of the RSEI was relatively strong. (5) The
   coefficient of variation in the RSEI was concentrated in the range of
   0-0.40, having an average value of 0.1627 and a standard deviation of
   0.1467, indicating that the RSEI values in the Zhoushan Archipelago
   during the study period were concentrated, the interannual fluctuations
   of the data were small, and the time series was relatively stable. The
   results of this study provide theoretical methods and a decision-making
   basis for the dynamic monitoring and regional governance of the
   ecological environment in island areas.},

Abstract = {The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) provides a forum in
   which government and industry cooperate for the improvement and rational
   use of telecommunications worldwide. One of the missions of the
   Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) is the management of the
   radio-frequency spectrum and orbital locations, which are increasingly
   in demand from a large number of services. The ITU-R's mission is to
   ensure rational, equitable, efficient and economical use of this
   spectrum by all radio-communication services, including those using
   satellite orbit, and to facilitate studies and adoption of regulations
   and recommendations on radiocommunication matters.
   World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) review and revise radio
   regulations, allocations, and allotment plans, and address any
   radiocommunication matters. The WRCs are now convened every two or three
   years. However, with that level of infrequency, spectrum allocation
   planning might not be very responsive to industry development. Moreover,
   the general scope of the agenda is extensive and results in political
   compromise instead of technical readiness. It creates tension regarding
   the need for adequate time to have relevant technical studies done to
   support or refute proposals.
   This issue of political versus technical interests becomes more crucial
   with the growth of regional activities for coordination and the economic
   value of the spectrum. In addition, industry has intemational-rather
   then merely national- representation, affecting the technical study
   process. In turn, the WRC process impacts on industry are significant:
   resulting in delays, uncertainties, and political compromises affecting
   technical viability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {ROAD MAP OF EVOLUTION OF NICNET TOWARDS GLOBALIZATION OF
   COMPUTER-COMMUNICATION},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS INFORMATION \& PLANNING},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {20},
Number = {12},
Pages = {595-608},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A view is advocated here that the application of computers and
   communication as an integrated technology, has more impact on social and
   economic development than computer technology alone or communication
   technology alone. As social and economic interaction cannot be localised
   artificially in a world moving towards a `global village', globalisation
   of computer-communication networks will become the major enabling
   instrument for this evolution.
   The evolution of NICNET, the computer communication nework of the
   National Informatic Centre, is so oriented that such an integration and
   globalisation is progressively impelemented utilising the latest low
   cost technologies available in the international market. Tracing the
   evolution of NICNET from its genesis in 1985, the choice of the various
   technologies to date, and, the road map for NICNET till 2000 AD is
   projected in step with the forecasting of technological evolution
   towards integration and globalisation of computer and communication
   resources.
   The choice of Spread Spectrum Multiple Access/Code Division Multiple
   Access (SSMA/COMA) based Very Small Aperture Terminal (VAST) Satellite
   Earth Station technology is discussed to support the contention that
   VAST Technology enabled the first level of integration and globalisation
   between 1985 and 1992.
   Discussing the inevitability of the Ku/Ka band choice for the next level
   of integration and globalisation, the potential of Single Channel Per
   Carrier (SCPC) based `hubles' VASTs with two-way as well as data
   broadcast capabilities and dedicated high speed external gateways is
   outlined as the second essential step in the integration and
   globalisation while at the same time, realising a NICNET Info-Highway
   during the period 1993 to 1997. On the ground segment, special
   technologies for effectively linking widely separated local area
   networks, network FAX and image server and multimedia communication
   services are proposed. Special features for accommodating a large number
   or close user groups and offering virtual private networks can increase
   the propensity for the spread of the IT culture as well as prod the
   growth of demand.
   During the period from 1986 to 2001, certain concepts of future space
   data networks are forecast which can propell NICNET to the third level
   of integration and globalisation. Based on the concept of NICSAT earlier
   conceptualised, a series of very low cost microsats will be launched for
   an internally operable dedicated space data network with user end to end
   communication capability, built in features for promoting specialised
   value added services, built in access security and expert system based
   network management. Low cost on-board features, a versatile space link
   scenario and a low cost ground infrastructure scenario are suggested.
   The possibility of introducing BISDN via such a satellite cluster are
   examined.
   Towards the end of the decade, NICNET will be incrementally converted
   for providing global intelligent network services over a strong skeleton
   of data super highway utilising the concept of application gateway in a
   global intelligent network, the interoperability of the service
   management systems, service creation environment and operation systems
   as well as support the interaction of the intelligent network components
   for intra-network and inter-network cases. The intelligent network
   architecture proposed is explicitly designed to support personal
   communication services on a global basis.},

Title = {Assessing the Link between Human Modification and Changes in Land
   Surface Temperature in Hainan, China Using Image Archives from Google
   Earth Engine},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In many areas of the world, population growth and land development have
   increased demand for land and other natural resources. Coastal areas are
   particularly susceptible since they are conducive for marine
   transportation, energy production, aquaculture, marine tourism and other
   activities. Anthropogenic activities in the coastal areas have triggered
   unprecedented land use change, depletion of coastal wetlands, loss of
   biodiversity, and degradation of other vital ecosystem services. The
   changes can be particularly drastic for small coastal islands with rich
   biodiversity. In this study, the influence of human modification on land
   surface temperature (LST) for the coastal island Hainan in Southern
   China was investigated. We hypothesize that for this island, footprints
   of human activities are linked to the variation of land surface
   temperature, which could indicate environmental degradation. To test
   this hypothesis, we estimated LST changes between 2000 and 2016 and
   computed the spatio-temporal correlation between LST and human
   modification. Specifically, we classified temperature data for the four
   years 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2016 into 5 temperature zones based on their
   respective mean and standard deviation values. We then assessed the
   correlation between each temperature zone and a human modification index
   computed for the year 2016. Apart from this, we estimated mean, maximum
   and the standard deviation of annual temperature for each pixel in the
   17 years to assess the links with human modification. The results showed
   that: (1) The mean LST temperature in Hainan Island increased with
   fluctuations from 2000 to 2016. (2) The moderate temperature zones were
   dominant in the island during the four years included in this study. (3)
   A strong positive correlation of 0.72 between human modification index
   and mean and maximum LST temperature indicated a potential link between
   human modification and mean and maximum LST temperatures over the 17
   years of analysis. (4) The mean value of human modification index in the
   temperature zones in 2016 showed a progressive rise with 0.24 in the low
   temperature zone, 0.33 in the secondary moderate, 0.45 in the moderate,
   0.54 in the secondary high and 0.61 in the high temperature zones. This
   work highlighted the potential value of using large and multi-temporal
   earth observation datasets from cloud platforms to assess the influence
   of human activities in sensitive ecosystems. The results could
   contribute to the development of sustainable management and coastal
   ecosystems conservation plans.},

Title = {Multi-source satellite imagery and point of interest data for poverty
   mapping in East Java, Indonesia: Machine learning and deep learning
   approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach to provide a more granular poverty
   map in terms of coverage (up to a grid level with the spatial resolution
   of 1.5 km) with less cost and time to update to support better poverty
   monitoring. Two poverty estimation model development scenarios using
   machine learning and deep learning were evaluated in this study. First,
   the model is constructed using multisource satellite imagery and
   geospatial point of interest location of economic in-frastructures using
   zonal statistics feature extraction, which is the proposed approach in
   this study. The specific multisource satellite imagery to be used as
   poverty indicators are night-time light intensity (NTL) as an approach
   to economic activity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as
   an approach to detect rural areas based on vegetation, built-up index
   (BUI) as an approach to detect urban areas based on building
   distribution, normalized difference water index (NDWI) to detect land
   cover, land surface temperature (LST) as an approach to detecting urban
   areas based on surface temperature, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
   dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an approach to detecting
   economic activities based on pollution, as well as point of interest
   (POI) density, and POI distance which show the accessibility of an area.
   Second, the model is constructed from daytime multiband and nighttime
   light intensity satellite imagery using the deep learning architecture
   of Resnet-34 transfer learning feature extraction. In each scenario, we
   compared the performance of different machine learning (support vector
   regression/SVR, decision tree regression/DTR, and random forest
   regression/RFR) algorithms along with deep learning (multiple layer
   perceptron/MLP and one dimensional-convolutional neural network/ CNN-1D)
   algorithms. Based on the results of the model development evaluation,
   the CNN-1D model was chosen as the best model in the first scenario, and
   the Resnet-34 + MLP model was chosen as the best model in the second
   scenario. The two best models from the first and second scenarios are
   then used to predict poverty at the grid level with a spatial resolution
   of 1.5 km. Based on official poverty data, the estimated poverty mapping
   built using the CNN-1D model in the first scenario was chosen as the
   best map with the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.95 and
   adjusted R2 0.84 at the district level. The results of visual
   identification revealed that high estimates of poverty are typically
   found in sparsely inhabited areas surrounded by unoc-cupied land, which
   is usually an agricultural area. Otherwise, low poverty estimates, on
   the other hand, are more likely to be found in highly populated regions
   with convenient access. Our finding is aligned with the official report
   of Statistics Indonesia, which claims that poverty in rural re-gions is
   higher than in urban areas.},

Abstract = {With the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change, the urban
   flood has increasingly become a major hazard risk faced by human being
   in recent decades. The catastrophic urban flood events appear every year
   in the world, especially in Asia and Pacific region due to its
   geographical composition, density population and un-even economic and
   social development. To reduce the urban flood risk and enhance the
   resilience of vulnerable communities, especially coastal communities,
   the Members of ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee (TC) have made their great
   efforts including engineering and non-engineering measures based on
   their different national conditions. As a key part of non-engineering
   measures, it is recognized that improving urban flood monitoring and
   forecasting is a measure with high benefit related to cost on urban
   flood risk reduction. In recent years, TC Members enhanced their
   capacity building on urban flood monitoring, forecasting and simulation,
   inundation mapping, etc. In order to enhance the technical cooperation
   and exchange on this aspect, Typhoon Committee Working Group on
   Hydrology (WGH) conducted two projects on ``Urban Flood Risk Management
   in Typhoon Committee Area (UFRM){''} and ``Operation System for Urban
   Flood Forecasting and Inundation Mapping (OSUFFIM){''} in the past
   years. This paper generally reviewed the situation and causes of urban
   flood in TC region; briefly summarized the progresses and shortages on
   urban flood monitoring and forecasting in TC Members; and initially
   discussed the areas to be enhanced in future for improvement of urban
   flood monitoring, forecasting and simulation, and inundation mapping
   with up-to-date development of weather radar and satellite monitoring,
   image-based monitoring, information technology (IT), Internet of Things
   (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence (AI).(c) 2022 The Shanghai

Title = {Spatial Estimation and Visualization of CO2 Emissions for Campus
   Sustainability: The Case of King Abdullah University of Science and
   Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A total of 21 metric tons of CO2 per person in terms of per capita
   emissions from consumption of energy was recorded in Saudi Arabia in
   2011 and forecasts have shown that this emission of CO2 is increasing.
   This poses the threat of climate change and global warming and therefore
   the need for the sustainability of the country. The Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia's Vision for 2030 addresses environmental sustainability that
   includes a reduction in CO2 emissions as well as diversified economic
   growth. Universities have been regarded as institutions with significant
   responsibilities to resolve the issues of sustainability as well as
   serve as role model to society by implementing a sustainability plan.
   This study established a spatial evaluation, estimation, and
   visualization of the CO2 emissions of King Abdullah University of
   Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia. The data required for this
   study were collected from the overall coverage of the university campus
   buildings by transforming raster data from the satellite image to vector
   data in the form of polygons, and then multiplying the area by the
   number of floors of the individual building. ArcGIS 10.3((R)) (ESRI,
   Redlands, CA, USA) software was used for this campus CO2 emissions
   evaluation and visualization. The overall estimate of the CO2 emissions
   for the university campus was 127.7-tons CO2 equivalent. The lowest
   emission was 0.02-tons CO2 equivalent while the maximum value was
   20.9-tons of CO2 equivalent. By this ArcGIS-based evaluation, it is
   evident that geographically integrated model for campus estimation and
   visualization of CO2 emissions provides the information for decision
   makers to develop viable strategies for achieving a higher standard in
   overall campus sustainability and addressing the issue of climate
   change.},

Title = {MODIS sensors can monitor spatiotemporal trends in fog and low cloud
   cover at 1 km spatial resolution along the U.S. Pacific Coast},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems
   along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently
   unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally,
   FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air
   traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to
   inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve
   transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in
   current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog,
   its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year
   (2000-2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine
   its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the
   California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months
   (June-September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an
   existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min
   intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear
   relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average
   r(2) of 0.82 and p-value of < 0.01. This strong relationship
   demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately
   detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our
   FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia
   sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California.
   This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution
   FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring
   spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our
   case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates
   considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend
   occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible
   Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC
   data for all summer months for the years 2000-2020. The methods and
   dataset presented in this paper provide a means for efficient, daily
   FLCC monitoring at 1 km(2) resolution, as well as the capacity for
   historical FLCC analyses.},

Abstract = {At the 25th Annual European Haemophilia Consortium (EHC) Congress held
   in Prague, Czech Republic, in October 2012, Pfizer sponsored a satellite
   symposium entitled: Understanding Health Outcomes: Focus on
   Haemophilia'. Co-chaired by Brian O'Mahony (President of the EHC) and
   Brian Colvin (Director Medical and Scientific Affairs Haemophilia,
   Pfizer, Europe), the symposium examined the role of outcomes in
   haemophilia care in an age of evidence-based medicine. The current
   global economic recession has inevitably directed the spotlight of
   governments and health economists towards the cost of healthcare. Now is
   the time to focus on which outcome measures are important to collect in
   order to validate these costs, and how to standardise collection and
   reporting measures to support services and patient care. Using the
   United Kingdom (UK) as a case study, where initiatives in data
   collection and reporting are being trialled, Gerry Dolan opened the
   discussion by highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary
   approach to ensuring success. Looking at specific measures of
   haemophilia healthcare, Carlo Martinoli focused on joint scores as a
   clinical outcome measure that can be systematically collected, and the
   role of ultrasound in bringing joint assessment into the hands of the
   haemophilia treater at the bedside'. Brian O'Mahony then brought the
   discussion full circle by highlighting the role of the patient in the
   multidisciplinary care team and the importance of the patient voice in
   the assessment and critical examination of health outcomes by payers and
   government bodies. The meeting closed by summarising the importance of
   collaboration between patients and their carers; physicians; members of
   the healthcare team; and budget holders in advancing haemophilia care,
   to provide the best possible care with optimum long-term outcomes for
   people with haemophilia.},

Title = {Performance of Three Reanalysis Precipitation Datasets over the
   Qinling-Daba Mountains, Eastern Fringe of Tibetan Plateau, China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Evaluation of different reanalysis precipitation datasets is of great
   importance to understanding the hydrological processes and water
   resource management practice in the Qinling-Daba Mountains (QDM),
   located at the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau. Although the
   evaluation of satellite precipitation data in this region has been
   performed, another kind of popular precipitation product-reanalysis
   dataset has not been assessed in depth. Three popular reanalysis
   precipitation datasets, including ERA-Interim Reanalysis of European
   Centre for Medium Forecasts (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis
   (JRA-55), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National
   Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis-1 (NCEP/NCAR-1) were
   evaluated against rain gauge data over the Qinling-Daba Mountains from
   2000 to 2014 on monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Different
   statistical measures based on the Correlation Coefficient (CC), relative
   BIAS (BIAS), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error
   (MAE) were adopted to determine the performance of the above reanalysis
   datasets. Results show that ERA-Interim and JRA-55 have good performance
   on a monthly scale and annual scale. However, the NCEP/NCAR-1 has the
   least BIAS with the observed precipitation in annual scale in QDM. All
   reanalysis datasets performed better in spring, summer, and autumn than
   in winter. The advantages of involving more precipitation observation
   stations was probably the main reason of the different performance of
   three precipitation reanalysis products, and the benefit of a
   four-dimensional variational analysis model over a three-dimensional
   variational analysis model may be another reason. The evaluation
   suggested that ERA-Interim is more suitable for study the precipitation
   and water cycles in the QDM.},

Abstract = {Accurate, reliable, and timely burn severity maps are necessary for
   planning, managing and rehabilitation after wildfires. This study aimed
   at assessing the ability of the Sentinel-2A satellite to detect burnt
   areas and separate burning severity levels. It also attempted to measure
   the spectral separability of the different bands and derived indices
   commonly used to detect burnt areas. A short investigation into the
   associated environmental variables present in the burnt landscape was
   also performed to explore the presence of any correlation. As a case
   study, a wildfire occurred in the Sierra de Gata region of the province
   of Caceres in North-Eastern Spain was used. A range of spectral indices
   was computed, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The potential added value of
   the three new Red Edge bands that come with the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor
   was also used. The slope, aspect, fractional vegetation cover and
   terrain roughness were all derived to produce environmental variables.
   The burning severity was tested using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)
   classifier. European Environment Agency's CORINE land cover map was also
   used to produce the land cover types found in the burned area. The
   Copernicus Emergency Management Service have produced a grading map for
   the fire using 0.5 m resolution Pleiades imagery, that was used as
   reference. Results showed a variable degree of correlation between the
   burning severity and the tested herein spectral indices. The visible
   part of the electromagnetic spectrum was not well suited to discern
   burned from unburned land cover. The NBRb12 (short-wave infrared 2 -
   SWIR2) produced the best results for detecting burnt areas. SAM resulted
   in a 73\% overall accuracy in thematic mapping. None of the
   environmental variables appeared to have a significant impact on the
   burning severity. All in all, our study result showed that Sentinel-2
   MSI sensor can be used to discern burnt areas and burning severity.
   However, further studies in different regions using the same dataset
   types and methods should be implemented before generalizing the results
   of the current study.},

Title = {Growing status observation for oil palm trees using Unmanned Aerial

Abstract = {For both the positive economic benefit and the negative ecological
   impact of the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical
   developing countries, it is significant to achieve accurate detection
   for oil palm trees in large-scale areas. Especially, growing status
   observation and smart oil palm plantation management enabled by such
   accurate detections would improve plantation planning, oil palm yield,
   and reduce manpower and consumption of fertilizer. Although existing
   studies have already reached a high accuracy in oil palm tree detection,
   rare attention has been paid to automated observation of each single oil
   palm tree's growing status. Nowadays, with its high spatial resolution
   and low cost, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has become a promising tool
   for monitoring the growing status of individual oil palms. However, the
   accuracy is still a challenging issue because of the extreme imbalance
   and high similarity between different classes. In this paper, we propose
   a Multi-class Oil PAlm Detection approach (MOPAD) to reap both accurate
   detection of oil palm trees and accurate monitoring of their growing
   status. Based on Faster RCNN, MOPAD combines a Refined Pyramid Feature
   (RPF) module and a hybrid class-balanced loss module to achieve
   satisfying observation of the growing status for individual oil palms.
   The former takes advantage of multi-level features to distinguish
   similar classes and detect small oil palms, and the latter effectively
   resolves the problem of extremely imbalanced samples. Moreover, we
   elaborately analyze the distribution of different kinds of oil palms,
   and propose a practical workflow for detecting oil palm vacancy. We
   evaluate MOPAD using three large-scale UAV images photographed in two
   sites in Indonesia (denoted by Site 1 and Site 2), containing 363,877
   oil palms of five categories: healthy palms, dead palms, mismanaged
   palms, smallish palms and yellowish palms. Our proposed MOPAD achieves
   an F1-score of 87.91\% (Site 1) and 99.04\% (Site 2) for overall oil
   palm tree detection, and outperforms other state-of-the-art object
   detection methods by a remarkable margin of 10.37-17.09\% and
   8.14\%-21.32\% with respect to the average F1score for multi-class oil
   palm detection in Site 1 and Site 2, respectively. Our method
   demonstrates excellent potential for individual oil palm tree detection
   and observation of growing status from UAV images, leading to more
   precise and efficient management of oil palm plantations.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, China has experienced rapid industrialization and
   urbanization. As cities have expanded rapidly, the spatial patterns of
   rural settlements also changed significantly. This study uses land use
   data from satellite imagery interpretation, socioeconomic statistics,
   and field survey data, together with techniques including landscape
   pattern analysis, kernel density estimation, and spatial measurement
   models, to analyze the evolving spatial patterns of rural settlements
   influencing factors in China from 1995 to 2015. The results indicate the
   following: First, China's rural settlements experienced significant
   changes in the period 1995-2015, as 88.92\% of Prefectural-level
   administrative district units saw an increase in rural settlement area,
   with total settlement size increasing by 1.35 million hectares, and
   settlement area sprawl index values can be summarized as ``high in the
   west and low in the east{''}. Second, in the two-decade study period,
   the population agglomeration capacity of rural settlements in China
   continuously weakened, and the shape and structure of rural settlement
   became more complex and irregular. The scale and scope of the
   disappearance of rural settlement areas in the northeast and southeast
   regions was relatively drastic, and the kernel density value of
   settlements dropped significantly. Third, the increase in rural
   settlement land area is concentrated in low-altitude and low-slope
   areas, with a significant tendency to be near water and roads. Fourth,
   social and economic factors, such as per capita net income of rural
   residents, the proportion of the population employed in agriculture, the
   size and structure of the permanent rural population, local fiscal
   revenue, and urbanization level, are the main factors that cause changes
   of rural settlement patterns. The results of this study can serve as a
   reference for promoting regional rural sustainable development policies
   and advancing rural spatial governance and comprehensive revitalization.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Changes in Vegetation in the Last Two Decades

Abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation is sensitive to climate change and
   human activities. Its spatial-temporal changes also affect the
   ecological and social environment. In this paper, we considered the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to study the spatio-temporal vegetation
   patterns. The detailed analysis of a moderate-resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were carried out through the Google Earth
   Engine (GEE) platform. Our results show a slow and tortuous upward trend
   in the average leaf area index (LAI) in the study region for the periods
   2001-2020. Specifically, Beijing had the highest LAI value, with an
   average of 1.64 over twenty years, followed by Hebei (1.30) and Tianjin
   (1.04). Among different vegetation types, forests had the highest
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the range of
   0.62-0.78, followed by shrubland (0.58-0.75), grassland (0.34-0.66), and
   cropland (0.38-0.54) over the years. Spatially, compared to the whole
   study area, index value in the northwestern part of the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region increased greatly in many areas, such as
   northwest Beijing, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou, indicating a significant
   ecological optimization. Meanwhile, there was ecological degradation in
   the middle and southeast regions, from Tangshan southeastward to Handan,
   crossing Tianjin, Langfang, the east part of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and
   the west part of Cangzhou. Air temperature and precipitation were
   positively and significantly correlated with net primary production
   (NPP) and precipitation stood out as a key driver. Additionally, an
   intensification of the urbanization rate will negatively impact the
   vegetation NPP, with the shrubland and forest being affected most
   relative to the cropland.},

Abstract = {Purpose The research aims to provide the basis for a better
   understanding of the internationalization of higher education in
   Vietnam. First, it examines Vietnam's higher education reforms and
   policy/ legal frameworks for the promotion of internationalization since
   the implementation of Doi Moi in 1986. Secondly, it analyzes the
   internationalization activities at the national and institutional
   levels. At both levels, the internationalization activities are
   categorized into internationalization at home and cross borders (Knight,
   2012). Finally, the paper discusses the challenges Vietnamese HE is
   facing and presents policy directions. Design/methodology/approach This
   study employs a case study research strategy to examine and gain
   understanding of internationalization of higher education in Vietnam as
   a phenomenon. The study collected detailed information using a variety
   of data collection procedures over a period of time. First, it analyzes
   Vietnam's higher education reforms as well as policy and legal framework
   for the promotion of internationalization. Then, using Knight's
   framework, the study analyzed the internationalization at home and
   crossborder educational activities at the national and institutional
   levels. At the national level, strategic policy goals and programs were
   explored. Then, it chose Vietnam National University- Hanoi as a
   institutional case to learn its institutional strategies on cross border
   programs and mobility, reputation building, research cooperation.
   Findings Vietnam has continuously reformed its legal and policy
   framework of higher education to better integrate into the global higher
   education market and also to meet the national demand for economic
   development. Predominant rationale for Vietnam to engage in crossborder
   programs is for brain development, specifically in the academics and
   public sector. Meanwhile internationalization at home is driven by (1)
   international programs and universities and (2) initiative to enhance
   competitiveness of its higher education institutes. Vietnam hosts
   different models of international universities, including classical,
   satellite and co-founded. However, issues and challenges remain, such as
   poor lack of systematic cooperation and coordination at the governmental
   level, retaining talents, and finally finances. Originality/value
   Written for the special edition on Internationalization of Higher
   Education in the Era of SDGs: Asia-Pacific Perspective, the study aims
   to provide a basis for understanding the current situation of
   internationalization higher education in Vietnam and how it compares to
   its partners in the region. This study is unique as it provides a
   two-layer analysis, at the national and institutional levels capturing
   macro and micro perspectives in one scene. In addition, this study
   includes rich empirical data, which was rare in previous literature due
   to limited access.},

Title = {Spatial-Temporal Pattern Evolution of Xi'an Metropolitan Area Using

Abstract = {A metropolitan area provides valuable space for economic development,
   and it is the home on which human beings depend for their survival.
   However, metropolitan areas are often faced with prominent problems
   caused by the natural environment and city layout. Therefore,
   understanding metropolitan areas' spatial-temporal pattern evolution is
   of vital significance for medium-to-long-term city growth. This study
   uses the nighttime light data to monitor the urban pattern evolution of
   the Xi'an Metropolitan Area (XMA) over the past 30 years. The study
   results suggest that the continuity correction and consistency
   correction used in this study can construct a stable long-term,
   multi-source nighttime light dataset and, at the same time, accurately
   reflect the changes in the urban pattern. The determination coefficient
   between gross domestic product (GDP) and total nighttime light (TNL)
   reached 0.90; the nighttime light index (NLI) of the XMA is
   characterized by high spatial heterogeneity. The NLI of the core areas
   has been saturated before 2004, while the CNLI value of the peripheral
   Chang'an District was 0.31 by 2021. Urban land expanded in all
   directions, with an average expansion rate of 12.9\% and an expansion
   intensity of 2.6\%. The nighttime light gravity center generally shifted
   towards southwest, from (108.915 degrees E, 34.355 degrees N) in 1992 to
   (108.922 degrees E, 34.343 degrees N) in 2021. The urban pattern of the
   metropolitan area is influenced by the natural environment, and the
   southwest and northeast directions will be the primary development
   directions in the future. The local development policy is a crucial
   driving factor in the urban pattern evolution, which significantly
   affects the location and intensity of urban expansion; the center of
   gravity of the XMA has different migration directions in different
   periods, meaning that the development of the metropolitan area tends to
   be balanced.},

   climate. In 1999, China initiated its ``Grain for Green{''} Program
   (GGP) to improve the ecological environment, control soil erosion, and
   adjust the agricultural industrial structure to promote the sustainable
   development of the rural economy. In this paper, economic statistics,
   rainfall, and remote sensing data are used to analyze the impact of the
   GGP on agricultural and rural economic development and regional
   precipitation in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau. The
   results show that since the implementation of the program, the
   employment structure of the labor force has changed and the regional
   economic growth and farmers' income have increased. From 2000 to 2016,
   the total gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita GDP of the Yan
   River Basin increased. The conversion of large-scale sloping farmland to
   forestry and grassland resulted in the decrease of farmland area and the
   increase of forestry area. The maximum, minimum, and mean value of
   vegetation coverage increased year by year. With the increase of
   vegetation coverage, the surface roughness, soil water content, and
   evapotranspiration improved and annual average precipitation grew
   significantly after the implementation of the program (2000 to 2018).
   From 1970 to the implementation of the project (1999), the annual
   average rainfall decreased at the trough from 1988 to 1999, and there
   was an overall upward trend from 1970 to 2018. The GGP has an important
   impact on the economy and people's income in the Yan River Basin, and
   the vegetation change caused by the variation of land use types has a
   certain impact on regional rainfall. Under the background of global and
   regional climate change, it is of great significance to fully understand
   the impacts of vegetation conversion on climate and its mechanism for
   objective assessment of driving factors in regional and global climate,
   as well as for scientific planning of future land use.},

Abstract = {With the implementation of China's top-down CO2 emissions reduction
   strategy, the regional differences should be considered. As the most
   basic governmental unit in China, counties could better capture the
   regional heterogeneity than provinces and prefecture-level city, and
   county-level CO2 emissions could be used for the development of
   strategic policies tailored to local conditions. However, most of the
   previous accounts of CO2 emissions in China have only focused on the
   national, provincial, or city levels, owing to limited methods and
   smaller-scale data. In this study, a particle swarm optimization-back
   propagation (PSO-BP) algorithm was employed to unify the scale of
   DMSP/OLS and NPP/VIIRS satellite imagery and estimate the CO2 emissions
   in 2,735 Chinese counties during 1997-2017. Moreover, as vegetation has
   a significant ability to sequester and reduce CO2 emissions, we
   calculated the county-level carbon sequestration value of terrestrial
   vegetation. The results presented here can contribute to existing data
   gaps and enable the development of strategies to reduce CO2 emissions in
   China.},

Title = {Assessing the Potential of Rural Settlement Land Consolidation in China:
   A Method Based on Comprehensive Evaluation of Restricted Factors},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Rural settlement land consolidation potential calculation is the basic
   work of land consolidation. An accurate potential is essential to rural
   development planners and policy makers as a project target or
   prediction. The traditional calculation methods include the per
   capita/household construction land method, idle rural residential land
   method, and comprehensive evaluation method. Though there have been some
   improvements, the potential for calculation methods on a national level
   is still limited. This article illustrates a new method for calculating
   the consolidation potential of rural settlement land, based on field
   data and the restructuring restrictions applicable to each rural land
   parcel in China. The field data was from Shandong Province because it
   lies within the country's biggest grain-producing area with the largest
   distribution density of rural settlements. It is an excellent
   representative sample for rural settlement land consolidation, offering
   a microcosm of rural development in China. For the study's comprehensive
   evaluation system, due to the lack of nationwide field survey data, the
   potential of Shandong Province was chosen as the standard value. We
   selected indicators concerning land resources, depopulation,
   transportation accessibility, local economic development, urbanization,
   and natural conditions to build an evaluation system. We then calculated
   the potential of each province according to their coefficients and field
   data from Shandong Province. Every province except Taiwan (for which no
   data were available) was divided into five zones for rural settlement
   land consolidation: the most-suitable zone, suitable zone, general zone,
   restricted zone, and most-restricted zone. The total rate of land
   consolidation is estimated at 0.24 for 2010 and forecast at 0.33 for
   2020, while those years' respective consolidation potentials are
   32,777.92 km(2) and 44,707.81 km(2). The rate is the total rural
   settlement land before land consolidation divided by added cultivated
   land after consolidation. The higher the rate, more effective the land
   consolidation is.},

Title = {Increasing fragmentation and squeezing of coastal wetlands: Status,

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Coastal wetlands arc of great ecological and economic value but face
   significant degradation and losses because of human activities.
   Nevertheless, the changes in spatiotcmporal landscape patterns, which
   have occurred as a result of coastal wetland losses, have not been well
   documented under the rapid urbanization in coastal zones. In this study,
   an algorithm based on periodic tidal inundations and full time-series
   indices was developed to map the detailed status and trends in the
   coastal wetlands in Fujian Province from 1994 to 2018 by using more than
   archived 5000 Landsat images. The results showed that in 2018, there
   were 1136.56 km(2) of coastal wetlands along the coast of Fujian with an
   overall accuracy of 95.63\%, which were mainly distributed in estuaries
   and bays. These coastal wetlands consisted of tidal flats, low marshes,
   and high marshes with proportions of 84.91\%, 13.05\%, and 2.04\%,
   respectively. An unprecedented loss of coastal wetlands has occurred in
   Fujian Province, with an annual rate of 15.44 km(2)/a from 1994 to 2018.
   Many coastal wetlands were reclaimed, dredged, and converted into inland
   areas for aquaculture ponds, ports, and built-up areas in different
   urbanization periods, which has led to a great loss of coastal spaces
   with an area of 476.87 km(2). The interplay between the loss of coastal
   wetlands and seaward urbanization will lead to severe fragmentation and
   squeezing effects in the coastal zone and will weaken the coastal
   protection from marine disasters that is provided by coastal wetlands.
   Therefore, we conceived two conceptional frameworks for sustainable
   coastal protection based on the current situations of the coastal
   communities to provide a trade-off between economic development and the
   protection of coastal developing countries in the world.},

Title = {Characterizing Sierra Nevada Snowpack Using Variable-Resolution CESM},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {The location, timing, and intermittency of precipitation in California
   make the state integrally reliant on winter-season snowpack accumulation
   to maintain its economic and agricultural livelihood. Of particular
   concern is that winter-season snowpack has shown a net decline across
   the western United States over the past 50 years, resulting in major
   uncertainty in water-resource management heading into the next century.
   Cutting-edge tools are available to help navigate and preemptively plan
   for these uncertainties. This paper uses a next-generation modeling
   techniquevariable-resolution global climate modeling within the
   Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM)at horizontal resolutions of 0.125
   degrees (14 km) and 0.25 degrees (28 km). VR-CESM provides the means to
   include dynamically large-scale atmosphere-ocean drivers, to limit model
   bias, and to provide more accurate representations of regional
   topography while doing so in a more computationally efficient manner
   than can be achieved with conventional general circulation models. This
   paper validates VR-CESM at climatological and seasonal time scales for
   Sierra Nevada snowpack metrics by comparing them with the Daymet,
   Cal-Adapt, NARR, NCEP, and North American Land Data Assimilation System
   (NLDAS) reanalysis datasets, the MODIS remote sensing dataset, the
   SNOTEL observational dataset, a standard-practice global climate model
   (CESM), and a regional climate model (WRF Model) dataset. Overall, given
   California's complex terrain and intermittent precipitation and that
   both of the VR-CESM simulations were only constrained by prescribed sea
   surface temperatures and data on sea ice extent, a 0.68 centered Pearson
   product-moment correlation, a negative mean SWE bias of <7 mm, an
   interquartile range well within the values exhibited in the reanalysis
   datasets, and a mean December-February extent of snow cover that is
   within 7\% of the expected MODIS value together make apparent the
   efficacy of the VR-CESM framework.},

   various anthropogenic activities, but there have been limited
   comprehensive studies on the relationship between coastline variation
   and anthropogenic activities at the watershed and local scales. The
   Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in China has experienced remarkable coastline
   variation along with rapid economic development and urbanization. In
   this study, the coastline of the PRE was extracted using Landsat images
   during 1987-2017, and the impacts of multiple factors on coastline
   variation were explored with correlation analysis and regression
   analysis. Results suggested coastlines of the PRE demonstrated a clear
   expanding trend over recent decades, and the coastline length had
   increased by 74.81 km and the land area had increased by 679.25 km(2) by
   2017, and results also showed rapid coastline variation during 1987-2004
   and relatively slow variation during 2004-2017. Artificial coastlines
   accounted for 80.90\% of the total coastline length in 2017, while
   natural coastlines accounted for only 19.10\%. In addition, reduction in
   the sand content caused by construction of reservoirs and river dredging
   in upstream areas played a dominant role in affecting natural coastline
   variation in the PRE, especially on the west coast. Moreover, the
   artificial coastline in the study area expanded quickly due to the
   influence of various human activities, among which the urbanization and
   land reclamation for aquaculture played a dominant role in affecting the
   artificial coastline variation on the east and west coasts,
   respectively. Results of this study have important value for
   understanding the individual and joint effects of various human
   activities on coastline variation and can provide important reference
   information for the sustainable management of the PRE as well as other
   estuaries.},

Title = {Does investment in irrigation technology necessarily generate rebound
   effects ? A simulation analysis based on an agro-economic model},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Investing in more efficient irrigation technology is usually regarded as
   a means to reduce the use of water by irrigated agriculture. However,
   some authors report that the introduction of irrigation systems that
   apply water more uniformly may actually increase water catchment
   depletion: the so-called `rebound effect'. In this paper a simple model
   that combines irrigation, agronomic, and microeconomic concepts is used
   to systematically analyze the conditions under which improved irrigation
   application uniformity may lead to increased water use and/or
   consumption. The analysis is illustrated with examples from the
   experience with irrigation modernization in Spain. Water demand (the
   value of marginal water productivity) becomes inelastic as the
   irrigation application uniformity increases. The increase in water
   depletion due to the introduction of more uniform irrigation systems is
   insignificant if land is limited and farmers optimize their profit. If
   land is not a limiting factor, new water abstractions are likely to
   occur, potentially leading to a vicious circle in which irrigated land
   expands while water resources become overexploited. This cycle tends to
   slow down as irrigation application uniformity increases. More accurate
   water accounting is suggested as an instrument for controlling water
   depletion complementary to investing in irrigation efficiency when water
   conservation at the basin scale is the main objective. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Modeling the global distribution of Culicoides imicola: an Ensemble
   approach},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Culicoides imicola is a midge species serving as vector for a number of
   viral diseases of livestock, including Bluetongue, and African Horse
   Sickness. C. imicola is also known to transmit Schmallenberg virus
   experimentally. E nvironmental and demographic factors may impose rapid
   changes on the global distribution of C. imicola and aid introduction
   into new areas. The aim of this study is to predict the global
   distribution of C. imicola using an ensemble modeling approach by
   combining climatic, livestock distribution and land cover covariates,
   together with a comprehensive global dataset of geo-positioned
   occurrence points for C. imicola. Thirty individual models were
   generated by `biomod2', with 21 models scoring a true skill statistic
   (TSS) > 0.8. These 21 models incorporated weighted runs from eight of
   ten algorithms and were used to create a final ensemble model. The
   ensemble model performed very well (TSS = 0.898 and ROC = 0.991) and
   indicated high environmental suitability for C. imicola in the tropics
   and subtropics. The habitat suitability for C. imicola spans from South
   Africa to southern Europe and from southern USA to southern China. The
   distribution of C. imicola is mainly constrained by climatic factors. In
   the ensemble model, mean annual minimum temperature had the highest
   overall contribution (42.9\%), followed by mean annual maximum
   temperature (21.1\%), solar radiation (13.6\%), annual precipitation
   (11\%), livestock distribution (6.2\%), vapor pressure (3.4\%), wind
   speed (0.8\%), and land cover (0.1\%). The present study provides the
   most up-to-date predictive maps of the potential distributions of C.
   imicola and should be of great value for decision making at global and
   regional scales.},

Abstract = {Significant relationship between tree height and ALS-derived topography
   was shown. Taller trees were found on slopes < 10A degrees and southerly
   aspects. Potential value of ALS in forest management applications was
   defined.
   Accurate information on tree height distribution can provide a better
   understanding of forest productivity and biomass estimation. Airborne
   light detection and ranging remote sensing, also known as airborne laser
   scanning (ALS), has proven to be an effective tool for deriving tree
   height information in forests. While tree height has been reported to
   vary in response to many environmental factors, few researchers have
   demonstrated the effect of topography on tree height variation using ALS
   data. This study investigated the relationship between tree height
   variation and ALS-derived topographic aspect and slope factors within
   two even-aged radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) plantation sites in
   Nundle, New South Wales, Australia. A total of 447 trees was sampled
   from 77 plots in two plantation age classes: 193 trees from a
   34-year-old site and 254 trees from a 9-year-old site. ALS height
   estimates were highly correlated with field heights (R (2) = 0.90 and
   RMSE = 0.66 for 2002 and R (2) = 0.87 and RMSE = 1.49 for 1977 sites).
   ALS-derived slope and aspect metrics were shown to have a significant
   relationship with height variation across the stands. The slope (P <
   0.01) and aspect (P < 0.001) were significant in the mixed linear
   models. Overall taller trees were found on slopes below 10A degrees and
   on southerly aspects, while shorter trees dominated steeper slopes (>
   20A degrees) and on northerly aspects. However, aspect gradient appeared
   to have more significant effect on tree heights than slope classes.
   These results were further verified using an additional 2,000 randomly
   located trees sampled across the plantations. The study demonstrates a
   significant relationship between tree height variation and ALS-derived
   ground aspect and slope categories which may have potential benefits for
   improving current wood resource inventories and future productivity
   models.},

Title = {Radar imaging mechanism of marine sand waves at very low grazing angle

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {111},
Number = {C10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {{[}1] The investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004 during six
   field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in
   monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for
   coastal management (OROMA) project aimed to improve the effectiveness of
   new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as shipborne imaging
   radars in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS
   Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, is based on a Kelvin Hughes RSR
   1000 X band (9.42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was
   mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the
   experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the
   North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the
   availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of
   the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular
   scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction
   theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have
   been taken at very low grazing angles <= 2.6 degrees of flood and ebb
   tide-oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal
   current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest <=
   0.6 m s(-1) have been measured at wind speeds <= 4.5 m s(-1) and water
   depths <= 25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and
   simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb
   tide-oriented sand wave is 27\%. For the flood tide-oriented sand wave,
   a difference of 21\% has been calculated. The difference between the
   minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide-oriented
   sand wave is 10\%, and for the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a value of
   43\% has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations
   correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated
   NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always
   quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the
   quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a
   first-order theory.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Substantial real cases can be formed from disease-specific online
   medical inquiry texts. Therefore, user preferences can constitute
   potentially rich commercial medical value and provide decision support
   for medical service recommendations. It is necessary to mine user
   preferences in disease-specific online medical inquiry texts. However,
   user preferences will change with cognitive behavior decisions in the
   context of disease-specific inquiry texts. More importantly, the context
   of disease-specific online inquiry texts in which user preferences are
   located will affect users' cognitive behavior decisions in real time.
   However, the existing preference access methods have relatively low
   precision since they fail to consider the inherent connection between
   different users' cognitive behaviors in various contexts and their
   preferences. We expanded the contextual perception preference model to
   propose a cognitive-behavior-based method to assess user preference. The
   contextual information (in online medical inquiry texts on various
   disease topics) and the impacts of user and text attributes on their
   cognitive behaviors were abstracted into concept models (including
   level, usefulness, risk, and effectiveness cognition) to obtain the
   mutual influences and adjusted relationships. Moreover, more accurate
   user cognition references were obtained within the multidimensional text
   space and multidimensional disease space. Based on a large-volume
   real-world dataset, our experiments revealed the AP@R as the evaluation
   standard. The method proposed in this article, compared with the
   contextual perception and ELPCAP algorithms, significantly improves the
   precision of preference prediction after the addition of cognitive
   behaviors, suggesting that the method can effectively mine the user
   cognitive behavior-preference relationships.},

Title = {Radius based domain clustering for WiFi indoor positioning},
Journal = {SENSOR REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-60},
Abstract = {Purpose - Nowadays, WiFi indoor positioning based on received signal
   strength (RSS) becomes a research hotspot due to its low cost and ease
   of deployment characteristics. To further improve the performance of
   WiFi indoor positioning based on RSS, this paper aims to propose a novel
   position estimation strategy which is called radius-based domain
   clustering (RDC). This domain clustering technology aims to avoid the
   issue of access point (AP) selection.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed positioning approach uses
   each individual AP of all available APs to estimate the position of
   target point. Then, according to circular error probable, the authors
   search the decision domain which has the 50 per cent of the intermediate
   position estimates and minimize the radius of a circle via a RDC
   algorithm. The final estimate of the position of target point is
   obtained by averaging intermediate position estimates in the decision
   domain.
   Findings - Experiments are conducted, and comparison between the
   different position estimation strategies demonstrates that the new
   method has a better location estimation accuracy and reliability.
   Research limitations/implications - Weighted k nearest neighbor approach
   and Naive Bayes Classifier method are two classic position estimation
   strategies for location determination using WiFi fingerprinting. Both of
   the two strategies are affected by AP selection strategies and
   inappropriate selection of APs may degrade positioning performance
   considerably.
   Practical implications - The RDC positioning approach can improve the
   performance of WiFi indoor positioning, and the issue of AP selection
   and related drawbacks is avoided.
   Social implications - The RSS-based effective WiFi indoor positioning
   system can makes up for the indoor positioning weaknesses of global
   navigation satellite system. Many indoor location-based services can be
   encouraged with the effective and low-cost positioning technology.
   Originality/value - A novel position estimation strategy is introduced
   to avoid the AP selection problem in RSS-based WiFi indoor positioning
   technology, and the domain clustering technology is proposed to obtain a
   better accuracy and reliability.},

Title = {Grizzly bear selection of recently harvested forests is dependent on
   forest recovery rate and landscape composition},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {449},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Forests in the early stages of regeneration are valuable habitat for
   threatened grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations inhabiting the
   interior mountains of North America, with forest management affecting
   the timing, prevalence, and quality of such habitats. Forest harvesting
   can lead to early-seral habitat, however the quality and duration of
   post-harvest habitat compared to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire),
   is not known. North American silvicultural practices are mandated to
   ensure tree regrowth following harvesting, and a rapid rate of growth in
   managed tree regeneration may lead to a shorter time window during which
   attractive early-seral habitat is available to bears compared to natural
   forest disturbances. The distribution of natural disturbances across
   forested landscapes may also be an important consideration in the
   response of bears to forest harvesting. In this study, we analyzed
   grizzly bear habitat selection for 160 collared grizzly bears across
   118,000-km(2) (68\% of their known habitat) in Alberta, Canada, using
   metrics of forest disturbance and recovery derived from a 33-year
   satellite time series. We developed seasonal resource selection
   functions to evaluate (1) if selection of recently harvested forests was
   contingent upon the availability of natural disturbances, (2) how
   habitat selection within disturbed areas varied across disturbance
   types, and (3) how habitat suitability changed over time during the
   first 30 years of forest recovery following various disturbance types.
   Results showed that, compared to areas not recently disturbed, grizzly
   bears were up to three times more likely to select for harvested forests
   when natural disturbances were limited in their home range, while
   selection of harvested forests was neutral when natural disturbances
   were abundant. When available, grizzly bears were more likely to select
   for natural disturbances compared to harvested locations, especially
   during Hypophagia (spring) and Hyperphagia (fall). Selection of
   harvested locations was inversely related to forest recovery assessed by
   spectral analysis and decreased sharply 15-20 years post-harvest, at
   which point it tended to be lower than pre-disturbance. This study
   demonstrates the utility of vegetation, disturbance, and recovery
   metrics derived from satellite time series for enriching our
   understanding of wildlife habitat selection in dynamic landscapes. Our
   results also have implications for forest management in regions where
   grizzly bear habitat availability and selection patterns are important.
   While rapid forest recovery following harvest is desirable and
   beneficial for a multitude of ecological and economic objectives, it
   appears to minimize the period of attractive early-seral habitat for
   grizzly bears.},

Title = {Probabilistic approach to cloud and snow detection on Advanced Very High
   Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {799-822},
Abstract = {Derivation of probability estimates complementary to geophysical data
   sets has gained special attention over the last years. Information about
   a confidence level of provided physical quantities is required to
   construct an error budget of higher-level products and to correctly
   interpret final results of a particular analysis. Regarding the
   generation of products based on satellite data a common input consists
   of a cloud mask which allows discrimination between surface and cloud
   signals. Further the surface information is divided between snow and
   snow-free components. At any step of this discrimination process a
   misclassification in a cloud/snow mask propagates to higher-level
   products and may alter their usability. Within this scope a novel
   probabilistic cloud mask (PCM) algorithm suited for the 1 km x 1 km
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is proposed which
   provides three types of probability estimates between: cloudy/clear-sky,
   cloudy/snow and clear-sky/snow conditions. As opposed to the majority of
   available techniques which are usually based on the decision-tree
   approach in the PCM algorithm all spectral, angular and ancillary
   information is used in a single step to retrieve probability estimates
   from the precomputed look-up tables (LUTs). Moreover, the issue of
   derivation of a single threshold value for a spectral test was overcome
   by the concept of multidimensional information space which is divided
   into small bins by an extensive set of intervals. The discrimination
   between snow and ice clouds and detection of broken, thin clouds was
   enhanced by means of the invariant coordinate system (ICS)
   transformation. The study area covers a wide range of environmental
   conditions spanning from Iceland through central Europe to northern
   parts of Africa which exhibit diverse difficulties for cloud/snow
   masking algorithms. The retrieved PCM cloud classification was compared
   to the Polar Platform System (PPS) version 2012 and Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 cloud masks, SYNOP
   (surface synoptic observations) weather reports, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and
   Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) vertical feature
   mask version 3 and to MODIS collection 5 snow mask. The outcomes of
   conducted analyses proved fine detection skills of the PCM method with
   results comparable to or better than the reference PPS algorithm.},

Title = {Can the watershed non-point source phosphorus flux amount be reflected
   by lake sediment?},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {118-130},

Abstract = {An understanding of the quantitative relationship between watershed
   non-point source (NPS) pollution and lake nutrient enrichment is
   essential for the environmental management of water bodies. However, a
   lack of data availability and integration limit our understanding of
   this relationship. The most critical bottlenecks are the lack of
   adequate support for watershed-lake integrated data, a lack of data of
   the nutrient loading from watersheds into a lake as NPS, and the
   long-term time series data of lake nutrient concentrations. Since lake
   sediment is the ultimate destination of watershed nutrients, this study
   aimed to reveal the relationship between watershed phosphorus (P)
   concentrations that are transported into lakes and lake P concentrations
   by using inlet sediments as an indicator. Three typical sub-basins
   within Hongze Lake, China were selected as the study site, and 30-year
   dataset was calculated using the technology integration of remote
   sensing, sediment chemical analysis and SWAT model assessment. It can be
   concluded that, first, the Mineral-P (Min-P) accounted for nearly 65\%
   of the watershed Total P (TP) loss, which varied over different basins
   and temporal periods. Second, the relationship between watershed P loss
   into lakes and sediment P concentrations represented obvious variation
   among different basins, sediment depths and P states. With respect to
   different basins, the highest correlation appeared in Basin 1, which had
   a R-2 value of 0.65 for Min-P. With respect to different P states, the
   Inorganic-P (IP) showed a closer relationship between watershed and lake
   P than Organic-P (OP), and the correlation coefficient (r) was higher
   than 0.6 in Basin 1 and Basin 3 for IP. In addition, the
   calcium-phosphorus ratio (Ca-P), which is largely sourced from watershed
   rock detritus by eroded runoff, played the most critical role among
   different Min-P states in the relatively ideal relationship of IP. With
   respect to different sediment depths, a stratification phenomenon
   existed in Basin 2 and Basin 3, which differed at specific depths. In
   particular, the ideal relationship only existed within the 7 cm depth
   from the bottom in basin 2, and this value expands to 10 cm for basin 3.
   This diversity was influenced by the integration roles from external and
   endogenous sources. All the findings indicated that lake surface
   sediment can be used as a proxy to represent NPS P loading under
   specific conditions. The relationship between watershed P loss and lake
   sediment P concentration was largely decided by land use/cover change
   (LUCC), meteorological conditions, and lake resuspension.},

Title = {Model-Observations Synergy in the Coastal Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Integration of observations of the coastal ocean continuum, from
   regional oceans to shelf seas and estuaries/deltas with models, can
   substantially increase the value of observations and enable a wealth of
   applications. In particular, models can play a critical role at
   connecting sparse observations, synthesizing them, and assisting the
   design of observational networks; in turn, whenever available,
   observations can guide coastal model development. Coastal observations
   should sample the two-way interactions between nearshore, estuarine and
   shelf processes and open ocean processes, while accounting for the
   different pace of circulation drivers, such as the fast atmospheric,
   hydrological and tidal processes and the slower general ocean
   circulation and climate scales. Because of these challenges,
   high-resolution models can serve as connectors and integrators of
   coastal continuum observations. Data assimilation approaches can provide
   quantitative, validated estimates of Essential Ocean Variables in the
   coastal continuum, adding scientific and socioeconomic value to
   observations through applications (e.g., sea-level rise monitoring,
   coastal management under a sustainable ecosystem approach, aquaculture,
   dredging, transport and fate of pollutants, maritime safety, hazards
   under natural variability or climate change). We strongly recommend an
   internationally coordinated approach in support of the proper
   integration of global and coastal continuum scales, as well as for
   critical tasks such as community-agreed bathymetry and coastline
   products.},

Title = {A survey of sensory data boundary estimation, covering and tracking

Abstract = {Boundary estimation and tracking have important applications in the
   areas of environmental monitoring and disaster management. A boundary
   separates two regions of interest in a phenomenon. It can be visualized
   as an edge if there is a sharp change in the field value between the two
   regions or alternatively, as a contour with a field value f = tau
   separating two regions with field values f > tau and f < tau. Examples
   include contours/boundaries of hazardous concentration in a pollutant
   spill, frontal boundary of a forest fire, isotherms, isohalines etc.
   Recent advances in the area of embedded sensor devices and robotics have
   led to deployments of networks of sensors capable of sensing, computing,
   communication and mobility. They are used to estimate the boundaries of
   interest in physical phenomena, monitor or track them over time and also
   in some cases, mitigate the spatial spread of the phenomena. Since these
   sensors work autonomously in the environment, minimizing the energy
   consumed while maximizing the accuracy of estimation or tracking is the
   main challenge for algorithms for boundary estimation and tracking.
   Several algorithms with these objectives have been proposed in the
   literature. In this work, we focus on the algorithms that estimate and
   cover boundaries found in the sensory data in a field and not the
   topological boundary of the sensor network per se, which is beyond the
   scope of this paper.
   Here, our objective is to provide a comprehensive survey of the
   algorithms for boundary estimation and tracking by providing a taxonomy
   based on two broad categories (i) Boundary estimation and tracking,
   where the sensors estimate the boundary without physically covering the
   boundary and (ii) Boundary covering - where the sensors not only predict
   the location and estimate the entire boundary but also physically cover
   the boundary by surrounding and bounding it. We further classify the
   techniques based on (a) sensing capabilities - in situ, range or remote
   sensing (b) movement capabilities - static or mobile sensors and (c)
   boundary type - static or dynamic and (d) type of estimation - field
   estimation where the entire field is sampled to search for contours and
   localized estimation where sampling is done near the boundary and (e)
   different types of mobility models in the case of mobile sensors. We
   believe that such a survey has not been performed before. By capturing
   and classifying the current state-of-the-art and identifying open
   research problems, we hope to ignite interest and stimulate efforts
   towards promising solutions for real-world boundary estimation and
   tracking problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Coastal mapping with satellite imagery is broadly used to calculate
   shoreline positions due to its high ecological and socioeconomic value
   in the context of coastal conservation and management strategies. We
   show the applicability of the Sentinel-1 to monitor large-scale

   shoreline extraction method based on C band from SAR missions, that
   improves coastal ocean/land discrimination. The method considers an
   automated processing chain using the incorporation of GLCM-mean texture
   information to increase improvements in image binarization by Sauvola
   thresholding. Results show that the proposed method may be used for
   shoreline monitoring of different types of geomorphology along the
   Mexican coastline, thus guaranteeing its applicability in different
   geographic surroundings. For the six specific areas of validation, the
   overall agreement between binarization ranges is from 90\% to 100\% and
   Sentinel-2 images are used to evaluate the VV and VH shorelines from
   Sentinel-1.},

Abstract = {We developed DeepSolar, a deep learning framework analyzing satellite
   imagery to identify the GPS locations and sizes of solar photovoltaic
   panels. Leveraging its high accuracy and scalability, we constructed a
   comprehensive high-fidelity solar deployment database for the contiguous
   US. We demonstrated its value by discovering that residential solar
   deployment density peaks at a population density of 1,000 capita/mile 2,
   increases with annual household income asymptoting at similar to\$150k,
   and has an inverse correlation with the Gini index representing income
   inequality. We uncovered a solar radiation threshold (4.5 kWh/m(2)/day)
   above which the solar deployment is ``triggered.'' Furthermore, we built
   an accurate machine learning-based predictive model to estimate the
   solar deployment density at the census tract level. We offer the
   DeepSolar database as a publicly available resource for researchers,
   utilities, solar developers, and policymakers to further uncover solar
   deployment patterns, build comprehensive economic and behavioral models,
   and ultimately support the adoption and management of solar electricity.},

Title = {A Novel Deep Learning Based Model for Tropical Intensity Estimation and
   Post-Disaster Management of Hurricanes},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The prediction of severe weather events such as hurricanes is always a
   challenging task in the history of climate research, and many deep
   learning models have been developed for predicting the severity of
   weather events. When a disastrous hurricane strikes a coastal region, it
   causes serious hazards to human life and habitats and also reflects a
   prodigious amount of economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to
   build models to improve the prediction accuracy and to avoid such
   significant losses in all aspects. However, it is impractical to predict
   or monitor every storm formation in real time. Though various techniques
   exist for diagnosing the tropical cyclone intensity such as
   convolutional neural networks (CNN), convolutional auto-encoders,
   recurrent neural network (RNN), etc., there are some challenges involved
   in estimating the tropical cyclone intensity. This study emphasizes
   estimating the tropical cyclone intensity to identify the different
   categories of hurricanes and to perform post-disaster management. An
   improved deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used for
   predicting the weakest to strongest hurricanes with the intensity values
   using infrared satellite imagery data and wind speed data from HURDAT2
   database. The model achieves a lower Root mean squared error (RMSE)
   value of 7.6 knots and a Mean squared error (MSE) value of 6.68 knots by
   adding the batch normalization and dropout layers in the CNN model.
   Further, it is crucial to predict and evaluate the post-disaster damage
   for implementing advance measures and planning for the resources. The
   fine-tuning of the pre-trained visual geometry group (VGG 19) model is
   accomplished to predict the extent of damage and to perform automatic
   annotation for the image using the satellite imagery data of Greater
   Houston. VGG 19 is also trained using video datasets for classifying
   various types of severe weather events and to annotate the weather event
   automatically. An accuracy of 98\% is achieved for hurricane damage
   prediction and 97\% accuracy for classifying severe weather events. The
   results proved that the proposed models for hurricane intensity
   estimation and its damage prediction enhances the learning ability,
   which can ultimately help scientists and meteorologists to comprehend
   the formation of storm events. Finally, the mitigation steps in reducing
   the hurricane risks are addressed.},

Title = {Exploring the use of Sentinel-2 datasets and environmental variables to
   model wheat crop yield in smallholder arid and semi-arid farming systems},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {869},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Low levels of agricultural productivity are associated with the
   persistence of food insecurity, poverty, and other socio-economic
   stresses. Mapping and monitoring agricultural dynamics and production in
   real-time at high spatial resolu-tion are essential for ensuring food
   security and shaping policy interventions. However, an accurate yield
   estimation might be challenging in some arid and semi-arid regions since
   input datasets are generally scarce, and access is re-stricted due to
   security challenges. This work examines how well Sentinel-2 satellite
   sensor-derived data, topographic and climatic variables, can be used as
   covariates to accurately model and predict wheat crop yield at the farm
   level using statistical models in low data settings of arid and
   semi-arid regions, using Sulaimani governorate in Iraq as an example. We
   developed a covariate selection procedure that assessed the correlations
   between the covariates and their relationships with wheat crop yield.
   Potential non-linear relationships were investigated in the latter case
   using regression splines. In the absence of substantial non-linear
   relationships between the covariates and crop yield, and residual
   spatial autocorrelation, we fitted a Bayesian multiple linear regression
   model to model and predict crop yield at 10 m resolution. Out of the
   covariates tested, our results showed significant relationships between
   crop yield and mean cumulative NDVI during the growing season, mean
   elevation, mean end of the season, mean maximum temperature and mean the
   start of the season at the farm level. For in-sample prediction, we
   estimated an R2 value of 51 \% for the model, whereas for out-of-sample
   prediction, this was 41 \%, both of which indicate reasonable predictive
   performance. The calculated root-mean-square error for out-of-sample
   prediction was 69.80, which is less than the standard deviation of 89.23
   for crop yield, further showing that the model performed well by
   reducing prediction var-iability. Besides crop yield estimates, the
   model produced uncertainty metrics at 10 m resolution. Overall, this
   study showed that Sentinel-2 data can be valuable for upscaling field
   measurement of crop yield in arid and semi-arid regions. In addition,
   the environmental covariates can strengthen the model predictive power.
   The method may be applicable in other areas with similar environments,
   particularly in conflict zones, to increase the availability of
   agricultural statistics.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aims to assess whether research and development
   (R\&D) personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental
   institutions contribute to innovation activities of firms from the Vise
   -grad Group countries.Research Design \& Methods: Fixed effects panel
   regression with robust standard errors was used for hypoth-esis testing
   over the period 2009-2017. The data for the study was extracted from
   Eurostat, the European Innovation Scoreboard and the Organisation for
   Economic Cooperation and Development with a particular focus on R\&D
   personnel from firms, the research system, and governmental
   institutions. The empirical analy-sis was focused on small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Findings: The results provide evidence
   about significant linkage between R\&D personnel from governmental
   institutions and innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group
   countries. The research also highlights the lack of a significant effect
   of R\&D personnel from firms and the research system on firms'
   innovation ac-tivities in the analysed former Soviet satellite economies
   distinguished by innovation performance below the average for the
   European Union.Implications \& Recommendations: Policy and practical
   implications that should be indicated include the ne-cessity to further
   develop knowledge cooperation between governmental institutions and
   firms in order to reinforce innovation processes. There is also a need
   to enhance cooperation between the research system and firms to support
   SMEs from the Visegrad Group countries with highly-skilled human
   resources.Contribution \& Value Added: This article adds to the
   literature on drivers and sources of firms' innovation activities by
   providing new empirical evidence on the effect of R\&D personnel on
   innovation activities of firms from the Visegrad Group countries, which
   are former Soviet satellite economies with a moderate level of
   in-novativeness and belong to peripheral countries in the European
   Union.},

Title = {Variation of satellite-derived total suspended matter in large lakes
   with four types of water storage across the Tibetan Plateau, China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {846},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Total suspended matter (TSM), as an indicator of the concentration of
   fine materials in the water column including particulate nutrients,
   pollutants, and heavy metals, is widely used to monitor aquatic
   ecosystems. However, the long-term spatiotemporal variations of TSM in
   lakes across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and their response to
   environmental factors are rarely explored. Accordingly, taking advantage
   of the Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance and in-situ data, an
   empirical model (R-2= 0.83, RMSE= 1.08 mg/L, and MAPE= 19.49 \%) was
   developed to estimate the average autumnal TSM in large TP lakes (>= 50
   km(2)) during the 1990-2020 period. For analyzing the spatiotemporal
   variability in TP lakes TSM, the examined lakes were classified into
   four types (Type A-D) based on their water storage changing in different
   periods. The results showed that the lakes in the southern and some
   northeastern parts of the TP exhibited lower TSM values than those
   situated in other regions. The assessment of TSM in each of these four
   lake types showed that more than half of them had a TSM value of < 20
   mg/L. Apart from Type D, the lakes with the TSM showing significantly
   decreasing trends were dominantly Types A-C. A relative contribution
   analysis involving five driving factors indicated that they contributed
   by > 50 \% to lake TSM interannual variation in 73 out of 114
   watersheds, and the lakes area change demonstrated the greatest
   contribution (82.2\%), followed by wind speed (11.0 \%). Further
   comparison between the entire lake and the non-expansive regions
   suggested that the expansive region played an indispensable role in
   determining the TSM value of the whole lake. This study can help to
   better understand the water quality condition and provide valuable
   information for policy-makers to maintain sustainable development in the
   TP region.},

Title = {Detection of the Coupling between Vegetation Leaf Area and Climate in a
   Multifunctional Watershed, Northwestern China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate detection and quantification of vegetation dynamics and drivers
   of observed climatic and anthropogenic change in space and time is
   fundamental for our understanding of the atmosphere-biosphere
   interactions at local and global scales. This case study examined the
   coupled spatial patterns of vegetation dynamics and climatic
   variabilities during the past three decades in the Upper Heihe River
   Basin (UHRB), a complex multiple use watershed in arid northwestern
   China. We apply empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and singular value
   decomposition (SVD) analysis to isolate and identify the spatial
   patterns of satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) and their close
   relationship with the variability of an aridity index (AI =
   Precipitation/Potential Evapotranspiration). Results show that UHRB has
   become increasingly warm and wet during the past three decades. In
   general, the rise of air temperature and precipitation had a positive
   impact on mean LAI at the annual scale. At the monthly scale, LAI
   variations had a lagged response to climate. Two major coupled spatial
   change patterns explained 29\% and 41\% of the LAI dynamics during
   1983-2000 and 2001-2010, respectively. The strongest connections between
   climate and LAI were found in the southwest part of the basin prior to
   2000, but they shifted towards the north central area afterwards,
   suggesting that the sensitivity of LAI to climate varied over time, and
   that human disturbances might play an important role in altering LAI
   patterns. At the basin level, the positive effects of regional climate
   warming and precipitation increase as well as local ecological
   restoration efforts overwhelmed the negative effects of overgrazing. The
   study results offer insights about the coupled effects of climatic
   variability and grazing on ecosystem structure and functions at a
   watershed scale. Findings from this study are useful for land managers
   and policy makers to make better decisions in response to climate change
   in the study region.},

Title = {Keynote - Total Design Data Needs for the New Generation Large-Scale
   Activity Microsimulation Models},
Booktitle = {TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {21-45},
Abstract = {Purpose - In this paper we describe a total design data collection
   method (expanding the definition of the usual ``total design''
   terminology used in typical household travel surveys) to emphasize the
   need to describe individual and group behaviors embedded within their
   spatial, temporal, and social contexts.
   Methodology/approach - We first offer an overview of recently developed
   modeling and simulation applications predominantly in North America
   followed by a summary of the data needs in typical modeling and
   simulation modules for statewide and regional travel demand forecasting.
   We then proceed to describe an ideal data collection scheme with core
   and satellite survey components that can inform current and future model
   building. Mention is also made to the currently implemented California
   Household Travel Survey that brings together multiple agencies, modeling
   goals, and data collection component surveys.
   Findings - The preparation of this paper involved reviewing emerging
   transportation modeling approaches and paradigms, policy questions, and
   behavioral issues and considerations that are important in the
   multimodal transportation planning context. It was found that many of
   the questions being asked of policy makers in the transportation domain
   require a deep understanding of the interactions and constraints under
   which individuals make activity-travel choices, the learning processes
   at play, and the attitudes and perceptions that shape ways in which
   people adjust their travel behavior in response to policy interventions.
   Based on the work, it was found that many of the traditional travel
   survey designs are not able to provide the comprehensive data needed to
   estimate activity-based model systems that truly capture the full range
   of behavioral considerations and phenomena of importance.
   Originality/value of paper - This paper offers a review of the emerging
   transportation modeling approaches and behavioral paradigms of
   importance in activity-based travel demand forecasting. The paper
   discusses how traditional travel survey designs are inadequate to meet
   the data needs of emerging modeling approaches. Based on a review of all
   of the data needs and new data collection methods that are making it
   possible to observe a full range of human behaviors, the paper offers a
   total survey data collection design that brings together many different
   surveys and data collection protocols. The core household travel survey
   is augmented by a full slate of special purpose surveys that together
   yield a rich behavioral database for activity-based microsimulation
   modeling. The paper is a valuable reference for transportation planners
   and modelers interested in developing data collection enterprises that
   will feed the next generation of transportation models.},

Title = {Recommendations on stress management},
Journal = {CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {160},
Number = {9, S},
Pages = {S46-S50},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health
   care professionals concerning the effects of stress management on the
   prevention and control of hypertension in otherwise healthy adults
   (except pregnant women).
   Options: Alternatives to stress management include other
   nonpharmacologic interventions and medical therapy; these options are
   not mutually exclusive.
   Outcomes: The health outcome considered was reduction of blood pressure.
   There is little evidence to date that stress management prevents death
   or vascular events. Because of insufficient evidence, no economic
   outcomes were considered.
   Evidence: A systematic search of the literature (which yielded, among
   other sources, 3 meta-analyses) was conducted for the period 1966-1997
   with the terms essential hypertension, treatment, psychological,
   behavioural, cognitive, relaxation, meditation, biofeedback and stress
   management. Other relevant evidence was obtained from the reference
   lists of the articles identified, from the personal files of the authors
   and through contacts with experts. The articles were reviewed,
   classified according to study design and graded according to level of
   evidence.
   Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular
   morbidity and premature death caused by uncontrolled hypertension.
   Benefits, harms and costs: The magnitude of the reduction in blood
   pressure obtained with multicomponent, individualized cognitive
   behavioural intervention for stress management was comparable in some
   studies to that obtained with weight loss or drugs; single-component
   interventions such as biofeedback or relaxation were less effective. The
   adverse effects of stress-management techniques are minimal, but the
   cost for effective interventions is substantial, similar initially to
   drug costs; continuing costs are probably minimal.
   Recommendations: (1) In patients with hypertension, the contribution of
   stress should be considered. (2) For hypertensive patients in whom
   stress appears to be an important issue, stress management should be
   considered as an intervention. Individualized cognitive behavioural
   interventions are more likely to be effective than single-component
   interventions.
   Validation: These recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring
   organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth
   International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They have not been
   clinically tested.
   Sponsors: The Canadian Hypertension Society, the Canadian Coalition for
   High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, the Laboratory Centre for
   Disease Control at Health Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of

Title = {Waking the Sleeping Giant: Agricultural intensification, extensification
   or stagnation in Mali's Guinea Savannah},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {58-70},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The World Bank argued that West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part
   of ``Africa's Sleeping Giant,{''}where increases in agricultural
   production could be an engine of economic growth, through expansion of
   cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni,
   in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources
   including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover
   classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to
   investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway
   of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then
   used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future
   pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which
   since the mid-1980s has provided support for intensive agricultural
   systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of
   mineral fertilizer. In the period of the panel survey (1994-2012),
   cropped land at household level was correlated with household size:
   households with less than one full team of draft oxen cultivated 0.50
   ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated
   0.82 ha/family member (R-2 > 0.8). At the village level, cropped land
   increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the
   importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and
   cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency.
   However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton
   yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below
   national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on
   long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either
   intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be
   best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to
   invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining
   or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25\% of
   household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland
   expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict
   between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased
   inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land
   expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or
   market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as
   mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining
   savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding
   household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and
   ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple
   viable pathways towards desirable futures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Modelling the distribution of migratory species has rarely been extended
   beyond breeding and wintering ranges despite many species showing much
   more complex movement patterns with multiple stopovers. We aimed to
   create a temporally explicit species distribution model describing the
   full annual distribution cycle, and use it to model the complex seasonal
   shifts in distribution of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, a declining
   long-distance migrant. To do this we used full-year satellite telemetry
   occurrence data, with their associated temporal information, to inform a
   temporally explicit species distribution model using MaxEnt. The
   resulting full-year distribution model was highly predictive (AUC =
   0.894) and appeared to have generality at the species-level despite
   being informed by data from a single breeding population. Comparison of
   our methodology with seasonal distribution models describing the
   breeding, winter and migration ranges separately showed that our
   full-year method provided more general and extensive predictions and
   performed better when tested with an independent dataset. When species
   distribution models based on a single season exclude environmental
   conditions experienced by birds in other parts of the annual cycle they
   risk underestimating niche breadth and neglecting the importance of
   stopover habitat. Conversely, models which simply average conditions
   across a season may miss the significance of finer scale within-season
   movements and overestimate niche breadth. In contrast, our framework for
   a full-year migrant distribution model successfully captures the
   finer-scale changes expected in seasonal environments and can be used to
   inform conservation management at every stage of migration. The
   full-year model framework appears to produce temporal distribution
   models generalised to the species-level from occurrence data limited to
   few individuals of a single population and may have particular utility
   when aiming to describe the distribution of species with complex
   migration patterns from telemetry data.},

Abstract = {Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk
   factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing
   national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this
   study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in
   context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for
   previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate
   attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends
   in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural,
   environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks
   from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met
   World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable
   evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from
   randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household
   surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used
   statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate
   covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure
   across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual
   scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of
   deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed
   trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth,
   population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific
   DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a
   Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation,
   household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and
   smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several
   occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased
   by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in
   2015 accounted for 57.8\% (95\% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and
   41.2\% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to
   global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure
   (211.8 million {[}192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking
   (148.6 million {[}134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma
   glucose (143.1 million {[}125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI
   (120.1 million {[}83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood
   undernutrition (113.3 million {[}103.9 million to 123.4 million]),
   ambient particulate matter (103.1 million {[}90.8 million to 115.1
   million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million {[}74.6 million to 105.7
   million]), household air pollution (85.6 million {[}66.7 million to
   106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million {[}77.2 million to 93.0
   million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million {[}49.3 million to
   127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for
   micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation
   and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY
   rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising
   exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from
   high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and
   drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined
   steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting
   plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks,
   such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most
   attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the
   leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries;
   childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early
   death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed
   to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be
   invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting
   plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to
   rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for
   intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain
   major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining.
   Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are
   increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The

Abstract = {Satellite technology has been used over the years by the countries the
   world over with the benefits percolating down to the society. It has
   contributed in revolutionising communications, improving natural
   resources management systems, facilitating the study of agriculture
   potential and in various fields of economic development. Satellites have
   also been used for surveillance, emergency preparedness and coordinating
   search and rescue operations on a global basis. A unique benefit of this
   technology has been realised in the area of navigation and
   radiopositioning.
   Satellite based navigation and radiopositioning was first implemented by
   the USA with the launch of TRANSIT System. TRANSIT had paved the way for
   worldwide acceptance of satellite navigation although its use, life and
   accuracy of position fixing were limited. These limitations were
   overcome with the introduction of concept of Global Positioning System
   (GPS). GPS was conceived in 1974 by the USA as a better and faster
   navigation system capable of providing three dimensional position and
   velocity information along-with precise time to all types of users
   anywhere on a 24 hours basis. GPS provides for two levels of services
   i.e. Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Precise Positioning Service
   (PPS). The SPS is intended to provide a position fix that is accurate to
   within 100 meters on 95 percent of occasions, whereas PPS requires
   transfer from Coarse (C/A) code to the more accurate Precision (P) code,
   which allows accuracy of 16 meters on 50 percent of occasions.
   The accuracy of 100 meters available to civil users through SPS may not
   meet the requirements of applications in offshore oil exploration,
   hydrographic survey, physical oceanographic operation, fixing, collision
   avoidance, harbour approach and landing of aircraft, geophysical survey
   of remote locations and conducting search and rescue operations etc.
   This degraded accuracy can however be improved using the concept of
   Differential GPS (DGPS).
   This article deals with various issues related to the GPS technologies,
   their potential applications and system configurations available for
   these applications. An approach for design, development and
   demonstration of GPS and DGPS in Indian conditions with the active
   participation of user departments, industries and R\&D institutions
   engaged in this field has also been discussed. Since the GPS/DGPS is a
   system with potential of revolutionising the concepts in navigation and
   radiopositioning applications, it is hoped that this article will pave
   the way for promoting developmental activities for GPS/DGPS and Indian
   industries will gear up to meet the large requirements anticipated in
   near future for these.},

Title = {Development and validation of a model to estimate postharvest losses
   during transport of tomatoes in West Africa},

Abstract = {In an effort to better understand postharvest losses associated with
   low-cost tomato transport in West Africa we present a spatial-temporal
   simulation model that links the prevailing outside weather conditions,
   estimated using satellite meteorology, to the microclimate observed
   inside truck trailers (cryptoclimate) to determine the deterioration in
   tomato quality during transport. Tomatoes from Burkina Faso are
   transported under sub-optimal circumstances to important Ghanaian
   markets; during a number of these transports conditions for the tomato
   cargo inside trucks were measured while conditions outside the trucks
   were monitored by means of weather satellites. The presented tomato
   quality model analytically combines cryptoclimate, duration since
   harvest, and kinetic modelling to arrive at estimated firmness. Firmness
   of tomatoes in transport was monitored with a portable penetrometer in
   selected trucks, augmented with additional (acoustic firmness) data
   collected in a climate chamber. Half of these observations were used to
   calibrate a firmness loss model and the other half to validate the
   simulation results.
   Our results indicate that outside weather during transport can be
   reasonably well estimated using satellite meteorology. The model
   performance for the estimation of outside global radiation (Rg) and
   land-surface temperature (LST) were found to be satisfactory, with a
   RMSE = 87.98 W m(-2); bias = 57.39 W m(-2) and RMSE = 2.95 degrees C;
   bias = 0.91 degrees C, respectively. Results for the cryptoclimate
   estimation (conditions inside the trucks) for temperature, relative
   humidity, and light intensity were as follows: R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 4.18
   degrees C (T-incargo); R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 19.59\% (RHincargo); and R-2 =
   0.9, RMSE = 137.31 lx (LIincargo). The postharvest loss model that
   relies on these estimates as its input explained on average 77\% of the
   variance in observed tomatoes firmness, with total product losses
   ranging from 30\% to 50\% when integrated over the entire transportation
   period.
   With the accuracy of the model quantified and the causality of losses
   partially demonstrated, we argue that the simulation model can be useful
   as an economic resistor in transport optimization studies to investigate
   the cost-benefit of various measures to reduce postharvest losses. Such
   studies could help to illustrate what net gains can be expected if
   delays along the transportation route are reduced, cargo conditions are
   semi-controlled (e.g. pre-cooling treatment), or if a different
   transport schedule is adopted. The model may also be used to show the
   impact of different climate change scenarios on postharvest losses. (C)

Title = {Spatiotemporal landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning
   models: A case study from district Hattian Bala, NW Himalaya, Pakistan},

Abstract = {The Himalayan region, a rugged mountain zone is among the most
   susceptible zones to the landslide hazard due to its terrain, geography,
   and active tectonics. Machine learning (ML) techniques are most advanced
   and precise methods to develop landslide susceptibility model (LSM). The
   current study was designed to analyze and assess the landslide
   susceptibility using ML approaches for District Hattian Bala, NW
   Himalayas, Pakistan. The historical satellite imageries are used to
   generate spatiotemporal landslide inventories of year 2005, 2007 and
   2012. A spatial database was created pertaining to topographic,
   environmental, geologic, and anthropogenic factors including slope,
   aspect, elevation, curvature, plane curvature, profile curvature,
   topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, distance to faults, distance
   to streams, distance to roads, normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) and land use/ land cover (LULC). These LCFs were selected to
   analyze periodic landslide susceptibility in the region. The
   experimental design utilized 349, 393, and 735 landslide inventory of
   2005, 2007, and 2012 respectively. Two ML models, i.e., Random Forest
   (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR) were applied to assess landslide
   susceptibility determine by thirteen landslide causative factors (LCFs).
   The spatiotemporal landslide inventory was partitioned into training
   (70\%) and testing (30\%) landslides for respective years to check the
   prediction accuracies of selected ML models. Comparative analysis of
   different LSMs was performed by the Receiver Operator Curves - Area
   Under Curves (ROC-AUC). The resultant accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Kappa,
   Precision, Recall, F1 indicated that RF outperformed the LR model. The
   study aims to minimize losses to lives and potential economic damage
   linked with recurrent slope instabilities in the region. It is
   anticipated that use of ML algorithms would support concerned
   authorities and organizations to effectively plan and manage landslide
   hazard in the region.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on

Title = {Estimation of the Value of Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration Services under
   Different Scenarios in the Central China (the Qinling-Daba Mountain
   Area)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Qinling-Daba Mountain area is a transitional zone between north and
   south China and not much is known about its carbon storage, particularly
   its pool of soil organic carbon (SOC). Given this shortcoming, more
   reliable information regarding its SOC is needed. In light of this, we
   quantified above and below-ground carbon sinks using both the
   Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon
   cycle process model. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for
   carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios
   using the NPV model. Our results indicated that the net primary
   productivity (NPP) was lower in places with low density forests that
   were situated at high elevation. The spatial distribution of carbon
   storage depended on NPP production and litter decompositon, which
   reflected specific vegetation as well as temperature and moisture
   gradients. The lowest amounts of carbon storage were in the center of
   the Qinling Mountains and also partly in the Daba area, which is a
   location associated with sparse grassland. Contrastingly, the
   broad-leaved forested area showed the highest amount of carbon storage.
   NPV was positively correlated with discount rate and carbon prices, thus
   resulting in the highest values in the forests and grassland. The net
   present value of total soil carbon sequestration in the six scenarios in
   2015 was 3.555 b yuan, 3.621 b yuan, 5.421 b yuan, 5.579 b yuan, 7.530 b
   yuan, 7.929 b yuan; The net present value of total soil carbon
   sequestration in 6 scenarios in 2017 is 2.816 b yuan, 2.845 b yuan,
   4.361 b yuan, 4.468 b yuan, 6.144 b yuan, 6.338 b yuan (billion = 10(9);
   b; RMB is the legal currency of the China, and its unit is yuan, 1 euro
   = 7.7949 yuan, and 1 pound = 9.2590 yuan). Levying a carbon tax would be
   a notable option for decision makers as they develop carbon emission
   reduction policies. Given this, incorporating discount rates and carbon
   pricing would allow for more realistic value estimations of soil organic
   carbon. This approach would also provide a theoretical basis and
   underscore the practical significance for the government to set a
   reasonable carbon price.},

Title = {Lightning and Severe Weather: A Comparison between Total and
   Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Trends},
Journal = {WEATHER AND FORECASTING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {744-755},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Many studies over the past several decades have attempted to correlate
   trends in lightning (e.g., rates, polarity) to severe weather
   occurrence. These studies mainly used cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning
   information due to the ease of data availability, high detection
   efficiency, and broad coverage across the United States, with somewhat
   inconclusive results. Conversely, it has been demonstrated that trends
   in total lightning are more robustly correlated to severe weather
   occurrence, with rapid increases in total lightning observed 10s of
   minutes prior to the onset of severe weather. Unfortunately, total
   lightning observations are not as numerous, or available over the same
   areal coverage domain, as provided by CG networks. Relatively few
   studies have examined concurrent trends in both total and CG lightning
   within the same severe thunderstorm, or even large sets of thunderstorms
   using an objective lightning jump algorithm. Multiple studies have shown
   that the total flash rate rapidly increases prior to the onset of severe
   weather. What is untested within the same framework is the use of CG
   information to perform the same task. Herein, total and CG lightning
   trends for 711 thunderstorms occurring in four regions of the country
   were examined to demonstrate the increased utility that total lightning
   provides over CG lightning, specifically within the framework of
   developing a useful lightning-based severe weather warning decision
   support tool. Results indicate that while both lightning datasets
   demonstrate the presence of increased lightning activity prior to the
   onset of severe weather, the use of total lightning trends was more
   effective than CG trends {[}probability of detection (POD), 79\% versus
   66\%; false alarm rate (FAR), 36\% versus 53\%; critical success index
   (CSI), 55\% versus 38\%; Heidke skill score (HSS), 0.71 versus 0.55].
   Moreover, 40\% of false alarms associated with total lightning, and 16\%
   of false alarms with CG lightning trends, occurred when a lightning jump
   associated with a severe weather ``warning{''} was already in effect. If
   these false alarms are removed, the FAR drops from 36\% to 22\% for
   total lightning and from 53\% to 44\% for CG lightning. Importantly,
   average lead times prior to severe weather occurrence were higher using
   total lightning as compared with CG lightning (20.65 versus 13.54 min).
   The ultimate goal of this study was to demonstrate the increased utility
   of total lightning information that the Geostationary Lightning Mapper
   (GLM) will provide to operational meteorology in anticipation of severe
   convective weather on a hemispheric scale once Geostationary Operational
   Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) is deployed in the next decade.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {4001-4018},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Sensors, communication systems and geo-reference units are required to
   achieve an optimized management of agricultural inputs with respect to
   the economic and environmental aspects of olive groves. In this study,
   three commercial olive harvesters were tracked during two harvesting
   seasons in Spain and Chile using remote and autonomous equipment that
   was developed to determine their time efficiency and effective based on
   canopy shaking for fruit detachment. These harvesters work in
   intensive/high-density (HD) and super-high-density (SHD) olive orchards.
   A GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GSM (Global System for
   Mobile Communications) device was installed to track these harvesters.
   The GNSS receiver did not affect the driver's work schedule. Time
   elements methodology was adapted to the remote data acquisition system.
   The effective field capacity and field efficiency were investigated. In
   addition, the field shape, row length, angle between headland alley and
   row, and row alley width were measured to determinate the optimum
   orchard design parameters value. The SHD olive harvester showed
   significant lower effective field capacity values when alley width was
   less than 4 m. In addition, a yield monitor was developed and installed
   on a traditional olive harvester to obtain a yield map from the
   harvested area. The hedge straddle harvester stood out for its highly
   effective field capacity; nevertheless, a higher field efficiency was
   provided by a non-integral lateral canopy shaker. All of the measured
   orchard parameters have influenced machinery yields, whether effective
   field capacity or field efficiency. A saving of 40\% in effective field
   capacity was achieved with a reduction from 4 m or higher to 3.5 m in
   alley width for SHD olive harvester. A yield map was plotted using data
   that were acquired by a yield monitor, reflecting the yield gradient in
   spite of the larger differences between tree yields.},

Abstract = {Rapid global economic expansion has resulted in a drastic increase of
   urbanization while impacting the Earth's entire ecology. This study
   evaluates the impact of historical land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change
   signatures on seasonal variation of climatic variables using a cloud
   platform-Google Earth Engine. Due to rapid urbanization and the
   noticeable spatio-temporal difference in the climate, administrative
   units of Dakshina Kannada district are taken for demonstration. The
   LU/LC of the district extracted from high-resolution images of Landsat
   using random forest classification, land surface temperature (LST)
   extracted from the thermal band of Landsat images using the mono window
   algorithm, evapotranspiration (ET) data extracted from MOD16A2.006 and
   precipitation data from CHIPRS was used. The data was extracted for the
   pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period 2001-2019. The district has seen a
   13.67\% reduction in the forest area with 18.81\% increase in the
   built-up areas. The LST and ET has seen a progressive drift in the past
   two decades, with an increase of 4.07 degrees C in median temperature in
   forest areas and a decline of 2.19 mm in median ET value, which
   necessitates monitoring forest encroachment. The higher variation in
   maximum LST in built-up land (0.36 degrees C) (near the industrial area)
   indicates that LU/LC change signature is the predominant driving factor
   and is associated with the physical characteristics of the built-up
   area. The ET exhibited a decreasing rate of 0.62 mm/year/sq.km of the
   built-up land. This study highlights the power of Google Earth Engine
   and free availability of satellite data in environmental protection,
   land-use management and sustainable development in the region.},

Title = {Heterogeneous accountingisation Accounting and inter-organisational
   cooperation in home care services},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING AUDITING \& ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1080-1112},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to explore the effects of the increased
   influence of accounting on core values and practices within the services
   providing home care in Sweden a public sector setting involving
   inter-organisational cooperation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case study data were obtained primarily
   through semi-structured interviews with managers and front-line staff
   involved in home care.
   Findings - When accountingisation is extended to include
   inter-organisational cooperation, a form of heterogeneous
   accountingisation occurred in the home care services: an internal domain
   (with a low level of accountingisation) could be differentiated from an
   inter-organisational domain (with a high level of accountingisation).
   When the accounting-induced disturbances intensified, there was a
   redefinition of core values. In the internal domain, core values of
   pensioner-oriented focus and flexibility during service delivery
   persisted. In contrast, in the inter-organisational domain, core values
   had the legal boundaries of the organisation as their central
   foundation, standardisation was emphasised, and inter-organisational
   work practices were defined as the other organisation's responsibility.
   The findings also extend the research on absorption groups by indicating
   the rise of a new type of absorption process. Absorption was not
   undertaken by a few individuals, specialist work groups or satellite
   organisations, as described in the literature; instead, all front-line
   welfare professionals were involved in absorbing the accounting-induced
   disturbances when performing their tasks.
   Research limitations/implications - This case study research is
   context-specific and the meaning and consequences of accountingisation
   may differ within the public sector because of the status and strength
   of professional groups concerned.
   Originality/value - To date, research on accountingisation has primarily
   employed an intra-organisational perspective. This paper analyses
   accountingisation in an inter-organisational setting.},

Abstract = {Landslide susceptibility (LSI) modeling of Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya is
   performed by integrating 28 causative factors on C-28(28) combinations
   on Geographical Information System (GIS) following analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP)-based multicriteria decision protocol, logistic regression
   (LR)-based multivariate technique, machine learning data-driven random
   forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods wherein the
   terrain is classified into `None' (with: 0.0 < LSI <= 0.17), `Low'
   (with: 0.17 < LSI <= 0.34), `Moderate' (with: 0.34 < LSI <= 0.51),
   `High' (with: 0.51 < LSI <= 0.68),'Very High' (with: 0.68 < LSI <= 0.85)
   and `Severe' (with: 0.85 < LSI <= 1.00) susceptible zones as validated
   through standard statistical accuracy tests and direct cross-correlation
   analysis of all the susceptible zonation maps generated by drawing
   comparison with the 30\% landslide inventory test data. The best
   integrated thematic RF-based LSI vector layer with an accuracy level of
   0.871, in turn, on integration with the vulnerability components like
   population density, number of households, building types, building
   height and building density has demarketed approximately 21\% of the
   region under `Very High' to `Severe' socioeconomic risk zone while about
   36\% area are classified under `Very High' to `Severe' structural risk
   zone as implicated by devastating landslide hazards in the region.
   Ground Penetrating Radar Survey has been conducted on all the slopes in
   the `Very High to Severe' landslide susceptible zones wherein
   near-surface lithologic setting, presence of paleo-slopes and
   microstructural features like fractures/faults and poorly stratified
   debris flow have been imaged that provided favorable subsurface
   conditions for slope failure. Finite element method-based slope failure
   analysis for Newmark displacement estimates factor of safety (FoS) value
   that acts as the proxy in defining the degree of slope instability is
   seen to vary between 1.905 and 2.357 in the `Low to Moderate' landslide
   susceptible zone while it ranges between 1.051 and 1.652 in the `High'
   landslide susceptible zone and between 0.649 and 1.349 in the `Very High
   to Severe' landslide inventory subset along the slopes under both
   gravity loading and seismic shaking in the terrain. The slope stability
   analysis puts the yield acceleration between 0.0012 and 0.11984 m/s(2)
   and the total deformation between 0.0027 and 1.4484 m. All these
   parameters in the classified landslide susceptible zones in unison
   demonstrate how unstable are the terrain slopes in the `High to Severe'
   landslide susceptible zones.},

Title = {Measuring the U.S. outdoor recreation economy, 2012-2016},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND
   MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper summarizes the methodology and results of newly-released
   federal statistics describing the U.S. outdoor recreation economy. These
   new statistics show that outdoor recreation represented 2.2\% of the
   U.S. economy from 2012 to 2016, similar in size to the utilities and
   mining industries. Boating/fishing contributed \$38.2 billion to gross
   output in 2016, followed by game areas (includes golfing and tennis)
   (\$36.3 billion) and RVing (\$30.8 billion). Additionally, more than 4.5
   million jobs were generated by the outdoor recreation economy in 2016,
   resulting in \$213.6 billion of compensation paid to U.S. workers. These
   new statistics provide for the first time a comprehensive and consistent
   measure of the value of outdoor recreation to the U.S. economy. Any
   future updates to these statistics may consider adding regional data and
   a longer time series to provide even more meaningful statistics to
   researchers and policymakers.
   Management implications: New statistics provide estimates of the outdoor
   recreation economy from an unbiased source: the outdoor recreation
   satellite account (ORSA). The ORSA provides a solid framework to measure
   the outdoor economy and can be used
   -To show the significance of the outdoor recreation economy
   -To compare its relevance with other economic sectors
   -To examine the growth of the outdoor recreation economy over time in a
   detailed manner
   -To pay attention to specific outdoor recreation activities and their
   respective changes over time.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful
   conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of
   high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely
   dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g.
   temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be
   related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined
   with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas)
   reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in
   a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W
   30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea
   surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects
   of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four
   consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07,
   2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time
   during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to
   juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture
   management and genetics were standardized significant differences
   verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental
   effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing
   data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual
   variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed
   to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main
   factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of
   negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other
   hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected
   by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased
   by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW,
   related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on
   occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater
   penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity
   nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may
   also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino
   period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a
   levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number
   of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain
   northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the
   La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher
   chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and
   penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased
   occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the
   potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an
   important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture.

Title = {Mapping Oyster Reef Distribution Using Kompsat-2/3 and Linear Spectral
   Unmixing Algorithm - A Case Study at Hwangdo Tidal Flat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Number = {102},
Pages = {246-253},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Oyster areas are widely used as species of biological indicator, and
   they are also the most important shellfish in terms of ecosystem
   economic valuation. Oysters are production on the west coast before 2007
   accounted for about 5 \% of the nation's total production, but the 2007
   Hebei Spirit oil spill caused production to plunge to less than 1 \%.
   Therefore, spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs are required to
   help local authorities define management strategies. In this study,
   Kompsat-2/3 was used to map oyster reef distribution and analyze the
   distribution of oyster reefs based on linear spctral unmixing in Hwangdo
   tidal flat. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions
   with a field spectroradiometer, was used to conduct linear spectral
   unmixing classifications on Kompsat-2/3 data. The classification result
   shows very high accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 95 \% or more, and
   there were misclassifications in some areas. The most causes of
   misclassification are the similarity of spectral characteristics and the
   limitations of the spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite images.
   For this reason, it was difficult to distinguish between oyster reefs
   and area distributed with many macrobenthos, and small-young oyster
   reefs were difficult to classify due to very weak reflectivity. In
   addition, the sand bar, it was is difficult to distinguish between
   oyster reefs related to dead reefs and sandbars because of the high
   reflectivity of these areas in the imagery. As a result of analyzing the
   change in the oyster reef area, it increased in 2019 compared to that in
   2015. Especially, the oyster reef area increased in 30-50 \% sand
   content and decreased in 20-30 \% and 60-70 \%. The changes of sand
   sediment seem to affect the distribution of oyster reefs. This study may
   be useful for mapping the distribution of oyster reefs and understanding
   the spatial variation of their habitat.},

   spatial characteristics of county-level energy-related carbon emissions
   in Northeast China from 2012 to 2020. At the same time, we use the
   geographic detector method to analyze the impact of various
   socio-economic factors on county carbon emissions under the single
   effect and interaction. The main results are as follows: (1) The
   county-level carbon emission model in Northeast China is relatively more
   accurate. The regression coefficient is 0.1217 and the determination
   coefficient R-2 of the regression equation is 0.7722. More than 80\% of
   the provinces have an error of less than 25\%, meeting the estimation
   accuracy requirements. (2) From 2012 to 2020, the carbon emissions of
   county-level towns in Northeast China showed a trend of increasing first
   and then decreasing from 461.1159 million tons in 2012 to 405.752
   million tons in 2020. It reached a peak of 486.325 million tons in 2014.
   (3) The regions with higher carbon emission growth rates are
   concentrated in the northern and coastal areas of Northeast China. The
   areas with low carbon emission growth rates are mainly distributed in
   some underdeveloped areas in the south and north in Northeast China. (4)
   Under the effect of the single factor urbanization rate, the added
   values of the secondary industry and public finance income have higher
   explanatory power to regional emissions. These factors promote the
   increase of county carbon emissions. When fiscal revenue and expenditure
   and the added value of the secondary industry and per capita GDP
   interact with the urbanization rate, respectively, the explanatory power
   of these factors on regional carbon emissions will be enhanced and the
   promotion of carbon emissions will be strengthened. The research results
   are helpful for exploring the changing rules and influencing factors of
   county carbon emissions in Northeast China and for providing data
   support for low-carbon development and decision making in Northeast
   China.},

Title = {LiDAR as a Tool for Assessing Timber Assortments: A Systematic
   Literature Review},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Forest ecosystems strongly contribute to the mitigation of climate
   change impacts through the carbon stored in forests and through
   harvested wood products, such as sawed wood and furniture, which are
   obtained from many types of timber assortments. Timber assortments are
   defined as log sections of specific dimensions (log length and
   maximum/minimum end diameters), gathered from felled trunks, that have
   both specific commercial timber utilisation and economic value. However,
   it is challenging to discriminate and assess timber assortment types,
   especially within a forest stand before the forest has been harvested.
   Accurate estimations of timber assortments are a fundamental
   prerequisite in supporting forest holdings and assisting practitioners
   in the optimisation of harvesting activities and promoting forest wood
   chains, in addition to forest policy and planning. Based on the
   georeferenced points cloud tool, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is
   a powerful technology for rapidly and accurately depicting forest
   structure, even if the use of LiDAR for timber assortments estimation is
   lacking and poorly explored. This systematic literature review aimed to
   highlight the state-of-the-art applications of the LiDAR systems
   (spaceborne; airborne, including unmanned aerial UASs; and terrestrial)
   to quantify and classify different timber assortment types. A total of
   304 peer-reviewed papers were examined. The results highlight a constant
   increment of published articles using LiDAR systems for forest-related
   aspects in the period between 2000 and 2021. The most recurring
   investigation topics in LiDAR studies were forest inventory and forest
   productivity. No studies were found that used spaceborne LiDAR systems
   for timber assortment assessments, as these were conditioned by the time
   and sample size (sample size = similar to 12 m/similar to 25 m of laser
   footprint and 0.7 m/60 m of space along the track for ICESat-2, GEDI and
   time = since 2018). Terrestrial LiDAR systems demonstrated a higher
   performance in successfully characterising the trees belonging to an
   understory layer. Combining airborne/UAS systems with terrestrial LiDAR
   systems is a promising approach to obtain detailed data concerning the
   timber assortments of large forest covers. Overall, our results reveal
   that the interest of scientists in using machine and deep learning
   algorithms for LiDAR processes is steadily increasing.},

Title = {Drivers of Land Use Change in Lantapan, Bukidnon, Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been the key in addressing the growing
   demand for food production both for home consumption and supplying the
   market. The market demand on agricultural production has therefore
   triggered change in land use. For farmers, it makes a lot of economic
   sense to venture on high value agricultural products where land and
   labor capital is limited
   This study provided a temporal analysis that would describe the land use
   changes in Barangay Songco, Lantapan, Bukidnon, with emphasis on the
   driving forces and how they influence the farming decision of farmers.
   Participatory mapping and focused group discussion were conducted with
   selected farmer-residents, and a satellite image to generate the
   historical land use map of barangay Songco. Maps were digitized and land
   areas were computed using the ArcGis9 field calculator to derive the
   estimated area occupied by a certain land use.
   Land use change in Songco is influenced by a high demand of agricultural
   products. Furthermore, inappropriate farming systems such as up and down
   planting that vegetable growers practice has caused severe soil erosion,
   leading to the decline on crop yield due to the removal of soil
   nutrients. Moreover, the off-site effect of soil erosion are siltation
   and sedimentation which carry traces of pesticides and chemical
   contaminants into water bodies which are likely to degrade water quality
   and may create health problems for farm families and those living
   downstream (Coxhead et. al. 2005).},

Abstract = {Vegetation species maps are useful for forestry managements and
   environmental ecological study. From the forestry management, broad and
   conifer leaf forest should be mapped. In addition to them, land-cover
   mapping data with high resolution is needed as validation data sets for
   low resolution's land-cover mapping results. SGLI sensor on board GCOM-C
   satellite, which will be launched in 2014, has 250m spatial resolution
   and it's data will be used for making global land-cover data set. ALOS
   satellite was launched in 2006. It has AVNIR-2 sensor and PRISM sensor.
   AVNIR-2 sensor has four spectral bands 460, 560, 650 and 830nm with 10-m
   spatial resolution. PRISMsensor has panchromatic band from 520nm to 770
   nm with 2.5m spatial resolution. If use the both of image, pseudo high
   spatial multi-spectal image can be processed. Because of the spatial
   resolution and multi-spectral information, these sensor data are
   expected to useful for making high resolution land-cover data set. We
   have developed Universal Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM)(Zhang, L.F.
   et. al, 2006 (Zhang et al., 2006)) and Modified Vegetation Index based
   on UPDM (MVIUPD)(Zhang, L. F. et. al, 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) and
   Xiong, Y., 2005 (?)) for satellite sensor data analysis for land cover
   mapping and vegetation monitoring. In the UPDM method, three
   coefficients of water, vegetation and soil is calculated using three
   standard patterns of water, vegetation and soil. One of this method's
   characteristics is the UPDM coefficients from different sensors for the
   same object being same as each other. The capability of vegetation
   species mapping was studied with ALOS/AVNIR-2 data and UPDM method.
   Japanese cedar, Japanese cypress, deciduous forest, bamboo forest,
   orchard and grass land can be classified using AVNIR-2 summer and winter
   data. In this study, AVNIR-2 and PRISM data are used for vegetation
   types mapping using universal pattern decomposition method. Firstly, the
   pan-sharpen image was processed using AVNIR-2 and PRISM data. Each
   band's Digital Number (DN) value of AVNIR-2's band is calculated using
   DN of PRISM and AVNIR-2. The reflectance of AVNIR-2 is calculated from
   calculated DN values. UPDM method is applied to the set of re-calculated
   reflectance. Using the coefficients of UPDM and vegetation index,
   evergreen forest and deciduous forest were classified using two seasonal
   data. These results are compared with forest resource information. The
   tendency was agree with each other, although detailed validation is
   needed. From these results, the UPDM method can be applied to
   pan-sharpen image and the pan-sharpen image can be used for vegetation
   type classification. In the near future, calculation methods with
   retaining the original reflectance should be improved.},

Abstract = {Effective management of human activities affecting listed species
   requires understanding both threats and animal habitat-use patterns.
   However, the extent of spatial overlap between high-use foraging areas
   (where multiple marine species congregate) and anthropogenic threats is
   not well-known. Our modeling approach incorporates data on sea turtle
   spatial ecology and a suite of threats in the Gulf of Mexico to identify
   and map ``hot spots{''} of threats to two imperiled turtle species. Of
   all 820 ``high{''} threats grid cells, our tracked turtles foraged at
   least 1 day in 77\% of them. Although threat data were not available
   outside the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, our map of turtle and threat
   ``hot spots{''} can be incorporated in future more comprehensive threat
   analyses for the region. Knowledge of these shared foraging- and
   threat-areas can assist managers charged with designing effective
   conservation and population recovery strategies, in future habitat
   modeling efforts, and in designations of Gulf of Mexico habitat with
   high conservation value.},

Title = {Tempo-Spatial Landslide Susceptibility Assessment from the Perspective
   of Human Engineering Activity},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The expansion of mountainous urban areas and road networks can influence
   the terrain, vegetation, and material characteristics, thereby altering
   the susceptibility of landslides. Understanding the relationship between
   human engineering activities and landslide occurrence is of great
   significance for both landslide prevention and land resource management.
   In this study, an analysis was conducted on the landslide caused by
   Typhoon Megi in 2016. A representative mountainous area along the
   eastern coast of China-characterized by urban development,
   deforestation, and severe road expansion-was used to analyze the spatial
   distribution of landslides. For this purpose, high-precision Planet
   optical remote sensing images were used to obtain the landslide
   inventory related to the Typhoon Megi event. The main innovative
   features are as follows: (i) the newly developed patch generating
   land-use simulation (PLUS) model simulated and analyzed the driving
   factors of land-use land-cover (LULC) from 2010 to 2060; (ii) the
   innovative stacking strategy combined three strong ensemble
   models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
   Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)-to calculate the distribution
   of landslide susceptibility; and (iii) distance from road and LULC maps
   were used as short-term and long-term dynamic factors to examine the
   impact of human engineering activities on landslide susceptibility. The
   results show that the maximum expansion area of built-up land from 2010
   to 2020 was 13.433 km(2), mainly expanding forest land and cropland
   land, with areas of 8.28 km(2 )and 5.99 km(2), respectively. The
   predicted LULC map for 2060 shows a growth of 45.88 km(2) in the
   built-up land, mainly distributed around government residences in areas
   with relatively flat terrain and frequent socio-economic activities. The
   factor contribution shows that distance from road has a higher impact
   than LULC. The Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM model obtained the optimal AUC value
   of 0.915 in the landslide susceptibility analysis in 2016. Furthermore,
   future road network and urban expansion have intensified the probability
   of landslides occurring in urban areas in 2015. To our knowledge, this
   is the first application of the PLUS and Stacking RF-XGB-LGBM models in
   landslide susceptibility analysis in international literature. The
   research results can serve as a foundation for developing land
   management guidelines to reduce the risk of landslide failures.},

Title = {Improved estimate of the policy-relevant background ozone in the United

Abstract = {The policy-relevant background (PRB) ozone is defined by the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the surface ozone concentration
   that would be present over the US in the absence of North American
   anthropogenic emissions. It is intended to provide a baseline for risk
   and exposure assessments used in setting the National Ambient Air
   Quality Standard (NAAQS). We present here three-year statistics
   (2006-2008) of PRB ozone over the US calculated using the GEOS-Chem
   global 3-D model of atmospheric composition with 1/2 degrees x 2/3
   degrees horizontal resolution over North America and adjacent oceans (2
   degrees x 2.5 degrees for the rest of the world). We also provide
   estimates of the US background (no anthropogenic US emissions) and
   natural background (no anthropogenic emissions worldwide and
   pre-industrial methane). Our work improves on previous GEOS-Chem PRB
   estimates through the use of higher model resolution, 3-year statistics,
   better representation of stratospheric influence, and updated emissions.
   PRB is particularly high in the intermountain West due to high
   elevation, arid terrain, and large-scale subsidence. We present for this
   region a detailed model evaluation showing that the model is successful
   in reproducing ozone exceedances up to 70 ppbv. However, the model
   cannot reproduce PRB-relevant exceptional events associated with
   wildfires or stratospheric intrusions. The mean PRB estimates for spring
   summer are 27 +/- 8 ppbv at low-altitude sites and 40 +/- 7 ppbv at
   high-altitude sites. Differences between the PRB simulation and the
   natural simulation indicate a mean enhancement from intercontinental
   pollution and anthropogenic methane of 9 ppbv at low-altitude sites and
   13 ppbv at high-altitude sites. The PRB is higher than average when
   ozone exceeds 60 ppbv, particularly in the intermountain West. Our PRB
   estimates are on average 4 ppbv higher than previous GEOS-Chem studies
   and we attribute this to higher lighting, increasing Asian emissions,
   and improved model resolution. Whereas previous studies found no
   occurrences of PRB exceeding 60 ppbv, we find here some occurrences in
   the intermountain West. The annual 4th-highest PRB values in the
   intermountain West are typically 50-60 ppbv, as compared to 35-45 ppbv
   in the East or on the West Coast. Such high PRB values in the
   intermountain West suggest that special consideration of this region may
   be needed if the ozone NAAQS is decreased to a value in the 60-70 ppbv
   range. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Eighty-metre resolution 3D soil-attribute maps for Tasmania, Australia},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {8},
Pages = {932-955},
Abstract = {Until recently, Tasmanian environmental modelling and assessments
   requiring important soil inputs relied on conventionally derived soil
   polygons that were mapped up to 75 years ago. In the `Wealth from Water'
   project, digital soil mapping (DSM) was used in a pilot project to map
   the suitability of 20 different agricultural enterprises over 70 000 ha.
   Following on from this, the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries
   Parks Water and Environment has applied DSM to existing soil datasets to
   develop enterprise suitability predictions across the whole state in
   response to further expansion of irrigation schemes. The soil surfaces
   generated have conformed and contributed to the Terrestrial Ecosystem
   Research Network Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia, a superset of
   GlobalSoilMap.net specifications. The surfaces were generated at 80-m
   resolution for six standard depths and 13 soil properties (e.g. pH, EC,
   organic carbon, sand and silt percentages and coarse fragments), in
   addition to several Tasmanian enterprise-suitability soil-attribute
   parameters.
   The modelling used soil site data with available explanatory state-wide
   spatial variables, including the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
   digital elevation model and derivatives, gamma-radiometrics, surface
   geology, and multi-spectral satellite imagery. The DSM has delivered
   realistic mapping for most attributes, with acceptable validation
   diagnostics and relatively low uncertainty ranges in data-rich areas,
   but performed marginally in terms of uncertainty ranges in areas such as
   the World Heritage-listed Southwest of the state, with a low existing
   soil site density. Version 1.0 soil-attribute maps form the foundations
   of a dynamic and evolving new infrastructure that will be improved and
   re-run with the future collection of new soil data. The Tasmanian
   mapping has provided a localised integration with the National Soil and
   Landscape Grid of Australia, and it will guide future investment in soil
   information capture by quantitatively targeting areas with both high
   uncertainties and important ecological or agricultural value.},

Title = {The feasibility study of offshore wind energy potential in Kijal,
   Malaysia: the new alternative energy source exploration in Malaysia},
Journal = {ENERGY EXPLORATION \& EXPLOITATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {329-344},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many countries have been endeavoring to explore and exploit
   the offshore wind energy in terms of solving the problem of limitations
   of onshore wind energy. Wind energy is one of potential alternative for
   generating electricity in Malaysia. The offshore wind speed is better
   compared to onshore, so there is more potential contribution by offshore
   wind power in terms of electricity generation. This paper provides a
   summary of the offshore wind resources of the Kijal, Malaysia by
   analyzing the QuikSCAT satellite data which is available and can be
   downloaded from the WindPRO application. Based on these datasets, wind
   resources are assessed, and economical efficiency is evaluated by means
   of the expected capacity factor. Research was conducted using WindPRO
   and WAsP software to assess the potential of wind energy along the South
   China Sea in Kijal, Terengganu. Seven models of the wind turbines with
   different rated power; 110kW, 225kW, 275kW, 600kW, 850kW, 1000kW and
   1250kW are taken for energy and economic feasibility analyses. The wind
   turbine with rated power 850 kW was indicated as the best wind turbine
   for installation in Kijal based on its best capacity factor, 26.8\% In
   economical aspect, Malaysia does not have Feed in Tariff (FiT) rates for
   offshore wind projects, thus the range of predicted FiT rates, RM 0.30
   to RM 2.00 were tested by using Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback
   Period (PBP) calculation. Finally, the conducive FiT rates for wind
   projects with secured investment were identified and the rates were in
   range RM 0.80 to RM 1.38. The overall results suggest that the wind
   energy has a bright future for use as an alternative source for
   generating electricity in Kijal, Malaysia.},

Title = {Rapid evolution of water resources in the Senegal delta},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {34-47},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent decades major water developments have led to an agricultural
   transformation of the Senegal delta both in Senegal and Mauritania. This
   otherwise, semi-arid region of the Sahel band now has an abundant supply
   of freshwater all year round mostly used for irrigation and urban water
   supply, including for the capital cities of the two countries. Archives
   from the Landsat satellites and in-situ hydrographs were used in this
   paper to retrace and analyse the hydrological changes that have taken
   place in the region since the middle of the 20th century. The satellite
   archives indicate that the area covered by irrigation increased by one
   order of magnitude from 73 km(2) in 1973 to similar to 770 km(2) in
   2010. The observed hydrological changes are complex, multi-faceted and
   often of great magnitude. If the water cycle was representative of
   natural conditions in the early 1980s, it is now representative of a
   heavily modified system controlled and impacted by human activities. The
   first hydraulic infrastructure was installed in 1947 to enable the Lake
   of Guiers to become the main water supply for Dakar. Two large dams were
   built on the Senegal River in the mid-1980s that modified the
   hydrological regime of the river by 1) preventing seawater intrusion, 2)
   raising the stage of the river and-of Lake of Guiers and 3) moderating
   floods. Another recent hydrological change in the delta was the opening
   of river mouth in 2003, which has led to a reduction of the average
   water level while increasing the semi-diurnal tidal wave between the
   river mouth and Diama. Each phase of these river regime changes and each
   step of the irrigation expansion are expressed in localised changes in
   the physical groundwater system. Increasingly, the retroaction from the
   shallow aquifer systems is observed as a rise of the saline water table.
   This poses a threat to the environmental and agricultural value of the
   region, and the salinization of the soils. Mitigating actions for this
   threat are currently being envisaged by the authorities. (C) 2016

Title = {Detecting collective behaviour in animal relocation data, with
   application to migrating caribou},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Collective behaviour can allow populations to have emergent responses
   to uncertain environments, driven by simple interactions among nearby
   individuals. High-throughput ethological studies, where individual
   behaviour is closely observed in each member of a population (typically
   in the laboratory or by simulation), have revealed that collective
   behaviour in populations requires only rudimentary cognitive abilities
   in individuals and could therefore represent a widespread adaptation to
   life in an uncertain world. However, the ecological significance of
   collective behaviour is not yet well understood, as most studies to date
   have been confined to specialized situations that allow intensive
   monitoring of individual behaviour.
   2. Here, we describe a way to screen for collective behaviour in
   ecological data that is sampled at a coarser resolution than the
   underlying behavioural processes. We develop and test the method in the
   context of a well-studied model for collective movement in a noisy
   environmental gradient. The large-scale distribution patterns associated
   with collective behaviour are difficult to distinguish from the
   aggregated responses of independent individuals in this setting because
   independent individuals also align to track the gradient. However, we
   show that collective idiosyncratic deviations from the mean gradient
   direction have high predictive value for detecting collective behaviour.
   We describe a method of testing for these deviations using the average
   normalized velocity of the population.
   3. We demonstrate the method using data from satellite tracking collars
   on the migration patterns of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), recovering
   evidence that collective behaviour is a key driver of caribou migration
   patterns. We find moreover that the relative importance of collective
   behaviour fluctuates seasonally, concurrent with the timing of migration
   and reproduction.
   4. Collective behaviour is a potentially widespread dynamic property of
   populations that can, in some cases, be detected in coarsely sampled
   ecological data.},

Abstract = {Reliable and accurate environmental state prediction can help in
   long-term sustainable planning and management. Enormous land-use/
   land-cover (LULC) transformation has been increasing the carbon
   emissions (CEs) and land surface temperature (LST) around the world. The
   study aimed to (i) examine the influences of land specific CEs on LST
   dynamics and (ii) simulate future potential LULC, CEs and LST pattern of
   Khulna City Corporation. Landsat satellite images of the year 2000, 2010
   and 2020 were used to derive LULC, LST and CEs pattern and change. The
   correlation between land-use indices (NDBI, NDVI, NDWI) and LST was
   examined to explore the impacts of LULC change on LST. Unplanned
   urbanization has increased 11.79 Km(2)(26.10\%) buildup areas and 25,268
   tons of CEs during 2000-2020. The calculated R-2 value indicates the
   strong positive correlation between CEs and LST. To simulate the future
   LULC, CEs and LST pattern for the year 2030 and 2040, multi-layer
   perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC)-based artificial neural network model
   was utilized with the accuracy rate of 94.12\%, 99\% and 98.48\% for
   LULC, LST and CEs model, respectively. The simulation shows that by
   2040, buildup area will increase to 87.33\%, net CEs will increase by
   19.82x 10(4)tons, and carbon absorptions will decrease by 23. 55 x
   10(4)tons and 69.54\% of the total study area's LST will be above 39
   degrees C. Such predictions signify the necessity of implementing a
   sustainable urban development plan immediately for the sustainable,
   habitable and sound urban environment.},

Title = {Distribution and extent of benthic habitats in Puck Bay (Gulf of Gdansk,
   southern Baltic Sea)},
Journal = {OCEANOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {63},
Number = {3},
Pages = {301-320},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {The majority of the southern Baltic Sea seabed encompasses homogenous
   soft-bottom sediments of limited productivity and low biological
   diversity, but shallow productive areas in the coastal zone such as
   wetlands, vegetated lagoons and sheltered bays show a high variety of
   benthic habitat types offering favourable biotopic conditions for
   benthic fauna. Within Polish marine areas, semi-enclosed Puck Bay (the
   western part of the Gulf of Gdansk) features an exceptionally diverse
   environment covering a range of benthic habitats which underscores its
   unique biological value and aesthetic quality and providing an impetus
   for conservation and ecosystem-based development. Full-coverages maps on
   benthic habitats in this area are therefore a necessary foundation for
   maritime spatial planning and implementation of strategies for
   sustainable management and protection of the coastal environment. This
   study presents the first comprehensive description and distribution of
   benthic habitats in Puck Bay which were categorised using the revised
   EUNIS 2019 classification system. Typological analyses were carried out
   based on inventory datasets from 1995 to 2019 including scientific
   publications, satellite images, open databases, topographic and
   geological maps, reports, theses, information available on websites and
   unpublished data shared willingly by individual researchers and
   administrative institutions. Collating various spatial data sources,
   that were first georeferenced and then visualized using techniques
   available in ArcMap 10.4.1 software (Esri), resulted in the mapping of
   benthic habitats and sites of important and protected plant species,
   which can contribute to the high confidence in environmental assessments
   and monitoring activities. (C) 2021 Institute of Oceanology of the

Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to develop a methodological approach to the
   problem of a quantitative assessment of the technical level (technical
   excellence) of geostationary telecommunication satellites (GTS). The
   technical level indicator is a quantitative measure for assessing the
   perfection of the design of a product and the quality of products
   (services) produced with its use. This is an important technical and
   economic indicator of experimental design work. The value of the
   technical level indicator is one of the determining factors in the
   competitiveness of the created space system. The paper discusses the
   existing methodological approaches to the quantitative assessment of the
   technical level of science-intensive and technically complex products.
   We present a new approach to determine the composition of technical
   performance markers for calculating the GTS technical level indicator
   allowing a formal description of the beneficial effect and a logical
   scheme for quantifying the technical level. The methodological approach
   to calculate the degree of influence of technical efficiency indicators
   on the value of the beneficial effect of the use of GTS is stated as
   well. It is based on a mathematical model of the hierarchy analysis
   introduced by T Saaty, complemented by us with mathematical models for
   the best consideration of GTS technical features. It allowed us to
   ensure control of errors and contradictions in expert judgments involved
   in the preparation of initial data of =measurable or hardly measurable
   techno-economic indicators of GTS. Due to the higher level of
   formalization of the process of quantifying the technical level and the
   application of mathematical methods used in modern decision theory, the
   developed methodological approach serves to improve the quality of
   calculations significantly and to reduce the influence of the subjective
   factor in determining the value of the technical level indicator. Based
   on the above, we developed a method for quantitative assessment of the
   GTS technical level that meets the modern requirements.},

Title = {A design of real-time unipath polarization imaging system based on
   Wollaston prism},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {65},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {A real-time polarization imaging system employing the Wollaston prism
   and a single charge-coupled device (CCD) chip covering a wavelength
   range of 400-650 nm is proposed to avoid the false polarization
   information from dynamic scenes in non-real-time polarization detection
   imaging method. An architecture consisting of telescope lens,
   collimation lens, Wollaston prism, the imaging lens and a single CCD
   chip is employed in the system. The telescope lens is used to focus the
   incoming light on an intermediate image. And after collimation, the beam
   is angularly separated by the Wollaston prism. Two beams corresponding
   to ordinary light and extraordinary light are subsequently focused on
   the CCD plane via the imaging lens. The telescope lens is designed to
   have a telecentric structure in the imaging space, and the invert of
   which is used as the collimation lens, the completely symmetrical
   structure design is used to reduce the influence of aberrations. More
   abundant details from this system can be obtained by using matched image
   post-processing strategy, which is beneficial to high-quality target
   detection with enhanced working distance and improved environment
   adaptability. After joint-designing and optimization, the system
   modulation transfer function value at cutoff frequency is higher than
   0.55, and the root-mean-square radius of the system is less than 5.3 mu
   m, which is smaller than the pixel size of the CCD detector.
   Additionally, the lateral chromatic aberration of the system is much
   smaller than the diameter of airy disk, and the absolute values of all
   kinds of aberrations are kept smaller than 0.02 at the same time. The
   calculation results show that all the aberrations are mostly corrected.
   The system imaging is numerically modeled and analyzed, and it is
   demonstrated that two intensity images with perpendicular polarization
   states appear adjacently on the CCD plane simultaneously in the imaging
   simulation. One image is formed with the fraction of the backscattered
   light polarized parallelly to the incident light, and the other with
   light polarized orthogonally to the incidence, indicating that the
   expected design is accomplished. Compared with the traditional
   amplitude-split polarization imaging system, the proposed real-time
   polarization imaging system shows that the improved performance for
   real-time detection with promoted power efficiency, spatial resolution,
   and the light crosstalk in focal plane is well handled. Moreover, the
   joint design of the whole system can compensate for the distortion
   aberration in the vertical direction of the CCD detector, which means
   that a further improvement of image quality can be expected. The
   proposed system has a promising perspective in the fields of underwater
   imaging detection, astronomical observation, remote sensing, biological
   tissues inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Title = {Quantitative estimation of sentinel-1A interferometric decorrelation
   using vegetation index},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Sentinel-1A data are widely used in interferometric synthetic aperture
   radar (InSAR) studies due to the free and open access policy. However,
   the short wavelength (C-band) of Sentinal-1A data leads to decorrelation
   in numerous applications, especially in vegetated areas. Phase blurring
   and reduced monitoring accuracy can occur owing to changes in the
   physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation during the satellite
   revisit period, which essentially makes poor use of SAR data and
   increases the time and economic costs for researchers. Interferometric
   coherence is a commonly used index to measure the interference quality
   of two single-look complex (SLC) images, and its value can be used to
   characterize the decorrelation degree. The normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) is obtained from optical images, and its value
   can be used to characterize the surface vegetation coverage. In order to
   solve the problem that Sentinel-1A decorrelation in the vegetated area
   is difficult to estimate prior to single-look complex interference, this
   paper selects a vegetated area in Sichuan Province, China as the study
   area and establishes two two-order linear quantitative models between
   Landsat8-derived normalized difference vegetation index and Sentinel-1A
   interferometric coherence in co- and cross-polarization: When NDVI at
   extremely high and low levels, coherence is close to zero, while NDVI
   and coherence show two different linear relationships in co- and
   cross-polarization in terms of NDVI at the middle level. The models
   global error basically obeys the normal distribution with the mean value
   of -0.037 and -0.045, and the standard deviation of 0.205 and 0.201 at
   the VV and VH channels. The two models are then validated in two
   validation areas, and the results confirm the reliability of the models
   and reveal the relationships between Sentinel-1A InSAR decorrelation and
   vegetation coverage in co- and cross-polarization, thus demonstrating
   that the NDVI can be applied to quantitatively estimate the InSAR
   decorrelation in vegetated area of Sentinel-1A data in both polarization
   modes prior to SLC interference.},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate acquisition of crop area is of great significance
   for monitoring crop growth and estimation of crop yields. And it's
   important for strengthening agricultural management, ensuring food
   security and supply of agricultural products. The combination of remote
   sensing data with traditional sampling methods is an effective way to
   monitor and estimate crop area on a large scale. The traditional
   sampling method, on the basis of traditional statistics theory which
   studies the laws of random variables, requires that the sampling units
   should satisfy the principle of mutual independence. However, the
   regional crops, which are affected by natural conditions and
   socioeconomic factors, are often spatial variable. There is no report on
   whether and how spatial variability will influence the sampling
   efficiency of crop acreage. Therefor the further improvement of sampling
   efficiency is limited. To solve this problem, a variation function model
   was constructed with the area ratio between maize or rice and sampling
   units as object variable on 10 sampling unit scales combining remote
   sensing data, spatial analysis and traditional sampling methods with
   Dehui, Jilin as study area. Selecting base value as index for spatial
   variability within the sampling unit, the effect of sampling unit scales
   on spatial variability of maize and rice were quantitatively analyzed.
   Three commonly used sampling schemes (random sampling, systematic
   sampling and stratified sampling) were selected for sample selection,
   overall extrapolation and error estimation. The sampling efficiency was
   quantitatively evaluated using overall relative error (r) of the
   sampling extrapolation, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the total
   estimate and the sample size (n) on different sampling unit scales. The
   results show that the spatial variability of maize and rice decreases
   with the increase of the sampling unit scale. The range of base value is
   {[}0.15, 0.20] and {[}0.05, 0.14] for maize and wheat respectively.
   Using the three sampling methods to extrapolate the maize and rice area
   separately: 1) Under the same sampling ratio, the relative sampling
   errors of the two crops' area estimations gradually increase with the
   decrease of spatial variability (the sampling unit size increases), the
   coefficient of variation also shows an increasing trend, and the
   sampling accuracy and extrapolation stability is affected by spatial
   variability; 2) The relative error in estimation of the two crop areas
   varies with the sampling method,when using simple random sampling and
   systematic sampling, the relative error of the two crops was within the
   range of (1`)/0, 50\%) and (0.5\%, 40\%), and the coefficient of
   variation was limited to (1\%, 75 A) and In the range of (1\%, 88\%),
   the relative errors at all scales were limited to 10\% or less with
   stratified sampling, and the fluctuations of the coefficient of
   variation were small (both within 0.3\% and 20\%). Therefore, the
   stratification was selected. Sampling is the best sampling method; 3)
   When the sampling method is determined, the sampling ratio is the main
   factor determining the sampling efficiency.
   As the sampling ratio increases, the rate of change of the relative
   error of the two crop area estimators gradually decreases, when the
   sampling fraction reaches S\%, The relative error is basically limited
   to 5\%, and the coefficient of variation is stable within 12\% On this
   basis, the effect of increasing the sampling ratio to increase the
   sampling progress is minimal; 4) According to the conclusions of 2) and
   3), Stratified sampling method is used to extrapolate crop area by 5\%
   sampling ratio. The sampling efficiency decreases with the increase of
   sampling unit size. When the sampling unit size is limited within
   3500mx3500m, the overall sampling satisfies 95\% sampling accuracy
   requirements., And the coefficient of variation is stable within 7\%,

Title = {Techno-economic assessment of application of solar PV in building sector
   A case study from Saudi Arabia},

Abstract = {Purpose The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is facing a rapid growth in
   energy demand mainly because of factors like burgeoning population,
   economic growth, modernization and infrastructure development. It is
   estimated that between 2000 and 2017 the power consumption has increased
   from 120 to 315 TWh. The building sector has an important role in this
   respect as it accounts for around 80 percent of the total electricity
   consumption. The situation is imposing significant energy, environmental
   and economic challenges for the country. To tackle these problems and
   curtail its dependence on oil-based energy infrastructure, KSA is aiming
   to develop 9.5 GW of renewable energy projects by 2030. The campus of
   the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) has been
   considered as a case study. In the wake of recently announced
   net-metering policy, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the
   prospects of rooftop application of PV in buildings. ArcGIS and PVsyst
   software have been used to determine the rooftop area and undertake PV
   system modeling respectively. Performance of PV system has been
   investigated for both horizontal and tilted installations. The study
   also investigates the economic feasibility of the PV application with
   the help of various economic parameters such as benefit cost ratio,
   simple payback period (SPP) and equity payback periods. An environmental
   analysis has also been carried out with the help of RETScreen software
   to determine the savings in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of PV
   system. Design/methodology/approach This study examines the buildings of
   the university campus for utilizable rooftop areas for PV application.
   Various types of structural, architectural and utilities-related
   features affecting the use of building roofs for PV have been
   investigated to determine the corrected area. To optimize the
   performance of the PV system as well as space utilization, modeling has
   been carried out for both horizontal and tilted applications of panels.
   Detailed economic and environmental assessments of the rooftop PV
   systems have also been investigated in detail. Modern software tools
   such as PVsyst, ArcGIS and RETScreen have also been used for system
   design calculations. Findings Saudi Arabia is embarking on a massive
   solar energy program as it plans to have over 200 GW of installed
   capacity by 2030. With solar energy being the most abundant of the
   available renewable resource for the country, PV is going to be one of
   the main technologies in achieving the set targets. The country has,
   however, unlike global trends, traditionally overlooked the small-scale
   and building-related application of solar PV, focusing mainly on larger
   projects. This study explores the prospects of utilization of solar PV
   on building roofs. Building rooftops are constrained in terms of PV
   application owing to wide ranging obstacles that can be classified into
   five types - structural, services, accessibility, maintenance and
   others. The total building rooftop area in the study zone, calculated
   through ArcGIS has been found to be 857,408 m(2) of which 352,244 m(2)
   is being used as car parking and hence is not available for PV
   application. The available roof area, 505,165 m(2) is further hampered
   by construction and utilities related features including staircases,
   HVAC systems, skylights, water tanks and satellite dish antennas.
   Taking into account the relevant obstructive features, the net rooftop
   area covered by PV panels has been found to be in the range 25-41
   percent depending upon the building typology, with residential buildings
   offering the least. To optimize both the system efficiency and space
   utilization, PV modeling has been carried out with the help of PVsyst
   software for both the tilted and horizontal installations. In terms of
   output, PV panels with tilt angle of 24 degrees have been found to be 9
   percent more efficient compared to the horizontally installed ones.
   Modeling results provide a net annual output 37,750 and 46,050 MWh from
   21.44 and 28.51 MW of tilted and horizontal application of PV panels,
   sufficient to respectively meet 16 and 20 percent of the total campus
   electricity requirements. Findings of the economic analysis reveal the
   average SPP for horizontal and tilted applications of the PV to be 9.2
   and 8.4 years, respectively. The benefit cost ratio for different types
   of buildings for horizontal and tilted application has been found to be
   ranging between 0.89 and 2.08 and 0.83 and 2.15, respectively. As
   electricity tariff in Saudi Arabia has been increased this year by as
   much as 45 percent and there are plans to remove \$54bn of subsidy by
   2020, the cost effectiveness of PV systems will be greatly helped.
   Application of PV in buildings can significantly improve their
   environmental performance as the findings of this study reveal that the
   annual greenhouse gas emission in the KFUPM campus can be reduced by as
   much as 40,199 tons carbon dioxide equivalent. Originality/value The PV
   application on building roof especially from economic perspective is an
   area which has not been addressed thus far. Khan et al. (2017) studied
   the power generation potential for PV application on residential
   buildings in KSA. Asif (2016) also investigated power output potential
   of PV system in different types of buildings. Dehwas et al. (2018)
   adopted a detailed approach to determine utilizability of PV on
   residential building roofs. None of these studies have covered the
   economics of PV systems. This study attempts to address the gap and
   contribute to the scholarship on the subject. It targets to determine
   the power output from different types of building in an urban
   environment by taking into account building roof conditions. It also
   provides detailed economic assessment of PV systems. Subsequent
   environmental savings are also calculated.},

Title = {Improved Classification Models to Distinguish Natural from Anthropic Oil
   Slicks in the Gulf of Mexico: Seasonality and Radarsat-2 Beam Mode
   Effects under a Machine Learning Approach},

Abstract = {Distinguishing between natural and anthropic oil slicks is a challenging
   task, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where these events can be
   simultaneously observed and recognized as seeps or spills. In this
   study, a powerful data analysis provided by machine learning (ML)
   methods was employed to develop, test, and implement a classification
   model (CM) to distinguish an oil slick source (OSS) as natural or
   anthropic. A robust database containing 4916 validated oil samples,
   detected using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was employed for this
   task. Six ML algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural
   networks (ANN), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes
   (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR).
   Using RF, the global CM achieved a maximum accuracy value of 73.15. An
   innovative approach evaluated how external factors, such as seasonality,
   satellite configurations, and the synergy between them, limit or improve
   OSS predictions. To accomplish this, specific classification models
   (SCMs) were derived from the global ones (CMs), tuning the best
   algorithms and parameters according to different scenarios. Median
   accuracies revealed winter and spring to be the best seasons and ScanSAR
   Narrow B (SCNB) as the best beam mode. The maximum median accuracy to
   distinguish seeps from spills was achieved in winter using SCNB (83.05).
   Among the tested algorithms, RF was the most robust, with a better
   performance in 81\% of the investigated scenarios. The accuracy
   increment provided by the well-fitted models may minimize the confusion
   between seeps and spills. This represents a concrete contribution to
   reducing economic and geologic risks derived from exploration activities
   in offshore areas. Additionally, from an operational standpoint,
   specific models support specialists to select the best SAR products and
   seasons for new acquisitions, as well as to optimize performances
   according to the available data.},

Title = {Monitoring and control of water-ecological space in the Dongting Lake
   region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {The territorial spatial planning in the new era strengthens the control
   of different functional spaces and emphasizes integrated and coordinated
   development of each functional space. Therefore, it is important to
   monitor the ``structure-function{''} characteristics of water-ecological
   space based on the context of territorial spatial planning and develop a
   management and control framework. Based on land use and social
   statistics, and with the help of ArcGIS analysis, this paper examined
   the structure and function of the water-ecological space in the Dongting
   Lake study for 2010, 2015, and 2020, generating a control framework and
   proposing key initiatives. The main results are as follows: 1) The
   overall scale of the water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study
   is over 7,300 km(2). Water bodies had the largest share, followed by
   coastal terrestrial areas, while the land-water ecotone was the
   smallest. There was a small decrease in the water ecological space
   during the study period. Yueyang had the largest overall scale of water
   ecological space, while Linli had the smallest. 2) The comprehensive
   function of water ecological space in the Dongting Lake study was about
   0.4000, increasing somewhat during the study period. Among the units,
   the comprehensive function value was highest in Yuanjiang City, while
   Jincheng City had the lowest. 3) From the structural elements of water
   ecological space, scientific planning of functional zoning of water
   ecological space should be carried out and combined with the delineation
   of ``three zones and three lines.{''} Key initiatives such as
   multi-scale and multi-level planning and control, use control and access
   restrictions, determination of water ecological space ownership,
   pollution control and accountability, and comprehensive water ecological
   treatment and restoration should be promoted.},

Abstract = {For the last two decades, since the Rio Conference on Environment and
   Development, land-use planning (LUP) has been carrying the hopes of
   providing a concrete instrument to translate sustainable development
   discourses into practice. In the Lao PDR, it is being seen as a way to
   provide alternatives to swidden agriculture and more recently, as an
   instrument to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
   (REDD). However, when assessing the impact of past LUP, many observers
   have noted the discrepancy between good intentions, as displayed in
   policy and project documents, and actual implementation due to the
   limited capacity of local institutions (Lestrelin et al., 2011a).
   Overcoming such a problem requires an objective analysis of its extent
   and its potential negative consequences. To avoid blind trust in
   delusive success stories, evaluation methods assessing the quality of
   the LUP process (i.e. level of community participation and understanding
   of LUP activities by local stakeholders) have been designed (Lestrelin
   et al., 2011b). From the perspective of developing a country-wide
   monitoring system for participatory land use planning (PLUP), this paper
   addresses two main research questions:
   How to assess the quality of a PLUP output, i.e. measuring the gap
   between principles and practice in PLUP?
   What can be done to increase the credibility, and therefore the
   practicality and feasibility, of the proposed land use plans?
   By analysing land zoning outputs from past and recent PLUP this paper
   underlines the irrationality of village LUP maps which often appear
   inconsistent with the principles of land use policies. In general the
   management of rural landscapes in the uplands of Lao PDR is difficult to
   grasp due to a tacit agreement between villagers willing to minimize
   land taxes and district authority lacking proper human and financial
   resources.
   Acknowledging the gap between the declared agricultural land from
   household surveys and what can be observed from satellite or village
   land use maps, the paper proposes a new approach to increase planning
   realism while reinforcing local participation in the PLUP process. An
   innovative participatory platform involving local communities in
   learning the complexities of LUP through a role-play was proposed by
   Bourgoin and Castella (2011). The authors argued that a landscape
   simulation exercise can help disclose the landscape management and
   livelihood strategies of different stakeholders at different scales.
   Building on this knowledge, this paper describes a negotiation platform
   allowing villagers discuss land zoning and management practices.
   Adaptive and accessible, the method is assisted by a participatory 3D
   model combined with a village socio-economic and geographic information
   system providing feedback about cost/benefit associated with each land
   use plan. Through successive iterations, villagers gradually refine
   their plans by exploring land use change scenarios.
   Beside its contribution to enhanced participation in landscape planning,
   the proposed method, which was successfully tested in six study villages
   of Viengkham District, can support the introduction of innovative land
   use systems in the northern uplands of Lao PDR. Furthermore, this
   instrument can be used to certify land use plans and provide a standard
   procedure for PLUP implementation.},

Title = {AIRBORNE LIDAR IN SUPPORT OF COASTAL MAPPING AND HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING},
Booktitle = {GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS},
Series = {Environmental Science Engineering and Technology},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {175-195},
Abstract = {Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play
   a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by
   recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and
   feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are
   being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to
   mankind is not fully acknowledged.
   The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France
   (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This
   trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely
   the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed
   a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas.
   Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the
   return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation
   with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system
   is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system.
   The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density
   reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are
   respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground.
   Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in
   integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of
   tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among
   which:
   - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the
   bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion
   and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone
   or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to
   shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal,
   transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been
   carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic
   models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont
   Saint Michel and Morbihan bays.
   - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and
   facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has
   been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites.
   By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne
   ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced

   Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the

   storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal
   developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in

   the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to

Note = {International Conference on Integrated Concepts on Water Recycling,
   Wollongong, AUSTRALIA, FEB 14-17, 2005},
Abstract = {Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to
   increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater,
   and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation,
   recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water
   resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies.
   The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous.
   Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries
   around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of
   the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In
   addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are
   considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural
   return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water,
   co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well
   as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse
   provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into
   creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits
   of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go
   unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the
   value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water
   resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the
   implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term
   sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which
   involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health
   risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant
   challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal
   influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water
   reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of
   significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of
   water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers
   experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including:
   the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel
   applications; the need for public education and increased public
   acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the
   lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the
   media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians.
   Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting
   water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging
   pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments
   including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception,
   understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and
   aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate
   disposal), increase in the use of `' alternative sources `',
   environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of
   nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since
   these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation
   and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these
   topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop
   innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for
   communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation
   and reuse projects.},

Title = {Quantitative Precipitation Estimation of Extremes in CONUS With Radar
   Data},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Constructing an accurate, continental, in-situ-based, kilometer-scale,
   long-term record of the precipitation field and its spatiotemporal
   changes remains a significant challenge. Here, we determine the
   extreme-value behavior of the NEXRAD Stage IV radar-based quantitative
   precipitation estimate. We find that the climatology of 5-year daily
   return values in the contiguous United States East of the Rocky
   Mountains shows only slight variability on spatial scales smaller than
   similar to 100 km. In light of this finding, we test whether
   rain-gauge-only daily precipitation data sets can produce accurate
   extreme-value behavior at spatial scales finer than the spacing between
   gauges. We find that the 5-year daily return values are accurate at
   locations far from rain gauges only if the interpolation between gauges
   is carried out appropriately for extremes. Precipitation statistics
   derived from in-situ rain gauge data are therefore of sufficient spatial
   resolution to faithfully capture daily extremes over much of the eastern
   United States.
   Plain Language Summary Accurate measurement of the amount of
   precipitation that falls within a given region and time period is
   crucial for environmental modeling, climate change research, and
   resource and risk management. For all of those applications, it is
   desirable to understand not only how much precipitation falls on
   average, but also how much precipitation falls during an extreme event,
   such as a severe storm. Using data from weather radar, we show that
   certain statistical properties of extreme rainfall are highly correlated
   on spatial scales up to 100 km over the eastern United States. This
   means that rain gauge networks, which have typical intergauge spacings
   of roughly 30 km over the eastern United States, are dense enough to
   accurately measure these statistical properties. However, it is
   imperative to interpolate between the rain gauge measurements in a way
   that explicitly captures extremes if the application of interest
   requires capturing extremes accurately. Our research represents a step
   toward constructing an accurate, continental-scale, long-term,
   high-resolution precipitation data set.},

Title = {Landsat Imagery Spectral Trajectories-Important Variables for Spatially
   Predicting the Risks of Bark Beetle Disturbance},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tree mortality caused by bark beetle infestation has significant effects
   on the ecology and value of both natural and commercial forests.
   Therefore, prediction of bark beetle infestations is critical in forest
   management. Existing predictive models, however, rarely consider the
   influence of long-term stressors on forest susceptibility to bark beetle
   infestation. In this study we introduce pre-disturbance spectral
   trajectories from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery as an indicator
   of long-term stress into models of bark beetle infestation together with
   commonly used environmental predictors. Observations for this study come
   from forests in the central part of the Sumava Mountains, in the border
   region between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The areas
   of bark beetle-infested forest were delineated from aerial photographs
   taken in 1991 and in every year from 1994 to 2000. The environmental
   predictors represent forest stand attributes (e.g., tree density and
   distance to the infested forest from previous year) and common abiotic
   factors, such as topography, climate, geology, and soil. Pre-disturbance
   spectral trajectories were defined by the linear regression slope of
   Tasseled Cap components (Wetness, Brightness and Greenness) calculated
   from a time series of 16 Landsat TM images across years from 1984 until
   one year before the bark beetle infestation. Using logistic regression
   and multimodel inference, we calculated predictive models separately for
   each single year from 1994 to 2000 to account for a possible shift in
   importance of individual predictors during disturbance. Inclusion of two
   pre-disturbance spectral trajectories (Wetness slope and Brightness
   slope) significantly improved predictive ability of bark beetle
   infestation models. Wetness slope had the greatest predictive power,
   even relative to environmental predictors, and was relatively stable in
   its power over the years. Brightness slope improved the model only in
   the middle of the disturbance period (1996). Importantly, these
   pre-disturbance predictors were not correlated with other predictors,
   and therefore bring additional explanatory power to the model.
   Generally, the predictive power of most fitted model decreases as time
   progresses and models describing the initial phase of bark beetle
   outbreaks appear more reliable for conducting near-future predictions.
   The pre-disturbance spectral trajectories are valuable not only for
   assessing the risk of bark beetle infestation, but also for detection of
   long-term gradual changes even in non-forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Estimate of daytime single-layer cloud base height from advanced
   baseline imager measurements},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {274},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Cloud base height (CBH) is an important parameter to describe cloud
   state and is highly related to the vertical motions in the atmosphere.
   CBH information is critical for both aviation safety and synoptic
   analysis. In this study, daytime CBH is estimated directly from
   Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-16)
   Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) level lb data and the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis
   (ERAS) data using the Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) machine
   learning technique. The CBH estimate algorithm, which is named as
   GETCBH, covers the same areal extent as the full disk of the ABI/GOES-16
   and only for single-layer clouds. The 2-years of CBH measurements from
   the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard
   Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations
   (CALIPSO) satellite is used as the label (which is the true value/class
   of the model output for regression/classification problem in machine
   learning terminology). A quality flag algorithm using another machine
   learning technique, the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees machine learning
   technique is developed to provide a confidence level for the CBH
   estimate. The evaluations show an overall root mean square error (RMSE)
   of 1.87 km and Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) of 0.92
   before any quality control. After excluding CBH estimates with low
   confidence (19.2\% of all samples), the RMSE is reduced to 1.14 km,
   Pearson's r increases to 0.97, and 96\% of the estimates are within 2 km
   of the CALIOP results. By analyzing model bias and feature importance,
   cloud phase information has the biggest impact on the CBH estimate,
   although all input features have positive impact on the estimate
   accuracy. Limited by the penetrability of CALIOP, GETCBH is valid for
   clouds with COD < 8.5. The CBH estimates have reduced accuracy
   (Pearson's r of 0.88) for optically thin clouds (clouds with cloud
   optical depth {[}COD] < 0.1) where little cloud information is contained
   in the ABI measurements, as well as for optically thick clouds (clouds
   with COD >= 3) where a larger proportion of opaque clouds is excluded.
   Furthermore, for the GBTCBH model using 9 months of CloudSat
   measurements as label, the CBH estimates are improved with an RMSE of
   1.41 km and Pearson's r of 0.92. In a case study of Hurricane Dorian,
   CBHs for most of the single-layer clouds are successfully estimated with
   small errors and flagged with high confidence, for both high and low
   clouds. Deep convective clouds and multi-layer clouds, both of which are
   not included in the training, are reasonably flagged as low confidence
   with large CBH estimate errors. In this particular case, 65\% of cloudy
   pixels have CBH estimate with high confidence in the scene. Daytime CBH
   with high spatial (2 km) and temporal (10 min) resolution can be derived
   from ABI measurements using this methodology.},

Abstract = {By 2050, almost 70\% of the world's population will live in towns and
   cities. This places increasing pressure on land to support development
   whilst minimising environmental impact and providing long-term
   sustainability. Prior knowledge of the ground at the planning and
   development stage is needed to assess its suitability to meet planned
   subsurface uses and avoid subsurface conflicts at an early stage of
   design.
   This research tested the development and application of a 3D engineering
   geological model and its spatial integration with 2D (hydro)geological
   datasets to support sustainable development decision-making at Earls
   Court, London, UK. The 3D engineering geological model consists of seven
   geological layers extending from Made Ground to the top surface of the
   Chalk Group. The 3D geological model, and 2D datasets derived from it,
   are combined with 2D geospatial datasets of urban underground space
   (UUS) indicators to identify potential uses of urban underground space
   based on its suitability to do so. This is complimented by a qualitative
   assessment of the potential subsurface interactions between UUS
   indicator uses and their implications for delivering the sustainability
   and energy objectives specified in the Earls Court masterplan.
   Infiltration sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), ground source heat
   potential and foundation condition potential were chosen as suitable UUS
   indictors against which to test the outputs of the methodology.
   Infiltration SuDS potential was assessed using nationally-available
   (hydro)geological 2D GIS datasets. Ground source heat potential was
   assessed using national-available 2D datasets and estimates of thermal
   properties of each geological layer revealed by the 3D geological model.
   Potentially suitable foundation conditions were assessed using density
   data from existing ground investigations and depth of suitable
   geological layers derived from the 3D geological model.
   The results reveal constraints for the development of rapid infiltration
   SuDS but opportunities for bespoke design that considers the thickness
   of overlying permeable sand and gravel. It identifies the susceptibility
   of the London Clay Formation to potential volume change and ground
   movement based on an assessment of its plasticity. Closed-loop ground
   source heat pump opportunities exist depending on site-specific thermal
   and hydraulic properties and heat exchange design. Opportunities for the
   use of the Kempton Park Gravel Member for ground source heating and
   cooling and combined use of thermal regulation and pile design via
   thermopiles are identified. A qualitative assessment of potential
   benefits and conflicts between UUS indicator uses reveals that the
   Kempton Park Gravel Member and London Clay Formation are likely to have
   the highest, relative, UUS value.
   The results demonstrate that there is potential to modify the energy and
   sustainability components of the Earls Court masterplan prior to
   invasive ground investigation and development. It is further suggested
   that this approach can be used to compliment research-tested,
   semi-qualitative means of valuing UUS indicators. The implications of
   the methodology for mainstreaming UUS into city masterplans is also
   assessed. It is concluded that opportunities now exist for the
   integrated 3D and 2D spatial assessment of UUS indicators into
   city-scale masterplans.},

Title = {Long Range Correlation in Vegetation Over West Africa From 1982 to 2011},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {119151-119165},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) data
   records offer important sources for long term correlation modelling over
   West Africa. In this study, we assessed long range correlations in half
   monthly NDVI records over West Africa from 1982 to 2011 using GIMMS
   NDVI. In our analysis, we assessed (a) the annual and seasonal trends
   obtained using Ordinary Linear Regression, (b) the detrended
   lag-1-autocorrelation C(1), (c) the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
   scaling Hurst exponent h and (d) the Multifractal (MF) characteristics
   of NDVI. Results show that there exist some patterns or trends in the
   records that persist over time. The value of C(1) for NDVI was obtained
   as 0.989 is significant at 95\% confidence interval. Consequently, the
   scaling h values of the Hurst DFA showed that about 37.4, 20.5, 41.7 and
   0.5\% of the vegetated areas are anti-correlated (h < 0.5),
   un-correlated (h = 0.5), correlated (0 :5 < h < 1) and uncorrelated
   random walk (h = 1), respectively. The trend analysis from Ordinary
   Least square Regression (OLR) shows that about 54.3, 0.1 and 45.6\% of
   the vegetated areas are positively, uncorrelated and negatively
   correlated, respectively. Our findings revealed that the DFA method
   performed better than OLR and the findings could be useful in
   identifying areas with improved and degraded vegetation, which cannot be
   properly captured by the OLR method. Accordingly, the comparison of the
   MF-DFA results of original data to those of shuffled and surrogate
   series indicated that the multifractal nature of considered time-series
   is both from PDF and long-range correlations but arguably, MF due to
   long range correlation dominates over West Africa. The research is
   therefore helpful in the formulating crop and environmental management
   policies that may be used to improve ecosystem management using a long
   term plan (inter-annual) or short term (inter-seasonal) planning.},

Title = {An integrated economic-ecological index based on satellite-derived
   carbon sequestration and carbon price: A case study during 2015-2020 in
   Shaanxi, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Carbon sequestration reflecting vegetation productivity is essential for
   global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystems. Exploring the spatial
   and temporal variation of carbon sequestration and corresponding
   ecological values yields insights for policy formulation to mitigate
   carbon emission and achieve carbon neutrality. Hence, taking Shaanxi
   China as the case study, we developed an integrated index (named C-GDP)
   based on vegetation carbon sequestration estimated by the CASA model and
   carbon prices acquired from carbon trading market in China to explore
   tradeoffs between economic and ecological development. The
   spatiotemporal distributions of carbon sequestration and C-GDP were
   characterized using hotspot analysis and variation coefficient during
   2015-2020. The estimated carbon sequestrations were assessed with
   promising accuracy, depicting high values in the south and low values in
   the north, with provincial averages of 1761.37gC/m2a. Temporally, carbon
   sequestrations increased with fluctuation between 2015 and 2020, with
   significant seasonality. Summertime, especially July, has the highest
   sequestration, while winter is the season with the lowest values. The
   C-GDP calculated by carbon sequestration and carbon price exhibited a
   distinct pattern with sequestration, with the highest C-GDP in Central
   Shaanxi and the lowest in the south. The multi-year provincial-mean
   C-GDP is 20.44 billion yuan. The C-GDP exhibited an increase trend with
   miniscule fluctuation, peaking at 23.66 billion yuan in 2020. The
   results imply the ecological value of carbon sequestration monetizing by
   carbon prices is much lower than economical value of production,
   suggesting that strict carbon policies, such as improving carbon prices
   or taxes, may be warranted for China because of high carbon mitigation
   costs.},

Title = {Spatial Management Measures Alter Vessel Behavior in the Aleutian
   Archipelago},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Aleutian Archipelago and surrounding waters have enormous
   ecological, cultural, and commercial significance. As one of the
   shortest routes between North American and Asian ports, the North
   Pacific Great Circle Route, which crosses through the Aleutian
   Archipelago, is traveled by thousands of large cargo ships and tanker
   vessels every year. To reduce maritime risks and enhance navigational
   safety, the International Maritime Organization built upon earlier
   offshore routing efforts by designating five Areas To Be Avoided (ATBAs)
   in the Aleutian Islands in 2016. The ATBAs are designed to keep large
   vessels at least 50 nautical miles (93 km) from shore unless calling at
   a local port or transiting an authorized pass between islands. However,
   very few studies have examined the effectiveness of ATBAs as a mechanism
   for changing vessel behavior and thereby reducing the ecological impacts
   of maritime commerce. In this study, we use 4 years of satellite-based
   vessel tracking data to assess the effectiveness of the Aleutian ATBAs
   since their implementation in 2016. We determined whether vessels
   transiting the North Pacific Great Circle Route changed behavior after
   ATBA implementation, both in terms of overall route selection and in
   terms of compliance with each ATBA boundary. We found a total of 2,252
   unique tankers and cargo vessels >400 gross tons transited the study
   region, completing a total of 8,794 voyages. To quantify routing changes
   of individual vessels, we analyzed the 767 vessels that transited the
   study region both before and after implementation. The percentage of
   voyages transiting through the boundaries of what would become ATBAs
   decreased from 76.3\% in 2014-2015 (prior to ATBA designation) to 11.8\%
   in 2016-2017 (after implementation). All five Aleutian ATBAs had
   significant increases in compliance, with the West ATBA showing the most
   dramatic increase, from 32.1\% to 95.0\%. We discuss the framework for
   ATBA enforcement and highlight the value of local institutional capacity
   for real-time monitoring. Overall, our results indicate that ATBAs
   represent a viable strategy for risk mitigation in sensitive ecological
   areas and that through monitoring, spatial protections influence vessel
   route decisions on multiple spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) plays an important role by pole and
   line fishery in the Bone Gulf, Indonesia, since it has a high economic
   value and wide market acceptance. The purpose of this paper was to
   assess the seasonal changes of skipjack tuna potential fishing ground in
   the Bone Gulf. We used pole and line fishery and oceanographic data of
   sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a derived from satellite
   to figure out the seasonal formation of the potential fishing areas. We
   developed the spatial model to determine the potential fishing ground
   based on different levels of oceanographic preferences. The results
   showed that potential fishing grounds were mostly formed in the first
   transition season (particularly in May) as well as the west season
   (especially in November), which have a good association with the
   specific SST and chlorophyll-a of near 30 Deg C and 0.2 mg m-3,
   respectively. Most of the potential skipjack fishing ground formation
   developed along with the specific oceanographic signatures. It was
   likely that the potential seasonal changes of fishing grounds
   corresponded with enhanced feeding opportunity distribution pattern for
   skipjack schools. This suggested that these potential areas play an
   important for conservation and skipjack fishing management within the
   study area.},

   this study we propose the analysis of the dynamics of the forest areas
   in the territorial administrative units that overlap the Apuseni
   Mountains, based on a data source processed from satellite images, for
   the period 2000-2017. The data source is the Global Forest Change
   database, designed to monitor forest dynamics and in particular forest
   loss. The raster images processed for the study area were extracted from
   this database. As a case study, we chose the Apuseni Mountains, which
   are part of the Western Carpathians, where forest exploitation has been
   particularly significant in recent years. The forest images were
   processed and then the forest dynamics was calculated for all
   administrative units overlapping the analyzed area. The obtained results
   highlighted the added value of the methodology proposed in the
   assessment of cut forests in each territorial administrative unit, it
   also highlights the advantages and limitations given by this spatial
   data source.},

Title = {A 6-year-long (2013-2018) high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset

Abstract = {A 6-year-long high-resolution Chinese air quality reanalysis (CAQRA)
   dataset is presented in this study obtained from the assimilation of
   surface observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring
   Centre (CNEMC) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Nested Air
   Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS).This dataset contains
   surface fields of six conventional air pollutants in China (i.e. PM2.5,
   PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) for the period 2013-2018 at high spatial
   (15km +/- 15km) and temporal (1 h) resolutions. This paper aims to
   document this dataset by providing detailed descriptions of the
   assimilation system and the first validation results for the above
   reanalysis dataset. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is adopted
   to demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis. The CV results show that
   the CAQRA yields an excellent performance in reproducing the magnitude
   and variability of surface air pollutants in China from 2013 to 2018 (CV
   R 2 D 0 :52-0.81, CV root mean square error (RMSE) D 0 :54 mg =m3 for
   CO, and CV RMSE D 16 :4-39.3 mu g =m(3) for the other pollutants on an
   hourly scale). Through comparison to the Copernicus Atmosphere
   Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) dataset produced by the European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), we show that CAQRA
   attains a high accuracy in representing surface gaseous air pollutants
   in China due to the assimilation of surface observations. The fine
   horizontal resolution of CAQRA also makes it more suitable for air
   quality studies on a regional scale. The PM2.5 reanalysis dataset is
   further validated against the independent datasets from the US
   Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program over China, which
   exhibits a good agreement with the independent observations (R 2 D 0
   :74-0.86 and RMSE D 16 :8-33.6 mu g =m3 in different cities).
   Furthermore, through the comparison to satellite-estimated PM2.5
   concentrations, we show that the accuracy of the PM2.5 reanalysis is
   higher than that of most satellite estimates. The CAQRA is the first
   high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China that
   simultaneously provides the surface concentrations of six conventional
   air pollutants, which is of great value for many studies, such as health
   impact assessment of air pollution, investigation of air quality changes
   in China, model evaluation and satellite calibration, optimization of
   monitoring sites, and provision of training data for statistical or
   artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting. All datasets are freely
   available at https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00053 (Tang et al.,
   2020a), and a prototype product containing the monthly and annual means
   of the CAQRA dataset has also been released at
   https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00092 (Tang et al., 2020b) to
   facilitate the evaluation of the CAQRA dataset by potential users.},

Title = {Characterizing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Mangrove Forests in Can Gio

Abstract = {Featured Application This study proposes the features of mangrove forest
   variations in relation to anthropogenic activities under the forms of
   land use land cover changes around three ecological zones of a Biosphere
   Reserve area, using Sentinel-2 Imagery and spatial regression approaches
   that have wide application in natural resources, land use planning, and
   environmental management. This study aimed at evaluating the
   spatiotemporal patterns of mangrove forest variations for three
   ecological zones of the Can Gio biosphere reserve (i.e., core, buffer,
   and transition zones) and its relation to land use/land cover changes.
   Time series Sentinel-2 Imagery-which presents the Normalized Different
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained through the Google Earth Engine and
   Overlap Similarity Algorithm-was used to characterize vegetation cover
   in the study area. Furthermore, the Cohen's Kappa agreement was applied
   to examine the accuracy of mangrove classification, and the Mann-Kendal
   (MK) significance was used to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of
   mangrove forests. The results showed that an NDVI value greater than 0.3
   recorded the reflected signal of mangrove population in the study area
   with anO-index greater than 0.85. A Cohen's Kappa statistic of agreement
   of 0.7 and an overall classification accuracy of 83\% was obtained.
   Regarding the trend in mangrove forest patterns, an increase in area of
   669 ha and 579 ha explored at the buffer and core zones, respectively,
   while the largest declined mangrove area of 350 ha was investigated at
   the buffer zone, followed by a transition at 314 ha during the study
   period due to the interconversion of shrimp farming and the expansion of
   built-up areas. Moreover, the study also described the negative impacts
   of the sea-encroached urban-tourism zone on mangrove patterns in the
   foreseeable future. The results from this study will act as a basic
   fundamental authentic report for local governments in proposing
   strategies for the shielding of mangrove forests and economic
   development from negative consequences in foreseeable future.},

Abstract = {The knowledge management, like a strategic resource, has gained great
   importance for business development and knowledge transfer processes
   became a key issue in allowing firms to get new sources of information.
   The study looks at the reality of industrial districts, where, normally,
   equality and fairness create the conditions upon which firms share their
   own knowledge. However, often, these contexts, in contrasts to the
   traditional Marshallian industrial district (Marshall, 1879, Becattini,
   1981), are characterized by an asymmetric power relationship among the
   parties, according to the Hub and Spoke district (Markusen, 1996). The
   case study of Val d'Agri, the most important Italian oil district, is an
   example of Hub-and-spoke District, with the dominance of a bigger firm
   (Eni) to manage all the relationship along the chain. The discovery of
   the Val d'Agri was made by ENI, in 1988.
   Purpose - Starting from the description of Val d'Agri district, our
   paper aims at mapping the local relationships, in order to define the
   way firms relate along the district value chain, with reference to both
   their position, and their own ``contractual power{''}; and to understand
   how firms position, as well as their different contractual power, affect
   knowledge transfer process within the district. Taking into account the
   ``Hub and Spoke{''} morphology, we support the idea that knowledge
   transfer is deeply affected by firms' contractual power, as well as by
   their position within the district. Explicit knowledge transfer is
   mainly linked to the development of production process; on the contrary,
   the transfer of tacit knowledge depends, above all, by the action people
   place within the district; so, human capital plays a very important role
   in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social
   interaction.
   Design/methodology/approach - We propose an empirical approach. This
   work will start providing an analysis of the main characteristics of the
   relational structure of Val d'Agri, in order to identify the main issues
   that can impact the development process of knowledge transfer. The study
   consists of two parts: in the first part, it will develop an analysis of
   the main national and international literature on the field, from both
   economic and managerial perspectives; in the second part, an empirical
   analysis will be developed. For the analysis were contacted about 100
   firms of satellite ENI industries (the biggest ones), both the same ENI.
   Were sent questionnaires for asking questions about the company
   structure, specialization, the typology of formal relationships exists
   with the leader, the company's distinctive knowledge, the existence of
   knowledge management systems.
   Originality/value - Since the importance that both industrial districts
   and knowledge transfer have for firms competition, the paper aims at
   giving a new and valuable framework useful to understand, not only the
   district dynamics, but also the way knowledge transfer may be fostered
   among all the firms related along a given value chain.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the application puts in
   evidence the peculiarity of an oil district, because the birth of this
   form of district is closely related to land resources. In addition,
   national laws and regulations that govern the exploitation of oil in
   Italy, create positions of power within the production chain, which
   alter the relationship between the companies, compared to what happens
   in the traditional type of Marshallian districts.},

Title = {Land use land cover change and the resilience of social-ecological
   systems in a sub-region in South west Cameroon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {The old paradigm of horizontal expansion of agricultural land and
   built-up areas over highland and lowland ecosystems remains highly
   prevalent in Cameroon, causing significant changes in LULC and
   undermining the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological
   systems. We analysed satellite imagery of 1986 and 2018 to examine the
   extent and spatial patterns of LULCC in Fako sub-region of Cameroon. In
   addition, we explored the likelihood of LULCC and magnitude of impact of
   the drivers and predictors of LULCC in the sub-region by engaging 25
   stakeholders in a focus group survey. Other cultivated areas of
   cropland, built-up, oil palm, and banana plantation covers increased by
   21,360 ha (10.5\%), 3152 ha (1.6\%), 5721 ha (2.8\%), and 1823 ha
   (0.9\%), while dense forest, rubber and tea plantation covers decreased
   by -44,945 ha (-22.1\%), -15,557 ha (-7.7\%), and -110 ha (-0.1\%),
   respectively, from 1986 to 2018. Most of the deforestation and LULCC was
   caused by expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland by
   smallholders, contrary to the widely publicised narrative of
   agro-industrial and built-up areas expansion. The spatial pattern of
   LULCC showed that expansion of other cultivated areas of cropland and
   agro-industrial plantations were highest in the north and east zones,
   respectively, while expansion of built-up areas and decrease in
   agro-industrial plantation covers were highest in the central, south and
   western coastal zones of Fako division. The variations in the spatial
   patterns of LULCC between the sub-divisions are attributed to
   differences in rates of population growth and urbanisation, topography,
   size of farming population, proportion of cultivable land, socioeconomic
   opportunities, and strength and resilience of local economy. The
   presence of the Mount Cameroon (4095 m), with high value forests,
   endemism, and conservation attractiveness restricted increased LULCC
   with elevation, while LULCC increased with nearness to the sea and
   national road networks. The likelihood of change from one LULC to oil
   palm plantation, banana plantation, and other cultivated areas and from
   rubber plantation, dense forest, lowland grassland to other land uses
   was 95\% and 90\%, respectively. Population growth, agricultural and
   farmland expansion, and infrastructural development were ranked as the
   three most important drivers of degradation under the business as usual
   scenario, while sustainable land management, good governance, and
   reforestation were ranked as the three most important predictors of
   LULCC reduction under the green economy scenario. In general, production
   and living space functions significantly increased at the expense of
   ecological land cover. Prioritising and increasing the legal protection
   of the mountain and coastal land-boundary ecosystems while providing for
   production and living land are invaluable for the sustainability of the
   social-ecological systems in the western highlands of Cameroon.},

Title = {Estimation of actual evapotranspiration and water stress in the Lijiang
   River Basin, China using a modified Operational Simplified Surface
   Energy Balance (SSEBop) model},

Abstract = {Due to the simultaneous impacts of economic development and climate
   change, the Lijiang River Basin in China-the largest karst tourist
   attraction in the world-has experienced dramatic water shortages during
   the dry season. As actual evapotranspiration (ETa) plays a critical role
   in the water cycle, accurate estimation of ETa and water stress are
   important for sustainable water resources management. In this paper, we
   mapped the distribution of daily ETa using a modified Operational
   Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model in combination with
   Landsat 8 images and assessed water stress using the Crop Water Stress
   Index (CWSI) during the dry season in the Lijiang River Basin. In
   general, the daily ETa simulated by the SSEBop model with aerodynamic
   resistance value of 110 s m(-1) was higher than that of satellite-based
   actual evapotranspiration products (i.e., MOD16A2 and
   Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML)\_V2 actual evapotranspiration products in
   this study). Aerodynamic resistance plays a critical role in the
   estimation of energy fluxes in the SSEBop model and should be readjusted
   and calibrated with available datasets to improve the model's
   performance in estimating actual evapotranspiration for particular
   regions. Readjusted values between 20 and 35 s m(-1) of aerodynamic
   resistance produced reasonable agreement with satellite-based actual
   evapotranspiration products in the Lijiang River Basin. In addition,
   insufficient ground-level measurements of actual evapotranspiration
   might have increased the uncertainty of the SSEBop model's performance.
   The achievement of higher accuracy in the estimation of actual
   evapotranspiration and water availability will require establishing
   local flux towers, particularly in forested areas, to collect
   evapotranspiration, temperature and other in situ data. For different
   land-cover classes, forest areas exhibited the highest actual
   evapotranspiration, whereas farmland and built-up areas had the lowest
   actual evapotranspiration values compared to the other land-cover
   classes. All land-cover classes, especially farmland areas, experienced
   severe water stress. Inadequate precipitation as a result of climate
   change, combined with high actual evapotranspiration will result in less
   water being available for the Lijiang River Basin. Additional water is
   required to compensate for evapotranspiration and support plant growth
   in the Lijiang River Basin during the growing season.},

Title = {Carbon Isotope Discrimination (delta C-13) of Grape Musts Is a Reliable
   Tool for Zoning and the Physiological Ground-Truthing of Sensor Maps in
   Precision Viticulture},

Abstract = {Carbon stable isotope composition of berry must at harvest (delta C-13)
   is an integrated assessment of plant water status during grape (Vitis
   viniferaL.) berry ripening. Measurement of delta C-13 of grape juice is
   proposed as an alternative to traditional measurements of water status
   to capture the spatial variability of physiological response at the
   vineyard scale, i.e., zoning. We performed samplings at four different
   locations in California, United States, with three different cultivars
   of table and wine grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Crimson-Seedless).
   Leaf physiology (photosynthesis,A(N), stomatal conductance,g(s)) and
   stem water potentials (psi(stem)) were routinely measured. The delta
   C-13 was measured at harvest and strong relationships were found between
   psi(stem)(R-2= 0.71), stomatal conductance (R-2= 0.71), net carbon
   assimilation (R-2= 0.59) and WUEi (R-2= 0.53). The role of leaf nitrogen
   on the signal was assessed by evaluating relationships between leaf
   nitrogen and WUEi(R-2= 0.54), Ci/Ca (R-2= 0.51), delta C-13 (R-2= 0.44),
   and psi(stem)(R-2= 0.37). Although nitrogen can be among the
   environmental factors able to affect the delta C-13 signal, this
   difference is only observable when variability inNis very large, by
   pooling different vineyards/varieties, but not at the within-vineyard
   scale. The utility of delta C-13 was further tested and measured on
   grape berries sampled on an equidistant grid in a 3.5 ha vineyard where
   psi(stem)was also measured throughout the field season and used to
   delineate management zones. Physiological measurements and grape
   composition were correlated to soil electrical resistivity and
   satellite-derived vegetation index. The two management zones obtained by
   delta C-13 or psi(stem)were spatially similar at 67\% and allowed to
   separate the harvest in two pools having statistically different grape
   composition (soluble solids, organic acids, and anthocyanin profiles).
   Zoning by delta C-13 performed as well as zoning by psi(stem)to separate
   grape phenolic composition, e.g., for selective harvest. Our results
   provided evidence that delta C-13 of grape must is a reliable and
   repeatable assessor of plant water status and gas exchange in vineyard
   systems that are crucial for zoning vineyards, even when irrigated, and
   for ground-truthing sensor maps in precision viticulture.},

Title = {Built environment and agricultural value at risk from Hurricane Irma

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Flooding is the most costly type of natural disaster, as well as the
   most frequent. To provide risk-based flood insurance, providers must be
   able to accurately determine an asset's risk of flooding. Additionally,
   after a flooding event, providers need to quickly determine the direct
   damages that occurred to verify insurance claims and assist affected
   communities. Many current approaches to flood risk and flood damage
   estimation use data or statistical extrapolation that add various
   sources of uncertainty into the final damage estimate. To reduce
   uncertainties in flood risk analyses, the objective of this research is
   to outline an approach to flood damage estimation conducted on a
   statewide scale while still estimating flood risk and damage on a
   structure-by-structure basis. This approach uses the observed flooding
   extent during and after Hurricane Irma in Florida, extracted from a
   collection of satellite images over the course of 8 days. The results
   show that residential structures had the largest exposure to flooding
   during Hurricane Irma, with estimates ranging from \$300 million to \$2
   billion per county, for the three counties that were studied in depth.
   For agriculture, fruit crops were estimated to have a potential at-risk
   revenue of \$38.2 million, and vegetables were estimated to have a value
   at risk of \$940 million across all crops. With improvements in the data
   used, this approach can offer a quick and accurate assessment of flood
   damages directly after a flood hazard, which could reduce the recovery
   time and economic impacts to the affected communities.},

Title = {Differential Impact of Climate Change on the Hydropower Economics of Two
   River Basins in High Mountain Asia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Water stored in the form of snow and glaciers in the High Mountain Asia
   (HMA) region regulates the water supply, and resultant water-based
   economies, that support the livelihoods of millions of people. Trends in
   the seasonal and long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by
   initial ice reserves, meteorological factors and geographic features,
   vary across sub-basins in the HMA region. We examined the economic
   impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins, one
   each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an
   integrated assessment framework to estimate the changes in economic
   value of the hydropower generation from hydropower plants on rivers fed
   by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins. The framework, developed
   under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical models (a
   suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower model)
   with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river
   flow over historic and future time using the water balance model in
   sixteen scenarios (eight climate models and two emissions scenarios) for
   rivers upstream of hydropower plants in each sub-basin. Using the
   hydropower model we developed, we estimated the changes in hydropower
   generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity,
   located in Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a
   19.6 MW capacity, in Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their
   baselines, the estimated impact of climate change and temporal
   variability were higher for the Naltar plant than for the Trishuli
   plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with water
   storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated
   impacts are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides
   an example of the differential impacts of climate change on hydropower
   plants located in rivers fed by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt
   at different decades in this century. This type of integrated assessment
   of climate change impact will support the scientific understanding of
   hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various
   climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource
   management in a changing climate.},

Title = {Micro-Spatial Analysis of Maize Yield Gap Variability and Production
   Factors on Smallholder Farms},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Site-specific land management practice taking into account variability
   in maize yield gaps (the difference between yields in the 90th
   percentiles and other yields on smallholder farmers' fields) could
   improve resource use efficiency and enhance yields. However, the
   applicability of the practice is constrained by inability to identify
   patterns of resource utilization to target application of resources to
   more responsive fields. The study focus was to map yield gaps on
   smallholder fields based on identified spatial arrangements
   differentiated by distance from the smallholder homestead and understand
   field-specific utilization of production factors. This was aimed at
   understanding field variability based on yield gap mapping patterns in
   order to enhance resource use efficiency on smallholder farms. The study
   was done in two villages, Mukuyu and Shikomoli, with high and low
   agroecology regarding soil fertility in Western Kenya. Identification of
   spatial arrangements at 40 m, 80 m, 150 m and 300 m distance from the
   homestead on smallholder farms for 70 households was done. The spatial
   arrangements were then classified into near house, mid farm and far farm
   basing on distance from the homestead. For each spatial arrangement,
   Landsat sensors acquired via satellite imagery were processed to
   generate yield gap maps. The focal statistics analysis method using the
   neighborhoods function was then applied to generate yield gap maps at
   the different spatial arrangements identified above. Socio-economic,
   management and biophysical factors were determined, and maize yields
   estimated at each spatial arrangement. Heterogeneous patterns of high,
   average and low yield gaps were found in spatial arrangements at the 40
   m and 80 m distances. Nearly homogenous patterns tending towards median
   yield gap values were found in spatial arrangements that were located at
   the 150 m and 300 m. These patterns correspondingly depicted
   field-specific utilization of management and socio-economic factors.
   Field level management practices and socio-economic factors such as
   application of inorganic fertilizer, high frequency of weed control,
   early land preparation, high proportion of hired and family labor use
   and allocation of large land sizes were utilized in spatial arrangements
   at 150 and 300 m distances. High proportions of organic fertilizer and
   family labor use were utilized in spatial arrangements at 40 and 80 m
   distances. The findings thus show that smallholder farmers
   preferentially manage the application of socio-economic and management
   factors in spatial arrangements further from the homestead compared to
   fields closer to the homestead which could be exacerbating maize yield
   gaps. Delineating management zones based on yield gap patterns at the
   different spatial arrangements on smallholder farms could contribute to
   site-specific land management and enhance yields. Investigating the
   value smallholder farmers attach to each spatial arrangement is further
   needed to enhance the spatial understanding of yield gap variation on
   smallholder farms.},

Title = {Global patterns and influencing factors of post-fire land cover change},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {223},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fire, as a strong disturbance type, can exert significant impacts on the
   biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere and human
   society. It can inherently trigger both critical transitions in
   ecosystems and dramatic changes in land cover. However, the general
   patterns and possible influencing factors of post-fire land cover change
   remain largely unclear at a global scale. Obtaining such knowledge is of
   great value in advancing the understanding of fire ecology and promoting
   sustainable fire management. Here, we combined satellite observations of
   long-term ESA CCI land cover (300 m resolution) and burned area data
   from MODIS collection 6 (500 m resolution) to assess the global
   post-fire land cover change patterns from 2005 to 2015. The results
   showed that areas with identified post-fire land cover change accounted
   for approximately 0.36-0.74\% of the annual global burned areas during
   the study period and were most common in countries such as Brazil,
   Argentina, and the D.R. Congo. The most common land cover change types
   in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were ``forest-to-agriculture{''} (31.93\%),
   ``forest-to-shrubland{''} (26.23\%) and ``agriculture-to-forest{''}
   (18.74\%), respectively. In addition, the conversion between agriculture
   and forest, and shrubland and forest, after fire were found to be
   bidirectional. After assessing 14 fire-related, climatic, topographic,
   ecological and socioeconomic factors that could potentially influence
   post-fire land cover change occurrence, burned area size and vegetation
   cover di-versity were identified as the two strongest predictors,
   followed by aspect, fire intensity and slope. Our results provide a
   global overview of post-fire land cover change patterns and offer
   guidance for developing sustainable fire management policies.},

Title = {Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs): A Case Study from Kota
   Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia},
Journal = {INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The topic on Landslide Vulnerability Assessment (LVAs) in Malaysia is
   relatively new and received little attention from geoscientists and
   engineers. This research paper tries to formulate the concept of LVAs by
   taking into account the science and socio-economic aspects. A new
   approach in vulnerability concept is also introduced herein. To achieve
   this goal, a framework was designed for assessing the LVAs. The
   framework was formulated semiquantitatively through the development of
   database for the risk elements (human and properties) based on
   information from secondary data (technical reports), extensive review of
   literature, and field observations. The vulnerability parameters
   included in assessing LVAs are 1) physical implication (building
   structures, internal materials, property damage, infrastructural
   facilities, and stabilization actions), 2) social status (injury,
   fatalities, safety, loss of accommodation, and public awareness), and 3)
   interference on environment (affected period, daily operation, and
   diversity). Each considered parameter in the vulnerability assessment is
   allocated with a certain index value ranges from 0 (0 \%
   damage/victims/period), 0.25 (1 - 25\% damage/victims/period), 0.50 (26
   - 50\% damage/victims/period), 0.75 (51 - 75\% damage/victims/period),
   and 1.00 (75 - 100\% damage/victims/period). All of these parameters are
   compiled and analyzed with ``Landslide Distribution Map{''} (LDM) to
   generate a ``Landslide Vulnerability Degree map (LVD){''}. The LDM was
   produced based on field studies and satellite image interpretations in
   order to locate the landslide locations in the studied area. Finally,
   three types of physical, human, and environment vulnerabilities were
   then classified into five classes of vulnerabilities, namely: Class 1 (<
   0.20): Very Low Vulnerability; Class 2 (0.21 - 0.40): Low Vulnerability;
   Class 3 (0.41 - 0.60): Medium Vulnerability; Class 4 (0.61 - 0.80): High
   Vulnerability); and Class 5 (> 0.81): Very High Vulnerability. Results
   from this study indicate that a further study is needed to the areas of
   high to very high vulnerability only. This LVAs approach is suitable as
   a guideline for preliminary development planning, controlling, and
   managing the landslide hazard /risk in the studied area and potentially
   to be extended with different background environments. (C) IJOG - 2017.

Title = {Preliminary results of GOCE-based height system unification between

Abstract = {The unification of local vertical datums (LVDs) at a country-wide scale
   has gained significant attention lately due to the availability of
   GOCE-based global geopotential models (GGMs) and the unprecedented geoid
   height accuracies offered. Within a single country, several LVDs may be
   used, especially in the case of islandic nations. Therefore, the
   unification of all of them to a single nation-wide LVD is of utmost
   importance. The same holds for neighboring countries, where the
   unification of their vertical datums is necessary as a tool of
   engineering, cross-border collaboration and environmental and risk
   management projects. The aforementioned set the main scope of the
   present study, which focuses on the use of GOCE and GOCE/GRACE GGMs in
   order to investigate the offsets between the Greek and Turkish LVDs.
   First an evaluation of the latest release 5 GOCE GGMs is carried out,
   either to their maximum degree or through spectral enhancement with
   EGM208 and topographic effects. Then, the geopotential value for the
   Greek and Turkish LVDs is performed, along with different estimates for
   the marine area of the Aegean Sea where several islands and isles exist
   with each one realizing its own LVD. The relative offset between the two
   LVDs was determined and used to provide a direct link between the Greek
   and Turkish LVDs with the IAG conventional value recently proposed as a
   global WHS. From the results achieved it was concluded that the
   spectrally enhanced GOCE GGMs reduce the standard deviation of the
   differences with GPS/levelling data by 2-4 cm over Turkey and 2 cm for
   mainland Greece. In terms of the zero-level geopotential determination,
   the LVD of the Greek mainland is 64.9 cm below the IAG conventional
   value, while that of Turkey is 9.6 cm above. Finally, it is concluded
   that in practice each Greek island realizes its own LVD with offsets
   between them as large as 35 cm. Despite that fact, the spectrally
   enhanced GOCE GGMs and in particular GOCO05s provides the overall
   smallest height residuals over the islands, hence the (W) over cap
   (LVD)(o) based on that can be recommended as the best estimate. In that
   way, relative offsets with the LVD of mainland Greece can be computed
   for each island, ranging between -23.8 and 15.5 cm.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {For much of the last two decades, the Central and East European (CEE)
   economies have experienced a deep structural reform, moving away from a
   socialist economic system towards a market economy. The political
   situation of the second half of the 20th century had a significant
   impact on the economic development and competitiveness of these
   transition countries, when compared with their Western European
   counterparts. A vast number of studies have been conducted to analyze
   the structural changes required for resource-dependent economies to
   achieve long-term development and to understand the synergies between
   commodities and diversification. Yet, the dynamics of resource
   extraction and the resource dependence of regions that have experienced
   periods of sustained levels of growth have largely been overlooked,
   especially the Central and Eastern European region. In this context,
   this article presents an analysis of the level of resource dependence of
   six countries which joined the European Union between 2004 and 2007.
   Using data spanning from the year 2000 to 2017, we calculate the
   Extractives Dependence Index (EDI) of six former Soviet satellite
   nations and one former Soviet state. Our results indicate that the
   commodity structure of trade in the six countries which joined the
   European Union has changed considerably. These countries have reduced
   their economic dependence on extractive resources by developing their
   high value-added and technology-intensive sectors. Our findings also
   reveal that Poland experienced the highest decrease in EDI scores among
   the six CEE countries.},

Abstract = {Hickory (Carya cathayensis) plantations in northwestern Zhejiang
   Province, China, have been extensively expanded in the past three
   decades due to their high economic value; however, improper management
   has caused serious soil erosion problems. To better manage hickory
   plantations, it is necessary to accurately map the spatial distribution
   of hickory expansion and to evaluate land suitability of current hickory
   plantations, but little research on these issues has been conducted.
   This research used bi-temporal Chinese satellite Gaofen-1 images in 2015
   (leaf-on and leaf-off) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM)
   data to develop a land-cover map with emphasis on young and mature
   hickory plantations using the random forest (RF) approach. The
   distribution data of hickory plantations in 2015 was then used to
   extract the spectral signatures of the 2010 Landsat imagery. The
   extracted spectral signatures were classified into different land covers
   using cluster analysis. The same approach was used with the Landsat
   imagery in 2005, 2000, 1995, 1990, and 1985 for mapping hickory dynamic
   change over time. The maximum entropy-based (MaxEnt) model was then used
   to evaluate the land suitability of these hickory plantations based on
   the identified factors from DEM, soil, and climate data. The results
   indicate that (1) the RF classifier based on multisource data can
   effectively produce a land-cover map with an overall accuracy of 89.5\%,
   in particular, producer's and user's accuracies of 88.7\% and 90.2\%,
   respectively, for mature hickory, and 95.2\% and 88.9\%, respectively,
   for young hickory plantations; (2) the areas of hickory plantations
   increased from 157.6 km(2) in 1985 to 528.5 km(2) in 2015 with the
   highest average annual increase rate of 25.3 km(2) in 2000-2005 and
   mainly at the cost of coniferous forests, followed by shrub and
   broadleaf forests; and (3) the MaxEnt model can be effectively used to
   evaluate suitability for hickory plantations. Three suitability
   levels-highly suitable, moderately suitable, and marginally
   suitable-were grouped. The mature hickory forests in 1985 had a higher
   proportion at the highly suitable level than the expanded hickory
   plantations between 1985 and 2015. This research provides important
   results for local governments and farmers to improve the management of
   young hickory plantations. The approach used in this research may be
   used for evaluation of land suitability for other cash forests such as
   Torreya.},

Title = {Financing urban development, three business models: Johannesburg,
   Shanghai and London},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN PLANNING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in
   urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of
   which bring new business logics into the production of the built
   environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban
   projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban
   expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors
   and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political
   contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to
   fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance
   arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics.
   However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of
   these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as
   contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation.
   As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban
   outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore
   broaden the discussion from globalised processes of
   ``financialisation{''} to consider three large-scale urban development
   projects from the perspective of their distinctive ``business
   models{''}, including their place in achieving wider strategic
   objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often
   bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of
   financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang,
   Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of
   Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development
   seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park
   Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation,
   associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport
   investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in
   relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with
   the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of
   governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move
   beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider
   accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and
   calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic
   analytical conversation about the implications of different business
   models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban
   development projects.},

Title = {Digital assessments of soil organic carbon storage using digital maps
   provided by static and dynamic environmental covariates},
Journal = {SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {948-974},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Understanding the vertical and lateral distribution of soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is indispensable for
   soil use and environmental management because of their vital role in
   soil quality assessments. Primarily, they are needed in calculating soil
   organic carbon storage (SOCS). The objective of this research was to
   provide digital maps of SOC and SOCD variation as well as their
   uncertainties at multiple standardized depths (H1: 0-5, H2: 5-15, H3:
   15-30, H4: 30-60 and H5: 60-100 cm) using a parsimonious model with
   optimized terrain-related attributes and satellite-derived data. SOCS
   were evaluated at soil subgroup levels. An area of about 808 km(2) with
   varying elevation, plant cover and lithology from the Miandoab region,
   West Azerbaijan Province, Iran was selected as a case study area. A
   total of 386 soil samples were collected from 104 profiles comprising
   various soil genetic horizons. A continuous spline function was then
   fitted to the target properties in advance of creating a dataset at five
   standard depth intervals (following the GlobalSoilMap project). These
   were then grouped into three classes including top (H1), middle (H2, H3
   and H4) and bottom (H5) depths to ease interpretation. Static and
   dynamic covariates (30-m resolution) were derived from a digital
   elevation model (DEM) and a suite of Landsat-8 spectral imageries,
   respectively. Four candidate models including stepwise multiple linear
   regression (SMLR), random forest (RF), cubist (CU) and extreme gradient
   boosting (XGBoost) Tree were tested in this study. Finally, the digital
   maps at 30-m resolution of SOC and SOCD and their uncertainties were
   prepared using the best-fit model and the bootstrapping method,
   respectively. Four soil subgroups (Gypsic Haploxerepts, Typic
   Calcixerepts, Typic Haploxerepts and Xeric Haplocalcids) were identified
   across the study area. The covariates had variable contributions on the
   evaluated models. The XGBoost Tree model generally outperformed other
   models for prediction of SOC and SOCD (R-2 = 0.60, on average).
   Regardless of soil subgroups, the uncertainty analysis showed that the
   SOCD map had a low prediction interval range value indicating high
   accuracy. Additionally, the highest SOCS and SOCD was observed at the
   top followed by middle and bottom depths in the study area. All
   subgroups exhibited a decreasing trend of SOCD with increasing depth. A
   similar trend was also observed for SOCS. The highest SOCD (on average)
   was observed in Gypsic Haploxerepts (4.71 kg C/m(2)) followed by Typic
   Calcixerepts (4.46 kg C/m(2)), Typic Haploxerepts (4.45 kg C/m(2)) and
   Xeric Haplocalcids (4.40 kg C/m(2)). Overall, the SOCS normalized by
   area within soil order boundaries was greater in Inceptisols than
   Aridisols across the study area. The findings of this study provide
   critical information for sustainable management of soil resources in the
   area for agricultural production and environmental health in the
   Miandoab region of Iran.},

Title = {Torrential Hazard Prevention in Alpine Small Basin through Historical,
   Empirical and Geomorphological Cross Analysis in NW Italy},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Debris flow is one of the most dangerous natural processes in mountain
   regions and it occur in a wide variety of environments throughout the
   world. In the Italian Alps, some tens of thousands of damaging debris
   flow and, in general, torrential floods associated to intense sediment
   transport in secondary catchments have been documented in the last 300
   years. These have caused socio-economic damage, damage to anthropogenic
   structures or infrastructures and in many cases casualties. Often, in
   the same basins, the occurrence of debris-flow processes recurs many
   years later. Prediction can often be spatial and based on the magnitude
   of the largest known process, while the temporal forecast is the most
   uncertain. It is also possible to increase the resilience of the
   population and of the territory. The present study aims at investigating
   different levels of debris-flow hazard in urban areas on Alpine alluvial
   fans and proposes a strategy for debris-flow prevention based on
   historical research and on a simplified analytical approach, methods
   that also involve relatively low costs. For such analysis, Ischiator
   stream catchment (ca. 20 km(2)) and its alluvial fan (NW Italy) were
   selected. This area was partly affected by historical torrential flood
   associated to intense sediment transport and debris-flow processes.
   Present-day instability conditions along the slope and the stream
   network were detected and synthesized through surveys and aerial photo
   interpretation integrated by satellite images (period 1954-2021). An
   estimation of the potential amount of moving detritus, referred to as
   debris flow, was carried out regarding the June 1957 debris-flow event,
   based on the predictive models. The individual hazard index value was
   estimated based on different methods. The results indicate that 56\% of
   the area is exposed to flood associated to intense sediment transport
   hazard, which fluctuates from high to very high levels; such results are
   supported by debris-flow historical records. Since today almost half of
   the settlement (Bagni di Vinadio) is located on potentially risk-exposed
   areas, the urban evolution policy adopted after the 1957 event failed to
   manage the risk connection to debris-flow activity.},

Title = {Probabilistic seasonal dengue forecasting in Vietnam: A modelling study
   using superensembles},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background
   With enough advanced notice, dengue outbreaks can be mitigated. As a
   climate-sensitive disease, environmental conditions and past patterns of
   dengue can be used to make predictions about future outbreak risk. These
   predictions improve public health planning and decision-making to
   ultimately reduce the burden of disease. Past approaches to dengue
   forecasting have used seasonal climate forecasts, but the predictive
   ability of a system using different lead times in a year-round
   prediction system has been seldom explored. Moreover, the transition
   from theoretical to operational systems integrated with disease control
   activities is rare.
   Methods and findings
   We introduce an operational seasonal dengue forecasting system for
   Vietnam where Earth observations, seasonal climate forecasts, and lagged
   dengue cases are used to drive a superensemble of probabilistic dengue
   models to predict dengue risk up to 6 months ahead. Bayesian
   spatiotemporal models were fit to 19 years (2002-2020) of dengue data at
   the province level across Vietnam. A superensemble of these models then
   makes probabilistic predictions of dengue incidence at various future
   time points aligned with key Vietnamese decision and planning deadlines.
   We demonstrate that the superensemble generates more accurate
   predictions of dengue incidence than the individual models it
   incorporates across a suite of time horizons and transmission settings.
   Using historical data, the superensemble made slightly more accurate
   predictions (continuous rank probability score {[}CRPS] = 66.8, 95\% CI
   60.6-148.0) than a baseline model which forecasts the same incidence
   rate every month (CRPS = 79.4, 95\% CI 78.5-80.5) at lead times of 1 to
   3 months, albeit with larger uncertainty. The outbreak detection
   capability of the superensemble was considerably larger (69\%) than that
   of the baseline model (54.5\%). Predictions were most accurate in
   southern Vietnam, an area that experiences semi-regular seasonal dengue
   transmission. The system also demonstrated added value across multiple
   areas compared to previous practice of not using a forecast. We use the
   system to make a prospective prediction for dengue incidence in Vietnam
   for the period May to October 2020. Prospective predictions made with
   the superensemble were slightly more accurate (CRPS = 110, 95\% CI
   102-575) than those made with the baseline model (CRPS = 125, 95\% CI
   120-168) but had larger uncertainty. Finally, we propose a framework for
   the evaluation of probabilistic predictions. Despite the demonstrated
   value of our forecasting system, the approach is limited by the
   consistency of the dengue case data, as well as the lack of publicly
   available, continuous, and long-term data sets on mosquito control
   efforts and serotype-specific case data.
   Conclusions
   This study shows that by combining detailed Earth observation data,
   seasonal climate forecasts, and state-of-the-art models, dengue
   outbreaks can be predicted across a broad range of settings, with enough
   lead time to meaningfully inform dengue control. While our system omits
   some important variables not currently available at a subnational scale,
   the majority of past outbreaks could be predicted up to 3 months ahead.
   Over the next 2 years, the system will be prospectively evaluated and,
   if successful, potentially extended to other areas and other
   climate-sensitive disease systems.
   Author summary
   Why was this study done?
   A climate-driven dengue early warning system would allow public health
   decision-makers to design, implement, and target timely interventions to
   the most at-risk places.
   Dengue is sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, and
   wind speed. Therefore, a dengue prediction model driven by seasonal
   climate forecasts offers a valuable tool for predicting dengue risk in
   advance.
   What did the researchers do and find?
   We developed a superensemble of probabilistic models to predict dengue
   incidence across Vietnam up to 6 months ahead. The predictive ability of
   the superensemble was assessed using multiple verification metrics and
   compared to a baseline model at multiple lead times, seasons, and
   locations.
   We found that the model superensemble generated more accurate
   predictions than the baseline model 1 to 3 months ahead but not 4 to 6
   months ahead.
   The model superensemble, however, was better able to predict outbreaks
   than the baseline model across all lead times.
   The predictive ability of the model varied with geographic location,
   forecast horizon, and time of the year and performed best in the peak
   season in areas experiencing a high level of transmission.
   What do these findings mean?
   While outbreaks of infectious diseases are difficult to predict,
   particularly several months ahead, model superensembles, which combine
   multiple climatic drivers with dengue surveillance data at the time of
   forecast issue date, provide a useful decision-support tool.
   Early warning systems driven by seasonal climate forecasts could shift
   dengue control towards a more preventative approach, guiding bespoke and
   targeted public health interventions and a more efficient allocation of
   scarce resources.},

Abstract = {One problem during offshore well-test operations, stimulations, and
   routine workovers are discharges into the air and sea while flaring.
   These procedures are usually performed by mobile drilling rigs with no
   storage capacity, and thus, hydrocarbons sequestered must be burned off
   from the rig flare booms. Another major problem has been the inability
   of the flare to operate at high flow rates. Because the burning process
   slows the pace of a test, restricting full flow testing, valuable well
   information is lost. Flaring of hydrocarbons also represents an economic
   loss. In the case of oil rigs, for example, flaring not only emits CO2
   into the atmosphere but also burns off usable oil.
   The Crystal Sea well-test vessel was designed to address the problems
   inherent to flaring and, at the same time, provide cost efficiency by
   salvaging usable oil during well testing. The success of her initial two
   jobs on the Statfjord North satellite field in the Norwegian sector of
   the North Sea confirms that sale of the salvaged oil normally lost
   during the flaring process could generate sufficient economic return to
   pay for the vessel. In addition, with its capability to receive products
   at twice the flow rate of conventional methods, the increased accuracy
   of the technical information obtained from the well test further
   enhances its value for improved reservoir management.},

Journal = {NEMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {891-894},
Abstract = {Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) have gained importance due to
   their widespread distribution, their host range and damage potential
   (Hussey \& Janssen, 2002). A recent survey on root-knot nematodes in
   Europe by Wesemael et al. (2011) showed that out of the 90 species
   described so far, 23 have been found in Europe. Furthermore, this survey
   showed that three species, namely Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria and
   M. javanica, are the most prevalent in southern European countries and
   in protected cultivation systems in the northern parts of Europe. These
   species can cause significant economic losses due to yield and quality
   reduction on high value crops. Rootknot nematode species are normally
   identified using morphological features and morphometrics on
   second-stage juveniles (J2), males, on the perineal patterns of mature
   females or isozyme phenotyping of females (Hunt \& Handoo, 2009). As the
   J2 stage is readily available from soil, and identifying this stage is
   most useful for making appropriate management decisions, several
   molecular methods, such as the use of restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms (RFLP), satellite DNA probes, sequence characterised
   amplified regions (SCAR) and real-time PCR assays, have become the
   preferred method for identification (Blok \& Powers, 2009). However, few
   of these methods enable the simultaneous identification of several
   nematode species within one sample.},

Abstract = {Numerous researches have been published on the application of landslide
   susceptibility assessment models; however, they were only applied in the
   same areas as the models were originated, the effect of applying the
   models to other areas than the origin of the models has not been
   explored. This study is purposed to develop an optimized random forest
   (RF) model with best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and then
   explore its generalization ability not only in the area where the model
   is originated but also in area other than the origin of the model. Two
   typical counties (Fengjie County and Wushan County) in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir area, China, which have the same terrain and geological
   conditions, were selected as an example. To begin with, landslide
   inventory was prepared based on field investigations, satellite images,
   and historical records, and 1 522 landslides were then identified in
   Fengjie County. 22 landslide-conditioning factors under the influence of
   topography, geology, environmental conditions, and human activities were
   prepared. Then, combined with 10-fold cross-validation, three typical
   ratios of positive-to-negative cells, i.e., 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10, were
   adopted for comparative analyses. An optimized RF model (Fengjie-based
   model) with the best ratios of positive-to-negative cells and 10-fold
   cross-validation was constructed. Finally, the Fengjie-based model was
   applied to Fengjie County and Wushan County, and the confusion matrix
   and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value
   (AUC) were used to estimate the accuracy. The Fengjie-based model
   delivered high stability and predictive capability in Fengjie County,
   indicating a great generalization ability of the model to the area where
   the model is originated. The LSM in Wushan County generated by the
   Fengjie-based model had a reasonable reference value, indicating the
   Fengjie-based model had a great generalization ability in area other
   than the origin of the model. The Fengjie-based model in this study
   could be applied in other similar areas/countries with the same terrain
   and geological conditions, and a LSM may be generated without collecting
   landslide information for modeling, so as to reduce workload and improve
   efficiency in practice.},

Abstract = {We conducted a satellite tracking study of the endangered short-tailed
   albatross (Phoebastria albatrus) to determine post-breeding season
   distribution, the amount of time spent within exclusive economic zones
   of Pacific Rim countries, and assess factors affecting spatial and
   temporal overlap with commercial fisheries in Alaska. We obtained 6709
   locations for 14 albatrosses (131-808 locations and 51-138 days of
   tracking per bird). Albatrosses ranged widely throughout the North
   Pacific Rim, spending the majority of time within the exclusive
   economics zones of Japan, Russia (Kuril Islands and Kamchatka
   Peninsula), and the United States (Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea,
   Alaska). We found evidence for gender and age-related differences in
   distribution and, therefore, potential interaction with regional
   fisheries. Overall, albatrosses spent the greatest proportion of time
   within the Alaska exclusive economic zone. Within Alaska, albatrosses
   occurred most frequently in fishery management zones that encompassed
   the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, and south of the Alaska Peninsula.
   Short-tailed albatrosses had the greatest potential overlap with
   fisheries that occurred along continental shelf break and slope regions,
   e.g., longlining for sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), where albatrosses
   occurred most often. Some birds, however, also made frequent excursions
   onto the extensive Bering Sea shelf, suggesting significant potential
   for interactions with the large-scale walleye pollock (Theragra
   chalcogramma) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) fisheries. Alaskan
   longline fishing fleets have been proactive in using seabird deterrent
   devices, however, our data further emphasize that such efforts beyond
   the Alaska exclusive economic zone would provide a greater conservation
   benefit for this species. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Electricity power supply in remote communities and towns are
   traditionally and hitherto supplied by diesel generator sets of varying
   capacities and sizes from few kilowatt to few megawatts. Its proven to
   be versatile, robust, modular, cheaper capital investment, reliable and
   easy to operate and maintain. These features are what make diesel
   generators most preferref choice for generating electric power to power
   hungry remote communities.
   The maindrawback, though, is its increasingly high cost of operation and
   maintenance, largely due to upward trend in the cost of diesel fuel,
   high cost of engines spare parts plus the inflationary nature of salary
   and wages of operators. For these reasons, engineers and technologists
   have for years worked tirelessly to find ways and means to reduce the O
   \& M costs. One of the novel ideas was to hybrid the conventional diesel
   generating system with renewable energy resources, such as mini hydro,
   solar photovoltaic or wind energy. Many prototypes involving severeral
   configurations of energy resources eg diesel/PV/battery,
   diesel/wind/battery, diesel/ minihydro/battey have been tested but none
   has so far has been as successful as SMA/Powercorp's automated
   Intelligent Power System (IPS).
   Based on microprocessor hardware, powerful computer software programming
   and satellite communication technology, the IPS-equipped diesel power
   station can now now be operated fully automatic with capability of
   remote control and monitoring. The system is versatile in maximising the
   use of renewable energy energy resources such as wind, mini hydro or
   solar thereby reducing very significantly the use of diesel fuel.
   Operation and maintenance costs also are reduced due to the use of
   minimum manpower and and increase in fuel efficiency of the engines.
   The tested and proven IPS technology has been operating successfully for
   the last ten years in remote diesel stations in Northern Territory,
   Australia, Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland and its latest and biggest
   system is the 5 MW diesel /minihydro stations in Sabah, Malaysia. This
   technology had brought about radical transformation in the ways remote
   diesel satations are operated and maintained not only in alleviating
   environmental damages related to diesel generation but also in improving
   the occupational health and safety of diesel enegines operators.
   This paper discusses the installation of IPS technology in a local
   electricity grid powered by multidiesel sets and minihydro machines, in
   Ranau/Kundasang, Sabah. The drastic system improvement and significant
   cost savings the system have entailed, have convinced the electric
   utility of its effectiveness and reliability.
   Finally, we believe strongly that Ips technology will pave way for
   modernisation of diesel-based remote power generating station in
   Malaysia, and elsewhere in other developing countries.},

Title = {Coastal wetlands of the northern Gulf of California: inventory and
   conservation status},

Year = {2006},

Abstract = {1. Above 28 degrees N, the coastline of the northern Gulf of California
   is indented Lit frequent intervals by negative or inverse estuaries that
   are saltier at their backs than at their Mouths due to the lack of
   freshwater inflow. These `esteros' total over 215000 ha in area and
   encompass mangrove marshes below 29 degrees N and saltgrass (Distichlis
   palmeri) marshes north of 29 degrees N. An additional 6000 ha of
   freshwater and brackish wetlands are found in the Colorado River delta
   where fresh water enters the interticial zone.
   2. The mangrove marshes in the Gulf of California have been afforded
   some degree of protected status in Mexico, but the northern saltgrass
   esteros do not have priority conservation status and are increasingly
   becoming development targets for resorts, vacation homes and aquaculture
   sites.
   3. We conducted an inventory of the marshes using aerial photography and
   satellite images, and evaluated the extent and type of development on
   each marsh. We reviewed the available literature on the marshes to
   document their vegetation types, and ecological functions in the
   adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
   4. Over 95\% of the mangrove marshes have been developed for shrimp
   fanning. However, the farms are built adjacent to, rather than in, the
   marshes, and the mangrove stands are still mostly intact.
   5. The majority of saltgrass marshes above the mangrove line are still
   relatively unspoiled. However, resort and Vacation home development is
   taking place on land Surrounding them.
   6. We recommend a system of protected reserves incorporating the
   pristine wetlands, along with water quality management and buffer zones
   For the more developed esteros. The saltgrass marshes should be
   considered for conservation protection, similar to the protection given
   to the Southern mangrove marshes whose Value has already been
   recognized. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In situ PM2.5 concentration observations have long been used as critical
   data sources in haze-related studies. Due to the frequently occurring
   haze pollution events, China started to regularly monitor PM2.5
   concentration nationwide from the newly established air quality
   monitoring network in 2013. Nevertheless, the acquisition of these
   invaluable air quality samples is challenging given the absence of a
   publicly available data download interface. In this study, we provided a
   homogenized in situ PM2.5 concentration dataset that was created on the
   basis of hourly PM2.5 data retrieved from the China National
   Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC) via a web crawler between 2015
   and 2019. Methods involving missing value imputation, change point
   detection, and bias adjustment were applied sequentially to deal with
   data gaps and inhomogeneities in raw PM2.5 observations. After excluding
   records with limited samples, a homogenized PM2.5 concentration dataset
   comprising of 1309 5-year long PM2.5 data series at a daily resolution
   was eventually compiled. This is the first attempt to homogenize in situ
   PM2.5 observations in China. The trend estimations derived from the
   homogenized dataset indicate a spatially homogeneous decreasing tendency
   of PM2.5 across China at a mean rate of about 7.6\% per year from 2015
   to 2019. In contrast to raw PM2.5 observations, the homogenized data
   record not only has complete data integrity but is more consistent over
   space and time. This homogenized daily in situ PM2.5 concentration
   dataset is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.917557
   (Bai et al., 2020a) and can be applied as a promising dataset for
   PM2.5-related studies such as satellite-based PM2.5 mapping, human
   exposure risk assessment, and air quality management.},

Abstract = {The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal (Hemiptera:
   Pentatomidae), is native to Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. Its
   dispersion from Asia to the United States of America and Europe caused
   serious damage to fruit, vegetables, and high-value crops. In Greece,
   damages are reported in kiwi orchards in the regions of Pieria and
   Imathia, which are the main production areas of kiwifruit. Greek
   kiwifruit production is expected to increase twofold within the next
   years. The aim of this research is to study the terrain and canopy
   properties that may have an impact on the development of H. halys
   populations. Thus, five kiwi orchards in total were selected in the
   regions of Pieria and Imathia. \& tau;en traps were installed from early
   June to late October within each selected kiwi orchard-two types of
   traps at every side of the orchards and the center. The installed traps
   were examined weekly and the number of the captured H. halys was
   recorded. During the same days, sentinel satellite images were analyzed
   to calculate the vegetation index, NDVI (Normalised Difference
   Vegetation Index), and NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index). The
   results showed population variability within the kiwi orchards since the
   population of H. halys was higher in areas with high NDVI and NDWI
   values. Additionally, our research revealed that H. halys prefers to
   develop populations at higher altitudes at both regional and field
   scales. The results of this research can be used to reduce damages by H.
   halys in kiwi orchards using different rates of pesticides depending on
   the prediction of the population size. There are multiple benefits of
   the proposed practice, such as a reduction in the production cost of
   kiwifruits, an increase in farmers' profit, and environmental
   protection.},

Title = {Study on Spatial-Temporal Change of Urban Green Space in Yangtze River

Abstract = {Urban green space plays an important role in beautifying the
   environment, improving the quality of life of residents, and promoting
   sustainable urban development. Rapid urbanization has led to great
   changes in the spatial structure and layout of urban green space. It is
   urgent to put forward the sustainable development strategy of green
   space through the research on the change of urban green space. Based on
   the geographical spatial differences of urban green space and
   integrating the factors of economy, society, industry, land use, and the
   environment, we constructed a research framework of
   ``space-supply-demand{''} integration of urban green space by GI and
   geodetector methods, and we conducted an empirical study on the
   spatial-temporal changes of urban green space and its driving mechanism
   in prefecture-level cities along the Yangtze River Economic Belt in
   China. First, the urban green space along the Yangtze River Economic
   Belt is concentrated in spatial distribution, while uneven development
   appears in urban greening among the zones. Second, the influence of
   different factors on urban green space change varies greatly and can be
   divided into three types: key factors, important factors, and auxiliary
   factors. The driving mechanism of the spatial distribution of urban
   green space supply and demand is quite different, but urban population
   and commercial service facilities land are their key influence factors,
   having a comprehensive influence on the spatial-temporal changes of
   urban green space. Third, the factors are classified into three
   categories of high, medium, and low levels according to the mean of
   interacting forces; in particular, the factors of per capita GDP,
   utility land, industrial smoke (dust) emissions, and other factors have
   a very strong interactive effect with other factors. Fourth, according
   to the spatial distribution characteristics of urban green space and its
   driving mechanism, this paper puts forward planning and policy
   suggestions, providing reference for other areas to deal with the green
   space change.},

Abstract = {This article describes a spatial prediction method that predicts the
   monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly field from the land only
   data. The land data are from the Global Historical Climatology Network
   (GHCN). The prediction period is 1880-1999 and the prediction ocean
   domain extends from 60degreesS to 60degreesN with a spatial resolution
   5degrees x 5degrees. The prediction method is a regression over the
   basis of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), The EOFs are computed
   from the following data sets: (a) the Climate Prediction Center's
   optimally interpolated sea surface temperature (OI/SST) data
   (1982-1999); (b) the National Climatic Data Center's blended product of
   land-surface air temperature (1992-1999) produced from combining the
   Special Satellite Microwave Imager and GHCN: and (c) the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research Reanalysis data (1982-1999). The optimal prediction method
   minimizes the first-M-mode mean square error between the true and
   predicted anomalies over both land and ocean. In the optimization
   process, the data errors of the GHCN boxes are used, and their
   contribution to the prediction error is taken into account. The
   area-averaued root mean square error of prediction is calculated.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate that this EOF prediction method can
   accurately recover the global SST anomalies during some circulation
   patterns and add value to the SST bias correction in the early history
   of SST observations and the validation of general circulation models.
   Our results show that (i) the land only data can accurately predict the
   SST anomaly in the El Nino months when the temperature anomaly structure
   has very large correlation scales, and (ii) the predictions for La Nina,
   neutral. or transient months require more EOF modes because of the
   presence of the small scale structures in the anomaly field. Copyright

Title = {Low efficiency of large volcanic eruptions in transporting very fine ash
   into the atmosphere},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Volcanic ash clouds are common, often unpredictable, phenomena generated
   during explosive eruptions. Mainly composed of very fine ash particles,
   they can be transported in the atmosphere at great distances from the
   source, having detrimental socio-economic impacts. However, proximal
   settling processes controlling the proportion (epsilon) of the very fine
   ash fraction distally transported in the atmosphere are still poorly
   understood. Yet, for the past two decades, some operational
   meteorological agencies have used a default value of epsilon = 5\% as
   input for forecast models of atmospheric ash cloud concentration. Here
   we show from combined satellite and field data of sustained eruptions
   that e actually varies by two orders of magnitude with respect to the
   mass eruption rate. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that the most intense
   eruptions are in fact the least efficient (with epsilon = 0.1\%) in
   transporting very fine ash through the atmosphere. This implies that the
   amount of very fine ash distally transported in the atmosphere is up to
   50 times lower than previously anticipated. We explain this finding by
   the efficiency of collective particle settling in ash-rich clouds which
   enhance early and en masse fallout of very fine ash. This suggests that
   proximal sedimentation during powerful eruptions is more controlled by
   the concentration of ash than by the grain size. This has major
   consequences for decision-makers in charge of air traffic safety
   regulation, as well as for the understanding of proximal settling
   processes. Finally, we propose a new statistical model for predicting
   the source mass eruption rate with an unprecedentedly low level of
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The transformation of resource-based cities and coordinated regional
   development are of great value to global urbanization and sustainable
   economic development in developing countries. Based on Landsat satellite
   monitoring data and urban economic data, statistical analysis and
   geospatial model were used to analyze the characteristics of urban
   development in urban agglomeration in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020,
   and the influencing mechanism was quantitatively revealed. The results
   show that the expansion of urban agglomerations rate reached its peak
   from 2005 to 2010, and then the expansion rate continued to decline. The
   resources of central cities were concentrated, while the development of
   sub-central cities was weak. The overall urbanization rate slows down,
   the scale difference between high-order cities and low-order cities
   expands, and the regional urban system shifts from balanced development
   to polarized development. The overall development of urban
   agglomerations shows a centripetal agglomeration characteristic centered
   on the Harbin Changchun-Daqing and Central and southern Liaoning
   Economic belt. Its west expands faster than the East, and its south
   expands faster than the north. The driving factors of urban
   agglomeration development are mainly administrative power, followed by
   market power, external power and weak internal power. From the point of
   time and space, the external power is on the rise, while the internal
   power is affected by the industrial adjustment and lacks the staying
   power. In view of the coordinated development of resource-based cities,
   this paper proposes to establish the linkage and coordination mechanism
   of integrated development of urban agglomeration, speed up the
   construction of unified market system, carry out transformation

Title = {Evaluation of the Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance Algorithm
   for Large-Scale Mangrove Classification},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests are of high biological, economic, and ecological
   importance globally. Growing within the intertidal zone, they are
   particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change in addition to
   being threatened on local scales by over-exploitation and aquaculture
   expansion. Long-term monitoring of global mangrove populations is
   therefore highly important to understanding the impact of these threats.
   However, data availability from satellites is often limited due to cloud
   cover. This problem can be mitigated using a season-trend modelling
   approach such as Continuous Monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD). COLD
   operates by using every available observation on a pixel-wise basis,
   removing the need for whole cloud free images. The approach can be used
   to better classify land cover by taking into account the underlying
   seasonal variability, and can also be used to extrapolate between data
   points to obtain more accurate long term trends. To demonstrate the
   utility of COLD for global mangrove monitoring, we applied it to five
   study sites chosen to represent a range of mangrove species, forest
   types, and quantities of available data. The COLD classifier was trained
   on the Global Mangrove Watch 2010 dataset and applied to 30 years of
   Landsat data for each site. By increasing the period between model
   updates, COLD was successfully applied to all five sites (2253 scenes)
   in less than four days. The method achieved an overall accuracy of 92\%
   with a User's accuracy of 77\% and a Dice score of 0.84 for the mangrove
   class. The lowest User's accuracy was for North Kalimantan (49.9\%) due
   to confusion with mangrove palms. However, the method performed
   extremely well for the Niger Delta from the 2000s onwards (93.6\%)
   despite the absence of any Landsat 5 data. Observation of trends in
   mangrove extent over time suggests that the method was able to
   accurately capture changes in extent caused by the 2014/15 mangrove
   die-back event in the Gulf of Carpentaria and highlighted a net loss of
   mangroves in the Matang Forest Reserve over the last two decades,
   despite ongoing management. COLD is therefore a promising methodology
   for global, long-term monitoring of mangrove extent and trends.},

Abstract = {The expansion of terrestrial applications including location-based
   services and transportation means such as road or train has fostered the
   design of complex location systems to comply with the needs of these
   applications. In the frame of the service provision ensured by the
   application towards a user or an external entity, these location systems
   are in charge of providing a consolidated information based on the
   position of one or more mobile platforms.
   The complexity of the information reported depends on the type of
   service targeted. It can range from a simple position reporting in the
   case of a low end asset management, to the provision of a reliable
   information (e.g. authenticated and with a mastered uncertainty) on the
   mobile's trajectory for liability critical services such as road
   charging or Intelligent Transport System (ITS). This wide spectrum of
   required technical features calls for a new and broader concept at
   location system level taking into account hybrid solutions in which the
   use of GNSS technologies is complemented with other technology sensors
   to improve the robustness and the performance of the solution.
   Several standards have been generated by different dedicated bodies, in
   order to support the GNSS market development across the various
   application domains mentioned above. For instance, 3GPP Location
   Services (LCS) standards provide minimum performance requirements mainly
   for Assisted-GNSS in the frame of terrestrial telecommunications and
   OMA-LOC LPPe (LTE Positioning Protocol Extensions) defines a
   communication protocol supporting hybridised positioning.
   Nevertheless, there is still a lack of performance specification for a
   large number of terrestrial applications (e.g. electronic fee
   collection, fleet management, container tracking.), including
   multi-modal applications (i.e. those involving various means of
   transport), leading to the development and use of sub-optimal GNSS-based
   systems and solutions.
   The need to unify the different initiatives by concentrating the
   positioning-related standardisation effort for terrestrial applications
   within a single dedicated entity was identified some time ago
   Accordingly, an initiative triggered by a number of industrial and
   institutional stakeholders materialized in the frame of the European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). This initiative is led by
   the group Satellite Communication and Navigation (SCN) of the Technical
   Committee Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (TC SES), the main
   objective being to elaborate a firm and common standard for GNSS-based
   Location systems. Up to now, the TC-SES has already approved end of 2012
   two Technical Reports related to architectures and application inventory
   which paved the way for the technical specifications to be developed.
   The present paper provides an overview of this on-going standardisation
   work, its objectives and the added-value it will bring. In addition, the
   already approved Technical Specifications will also be presented.
   Thus, the structure of the targeted standard encompasses the four
   following specifications:
   The location system minimum performance requirements, which can be
   considered as the core of the specification work. These requirements are
   determined function of the type of location systems (i.e. association of
   technical enablers), the applicable environmental conditions (depending
   on the type of application), and finally the type of features needed
   (e.g. accuracy, authentication, anti-spoofing, robustness to
   interference).
   The GNSS-based location system reference architecture including the
   interface definition, which is expected to capture a generic and modular
   definition of location systems, thus adaptable to all targeted
   applications.
   The data exchange protocol at location system level (covering in
   particular the handling of the requests from an external application
   provider and the protocol to ensure proper information delivery).
   The test specification (including procedure, scenario and data),
   enabling location system validation versus the previous requirements
   (protocol and performance).
   The methodology used to define the perimeter of the above specifications
   looks for:
   The definition of terrestrial application classes to be covered by the
   standard, including the identification of the key requirements
   (functional and performance) applicable for each application.
   The inventory of the technological enablers taken onboard in the
   standard. These enablers are understood as much as sensor technologies
   (GNSS receivers, Network sensors, inertial sensors, hybridization
   layer), as system layer features allowing Quality of Service (QoS)
   improvements (A-GNSS, D-GNSS, RTK, integrity functions, authentication
   functions).
   The definition of reference environments, derived from the applications'
   typical use cases, and which provide the necessary conditions to
   determine the minimum performance requirements.
   With the ambition to satisfy a wide range of terrestrial applications,
   the standard under preparation, once approved, will surely benefit to
   other standardization groups. Indeed, care is being taken to harmonize
   the work done under TC SES SCN, with standardisation groups in other
   domains. Furthermore, it will also be valuable to actors from markets
   whose specificities do not justify the existence of a dedicated
   standard. All these stakeholders will thus benefit from a more important
   variety of solutions, components and functions available, all of them
   simultaneously compatible to the standard.},

Abstract = {The current work is aimed to realizing land suitability and water use
   efficiency and determining the optimum land use system. The main aims
   were to identify the physiographic futures and calculate the crop water
   requirements for specific crops. The study area was observed through a
   soil survey inventory in Paris Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt. Ten soil
   profiles plus a number of auger observations and mini pits were selected
   to represent the different mapping units. A fieldwork and morphological
   description were carried out, and soil samples were collected for
   demonstrating the physical and chemical soil properties. Based on
   satellite data that can integrate with GIS utility, field work, and
   laboratory analysis, the physiographic map was generated. The study
   found that the main land type units are plateaus, hills, dunes, and
   depression floor. Concerning the second aim, the main land qualities of
   different mapping units were rated and matched to obtain the current and
   potential land suitability using automated land evaluation system. This
   research concluded that the best crops adapted with the soil conditions
   and could be feasible for economic use are clover, wheat, beans, sugar
   beet, onions, maize, sunflower, tomato, potato, groundnut, pea, lentil,
   barley, sesame, and carrots. Crop water requirements were determined in
   variable rate according to the actual plant requirements using the aid
   of FAO-Cropwat model. Irrigation schedule and consumptive use of
   suitable crops were calculated and adopted. The crop water requirements
   for each selected crop were determined as follow: 828.0, 596.7, 410.3,
   679.95, 409.52, 791.60, 712.2, 902.93, 456.55, 529.95, 231.4, 217.95,

Abstract = {Geomagnetic storms play a critical role in space weather physics with
   the potential for far reaching economic impacts including power grid
   outages, air traffic rerouting, satellite damage and GPS disruption. The
   LFM-MIX is a state-of-the-art coupled magnetospheric-ionospheric model
   capable of simulating geomagnetic storms. Imbedded in this model are
   physical equations for turning the magnetohydrodynamic state parameters
   into energy and flux of electrons entering the ionosphere, involving a
   set of input parameters. The exact values of these input parameters in
   the model are unknown, and we seek to quantify the uncertainty about
   these parameters when model output is compared to observations. The
   model is available at different fidelities: a lower fidelity which is
   faster to run, and a higher fidelity but more computationally intense
   version. Model output and observational data are large spatiotemporal
   systems; the traditional design and analysis of computer experiments is
   unable to cope with such large data sets that involve multiple
   fidelities of model output. We develop an approach to this inverse
   problem for large spatiotemporal data sets that incorporates two
   different versions of the physical model. After an initial design, we
   propose a sequential design based on expected improvement. For the
   LFM-MIX, the additional run suggested by expected improvement diminishes
   posterior uncertainty by ruling out a posterior mode and shrinking the
   width of the posterior distribution. We also illustrate our approach
   using the Lorenz `96 system of equations for a simplified atmosphere,
   using known input parameters. For the Lorenz `96 system, after
   performing sequential runs based on expected improvement, the posterior
   mode converges to the true value and the posterior variability is
   reduced.},

Abstract = {Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the
   European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land
   component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5),
   hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered
   will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support
   land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the
   water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the
   production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends
   and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical
   integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled
   meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an
   elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land
   shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use
   of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical
   weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared
   to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is
   enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km
   (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5.
   Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or
   satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in
   the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced
   soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of
   river discharge estimations with available observations. However,
   ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to
   those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The
   description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5.
   Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square
   error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly
   due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is
   important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has
   extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month
   delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in
   production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn
   2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its
   extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a
   valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and
   climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water
   resource, land, and environmental management.},

Title = {Rapid assessment of biological richness in a part of Eastern Himalaya:
   an integrated three-tier approach},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {207},
Number = {3},
Pages = {363-384},

Abstract = {Biodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single
   or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its
   environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an
   ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging
   implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity
   attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical,
   economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative
   importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest
   vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized
   software, Bio\_CAP Higher biological richness was assigned to the
   habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem
   uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and
   (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated `three-tier
   modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited
   field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid
   assessment of biological richness.
   Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach
   provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to
   ecological habitats), with 89\% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done
   using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and
   evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for
   deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of
   juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e.,
   proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape
   parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in
   turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species
   diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients
   were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species
   diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and
   biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated
   quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation.
   Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the
   elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to
   Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's
   index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of
   distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was
   presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest
   degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This
   methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest
   managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization
   of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific
   species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Title = {The CanMars Mars Sample Return analogue mission},
Journal = {PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {110-130},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The return of samples from known locations on Mars is among the highest
   priority goals of the international planetary science community. A
   possible scenario for Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a series of 3
   missions: sample cache, fetch, and retrieval. The NASA Mars 2020 mission
   represents the first cache mission and was the focus of the CanMars
   analogue mission described in this paper. The major objectives for
   CanMars included comparing the accuracy of selecting samples remotely
   using rover data versus a traditional human field party, testing the
   efficiency of remote science operations with periodic pre-planned
   strategic observations (Strategic Traverse Days), assessing the utility
   of realistic autonomous science capabilities to the remote science team,
   and investigating the factors that affect the quality of sample
   selection decision-making in light of returned sample analysis.
   CanMars was conducted over two weeks in November 2015 and continued over
   three weeks in October and November 2016 at an analogue site near
   Hanksville, Utah, USA, that was unknown to the Mission Control Team
   located at the University of Western Ontario (Western) in London,
   Ontario, Canada. This operations architecture for CanMars was based on
   the Phoenix and Mars Exploration Rover missions together with previous
   analogue missions led by Western with the Mission Control Team being
   divided into Planning and Science sub-teams. In advance of the 2015
   operations, the Science Team used satellite data, chosen to mimic
   datasets available from Mars-orbiting instruments, to produce a
   predictive geological map for the landing ellipse and a set of
   hypotheses for the geology and astrobiological potential of the landing
   site. The site was proposed to consist of a series of weakly cemented
   multi-coloured sedimentary rocks comprising carbonates, sulfates, and
   clays, and sinuous ridges with a resistant capping unit, interpreted as
   inverted paleochannels.
   Both the 2015 CanMars mission, which achieved 11 sols of operations, and
   the first part of the 2016 mission (sols 12-21), were conducted with the
   Mars Exploration Science Rover (MESR) and a series of integrated and
   hand-held instruments designed to mimic the payload of the Mars 2020
   rover. Part 2 of the 2016 campaign (sols 22-39) was implemented without
   the MESR rover and was conducted exclusively by the field team as a Fast
   Motion Field Test (FMFT) with hand-carried instruments and with the
   equivalent of three sols of operations being executed in a single actual
   day. A total of 8 samples were cached during the 39 sols from which the
   Science Team prioritized 3 for ``return to Earth{''}. Various science
   autonomy capabilities, based on flight proven or near-future techniques
   intended for actual rover missions, were tested throughout the 2016
   CanMars activities, with autonomous geological classification and
   targeting and autonomous pointing refinement being used extensively
   during the FMFT. Blind targeting, contingency sequencing, and
   conditional sequencing were also employed.
   Validation of the CanMars cache mission was achieved through various
   methods and approaches. The use of dedicated documentarians in mission
   control provided a detailed record of how and why decisions were made.
   Multiple separate field validation exercises employing humans using
   traditional geological techniques were carried out. All 8 of the
   selected samples plus a range of samples from the landing site region,
   collected out-of simulation, have been analysed using a range of
   laboratory analytical techniques. A variety of lessons learned for both
   future analogue missions and planetary exploration missions are
   provided, including: dynamic collaboration between the science and
   planning teams as being key for mission success; the more frequent use
   of spectrometers and micro-imagers having remote capabilities rather
   than contact instruments; the utility of strategic traverse days to
   provide additional time for scientific discussion and meaningful
   interpretation of the data; the benefit of walkabout traverse strategies
   along with multi-sol plans with complex decisions trees to acquire a
   large amount of contextual data; and the availability of autonomous
   geological targeting, which enabled complex multi-sol plans gathering
   large suites of geological and geochemical survey data.
   Finally, the CanMars MSR activity demonstrated the utility of analogue
   missions in providing opportunities to engage and educate children and
   the public, by providing tangible hands-on linkages between current
   robotic missions and future human space missions. Public education and
   outreach was a priority for CanMars and a dedicated lead coordinated a
   strong presence on social media (primarily Twitter and Facebook),
   articles in local, regional, and national news networks, and interaction
   with the local community in London, Ontario. A further core objective of
   CanMars was to provide valuable learning opportunities to students and
   post-doctoral fellows in preparation for future planetary exploration
   missions. A learning goals survey conducted at the end of the 2016
   activities had 90\% of participants ``somewhat agreeing{''} or
   ``strongly agreeing{''} that participation in the mission has helped
   them to increase their understanding of the four learning outcomes.},

Title = {An optimisation model for incentivising the development of marginal oil
   and gas fields amidst increasingly complex ownership patterns: UKCS case
   study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many recent discoveries in the UKCS have been economically marginal and
   comparatively small such that they are unable to be developed on a
   standalone basis. Nevertheless, there is a proliferation of production
   facilities and transport infrastructure that can, on accepting a tariff,
   process hydrocarbons from these smaller-sized oil and gas fields,
   thereby contributing to the UK Government's strategy of maximising
   economic recovery (MER). However, the empirical dimensions of
   cost-sharing arrangements between a field owner (host field or hub) and
   tie-in (satellite) fields are not well examined in the literature
   although they influence long-term economics in matured oil provinces. In
   this paper, we develop a mixed integer programming optimisation model to
   analyse how these third-party access to infrastructure issues impact MER
   in the UKCS. A first-best situation with only one regional operator is
   empirically compared with the actual situation of multiple ownership. We
   then assess the impact of different infrastructure unbundling provisions
   via pipeline tariff choices and their interaction with the fiscal regime
   on the net present value (NPV) and other project metrics such as timings
   of hub and field shutdowns. We find that differences in field ownership,
   tariff choice and changes to the fiscal regime impact the overall NPV of
   field developments. Our results also show that having a progressive
   fiscal regime in a mature basin such as the UKCS is important to support
   continued operations under low oil prices while increasing the
   government's take at high prices. The cost-sharing effect shows that
   imposing strict cost-sharing rules does not change overall project
   valuations, even in a low oil price scenario. An additional contribution
   to the extant literature is that tariff determination could be based on
   cost-sharing rules that enjoin each field tieback to a hub to pay a
   split tariff, comprised of a fixed cost of service (access charge) and
   variable (marginal) costs.},

Abstract = {The man-made processes, boosted by the increasingly worldwide need of
   food, fiber, water and shelter, rule the changes of use and land cover
   {[}1]. The deforestation causes the loss of biodiversity and causes
   possible weather impacts {[}2]. With the valuation of natural resources,
   know its allocation in both spatial location and time and know how they
   interact in space is fundamental to create aid mechanisms to decision
   taking as well as planning future development {[}3].
   The spatial modeling simulation help understand the causing mechanisms
   and development processes of environmental systems {[}4]. The spatial
   modeling simulation based on Cellular Automata (CA) have been used for
   assessing complex environmental issues, such as estimate pathways and
   impacts related to the greenhouse gases emissions {[}5], {[}6],
   integrated modeling of population, employment and land-use change {[}7],
   land-use change {[}8], predict possible trends in deforested areas,
   pastures and forests {[}9], among others {[}10].
   This study proposes the development, calibration and outcomes analysis
   of a dynamic spatial modeling simulation Land Use, Land Use Change
   (LULUC), taking into consideration a time period, 1986, 2000 and 2008
   (t(1), t2 and t(3), respectively) where t3 is used to assess quality of
   the simulated map from t(2). Work is focused on reduction rate of the
   forest remaining of Atlantic Rainforest of the Brazilian Municipality of
   Maragogipe located at 82 miles east of the State Capital Salvador in the
   State of Bahia. For so, a modeling platform was used (freeware) based on
   (CA) DINAMICA-EGO (http://www.csr.ufmg.br/dinamica).
   Medium and high resolution satellite images were researched and
   purchased (Landsat-TM and CBERS-2B, sensor CCD; HRC) and other
   cartographical bases correlated to the study area. Information was
   cataloged according to its source, homogenized, and defining the work
   unit: degrees, cartographic and geodetic references, by performing
   conversions and geo-referencing if applicable. Satellite images were
   processed to equalization histogram and radiometric. They were
   classified by using the supervised method and the Bhattacharya
   algorithm. The following classes were identified: rainforest, mangrove,
   grassland, regrow, urban areas and others. The thematic precision was
   assessed with the aid of 300 points acquired in technical visit and by
   high resolution images analyses, in both cases defined at random. The
   descriptive statistics of global accuracy reached the 89\% ratio and the
   Kappa inter-rater agreement: 0.864 number that represents a high
   acceptance level according to scale suggested by Congalton and Green
   {[}3]. The classes were grouped in rainforest and non-rainforest.
   Basically, the model was structured in the software, based on a
   simulation model suggested by Soares-Filho et al. {[}12]. An initial map
   (t(2)) has its classes changed according to change rate ``Transition
   Matrix{''} (TM). TM is the total amount of change for each land cover
   transition type of the maps classified, taking into account the time
   period of the simulation through a cross-tab operation. Such changes
   happen in the most likely areas, defined by the likelihood map,
   resulting from the calculus of Weights of Evidence (WofE). WofE are the
   local odds of a transition land use classes taking into account a range
   of spatial variables by stochastic methods, Bayesian statistical or
   conditional probability. The spatial variables were: altitude, slope,
   soil conditions, conservation areas, distance to major rivers, distance
   to small rivers, distance to urban patches, distance to roads, distance
   to deforestation, and distance to protected areas. In this study,
   analyzed transition was transformation of forest in deforested areas
   (deforestation). Stains of change (landscape disturbance) happened in
   quantity in accordance with TM and had their rate of appearance or
   aggregation according to the values arbitrated to certain software
   function operators, as well as the isometrics of stains. Applied to
   changes, the resulting landscape map was saved at every step of the
   model and retro-fed as initial map in the next step until reaching a
   compatible time variation with t(3), by making possible the validation
   of outcomes. Validation was performed by calculating the similarity
   between the simulated map and the real map (t(3)) based on fuzzy logic,
   applied to a context of pixel vicinity, by means of an exponential decay
   function with an 11-pixel-window.
   By visual analysis (Figure 1), it was noted that the heuristic process
   was successfully designed, as the deforestation standard was respected
   and are congruent with the local probabilities according to the
   likelihood map. The similarity reached by comparison between the model
   outcome and the real map (t(3)) was 46\% of minimal similarity and 77\%
   of maximal similarity.},

Abstract = {The adverse effects of the weed flora on the agricultural yield are well
   documented. In an agro-ecosystem, weed species distribution pattern
   depends on both surrounding environment and farming practices. This
   first ever study was designed to compare and determine the weed species
   richness, distribution pattern and their ecologically meaningful groups
   in wheat and maize field of Gujrat, Pakistan. In this study, seasonal
   variation variable and satellite derived measurements like normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index
   (NDMI) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were calculated for each
   vegetation sample and their contribution towards explaining variations
   in the weed species data was tested by using direct unimodal ordination
   method. Phytosociological data was collected from 50 crop fields (25
   each from wheat and maize fields during winter and monsoon season
   respectively) comprising of 250 sub-samples/plots (size 1 x 1 m) during
   2016. The results of Monte Carlo testing and cluster analysis showed
   that there were four statistically significant weeds groups (i.e. 1.
   Anagallis-Medicago-Phalaris or AMP-Wheat weed group; 2.
   Chenopodium-Convolvulus-Vicia or CCV-Wheat weed group; 3. Cyperus
   Halva-Amaranthus or CMA-Maize weed group; 4. Cannabis-Cynodon-Digera or
   CCD-Maize weed group). A total of 60 weed species were recorded and the
   majority of them belongs to Poaceae and Amaranthaceae families. The
   majority of weed species flowered during monsoon season whereas
   therophytic life form and microphyllous leaf size categories were the
   most dominant The highest mean weed diversity, NDVI and NDMI values were
   recorded for the weed communities of maize fields whereas the higher
   mean TWI value was recorded for the weed groups of wheat fields,
   suggesting strong linkage with the local climatic conditions. Canonical
   correspondence analysis (net effects) suggested that sum of local
   climatic conditions (seasonality variable) was found to be the most
   important in controlling the variations in the weed species data
   followed by longitude and altitude variables and least by the NDVI, NDMI
   and TWI. It is concluded that effective weed management activities are
   required to enhance the yield of these two important crops in the area.
   Thus, further studies related to determination of weed types and their
   distribution pattern by using factors like fertilization (type, timing,
   quantity), wheat and maize cultivar, land preparation (types, timing and
   intensities), soil management, pesticides (usage, type, quantity,
   quality), irrigation (type like rain-fed, tube-well, canals; timing,
   quantity), socio-economic and anthropogenic activities, and their
   relationship with the yield variable on temporal and spatial scales are
   recommended for this agro-ecosystem of the study area.},

Title = {Forest Fire Susceptibility Zonation in Eastern India Using Statistical
   and Weighted Modelling Approaches},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recurring forest fires disturb ecological balance, impact socio-economic
   harmony, and raise global concern. This study implements multiple
   statistical and weighted modelling approaches to identify forest fire
   susceptibility zones in Eastern India. Six models, namely, Frequency
   Ratio (FR), Certainty Factor (CF), Natural Risk Factor (NRF), Bivariate
   statistical (Wi and Wf), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and
   Logistic Regression (LR) were used in the study. Forest fire inventory
   (2001 to 2018) mapping was done using forest fire points captured by the
   MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. Fire
   responsible components, namely, topography (which has four variables),
   climate (5), biophysics (8) and disturbance (4) were used as inputs to
   the modelling approaches. Multicollinearity analysis was carried out to
   examine the association and remove the highly-correlated variables
   before performing the modeling. Validation of model prediction levels
   was done using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
   (ROC curve-AUC) value. The results reveal that the areas with west and
   southwest orientations, and moderate slope demarcate higher
   susceptibility to forest fire. High precipitation areas with lower
   temperature but ample solar radiation increase their susceptibility to
   forest fire. Mixed deciduous forest type with ample solar radiation,
   higher NDVI, lower NDWI and lower TWI values exhibits higher
   susceptibility. Model validation shows that LR (with AUC = 0.809)
   outperforms other models used in the study. To minimize the risk of fire
   and frame with proper management plans for the study area,
   susceptibility mapping using satellite imageries, GIS technique, and
   modelling approaches is highly recommended.},

Abstract = {Background and aims: The objective of this work is to classify mountain
   wetlands (vegas) in the Central Andes between 28 degrees y 53 degrees S,
   based on geomorphology and hydrology. In addition, it seeks to
   characterize and determine the area, height, and slope of the vegas in
   each typology. M\&M: The determination of the different typologies was
   carried out based on an integrated biophysical approach at different
   scales of spatial analysis, where the vegas present in the study area
   were identified and their link with hydrological and geomorphological
   aspects. The dominant runoff types, and the geomorphological units were
   determined. Satellite images ALOS-AVNIR-2, Landsat 5 TM and field data
   were used. Results: A total of 304 vegas were identified that are
   determined by the geomorphological unit (river plains, alluvial fan,
   hillside, undifferentiated foothills, depression without surface
   discharge with or without water and fault) and the dominant type of
   runoff (linear surface, mantiform subsurface and subsurface mantiform to
   superficial linear). Four typologies of vegas are recognized: Riverbank,
   Hillside, Depression and Fault. The Riverbank and Hillside typologies
   were dominant in number and area. Eight and slope did not result
   different between typologies. Conclusions: The vegas present in the
   Central Andes respond to 4 typologies: Riverbank, Fault, Hillside and
   Depression. There is a close relationship between vegas, geomorphology
   and the dominant runoff, allowing their classification and to analyze
   different management measures. The obtained results are a contribution
   to the study of ecosystems of high ecological and socio-economic value
   in the region.},

Title = {Vegetable mapping using fuzzy classification of Dynamic Time Warping
   distances from time series of Sentinel-1A images},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Vegetable production is important because of the food security, diet
   improvement and socio-economic value. Mapping the location and extent of
   vegetable fields is therefore important in agricultural policy, food
   security and farmer support. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a common way
   to map crops from time series of satellite images. However, as all hard
   classifications, it does not show the spatial distribution of
   uncertainty in the classification. In fuzzy classification, where
   memberships to multiple classes are assigned to each pixel, differ-ences
   in membership between the first and the runners-up class can be used to
   assess classification uncertainty at the pixel level. This research
   formulates a fuzzy classifier based upon Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
   Warping (TWDTW) distances to map vegetable types from time series of
   Sentinel-1A SAR images. For each pixel, the TWDTW distances to the
   classes was normalised by dividing them by the sum of all TWDTW
   distances to all the classes for that pixel. The normalized distances
   were then used to compute fuzzy memberships for each pixel to each
   class, using the Gaussian membership function. Based on these
   memberships, fuzzy measures such as Confusion Index (CI), Ambiguity
   Index (AI), fuzziness and fuzzy membership were calculated and different
   thresholds applied on each of the measures during subsequent
   defuzzification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the
   defuzzified output results were 0.86 and 0.83, respectively, which was
   an improvement with regard to the crisp Time-Weighted Dynamic Time
   Warping with SPRING strategy for subsequence searching (TWDTWS)
   algorithm with 0.73 and 0.68 for overall accuracy and kappa,
   respectively. This study concludes that this new approach improves
   classification accuracy in image classification by excluding pixels with
   high un-certainty, which is especially relevant when only a limited
   number of classes are sampled and mapped.},

Abstract = {Gully erosion has been identified in recent decades as a global threat
   to people and property. This problem also affects the socioeconomic
   stability of societies and therefore limits their sustainable
   development, as it impacts a nonrenewable resource on a human scale,
   namely, soil. The focus of this study is to evaluate the prediction
   performance of four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression
   (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), Linear Discriminate
   Analysis (LDA), and the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), which are novel
   approaches in gully erosion modeling research, particularly in semi-arid
   regions with a mountainous character. 204 samples of erosion areas and
   204 samples of non-erosion areas were collected through field surveys
   and high-resolution satellite images, and 17 significant factors were
   considered. The dataset cells of samples (70\% for training and 30\% for
   testing) were randomly prepared to assess the robustness of the
   different models. The functional relevance between soil erosion and
   effective factors was computed using the ML models. The ML models were
   evaluated using different metrics, including accuracy, the kappa
   coefficient. kNN is the ideal model for this study. The value of the AUC
   from ROC considering the testing datasets of KNN is 0.93; the remaining
   models are associated to ideal AUC and are similar to kNN in terms of
   values. The AUC values from ROC of GLM, LDA, and CART for testing
   datasets are 0.90, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively. The value of accuracy
   considering the validation datasets of LDA, CART, KNN, and GLM are 0.85,
   0.82, 0.89, 0.84 respectively. The values of Kappa of LDA, CART, and GLM
   for testing datasets are 0.70, 0.65, and 0.68, respectively. ML models,
   in particular KNN, GLM, and LDA, have achieved outstanding results in
   terms of creating soil erosion susceptibility maps. The maps created
   with the most reliable models could be a useful tool for sustainable
   management, watershed conservation and prevention of soil and water
   losses.},

Title = {Undamming the Douro River Catchment: A Stepwise Approach for
   Prioritizing Dam Removal},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dams provide water supply, flood protection, and hydropower generation
   benefits, but also harm native species by altering the natural flow
   regime, and degrading the aquatic and riparian habitats. In the present
   study, which comprised the Douro River basin located in the North of
   Portugal, the cost-benefit assessment of dams was based upon a balance
   between the touristic benefits of a dammed Douro, and the ecological
   benefits of less fragmented Douro sub-catchments. Focused on four
   sub-catchments (Sabor, Tamega, Coa and Corgo), a probabilistic stream
   connectivity model was developed and implemented to recommend priorities
   for dam removal, where this action could significantly improve the
   movement of potadromous fish species along the local streams. The
   proposed model accounts for fish movement across the dam or weir
   (permeability), which is a novel issue in connectivity models. However,
   before any final recommendation on the fate of a dam or weir, the
   connectivity results will be balanced with other important
   socio-economic interests. While implementing the connectivity model, an
   inventory of barriers (dams and weirs) was accomplished through an
   observation of satellite images. Besides identification and location of
   any obstacles, the inventory comprised the compilation of data on
   surrounding land use, reservoir water use, characteristics of the
   riparian gallery, and permeability conditions for fish, among others.
   All this information was stored in a geospatial dataset that also
   included geographical information on the sub-catchment drainage network.
   The linear (drainage network) and point (barriers) source data were
   processed in a computer program that provided or returned numbers for
   inter-barrier stream lengths (habitat), and the barrier permeability.
   These numbers were finally used in the same computer program to
   calculate a habitat connector index, and a link improvement index, used
   to prioritize dam removal based upon structural connectivity criteria.
   The results showed that habitat patch connectivity in the Sabor, Tamega
   and Coa sub-catchments is not dramatically affected by the installed
   obstacles, because most link improvement values were generally low. For
   the opposite reason, in the Corgo sub-catchment, obstacles may
   constitute a relatively higher limitation to connectivity, and in this
   case the removal of eight obstacles could significantly improve this
   connectivity. Using the probabilistic model of structural connectivity,
   it was possible to elaborate a preliminary selection of dams/weirs that
   critically limit stream connectivity, and that will be the focus of
   field hydraulic characterization to precisely determine fish movement
   along the associated river stretches. Future work will also include the
   implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for dam
   removal or mitigation of the critical structures, as well to define
   exclusion areas for additional obstacles.},

Title = {Role of sunshades in space as a climate control option},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {241-253},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Placing reflectors in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to
   shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for
   use as a countermeasure against climate change. While the sunshade
   technology has been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoints, no study
   has evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a
   cost-effectiveness viewpoint, presuming that it is used in combination
   with CO2 abatement options as a pillar of the mitigation of climatic
   change. Nor have the contributions of geoengineering research and
   development to the economics of overall climate control measures been
   evaluated. Such evaluations are attempted in this study, which focuses
   on a space-based sunshade technology. As a result, it is recommended
   that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m(2) through the sunshades
   over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the
   21st century. In this case, an increase in global CO2 emissions by some
   15\% is allowed in the former half of the 21st century, and the total
   climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US\$ on a
   present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshades are
   unavailable. To enjoy the above advantages, the mass of the sunshade
   stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a
   doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration should be lower than 100
   Mt/2xCO(2) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing
   (space-launching) sunshades from 6000 to 1000 US\$/kg over a
   half-century. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Restitution Study for the Plans of a Group of Traditional Erzurum
   Houses in Ibrahim Pasa District},
Journal = {MEGARON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {271-285},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to purpose a restitution for the plan of a
   group of traditional Erzurum houses, which were built as independent but
   adjacent houses in the second half of the 18th century in the historical
   city center of Erzurum, by examining the spatial, structural and
   functional transformation with the abolition of borders while
   transforming into a cafe/restaurant. These traditional Erzurum houses
   are located at the intersection of Rasit Pasa and Salih Yuzbasi Streets
   in Ibrahim Pasa District, which is one of the historical settlements in
   the south west of Inner Castle. Houses once used independently began to
   be used as a single building with a number of changes made in the plan
   layout. However, during the change of function, facade layout and
   numerous spaces intertwined under the same roof and this made it
   difficult to understand the original plan scheme of the buildings. As
   there is a lack of documentation of the changes made and the presence of
   ambiguity in the different verbal information sources about the
   buildings, the main problem of this study is to determine the number of
   houses the cafe/restaurant consists of. Other important problems are the
   determination of the boundaries and the spatial organization of the
   houses. In addition, the scarcity of written sources in literature about
   these historic adjacent houses, which are numerous but more modest in
   the urban fabric compared with the two-story independent houses,
   increases the importance of this study. In order to reveal the changes
   and transformation of a group of traditional Erzurum houses built
   independently but adjacent to each other, first of all, traditional
   Erzurum houses were examined architecturally under the headings of
   location, plan and facade layout, material and construction technique
   properties. Then the architectural features and possible traces of
   change on this group of buildings, which were not mentioned in any
   source or document, were revealed in terms of location and plan
   features. After documentation of the current situation, property deeds,
   cadastral plans, satellite images, old photographs, historical and
   current maps, traces of the buildings themselves, information about
   traditional Erzurum houses and comparative studies were used to
   understand the different building phrases and restitution of the plan of
   these buildings. When the archive documents are evaluated, it is
   understood that the group of buildings were built in the second half of
   the 18th century according to Nene Saliha Hanim's Foundation record
   dated to 1791-92. Also, parcel numbers with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 belong to
   a foundation named ``Nene Saliha Hanim{''} and parcel numbers with 5,
   15, 16, 17, 18, 41 and 42 belong to private property according to the
   land registers. Within the building group, in addition to eight
   independent houses analyzed spatially, functionally and structurally,
   the external body walls and garden boundaries of at least two more
   houses, which do not exist currently, were identified. Possibly, a khan
   might have existed in the place of one. Unlike the traditional Erzurum
   houses mentioned in the literature, these houses, for which a
   restitution is prepared, have a simple spatial organization consisting
   of one or two rooms. The studied houses, which contain many clues about
   the social and cultural life style of the old Erzurum city, yet which
   are decreasing in number, should be registered as cultural assets by the
   relevant Conservation Board.
   Additionally, the reconstruction permit decision given in the
   Conservation Development Plan for this region that conforms to many
   protection criteria such as historical, architectural, continuity,
   rarity and memorial value with its structure, parcel and streets should
   be re-evaluated. This study is important as it reveals that these
   single-story houses, which are stacked in a building block on a
   traditional street texture, with modest architectural organization
   should be part of the relevant literature on traditional Erzurum houses,
   which mainly deals with independent separate two-story houses owned by
   wealthy families. In addition, it is stated for the first time in the
   literature with this study that the parcels inside the building block
   get access to the main street through a common closed inner street, in
   contrast to the houses lined up adjacent to each other on independent
   lots on the street.},

Abstract = {Urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta is the most developed one of
   three urban agglomerations in China, which consists of Shanghai, some
   cities located in the south of Jiangsu province and the north of
   Zhejiang province. Shanghai is an international economic, financial,
   trade and shipping center, which leads the progress of urban
   agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. It is a lively region which has
   the fastest economy growth and the largest economy amount The
   development of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta has played a
   very important role in China's sustained and steady economic growth all
   the while. However, with the economic advancement in urban agglomeration
   of Yangtze River Delta, the augment of chemical emissions gases, such as
   non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), CFCS, CO, NO, NO2, caused the decrease
   of the amount of O-3. According to the previous research, O-3 had a
   strongly relationship with ultraviolet radiation (UV), and the depletion
   of O-3 would cause the increase of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
   earth surface. The ultraviolet radiation has a strong negative
   ecological effect in many aspects, such as people, animal, plant,
   biogeochemical cycles and the structure of the ecosystem. In the
   situation, it is very meaningful for us to study the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of O-3 and ultraviolet radiation in urban
   agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta based on remote sensing data; it
   can also be very important to analyze the relationship between the
   ultraviolet radiation and O-3. Government departments can legislate or
   make planning to protect ozone layer in order to reduce the surface
   ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface to maintain residents' health
   and ecosystem according the results of the article.
   We used the total ultraviolet radiation product of SCIAMACHY (from Jan.
   2003 to Dec. 2007), the total ozone product of SCIAMACHY (from Jan. 2003
   to Sep. 2004) and OMI (from Oct. 2004 to Dec. 2007) to analyze the
   ultraviolet radiation and total ozone spatiotemporal characteristics
   reaching the earth surface, as well as the relationship between them in
   urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. Urban agglomeration of
   Yangtze River Delta was divided into sixteen cities according the
   administration management and economy activities.
   The calculation results revealed that (1) the spatial feature of the
   annual and seasonal of ultraviolet radiation and the total ozone
   presented significant regional difference, but the distribution
   characteristics of them were not the same. The spatial character of
   ultraviolet radiation in urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was
   that cities located in the lower latitude had the higher ultraviolet
   radiation, but had the lower total ozone. However, the cities located in
   the higher latitude had the lower ultraviolet radiation, but had the
   higher total ozone. (2) the average value of summer ultraviolet
   radiation of urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was the highest
   one followed by spring, autumn, and the average value of winter
   ultraviolet radiation was the lowest; the total ozone of spring of urban
   agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta was the highest followed by summer,
   winter, and the total ozone of autumn was the lowest. (3) The seasonal
   change amplitude of ultraviolet radiation was not significant, and the
   trends were different, while the seasonal change range of total ozone
   was significant, and the trends were different. (4) The calculation
   results showed that there were negative correlation between the
   ultraviolet radiation and total ozone in urban agglomeration of Yangtze
   River Delta.},

Abstract = {Food culture is most influenced by the locality of its origin, which
   will have been one of food acquisition and processing by various means.
   It is generally agreed, and is the basis of much United Nations,
   especially Food and Agriculture Organisation strategic development
   policy, that successful agriculture, horticulture and aquacuiture along
   with fishing, underpin economically viable and healthy communities with
   their various food cultures. We also know that this must be in tandem
   with maternal literacy and operational health care systems. These
   elements are best represented on a regional basis. There is a growing
   consumer interest in knowing where one's food comes from as a measure of
   ``food integrity{''}. However, food production alone can be a precarious
   business and relate to a lesser or greater extent to local food culture
   and to trade, which may be complementary or at-odds with each other.
   Likewise, the local food culture may have its strengths and weaknesses
   as far as its ability to meet nutritional and health needs is concerned.
   Local food production may be restricted because of geographical or
   socio-economic conditions which preclude food diversity, although this
   may be compensated for by trade. Where food adequacy and diversity is
   compromised, and soils poor, various macro-nutrient, micronutrient (from
   animals and plants) and phytonutrient (nutritionally-advantageous food
   component from plants) deficiencies may be in evidence. These food
   system problems may be intertwined with food culture - for example,
   ``rice-based and water-soluble vitamin poor{''}; ``few animal-derived
   foods like meat, fish, eggs and milk with associated low calcium,
   vitamin D, Vitamin B-12 and long chain n-3 fatty acid intakes{''}; ``low
   fruit and vegetable intake with limited carotenoids and other
   phytonutrients{''}. Geo-satellite surveillance and mopping is
   identifying such ``hot spots{''}: for regional food problems, as well as
   hot spots where most of the world's biodiversity is found (1.4\% of land
   on earth). On the other hand, regional food culture can confer
   considerable advantage for health and economic development, but does not
   necessarily do so. The challenge is to respect and retain traditional
   food knowledge and sustainable food systems, with good governance for
   food security. There has been a recent awakening of interest and concern
   about the lack of documentation of traditional and indigenous food
   cultures which are important not only for their own sake, but for the
   legacy of food knowledge which they can confer on future generations,
   provided they are not lost. Hence, the value of a special focus on
   African food cultures (www.healthyeatingclub.org/Africa), including Rift
   and Nile Valleys and North West African foods, which are the cradles of
   human food systems and habits. This is the case too with indigenous
   foods and food cultures (whether hunter-gatherer or subsistence
   agriculture); with relatively long-living food cultures in North East
   Asia, with food cultural distinction and fusion (FHILL and SENECA
   studies) and with migratory Food Habits. By and large, there is a
   remarkable resilience and ingenuity of people and their food systems,
   but monoculture and lack of diversity encourage food system failure.},

Title = {Greening residential quarters in China: What are the roles of urban
   form, socioeconomic factors, and biophysical context?},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Residential greenspace has great intracity variations. Its driving
   factors have been widely investigated in Western countries (e.g., in
   Europe and North America), where residential areas are mostly privately
   owned, but few studies have examined the determinants of residential
   greenspace in China, where land is owned by the gov-ernment. Taking the
   subtropical city of Changsha, China, as an example, this study mapped
   the percent green cover (PGC) in residential quarters with a
   fine-resolution satellite image. We also investigated its driving
   factors measured from multisource geospatial data. The results show that
   (1) the PGC in the residential quarters showed great spatial variation,
   with an average of 36.6\% (0-85.7\%) and a standard deviation of 18.3\%.
   (2) Urban form, biophysical context, and socioeconomic factors together
   explained 49.18\% of the variation in the PGC, and they independently
   explained 22.87\%, 11.17\%, and 2.31\% of the variation, respectively.
   (3) Residential quarter size, PGC in the surrounding buffer zone,
   residential quarter age, housing value, and population density
   significantly and positively impact the PGC, while percent building
   cover, floor area ratio, and distance to city center had significant
   negative impacts. The strongest positive and negative impacts came from
   PGC in the surrounding buffer zone and percent building cover,
   respectively. Socioeconomic factors, the dominant driving factors in
   Western countries, show little impact on residential PGC. These findings
   expand our understanding of the intracity variation in greenspace
   coverage and the driving factors, which sheds light on the effective
   planning and management of urban greenspaces in China.},

Abstract = {The people of northwestern Alaska have had a long relationship with
   local populations of Rangifer tarandus. During the last 200 years this
   relationship has changed from one of subsistence to overexploitation of
   caribou (the name for wild reindeer in North America), to commercial
   livestock production of semi domesticated reindeer and now may be
   returning to a subsistence economy based on caribou. Reindeer were
   introduced to Alaska in 1892 because of the disappearance of caribou, a
   subsistence resource. Until recently, reindeer meat and velvet antler
   production generated significant employment and revenue important to the
   economies of rural Alaskan communities. However, from 1976 to 1996 the
   Western Arctic Caribou Herd (WACH) increased from about 75,000 to
   463,000 animals. Concurrently, winter range use of the WACH shifted
   westward onto traditional reindeer ranges of the Seward Peninsula for
   the first time in over 100 years. This event has produced socio-economic
   and ecological consequences for the region. Many reindeer herders have
   lost 75-100 percent of their herds through commingling and out-migration
   with wild caribou. This loss, amounting to over 17,000 reindeer,
   represents a potential economic value of millions of dollars. Many
   herders have adopted new technologies, such as satellite telemetry and
   intensive herding to salvage what is left of their herds. Here we
   discuss the role of grazing animals and patterns of human resource use
   in an Arctic system. We then discuss our findings on the effects and
   changes in management practices brought about by caribou incursion in
   the context of the regional economy on the Seward Peninsula.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2005},

Abstract = {Recent flood events along the international border between the USA and
   Mexico resulted in significant economic damage and loss of human life.
   The International Boundary and Water Commission, the agency responsible
   for monitoring US-Mexican flood control levees, had requested funding
   for maintenance and improvement of these levees. However, the Office of
   Management and Budget requires agencies to provide benefits or in this
   case avoided loss estimates to justify the budget request. Due to severe
   time constraints in the budgetary process there was a need for a rapid
   assessment of the potential economic impacts from a failure of this
   ageing flood-control infrastructure. The economic losses avoided by four
   major flood-control projects on the Rio Grande were estimated using an
   innovative combination of satellite imagery, geographic information
   systems, and economic methods. The control projects apply to about 547
   km (340 miles) of levees from Caballo Reservoir in New Mexico to
   Brownsville, Texas, and include several million people, extensive
   industry, and agricultural production. High resolution imagery was used
   to identify and quantify potential flood inundation areas, types of land
   use, and impacts of flood-control infrastructure failure. Value
   estimates of residential, industrial, and commercial property, and
   agricultural production at risk were developed from property assessment
   data, crop enterprise budgets, census data, and community leaders.
   Damage factors accounting for flood inundation levels and building
   contents were then used to develop gross economic losses avoided by
   flood-control infrastructure for each of the different property and land
   use types in each project area. The baseline analysis indicates that the
   four projects cumulatively prevent one time losses of US\$322.9 million
   in flood-control protection.},

Abstract = {Connecting the Unconnected or under-connected (CTU) is the holy grail of
   transforming the lives of over 3 billion people around the globe with
   wireless Internet who are yet to experience its value in multiple ways.
   If this could be accomplished, its impact on the society would be
   enormous.
   This white paper from the IEEE Future Networks CTU Working Group
   endeavors to highlight the need to consider the CTU requirements in 5G
   and B5G networks in the standardization process, in the development of
   the use cases, and affordable solutions. In its Vision 2030 SDG
   (Sustainability Development Goals) the United Nations has proclaimed
   access to Internet as basic human right and has said that these goals
   cannot be achieved without affordable access to Internet by everyone on
   this planet.
   While there are numerous projects and initiatives ongoing around the
   world, these are fragmented and lack the critical mass and coordination
   to be able to impact the future standards, product development, and cost
   of deployment otherwise achievable by volume. Although difficult to pin
   down, to define a threshold for basic connectivity for all is important.
   But it would need to be flexible to adapt to changing times. It is the
   goal of the CTU group to create an open platform where the experts can
   bring their ideas, solutions, and potentially collaborate to create
   large global projects and influence the network service providers,
   manufacturers and their governments. This white paper defines the CTU
   working group's charter, scope, and provides a brief overview of the
   relevant stakeholders and linkages between them. Then the paper goes
   into the current status of the CTU landscape and where we want to reach
   to accomplish the vision of connecting everybody, especially those
   living in rural and remote areas. We present the various standards and
   industry fora and how they are interlinked. While technologies are
   available today, they need to be customized and optimized at the systems
   level to bring down the cost of the network in order to be affordable.
   In addition, the content needs to be relevant and in local languages to
   be useful, not to mention the need to offer innovative human computer
   interaction (HCI) solutions (that are not text based) so that people who
   are not literate or are digitally disadvantaged can easily use the
   devices and consume services. Another important area is that of flexible
   spectrum allocation regime at the lower range of the spectrum to
   increase reach and coverage. Use of renewable energy sources will enable
   deployment in remote areas where there is lack of power grid, or it is
   intermittent. Thus, this white paper identifies a number of technology
   gaps to be filled in by 5G and B5G networks, such that access is
   affordable and content and services are actually consumed by the
   targeted set of users. Technology aside, the need to develop innovative
   business models is a must to be commercially sustainable in the
   long-term. A number of such models, especially designed for the rural
   population, are proposed, such as Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE)
   Freemium (Free + Premium), revenue sharing among the chain of service
   providers, subsidized billing by USOF (Universal Service Obligation
   Funds). Finally, the white paper presents a 10-year roadmap starting
   from the current state to 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.},

Abstract = {To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR)
   model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected
   Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters;
   especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical
   records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a
   geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides
   in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into
   two datasets: 70\% of them were used as the training dataset and 30\% as
   the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors
   (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors;
   human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary
   conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library
   for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model
   training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the
   established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation
   in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis
   results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very
   low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of
   conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was
   explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and
   recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above
   two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances
   between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than
   the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF
   model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high
   and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the
   geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other
   hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable
   for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of
   its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The
   outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine
   learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and
   urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing
   demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility
   assessments.},

Abstract = {Cherokee Nation Strategic Programs (CNSP) and Ocean Aero, Inc. have
   teamed together to demonstrate the multimission capabilities of
   commercial autonomous maritime systems. CNSP has a proven record
   testing, fielding, and developing Unmanned Systems (UxS) programs across
   air, ground, and maritime domains. Ocean Aero has developed a portfolio
   of intelligent autonomous underwater and surface vehicles that are
   uniquely engineered for a wide range of applications above and below the
   ocean surface. The focus of our collaboration is the accelerated
   deployment of autonomous capabilities in operational mission scenarios.
   Unmanned systems are demonstrating daily value to commercial and
   civilian users today. Drones are rapidly moving beyond powerful remotely
   controlled information capture tools into advanced networks of aerial
   robots providing services and access that was never before considered
   valuable. Ground robot technologies are maturing just as rapidly and
   taking on many different forms as purpose-built systems are enabling
   subterranean exploration, driver safety on interstate highways, and
   disaster response support. Maritime systems are now fulfilling the same
   potential with robust, all-weather designs that enable long endurance,
   rugged missions for marine users. The operational value that these
   systems provide comes from the advancements in intelligent autonomy.
   We are currently testing the range of autonomous capabilities of the
   Ocean Aero Triton Series autonomous underwater and surface vehicle
   systems at the University of Southern Mississippi Marine Research Center
   (USM MRC). The Ocean Aero vehicles are designed and built with
   autonomous, persistent navigation capabilities as a standard feature.
   Additional customized, missioncentric sensors may be added to the
   systems to accomplish specific operational tasks and/or increase
   autonomous performance. The command-and-control (C2) communication
   architecture provides situational awareness and mission progress
   monitoring for the onboard vehicle decision-making, as well as the
   remote operator control station. To successfully achieve the high level
   of autonomous operations in locations without terrestrial communications
   (cellular) and beyond visual line of sight, UxS use satellite
   communications for navigation and mission data transfer.
   Our testing is evaluating the ability of the autonomous systems to
   accomplish multiple missions, including perimeter security, tracking of
   other surface vehicles, environmental monitoring, and marine science
   missions. These evaluations include the performance of the vehicles, the
   sensors, and the multi-domain communication systems, while
   characterizing the operating conditions for each test series.
   ``Autonomy{''} is a capability that means different things to different
   people. Our testing at the MRC is evaluating the ability of the system
   to react to new information, whether from external source or
   self-perceived, to accomplish the intended mission, such as detection of
   an unknown vehicle in the area. This ability to react includes concepts
   such as dynamic replanning for navigation, as well as communications
   with the operations center for mission management awareness. Through
   these communications and activities, we are measuring the operator
   workloads in multiple missions to determine if the autonomy in the
   system is increasing, decreasing, or improving operator performance.
   Our testing team was assembled specifically to accomplish these
   objectives. The full technical paper will include sample test cases and
   data collection examples for evaluating the Ocean Aero autonomous
   underwater and surface vehicle technologies using the Cherokee Nation
   Capabilities-Based Assessment process. This is the proven, repeatable
   process that we have used for evaluating air, ground, and maritime
   unmanned systems for many customers. We use this process for assessing
   the operational performance of mature products, not research-only test
   units. This focus on technologies that are commercially available or at
   least products from an active production line, allow us to evaluate
   capabilities as they relate to mission requirements and user objectives.
   We have the team with the experience, the equipment, the facilities, and
   the dedication to advance the expectations of what is possible for
   unmanned maritime systems. This paper covers the process for achieving
   that advancement, including identifying the challenges such as
   evaluating autonomous capabilities and operating in live environments.},

Title = {Generating digital terrain model: joint use of airborne lidar data and
   optical images},
Journal = {TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {145-159},
Abstract = {The knowledge of an accurate topography is a prerequest for monitoring
   natural hazards and for environmental management (e.g. hydrologic and
   erosion models). Remote sensing lidar systems are active sensors which
   record altimeter data of the Earth's surface as 3D point clouds: from an
   emitted laser pulse, the receptor detects backscaterred photons from the
   reflecting target. The altimeter accuracy is often higher than in the
   case of using stereoscopic conventional techniques, even if the ground
   density of the data is often lower. Additionnaly, beyond the altimeter
   information, these data contain spectral information related to the
   target reflectance in the infra-red domain. Depending on the target
   geometry, lidar systems can acquire several echos for a single laser
   pulse. This property is particularly interesting in forests or in areas
   of urban vegetation since it provides not only the canopy height, but
   also, under certain conditions, the terrain height under the vegetation
   layer.
   Many algorithms have been implemented to sort out the automatic
   classification problem of 3D point clouds providing ground and
   off-ground points as well as the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). This is
   mainly due to the various aspects of landscapes within a global survey
   which can include urban, forest or mountainous areas.
   This paper presents the generation of DTMs based on the joint use of
   optical images and lidar data. The study is focused on rural areas where
   a large scale mapping is a major issue. We propose an algorithm based on
   a predictive Kalman filter for which the temporal component is replaced
   by a spacial indexation. The algorithm consists in analyzing the
   altimeter distribution of the point cloud of a local area in the local
   slope frame. We insist on the role of local slopes for determining the
   ground height especially in case of steep slope terrain. We assume that
   points of the first altimeter mode (lowest points) belong to the
   terrain. The mean height of these points correspond to the measured DTM
   value. The final DTM value at a specific position is obtained by a
   linear combination between the measured value and the predicted value.
   The predicted value depends on the neighboring pixels through their
   respective uncertainties. The slopes are also integrated in the
   predictive filter. The local slope is estimated by robust M-estimator,
   based on the local first altimeter mode. The final slope for each site
   depends on the corresponding neighborhood uncertainties. This process
   makes the slope estmation more robust. Finally, the predictive Kalman
   framework provides not only a robust terrain surface, but also an
   uncertainty for each DTM pixel as well as a map of normal vectors.
   The local window size is a critical parameter in filtering algorithms.
   It should be small enough to keep all ground details but large enough to
   ensure the removal of off-ground objects such as trees or/and buildings.
   Consequently, we S introduce an adaptation of the local neighborhood
   based on the integration of image and lidar data within a predictor of
   high vegetation areas. In this context, we decided to investigate the
   potential of using raw uncalibrated lidar intensity in case of a joint
   indice computation, which is generally derived from image-based infrared
   data. Consequently, lidar intensity and optical images are combined to
   generate a Hybrid Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (HNDVI). The
   lidar provides the infrared band whereas the aerial image provides RGB
   spectral bands.
   A vegetation mask is then calculated with HNDVI and lidar variance
   information. In fact, higher values of HNDVI are likely to correspond to
   vegetated areas and vegetation is described as non-ordered point cloud
   with a high variance compared to human-made structures. Based on the
   vegetation mask, the local neighborhood size continuously varies from a
   predefined minimum distance to an automatically processed upper boundary
   depending on the vegetated area density. Lidar data have been collected
   in 2004 by the Institut Frangais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la
   Mer (IFREMER) over the Morbihan Gulf, France. It has been funded by
   TOTAL. The entire survey is composed of 230.106 points with intensities
   and has been acquired with an ALTM (Optech) system 1210. The point
   density is 0.7 pt/m(2). The lidar wavelength is 1064 nm. Optical images
   are extracted from the BDOrtho (R) French orthophoto data basis of the
   Institut Geographique National with a nominal resolution of 0.5 m, but
   resampled at 2.5 m for the generation of the Hybrid-NDVI image.
   Conclusive results show the potentiality of a full combination of lidar
   data and RGB optical images for improving the generation of fine DTMs on
   rural environments. The filtering process is more robust, DTM are less
   picked due to vegetation filtering. However, in case of dense
   vegetation, the window size can be large and the average terrain height
   may be underestimated. As future work, further area predictors can be
   developed to adapt the proposed methodology to various landscapes and
   relieves.},

Title = {Assessment and simulation of land use and land cover change impacts on

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {Rapid urbanization is changing the existing patterns of land use land
   cover (LULC) globally, which is consequently increasing the land surface
   temperature (LST) in many regions. The present study is focused on
   estimating current and simulating future LULC and LST trends in the
   urban environment of Chaoyang District, Beijing. Past patterns of LULC
   and LST were identified through the maximum likelihood classification
   (MLC) method and multispectral Landsat satellite images during the
   1990-2018 data period. The cellular automata (CA) and stochastic
   transition matrix of the Markov model were applied to simulate future
   (2025) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns.
   The CA model was validated for the simulated and estimated LULC for
   1990-2018, with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.83, using validation
   modules in IDRISI software. Our results indicated that the cumulative
   changes in built-up to vegetation area were 74.61 km2 (16.08\%) and
   113.13 km2 (24.38\%) from 1990 to 2018. The correlation coefficient of
   land use and land cover change (LULCC), including vegetation, water
   bodies and built-up area, had values of r = -0.155 (p > 0.005), -0.809
   (p = 0.000), and 0.519 (p > 0.005), respectively. The results of future
   analysis revealed that there will be an estimated 164.92 km2 (-12\%)
   decrease in vegetation area, while an expansion of approximately 283.04
   km2 (6\% change) will occur in built-up areas from 1990 to 2025. This
   decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely
   cause a rise of approximately similar to 10.74 degrees C and similar to
   12.66 degrees C in future temperature, which would cause a rise in
   temperature (2025). The analyses could open an avenue regarding how to
   manage urban land cover patterns to enhance the resilience of cities to
   climate warming. This study provides scientific insights for
   environmental development and sustainability through efficient and
   effective urban planning and management in Beijing and will also help
   strengthen other research related to the UHI phenomenon in other parts
   of the world.},

Abstract = {The mapping of soil nutrients is a key issue for numerous applications
   and research fields ranging from global changes to environmental
   degradation, from sustainable soil management to the precision
   agriculture concept. The characterization, modeling and mapping of soil
   properties at diverse spatial and temporal scales are key factors
   required for different environments. This paper is focused on the use
   and comparison of soil chemical analyses, Visible near infrared and
   shortwave infrared VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy, partial least-squares
   regression (PLSR), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Landsat-8 operational land
   imager (OLI) images, to inexpensively analyze and predict the content of
   different soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium
   (K)), pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) in arid conditions. To achieve
   this aim, 100 surface samples of soil were gathered to a depth of 25 cm
   in the Wadi El-Garawla area (the northwest coast of Egypt) using
   chemical analyses and reflectance spectroscopy in the wavelength range
   from 350 to 2500 nm. PLSR was used firstly to model the relationship
   between the averaged values from the ASD spectroradiometer and the
   available N, P, and K, pH and SOM contents in soils in order to map the
   predicted value using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and secondly to retrieve N,
   P, K, pH, and SOM values from OLI images. Thirty soil samples were
   selected to verify the validity of the results. The randomly selected
   samples included the spatial diversity and characteristics of the study
   area. The prediction of available of N, P, K pH and SOM in soils using
   VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy showed high performance (where R-2 was 0.89,
   0.72, 0.91, 0.65, and 0.75, respectively) and quite satisfactory results
   from Landsat-8 OLI images (correlation R-2 values 0.71, 0.68, 0.55, 0.62
   and 0.7, respectively). The results showed that about 84\% of the soils
   of Wadi El-Garawla are characterized by low-to-moderate fertility, while
   about 16\% of the area is characterized by high soil fertility.},

Abstract = {The seasonal and occasional movement of wild animals including elephants
   from one terrestrial habitat to another habitat are very common natural
   as well as biological habits for the survival of their lives. Around 163
   km railway track runs from Siliguri Junction (SGUJ) to Alipurduar
   Junction (APDJ) within biodiversity hotspot region. According to the
   report of Forest Department, around 14 prominent and 59 minor elephant
   corridors have been crisscrossed over the railway track and in between
   the years 1974 and 2019, nearly 71 elephants are brutally killed due to
   collision with running trains. The kernel density estimation model is
   applied to evaluate the spatio-temporal death risk of elephants. To
   predict the spatial vulnerability or risk of accidental death of
   elephants, Kernel density estimation analytical algorithms like
   Bandwidth selection, Intensity, Grid Resolution, Kernel function have
   been considered. This model considers past accidental deaths data along
   with secondary data like train speed, fragmentation of elephant
   habitats, distance of croplands from railway track, human encroachment
   with electric fencing etc. The anthropogenic activities as well as land
   use and land cover change have been analysed using Landsat 8 Operational
   Land Imager-OLI (2019) satellite images and digitally processed by EDRAS
   IMAGINE 16.5(v16.5.0.852) software. Similarly digital thematic maps have
   also been prepared on ArcGIS 10.3 platform. Kernel Density Estimation
   (KDE) intensity (risk) is computed considering the Elephant Death Risk
   Score (EDRS) as it takes into account of the first and second order
   properties. Fixed bandwidth is selected for the whole distribution and
   it is computed by the nearest neighbour distance mean method. On the
   basis of calculated tau value, (the mean distance between centroids and
   nearest neighbour index) Kernel Density map is prepared to show the
   elephant death risk in term of first order properties and second order
   properties. The result shows very high and high KD (risk) values (
   0.9799-10.0709) are confined in the eastern and western segments of the
   SGUJ to APDJ railway line. Therefore, this model helps to take
   sustainable holistic environmental management of wild animals as well as
   wild natural habitats in different corners of the globe.},

Title = {Determining critical light and hydrologic conditions for macrophyte
   presence in a large shallow lake: The ratio of euphotic depth to water
   depth},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Light determines macrophyte distribution, community composition and
   biomass in shallow lakes. Therefore, it is vital to determine the
   critical underwater light climate thresholds for macrophyte degradation
   and recovery. In this study, we first proposed a novel index, defined as
   the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to water depth (WD), as a measure of
   the underwater light supply for macrophytes. The underwater light
   environment in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow, eutrophic lake) was then
   characterized based on this index (Z(eu)/WD) using field measurements
   collected from 2006 to 2013 (8 years x 4 seasons x 32 sites). The
   distribution of the macrophyte presence frequency (MPF, the number of
   investigations that identified macrophytes divided by the total number
   of investigations) was greater than 0.70 in Xukou Bay and East Lake
   Taihu over the 32 investigations, followed by the other sites
   distributed in East Lake Taihu. The proportion of macrophyte coverage
   increased with the increase in Z(eu)/WD. A significant relationship was
   observed between Zeu/WD and MPF for the 19 sites with macrophytes (r(2)
   = 0.48, p< 0.001, n = 19). In the region with high nutrient
   concentrations and serious water pollution, better underwater light
   conditions are required for the growth of macrophytes. A Z(eu)/WD value
   of 0.80 can be regarded as the critical underwater light threshold for
   the growth of macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The region with Z(eu)/WD
   ranging between 0.57 and 0.80 was usually covered by sparse macrophytes;
   this region should be vital for macrophyte recovery and environmental
   management in Lake Taihu. The distribution of Z(eu)/WD was further
   obtained using MODIS satellite-derived Zeu from June to October in 2003
   and 2013. Xukou Bay and Guangfu Bay in the southern part of Lake Taihu
   could be regarded as potentially crucial regions for the recovery of
   macrophytes from the perspective of underwater light and nutrient
   levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Declines and peaks in NO2 pollution during the multiple waves of the

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic created an extreme natural experiment in which
   sudden changes in human behavior and economic activity resulted in
   significant declines in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, immediately
   after strict lockdowns were imposed. Here we examined the impact of
   multiple waves and response phases of the pandemic on nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) dynamics and the role of meteorology in shaping relative
   contributions from different emission sectors to NO2 pollution in
   post-pandemic New York City. Long term (> 3.5 years), high frequency
   measurements from a network of ground-based Pandora spectrometers were
   combined with TROPOMI satellite retrievals, meteorological data,
   mobility trends, and atmospheric transport model simulations to quantify
   changes in NO2 across the New York metropolitan area. The stringent
   lockdown measures after the first pandemic wave resulted in a decline in
   top-down NOx emissions by approx. 30 \% on top of long-term trends, in
   agreement with sector-specific changes in NOx emissions. Ground-based
   measurements showed a sudden drop in total column NO2 in spring 2020, by
   up to 36 \% in Manhattan and 19 \%-29 \% in Queens, New Jersey (NJ), and
   Connecticut (CT), and a clear weakening (by 16 \%) of the typical weekly
   NO2 cycle. Extending our analysis to more than a year after the initial
   lockdown captured a gradual recovery in NO2 across the NY/NJ/CT
   tri-state area in summer and fall 2020, as social restrictions eased,
   followed by a second decline in NO2 coincident with the second wave of
   the pandemic and resurgence of lockdown measures in winter 2021.
   Meteorology was not found to have a strong NO2 biassing effect in New
   York City after the first pandemic wave. Winds, however, were favorable
   for low NO2 conditions in Manhattan during the second wave of the
   pandemic, resulting in larger column NO2 declines than expected based on
   changes in transportation emissions alone. Meteorology played a key role
   in shaping the relative contributions from different emission sectors to
   NO2 pollution in the city, with low-speed (< 5 m s(-1)) SW-SE winds
   enhancing contributions from the high-emitting power-generation sector
   in NJ and Queens and driving particularly high NO2 pollution episodes in
   Manhattan, even during - and despite - the stringent early lockdowns.
   These results have important implications for air quality management in
   New York City, and highlight the value of high resolution NO2
   measurements in assessing the effects of rapid meteorological changes on
   air quality conditions and the effectiveness of sector-specific NOx
   emission control strategies.},

Title = {An Integrated Experimental Design for the Assessment of Multiple

Abstract = {Background: For nearly five decades long-term studies in rodents have
   been the accepted benchmark for assessing chronic long-termtoxic
   effects, particularly carcinogenicity, of chemicals. The European Food
   Safety Authority (EFSA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have
   pointed out that the current set of internationally utilized test
   methods capture only some of the potential adverse effects associated
   with exposures to these agents over the lifetime.
   Objectives: In this paper, we propose the adaption of the
   carcinogenicity bioassay to integrate additional protocols for
   comprehensive long-term toxicity assessment that includes developmental
   exposures and long-term outcomes, capable of generating information on a
   broad spectrum of different end points.
   Discussion: An integrated study design based on a stepwise process is
   described that includes the priority end points of the Economic
   Co-operation and Development and the National Toxicology Program
   guidelines on carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity and developmental and
   reproductive toxicity. Integrating a comprehensive set of relevant
   toxicological end points in a single protocol represents an opportunity
   to optimize animal use in accordance with the 3Rs (replacement,
   reduction and refinement). This strategy has the potential to provide
   sufficient data on multiple windows of susceptibility of specific
   interest for risk assessments and public health decision-making by
   including prenatal, lactational, neonatal exposures and evaluating
   outcomes over the lifespan.
   Conclusion: This integrated study design is efficient in that the same
   generational cohort of rats used for evaluating long-term outcomes can
   be monitored in satellite parallel experiments to measure biomarkers and
   other parameters related to system-specific responses including
   metabolic alterations and endocrine disturbances.

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline changes and future forecasting:
   the case of Kucuk Menderes Delta, Turkiye},

Abstract = {A delta coastal area is one of the most important regions for human use
   owing to its scenic natural beauty and economic value. However, due to
   the constant interaction between the land and water environments in this
   region, it is also one of the most rapidly changing landforms in the
   world under the impact of natural processes as well as anthropogenic
   activities. Therefore, the determination and the constant monitoring of
   these changes spatiotemporally are of great significance in terms of the
   protection, planning, proper usage, effective management, and
   sustainability of the delta coast. In this study was aimed to determine
   the short-term and long-term shoreline changes that occurred between the
   years 1957 and 2020 along the coast of the Kucuk Menderes Delta and its
   close surroundings. In addition, the underlying causes were explored,
   and the future of the shoreline position was forecasted. The shorelines
   were digitized using seven multi-temporal orthophoto maps based on the
   high water line indicator. The shoreline changes were analyzed using
   different statistical methods, namely, the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM),
   Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear
   Regression Rate (LRR), by employing the Digital Shoreline Analysis
   System (DSAS). The future position of the shoreline was estimated using
   the extended Kalman Filter in the DSAS. The analyses revealed that in a
   period of 63 years, the maximum accretion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR
   and LRR) were 248.99 m, 3.96 m/year, and 3.65 m/year, respectively, the
   maximum erosion distance (NSM) and rates (EPR and LRR) were - 142.37 m,
   - 2.27 m/year, and - 2.19 m/year, respectively, and the delta coastal
   area had increased by 37.01 ha. It is forecasted that the delta coastal
   area will expand by 10.63 ha and 16.16 ha from 2020 to 2030 and 2040. If
   the current conditions that occurred in the last 63 years continue with
   similar effects, it was forecasted that by the years 2030 and 2040,
   significant changes would occur in the shoreline such as retreat into
   the existing facilities/usage areas and decrease of Eleman Wetland area,
   which would greatly alter the ecology, hydrography, and spatial usage of
   the delta region.},

Title = {How do CMIP6 models project changes in precipitation extremes over
   seasons and locations across the mid hills of Nepal?},

Abstract = {Assessing variability of historical and projected future precipitation
   extremes is of high value in managing water resources effectively. The
   Himalayan environment of Nepal is comprised of both hills and mountains.
   The hills are the most susceptible to precipitation extremes and related
   natural hazards, which hinder the socio-economic development of the
   country. This study investigated the variability of extreme
   precipitation events over the 22 weather stations distributed across the
   mid hills of Nepal to identify its driving potential of extreme events.
   Firstly, trends and spatial distribution of different precipitation
   indices were computed on annual and seasonal scales for the baseline
   (historical) period of 1986-2015. We found that the annual maximum
   precipitation amount (1-day, consecutive 3-day, and 5-day) and heavy
   precipitation days with daily precipitation exceeding 10, 20, and 50 mm
   (i.e., R10, R20, and R50 respectively) show dominantly falling trends
   during the historical period. Noticeably, while analyzing at a seasonal
   scale, we found that the precipitation amount exhibited a statistically
   significant decreasing pattern during the monsoon season. This study
   then assessed possible changes of those indices under future climatic
   conditions using the latest set of scenarios from ten CMIP6 (Coupled
   Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6) models dataset for the near
   future period (2021-2050) under two shared socio-economic pathways
   (SSP245 and SSP585). The projection showed a wider range of deviation
   with respect to the baseline, predominantly increasing heavy
   precipitation. Overall, the increasing pattern of the intensity,
   duration, and frequency of extreme events indicates the region would
   possess more risks of natural hazards such as floods, landslides, and
   soil erosion in the future. Furthermore, most of the climate models
   showed that consecutive dry days (CDDs) are projected to increase, which
   could significantly impact agriculture facilities, food security, and
   water scarcity and ultimately could increase the vulnerability of hill
   communities. Our findings are expected to help understand the
   extremities of precipitation variability and have strong policy
   implications indicating that adaptation measures that can reduce risks
   make society less vulnerable and more resilient to extremes.},

Title = {Precision variable rate nitrogen for dryland farming on waterlogging
   Riverine Plains of Southeast Australia?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {186},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in
   popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land
   preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen,
   invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many
   major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability
   as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may
   include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical
   harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable
   Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information
   and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces
   crop yields.
   Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the
   district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings
   over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha).
   Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across
   GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR
   levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one
   year may be poorest in the next.
   We answer the question: ``Why would a farmer in this district choose to
   apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in
   possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment,
   georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map
   data for that paddock in many past seasons?{''} We show that soil
   conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN
   versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging.
   If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season,
   applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of
   attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled
   soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable.
   We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated
   decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable,
   fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced
   in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with
   high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices.
   Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of
   each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1\% increase in
   yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7\% decrease in applied N.
   We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable
   than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may
   lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.},

Title = {Changes in crop type distribution in Zhangye City of the Heihe River
   Basin, China},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {22-36},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With rapid economic development in China, crops have undergone
   remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and
   accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and
   agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural
   production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in
   planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such
   knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural
   competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee
   national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in
   the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated
   upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on
   multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial
   distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and
   analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition,
   some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern
   of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four
   conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural
   network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in
   Zhangye was high, at 89.38\%. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land
   area in Zhangye increased from 463.81 x 10(3) ha to 493.89 x 10(3) ha.
   The sowing area of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39.21 x 10(3) ha
   and 5.99 x 10(3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the sowing
   area decreased by 3.61 x 10(3) ha and 9.14 x 10(3) ha, respectively.
   Considering other crop types as a group, their sowing area decreased by
   only 2.37 x 10(3) ha. The increase in corn sowing area mainly came from
   the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43.09\% of
   its total sowing area in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed
   a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the
   tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high
   conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while
   wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle
   and Shandan counties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To account for complex and diverse water system involving river dry-up,
   groundwater degradation, agricultural/urban water use, and dam/canal
   effects in heavily irrigated Yellow River Basin, this study coupled NIES
   Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model series with more
   complex sub-models involving various factors (NICE-DRY). The model
   reproduced reasonably evapotranspiration, irrigation water use,
   groundwater level, and river discharge during spring/winter wheat,
   summer maize, and summer rice cultivations. Scenario analysis predicted
   the impact of irrigation on both surface water and groundwater, which
   had previously been difficult to evaluate. The simulated discharge with
   irrigation was improved in terms of mean value, standard deviation, and
   coefficient of variation. Another scenario analysis of conversion from
   dryland to irrigated fields predicted that the effect of groundwater
   irrigation was predominant in the middle and downstream and the
   resultant groundwater degradation predominantly, where surface water was
   seriously limited. Simulated dry biomasses of wheat and maize were
   linearly related to Time-Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (TINDVI) estimated from satellite images. Temporal gradient of
   TINDVI during 1982-1999 showed spatially heterogeneous distribution and
   increasing trends in the wheat and maize fields, indicating that the
   production increases were related to irrigation water and the resultant
   hydrologic changes. This integrated approach could help to estimate a
   close relationship between crop production, hydrologic cycle, and water
   availability, and predict heterogeneous vulnerability of water
   resources. Because this region experienced substantial river dry-up and
   groundwater degradation at the end of the 20th century, this approach
   would help to overcome substantial pressures of increasing food demand
   and declining water availability, and to decide on appropriate measures
   for whole water resources management to achieve sustainable development
   under sound socio-economic conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Reviews and syntheses: An empirical spatiotemporal description of the
   global surface-atmosphere carbon fluxes: opportunities and data

Abstract = {Understanding the global carbon (C) cycle is of crucial importance to
   map current and future climate dynamics relative to global environmental
   change. A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed
   information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface-atmosphere fluxes.
   However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their
   coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of
   integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland
   freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a
   data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based
   spatially explicit surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to
   identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data
   limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans,
   continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes
   related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical
   aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and
   cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through
   geostatistical and/ or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby
   minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in
   process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE)
   between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere.
   Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study
   is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that
   need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories.
   Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling.
   In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates
   from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric
   inversions. This holds for Europe (mean +/- 1 SD: 0.8 +/- 0.1 PgC
   yr(-1), positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 +/-
   0.4 PgC yr(-1)), East Asia (1.6 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), South Asia (0.3 +/-
   0.1 PgC yr(-1)), Australia (0.2 +/- 0.3 PgC yr(-1)), and most of the
   Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in
   tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and
   because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global
   bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of 5.4 +/- 2.0 PgC yr(-1). By
   contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2
   over 2001-2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source
   of 4.3 +/- 0.1 PgC yr(-1). This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr(-1)
   highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in
   tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment
   provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon
   observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land
   regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second,
   extensive pCO(2) data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack
   observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and
   inland water-atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data
   uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria
   optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS)
   and atmospheric inversions, without over-or under-stating bottom-up data
   credibility.
   In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at
   national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2
   fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which
   future emission reductions are proposed.},

Abstract = {The black soil area in Northeast China serves as a ``ballast{''} to
   ensure China's food security. Unreasonable development and utilization
   lead to serious black soil degradation in some areas and affect regional
   food production and economic and social development. In the context of
   the intensification of the contradiction between food supply and demand
   worldwide, we should pay more attention to the overall situation of
   regional sustainable development and seek for systematic, scientific,
   and economic solutions. This study establishes a regional all-for-one
   customization model of black soil granary on the basis of the regional
   system of human-land relationship, customized and accurate management,
   agricultural system theory, and agricultural informatization with the
   guidance of integrated geography concept. The aim of this regional
   all-for-one customization model is to systematically diagnose the key
   problems and leading factors of black soil degradation and determine a
   solution that combines the commonness and individuality of black soil
   protection from the perspective of multiscale linkage, multifactor
   coupling, and multitechnology cooperation. The regional all-for-one
   customization model of black soil granary integrates the two
   perspectives of ``regional{''} and ``customization{''} into the
   protection and comprehensive utilization of black soil for the first
   time. It adopts zoning, grading, and classification as the main strategy
   and big data and artificial intelligence as the main technical
   approaches. This model constructs three strategies of different scales
   by combining the ``satellite-air-ground-network{''} 3D monitoring system
   and the all-for-one customization platform driven by big data and
   artificial intelligence. First, the ``implementing strategies by
   regions{''} are implemented at the regional scale to formulate the
   regional agricultural resource allocation scheme and agricultural
   zoning, which can provide strategies to protect and utilize black soil
   effectively. Second, the ``determining strategies in accordance with
   villages{''} are implemented at the village scale to formulate a black
   soil protection and utilization model for different categories of
   villages, which can promote the organic integration of black soil
   protection and rural revitalization. Third, a ``one strategy for one
   field{''} concept is applied at the field scale to provide accurate
   strategies for soil restoration and yield improvement in a fixed,
   quantitative, and regular manner. Multiscale integrated demonstration
   and scheme verification of the regional all-for-one customization model
   of black soil granary are conducted in Qiqihar City at three scales,
   namely, region, village, and field, to solve the key issues in black
   soil protection and utilization and form a replicable and popularized
   system solution, thereby providing a model for the sustainable
   development of Chinese and global black soil agriculture. The proposed
   regional all-for-one customization model of black soil granary has
   important theoretical and practical value in promoting the high-quality
   development of regional agriculture and rural revitalization, and
   provides a demonstration model of land protection and utilization for
   the black soil area in China and the whole world.},

Title = {Machine Learning for Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence in Changsha: An
   Innovative Investigation into the Introduction of a Forest Fuel Factor},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Affected by global warming and increased extreme weather, Hunan Province
   saw a phased and concentrated outbreak of forest fires in 2022, causing
   significant damage and impact. Predicting the occurrence of forest fires
   can enhance the ability to make early predictions and strengthen early
   warning and responses. Currently, fire prevention and extinguishing in
   China's forests and grasslands face severe challenges due to the
   overlapping of natural and social factors. Existing forest fire
   occurrence prediction models mostly take into account vegetation,
   topographic, meteorological and human activity factors; however, the
   occurrence of forest fires is closely related to the forest fuel
   moisture content. In this study, the traditional driving factors of
   forest fire such as satellite hotspots, vegetation, meteorology,
   topography and human activities from 2004 to 2021 were introduced along
   with forest fuel factors (vegetation canopy water content and
   evapotranspiration from the top of the vegetation canopy), and a
   database of factors for predicting forest fire occurrence was
   constructed. And a forest fire occurrence prediction model was built
   using machine learning methods such as the Random Forest model (RF), the
   Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model (GBDT) and the Adaptive
   Augmentation Model (AdaBoost). The accuracy of the models was verified
   using Area Under Curve (AUC) and four other metrics. The RF model with
   an AUC value of 0.981 was more accurate than all other models in
   predicting the probability of forest fire occurrence, followed by the
   GBDT (AUC = 0.978) and AdaBoost (AUC = 0.891) models. The RF model,
   which has the best accuracy, was selected to predict the monthly forest
   fire probability in Changsha in 2022 and combined with the Inverse
   Distance Weight Interpolation method to plot the monthly forest fire
   probability in Changsha. We found that the monthly spatial and temporal
   distribution of forest fire probability in Changsha varied
   significantly, with March, April, May, September, October, November and
   December being the months with higher forest fire probability. The
   highest probability of forest fires occurred in the central and northern
   regions. In this study, the core drivers affecting the occurrence of
   forest fires in Changsha City were found to be vegetation canopy
   evapotranspiration and vegetation canopy water content. The RF model was
   identified as a more suitable forest fire occurrence probability
   prediction model for Changsha City. Meanwhile, this study found that
   vegetation characteristics and combustible factors have more influence
   on forest fire occurrence in Changsha City than meteorological factors,
   and surface temperature has less influence on forest fire occurrence in
   Changsha City.},

Title = {Impact of information technology on the earth sciences},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {297-319},
Abstract = {The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with
   the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal
   plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight
   quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and
   geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to
   construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front
   the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the
   controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly
   the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the
   building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data
   gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example,
   digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the
   earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the
   earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly
   available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to
   propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into
   a new era. The component information technologies are now available to
   allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world.
   Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques
   have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's
   crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved
   pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas
   reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at
   best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this,
   geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow
   through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic
   reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir
   and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made
   about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is
   analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques
   means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences
   yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in
   understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers
   which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake
   belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems
   within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their
   colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is
   such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone.
   Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies
   will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The
   key components of the information technologies that will enable this
   revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and
   computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components
   needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from
   observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making.
   Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic
   sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within
   the earth.
   Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can
   be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful
   information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this
   particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir
   through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil.
   The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through
   the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed.
   From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior
   of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists
   and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to
   various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and
   manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being
   developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data
   overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data.
   Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by
   data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is
   probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age.
   Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which
   by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to
   picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously,
   the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple
   two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing
   rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated,
   and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff
   the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many
   complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of
   complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments
   conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to
   project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special
   glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a
   three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are
   already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly
   with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and
   workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies
   and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the
   application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the
   generalist. This is a very important development because it allows
   models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights
   and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the
   specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily
   available technology. Application of this entire suite of information
   technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced
   processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete
   cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and
   improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory
   to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a
   major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the
   value of their application and integration with other technical
   disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely
   not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic
   prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from
   companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of
   the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Title = {Monitoring three-decade dynamics of citrus planting in Southeastern
   China using dense Landsat records},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Across Southeastern China, the expansion of citrus plantation has
   underpinned substantial economic development at the expense of forest
   cover and associated ecosystem services. The high-order complexity of
   citrus planting dynamics requires more detailed observations. To achieve
   this goal, we developed a novel monitoring scheme by integrating
   multi-epoch land cover classification and continuous change detection on
   the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using all available Landsat
   archives (1986-2018). First, a stable/changed area masking approach was
   adopted. Then, the GEE-based Continuous Change Detection and
   Classification (GEE-CCDC) algorithm was applied to detect the timing and
   position of citrus planting-related land cover changes. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the scheme was validated both spatially and temporally.
   We applied the proposed scheme in Xunwu, a typical County in
   Southeastern China where continuous expansion was disrupted by an
   outbreak of Huanglongbing (HLB, a destructive citrus disease). The
   validation results indicate that the multiepoch classification
   effectively identified the stable, abandoned, and newly cultivated areas
   related to citrus planting. Within these areas, our monitoring of citrus
   planting dynamics had an overall temporal accuracy of 90.59\% and a mean
   detection date deviation of 13.21 days (leading). Based on the change
   detection results, we found a two-stage change pattern, namely a
   continuous expansion period (1986-2016) followed by a disturbance period
   (2017-2018). Moreover, almost half of the orchards were cultivated in
   regions with an elevation and slope of 301-400 m and 11-20 degrees.
   During the continuous expansion period, a total of 497.85 km(2) natural
   lands were converted for citrus planting. Affected by the HLB outbreak,
   both orchard abandonment (114.66 km(2)) and new orchard cultivation
   (36.87 km(2)) were detected during the disturbance period. The proposed
   scheme offers a useful tool for cash crops management, and highlights
   the value of dense satellite data in monitoring the extent of ongoing
   human appropriation of natural ecosystems at a large scale and
   long-term.},

Title = {The economic impact of tourism in Central Finland: a regional
   input-output study},
Journal = {TOURISM REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {521-547},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the total economic
   impact of tourism at the regional level in Central Finland. This paper
   aims to clarify the extent to which tourism contributes to regional
   output, employment, income and taxes in tourism-related sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a regional
   input-output analysis. The author calculates the effects of tourism on
   regional output, demand, wages, employment and national and regional
   taxes in Central Finland.
   Findings The author's regional input-output analysis reveals that
   tourism has a substantial impact on production in Central Finland
   (including the direct and indirect effects of consumption by tourists in
   different sectors). Moreover, the effects of tourism expenditures on
   employment and residents' incomes in tourism-related sectors in Central
   Finland are quite significant.
   Research limitations/implications Many limitations of this study stem
   from the assumptions of the input-output model. Other limitations relate
   to the analysis of the impacts of tourism on household taxes, savings,
   consumption and net income. Our study uses average figures, which may
   overstate the effect of tourist expenditures on taxes because tourism
   jobs are often low paying.
   Practical implications The study yields results that can be used to
   frame regional policy. The results may be useful for policymakers in
   planning for tourist attractions. Furthermore, local authorities may use
   the results to guide decisions regarding infrastructure investments or
   improvements to the operating environment of tourism industries.
   Originality/value Many studies analyse the economic impact of events at
   the regional level using input-output analysis. National-level tourism
   impact studies using the input-output technique have also been
   conducted. Studies focussed on the economic impact of tourism at the
   regional level typically examine the macroeconomic (income, output and
   employment) effects of tourism. Consequently, these studies have
   focussed on estimating output, employment and income multipliers
   (Mazumder et al., 2012). The author's contribution is a regional
   input-output analysis of direct and indirect impacts of tourism
   expenditures on production, demand, wages, income and employment in the
   whole economy at the regional level (in Central Finland). The author
   also analyses the impacts of tourism on national and regional taxes. The
   results of this study could be used by planners and policymakers
   involved in regional planning and development.},

Title = {Delta dynamics: Effects of a major earthquake, tides, and river flows on
   Cienega de Santa Clara and the Colorado River Delta, Mexico},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {144-156},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intertidal portion of Mexico's Colorado River Delta is a dynamic
   environment subject to complex interactions of tectonic, fluvial, and
   tidal forces at the head of the Gulf of California. We review the
   historical interactions of these forces, use sequential satellite
   images, overflights, ground observations, and interferometric synthetic
   aperture radar (InSAR) data to study the effects of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El
   Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake on changing patterns of tidal inundation within
   the Delta, and assess effects of these changes to the
   fluvial/hydrological regime of the Colorado River estuary and nearby
   Cienega de Santa Clara wetland. The objectives of this study are to
   highlight for environmental scientists, land managers, and ecological
   engineers the contribution of tectonic forces in shaping the intertidal
   Delta environment and to provide information on the effects of the 2010
   earthquake which will be of practical value in planning and designing
   management measures and restoration projects for the estuary and
   Cienega.
   The Colorado River estuary is at present blocked by a tidal sand bar
   which restricts access by marine species to the upper estuary and
   obstructs the flow of fresh water into the lower estuary. Located 13 km
   east of the estuary, the Cienega is a 6000 ha wetland supported by
   agricultural drain water from Arizona and Mexico. South of the Cienega
   is the Santa Clara Slough, an unvegetated 26,000 ha basin subject to
   periodic inundation from the northern Gulf's high amplitude tides, which
   have historically reached the margins of the Cienega several times each
   year.
   The El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake ruptured the previously unknown Indiviso
   Fault which extends into the intertidal zone just west of the Cienega.
   The Cienega experienced only minor surface deformation having no direct
   effects to the wetland. Most of the significant ground movement and
   surface deformation occurred west of the Indiviso Fault adjacent to the
   estuary, where portions of the intertidal flats underwent extensive
   liquefaction, northward coseismic displacement and post-seismic
   subsidence. These surface deformations changed the pattern of tidal
   inundation, triggering development of a new system of natural tidal
   channels and creating conditions favorable for installation of projects
   to restore connectivity between the upper and lower estuary. The changed
   pattern of tidal inundation may also have contributed to an observed
   reduction in the occurrence of tidal flooding along the southwestern
   margin of the Cienega following the earthquake. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Evaluating rainfall datasets to reconstruct floods in data-sparse
   Himalayan region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Floods are widespread natural disasters having significant
   socio-economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management
   strategies. Flood modelling is an enduring challenge, especially over
   the data-sparse mountainous regions such as the Himalayas, due to the
   lack of accurate rainfall measurements. Global datasets are often
   employed for flood modelling; however, their applicability over the
   Himalayan terrain is still uncertain. In this regard, the Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model is
   increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates. This work aims
   at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets,
   satellite product, and the WRF model to represent heavy rainfall over
   the Himalayan terrain. Further, these datasets are used to drive the
   Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to assess their
   ability to reconstruct floods in the Himalayan region. A Rainfall-Flood
   Skill Score (RFSS) is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall
   datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the
   region. The range of RFSS can vary from - infinity to 1, with positive
   values as the desired value. The analysis is conducted over the upstream
   part of the Upper Ganga Basin, spanning from high elevation mountains to
   the foothills of the Himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that
   caused flooding in the region. Quantitative evaluation of rainfall
   datasets in terms of bias, RMSE, and scale errors shows high spatial
   variability with different datasets performing differently over various
   regions of the study area. The topography is observed to influence the
   performance of rainfall datasets. Based on the error metrics, it is
   found that the rainfall simulated using the WRF model exhibits least
   error in high elevation and valley regions of the Himalayas, whereas,
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation
   Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR, in some
   cases) datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the
   Himalayas. On forcing the VIC model with these datasets, the WRF model
   with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest
   RFSS score of 0.97 among all the datasets and, therefore, considered
   most suitable for simulating floods in the study region.},

Title = {Mapping croplands of Europe, Middle East, Russia, and Central Asia using

Abstract = {Accurate and timely information on croplands is important for
   environmental, food security, and policy studies. Spatially explicit
   cropland datasets are also required to derive information on crop type,
   crop yield, cropping intensity, as well as irrigated areas. Large area -
   defined as continental to global - cropland mapping is challenging due
   to differential manifestation of croplands, wide range of cultivation
   practices and limited reference data availability. This study presents
   the results of a cropland extent mapping of 64 countries covering large
   parts of Europe, Middle East, Russia and Central Asia. To cover such a
   vast area, roughly 160,000 Landsat scenes from 3351 footprints between
   2014 and 2016 were processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
   platform. We used a pixel-based Random Forest (RF) machine learning
   algorithm with a set of satellite data inputs capturing diverse
   spectral, temporal and topographical characteristics across twelve
   agroecological zones (AEZs). The reference data to train the
   classification model were collected from very high spatial resolution
   imagery (VHRI) and ancillary datasets. The result is a binary map
   showing cultivated/non-cultivated areas ca. 2015. The map produced an
   overall accuracy of 93.8\% with roughly 14\% omission and commission
   errors for the cropland class based on a large set of independent
   validation samples. The map suggests the entire study area has a total
   546 million hectares (Mha) of net croplands (nearly 30\% of global net
   cropland areas) occupying 18\% of the study land area. Comparison
   between national cropland area estimates from United Nations Food and
   Agricultural Organizations (FAO) and those derived from this work also
   showed an R-square value of 0.95. This Landsat-derived 30-m cropland
   product (GFSAD30) provided 10-30\% greater cropland areas compared to UN
   FAO in the 64 Countries. Finally, the map-to-map comparison between
   GFSAD30 with several other cropland products revealed that the best
   similarity matrix was with the 30 m global land cover (GLC30) product
   providing an overall similarity of 88.8\% (Kappa 0.7) with producer's
   cropland similarity of 89.2\% (errors of omissions = 10.8\%) and user's
   cropland similarity of 81.8\% (errors of commissions = 8.1\%). GFSAD30
   captured the missing croplands in GLC30 product around significantly
   irrigated agricultural areas in Germany and Belgium and rainfed
   agriculture in Italy. This study also established that the real
   strengths of GFSAD30 product, compared to other products, were: 1.
   identifying precise location of croplands, and 2. capturing fragmented
   croplands. The cropland extent map dataset is available through NASA's
   Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at
   tps://doi.org,10.5067/MEaSUREs/GFSAD/GFSAD30EUMARUMECE.001, while the

Abstract = {The developments taking place in Information Technology (IT),
   particularly, the convergence between computers and communication has
   made the world a global village.  Indeed competitive advantage would be
   primarily determined by a nation's or firm's IT infrastructure.  This is
   all the more compelling in the context of our economic reforms programme
   where India is all set to get plugged into the global economy.  The
   shift from analogue to digital technology has brought a major transition
   which has completely altered the communications landscape.  `'anytime
   anywhere'' communications based on mobile cellular, satellite and
   Personal Communication System (PCS) technologies are fast becoming a
   global reality.  This coupled with the development of `'Information
   Superhighways'' based on optical fibre is making the integration of
   voice, data and video available through the Integrated Services Digital
   Network.  While wireless and optical fibre based local loops loom on the
   horizon, `the last mile problem' has resulted in the amalgamation of
   major switching and cable networks in the USA, in order to bring
   multimedia to tomorrow's home.  It is anticipated that several of these
   possibilities would become commonplace by the year 2000 and in this
   context it is extremely important that developing countries like our
   own, chalk out strategies in order to leapfrog technologies in the most
   cost effective manner with a view to successfully managing the
   tremendous changes underway.
   The output of global electronics reached \$700 billion in 1990 and is
   expected to reach about \$1.3 trillion by the year 2000.  The value
   added by the electronics industry is growing at about 6 per cent per
   year, compared with about 3.8 per cent for all manufacturing industries
   and 3.1 per cent for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (all in real terms). 
   At this pace by the year 2000 electronics will account for about 4 per
   cent of world GDP and 14 per cent of value added in manufacturing.  In
   comparison, the Indian electronics industry reached an output level of a
   little over \$ 4 billion in 1992 representing 0.7 per cent of the global
   electronics industry.  If India were to achieve a production level of \$
   20 billion by the year 2000, this would increase to 1.5 per cent.
   In the context of the next decade China whose current electronics output
   is almost 3 times that of India provides a very useful point of
   reference.  What is alarming is the rate at which electronics
   applications are growing in China, in TV, telecom and Information
   Technology (IT).  Thus, China's production of TV sets, both colour and
   Black \& White, is 5 times that of India; it proposes to install over 3
   times the number of telephones by the year 2000; and its IT industry
   currently is also 3 times of India's.  These in turn provide rapidly
   improving economies of scale, when compared to those of the Indian
   electronics industry, thus promoting greater vertical integration,
   increasing cost competitiveness, makes exports more viable and attracts
   greater foreign direct investment and technology to feed its burgeoning
   market.  Consequently, there is an imperative need to provide a
   strategic vision at this juncture to address the Chinese challenge and
   to ensure the future health of the Indian electronics industry
   commensurate with our size and capabilities.
   The background paper provides the current status of the electronics
   industry both nationally as well as internationally and the development
   strategies pursued by different countries.  From these, the major issues
   in devising an appropriate strategy for future development of the Indian
   Electronics Industry are derived.  This is to lay the ground work for
   further deliberation.  The paper is divided into following parts:

Title = {A multiple natural hazard analysis, SECMOL College region, near Leh,
   Ladakh, North India, with applications for community-based DRR},
Journal = {DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {287-312},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment
   (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied,
   rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study
   (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College),
   close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to
   the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard
   assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of
   hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue
   its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019)
   documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the
   principles of geohazard assessment and the development of
   student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home
   village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised
   along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards.
   Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data
   (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation
   of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes,
   assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and
   identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with
   satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood
   vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003),
   examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic
   terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation
   allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and
   the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events,
   together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan
   earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and
   river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and
   disaster scenario analyses.
   Findings
   This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is
   exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High
   magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in
   the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to
   maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods
   demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely
   damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study
   reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the
   potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to
   be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts
   of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be
   lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces
   recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural
   planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk
   zones.
   Practical implications - The frequency of hazards is low, but potential
   impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering
   options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and
   evacuation management for large floods.
   Originality/value
   Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages
   between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application
   of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to
   rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of
   catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work
   complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community
   aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value.},

Title = {Linking data of ENSO, NDVI-MODIS and crops yield as a base of an early
   warning system for agriculture in Cordoba, Argentina},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {By influencing interannual rainfall variability in the Province of
   Cordoba, Argentina, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also impact on
   corn and soybean yields at the main rain-fed agricultural production
   departments. Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental
   impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a
   region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and
   decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean
   yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using
   different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production
   departments of Cordoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Rio
   Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Cordoba as a vegetation proxy to
   depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal
   persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators
   from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing
   season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops
   productivity.
   Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence
   during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is
   compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While
   for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p <
   0.05) in all Cordoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS.
   Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships
   when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when
   using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was
   located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop
   season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as
   an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case,
   the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small.
   The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more
   extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May,
   at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the
   growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with
   the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11\% and 10\% of Rio
   Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19\% when
   SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an
   unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of
   crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression
   models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI
   and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors.
   Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making
   use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during
   the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO
   influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its
   incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis
   of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.},

Abstract = {Objective: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health
   care professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control
   hypertension in otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women).
   Options: For people at risk for hypertension, there are a number of
   lifestyle options that may avert the condition-maintaining a healthy
   body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, exercising, reducing
   sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and potassium, and
   reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce the
   risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the
   options for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification,
   antihypertensive medications or a combination of these options; with no
   treatment, these people remain at risk for the complications of
   hypertension.
   Outcomes: The health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure
   and in morbidity and mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence,
   no economic outcomes were considered.
   Evidence: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1966 to
   September 1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists
   were scanned, experts were polled, and the personal files of the authors
   were used to identify other studies. All relevant articles were
   reviewed, classified according to study design and graded according to
   level of evidence.
   Values: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular
   morbidity and premature death caused by untreated hypertension.
   Benefits, harms and costs: Lifestyle modification by means of weight
   loss (or maintenance of healthy body weight), regular exercise and low
   alcohol consumption will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected normotensive and hypertensive people. Sodium restriction and
   stress management will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
   selected hypertensive patients. The side effects of these therapies are
   few, and the indirect benefits are well known. There are certainly costs
   associated with lifestyle modification, but they were not measured in
   the studies reviewed. Supplementing the diet with potassium, calcium and
   magnesium has not been associated with a clinically important reduction
   in blood pressure in people consuming a healthy diet.
   Recommendations: (1) It is recommended that health care professionals
   determine the body mass index (weight in kilograms/{[}height in
   metres](2)) and alcohol consumption of all adult patients and assess
   sodium consumption and stress levels in all hypertensive patients. (2)To
   reduce blood pressure in the population at large, it is recommended that
   Canadians attain and maintain a healthy body mass index. For those who
   choose to drink, alcohol intake should be limited to 2 or fewer standard
   drinks per day (maximum of 14/week for men and 9/week for women). Adults
   should exercise regularly (3) To reduce blood pressure in hypertensive
   patients, individualized therapy is recommended. This therapy should
   emphasize weight loss for overweight patients, abstinence from or
   moderation in alcohol intake, regular exercise, restriction of sodium
   intake and, in appropriate circumstances, individualized cognitive
   behaviour modification to reduce the negative effects of stress.
   Validation: The recommendations were reviewed by all of the sponsoring
   organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of the fourth
   International Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They are similar to
   those of the World Hypertension League and the Joint National Committee,
   with the exception of the recommendations on stress management, which
   are based on new information. They have not been clinically tested.

Title = {Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Denoising Algorithm Based on Deep
   Learning},

Abstract = {Objective Synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) is a kind of sensor to capture
   microwaves. Its principle is to establish images through the reflection
   of waveforms, so as to solve the problem that traditional optical remote
   sensing radars are affected by weather, air impurities, and other
   environmental factors when collecting images. The most widely used SAR
   is change detection (CD). CD refers to the dynamic acquisition of image
   information from a certain target, which includes three steps: image
   preprocessing, generation of difference maps, and analysis and
   calculation of difference maps. It is applied to the estimation of
   natural disasters, management and allocation of resources, and
   measurement of land topographic characteristics. However, in the process
   of CD, the inherent speckle noise in SAR images will reduce the
   performance of CD. Therefore, the image denoising method has become a
   basic method of preprocessing in CD. How to restore a clean image from a
   noisy SAR image is an urgent problem to be solved.
   Methods Traditional denoising algorithms of SAR images generally use the
   global denoising idea whose principle is to use the global similar
   information in images to perform processing and judgment. In the case of
   the high resolution of images, these algorithms need a series of
   preprocessing such as smoothing and then complete pixel distinction
   through the neighborhood processing of each image block. The algorithms
   usually occupy huge computing resources and have certain spatial and
   temporal limitations in practical applications. In addition, they cannot
   efficiently complete the denoising task. In terms of deep learning, some
   algorithms perform well, but there is still room for improvement in
   network convergence speed, model redundancy, and accuracy. To solve
   these problems, this paper proposes a denoising algorithm based on a
   multi-scale attention cascade convolutional neural network (MALNet). The
   network mainly uses the idea of multi- scale irregular convolution
   kernel and attention. Compared with a single convolution kernel, a
   multi-scale irregular convolution kernel has an excellent image
   receptive field. In other words, it can collect image information from
   different scales to extract more detailed image features. Subsequently,
   the convolution kernels of different scales are concat layers in the
   network, and an attention mechanism is introduced into a concat feature
   map to divide the attention of the features so that the whole model has
   a positive enhancement ability for the main features of the image. In
   the middle of the network, the dense cascade layer is used to further
   strengthen the features. Finally, the image restoration and
   reconstruction are realized by network subtraction.
   Results and Discussions In this paper, qualitative and quantitative
   experiments are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed MALNet model in denoising. The WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-
   CNN algorithms are compared with our proposed method. The clear state
   and complete signs of the denoised images are visually observed. In
   order to make a fair comparison, we use the default settings of the
   three algorithms provided by the authors in the literatures. Peak
   signal-to- noise ratio ( PSNR), structural similarity index measure
   (SSIM), and image entropy are used as objective evaluation indexes. The
   PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy are calculated as error metrics. Three
   denoising algorithms are compared, and airpoirt, mountain, and coast are
   selected as verification images. The denoising effects of airport images
   (Fig. 7), coast images (Fig. 8), and mountain images (Fig. 9) are
   analyzed. It shows the visual effect comparison of denoising results of
   different algorithms. In Figs. 7-9, 6 figures are successively noise-
   free image, noise image, denoised image obtained by WNNM, denoised image
   obtained by SAR-BM3D, denoised image obtained by SAR-CNN and denoised
   image obtained by MALNet. It is obvious that the WNNM denoised image has
   many defects that are not removed completely, and the texture loss is
   quite serious. SAR-BM3D denoised image retains some details, but the
   aircraft fuselage is very vague, and the tail part has gotten most of
   the edge information erased. Although the aircraft wing in the SAR- CNN
   denoised image is recovered, the whole aircraft at the bottom is still
   far from the reference image, and the recovered small objects are
   blurred. It can be seen from Table 3 that the average PSNR value of the
   proposed MALNet is about 9. 25 dB higher than that of SAR-BM3D, about 0.
   75 dB higher than that of SAR-CNN, and about 14. 45 dB higher than that
   of WNNM. Moreover, in terms of the noise level, MALNet is 0. 01 dB less
   than that SAR-CNN. The PSNR value of the proposed MALNet model at each
   noise level is higher than that of other algorithms. Especially, when
   the noise parameter is 20, the proposed method is 2. 56 dB higher than
   that of the SAR- CNN algorithm. In terms of structural similarity (Table
   4), it can be seen that the SSIM of MALNet is mostly the highest among
   all methods. Only when the noise parameter is 50, it is slightly lower
   than that of SAR- CNN, but the average SSIM is still the highest. The
   average information entropy of the denoised images by the four
   algorithms is 7. 113492 bit/pixel for WNNM, 6. 842258 bit/pixel for SAR-
   BM3D, 7. 499375 bit/ pixel for SAR-CNN, and 6. 6917 bit/pixel for
   MALNet. The proposed algorithm outperforms WNNM, SAR-BM3D, and SAR-CNN
   by 0. 42179 bit/ pixel, 0. 15056 bit/pixel, and 0. 80768 bit/pixel,
   respectively. Therefore, in terms of the three objective evaluation
   indexes of PSNR, SSIM, and image entropy, the proposed network in this
   paper has better denoising performance than other comparison methods.
   Conclusions In this paper, a new denoising model MALNet is proposed for
   solving the noise in SAR images. This model uses an end-to-end
   architecture and does not require separate subnets or manual
   intervention. The solution includes three modules, i. e., multi-scale
   irregular convolution module, feature extraction module based on
   attention mechanism, and feature enhancement module based on dense
   cascade network. The model also adds batch normalization and global
   average pooling to improve its adaptability. It can complete convergence
   without massive data sets. The image data can complete convergence after
   150 rounds of training. The training efficiency is outstanding, and the
   portability is positive. The experimental results show that compared
   with those of other traditional image denoising algorithms, the PSNR and
   SSIM of the proposed algorithm are improved by 0. 75 dB-14. 45 dB and 0.
   01-0. 16, respectively. The proposed algorithm is superior to other
   algorithms in image entropy and can better recover the details of
   images.},
